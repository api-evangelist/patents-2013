This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 862 014 filed on Aug. 3 2013 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 875 112 filed on Sep. 9 2013. The subject matter of this application is also related to the subject matter of the following co pending U.S. patent application U.S. application Ser. No. 13 547 982 filed on Jul. 12 2012. The disclosures of all five of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Electronic devices and systems are frequently relied upon to provide information to users. Content providers and distributors naturally desire to track usage of that content. Content providers and advertisers rely on tracking content use and advertisement use on the Internet to determine appropriate distribution and pricing schemes and to identify relevant content and ads to present to particular users. Providers of paid content typically either offer subscriptions to periodicals or content libraries and or offer per item pricing for particular publications.

Presently available systems for tracking content usage typically determine whether a particular piece of content was accessed by a user by for example tracking page hits for freely available content and tracking purchases of and or logins to restricted access content. Also techniques have been proposed for determining and tracking certain types of interactions with webpage content such as scrolling see for example Advanced Content Tracking with Google Analytics part 1 posted Feb. 21 2012 at http cutroni.com blog 2012 02 21 advanced content tracking with google analytics part 1 wrap .

Although existing content tracking schemes can determine whether content was accessed systems and methods are needed to better determine whether content particularly text content was in fact consumed i.e. read by the user. Also there is a need to better track partial consumption to determine for example how much text in a given piece of content was read. This can facilitate better content targeting as well as more accurate and flexible pricing schemes. Furthermore more accurately determining whether and how much of a particular piece of content was consumed can facilitate providing more accurate search results than simply relying on known metrics such as page hits and links.

Communications devices including PCs smartphones tablets e readers etc. continue to grow in popularity and have become an integral part of both personal and business communications. As a result users continue to spend more time using their communications devices during the course of a day reading e mails reading web sites sending short message service SMS messages etc.

Rapid serial visual presentation RSVP is a method of displaying textual content in which each word of the textual content is displayed in sequential order one at a time at a certain display rate at a fixed location on a display. RSVP was first introduced in the 1970s as a technique for presenting text one word at a time in a display. Many references since then have provided information on the use of RSVP in a variety of applications. Commercially available products based on RSVP include Zap Reader www.zapreader.com reader and Spreeder www.spreeder.com . Some prior methods exist for improving the effectiveness of an RSVP by varying the display time of a word in the display based on word length and word type see U.S. Pat. No. 6 130 968 to McIan et al. McIan and based on word frequency see WO 37256 by Goldstein et al. Goldstein 2002 . While these techniques are beneficial in improving comprehension of the displayed text new techniques and methods are needed to further increase a user s reading speed and improve the presentation of dense content on electronic displays.

Isolated efforts have also been made to apply RSVP to particular applications e.g. email applications in mobile communications devices see US 2011 0115819 by Hanson . However the challenges and opportunities for integrating RSVP into user interfaces for increasing the density of displayable content remain largely unexplored. Moreover despite the increased need for more accurately tracking content consumption RSVP has not yet been exploited for that purpose.

In accordance with embodiments of the present invention computer implemented methods computer program products and systems are provided for provisioning content and tracking content use the content including textual content that is displayable using RSVP. A particular embodiment identifies content including textual content to be displayed using RSVP on an electronic device to a user displays that content to the user using RSVP and generates content tracking information by tracking a number of words of the textual content that is displayed using RSVP. In some embodiments a user session identifier is stored and related to a content identifier in an electronic database.

In some embodiments other variables are tracked and stored and are associated with the content identifier including for example variables that track a number of total words a number of words left or remaining in content a block size a number of words downloaded a block finished indicator and a content finished indicator. In some embodiments reading speed is calculated and used to select content and or determine aspects of content presentation. In some embodiments tracked textual content is provided in the context of tracked content including various mixed media types including for example maps images video audio and or augmented reality.

In some embodiments tracked RSVP data is aggregated by user media and other categories. In some embodiments RSVP aggregated data analytics including totals averages percentages and or rates of change corresponding to such data corresponding to digital media items are utilized to determine or enrich search ranking results related to those items. In other embodiments RSVP data is used to track the amount or percentage of words that users viewed prior to leaving a content item. In a particular aspect of such an embodiment particular words or keywords that are near points at which significant user exits occur are tracked and graphically displayed so that a content provider can analyze how to potentially alter content to improve reader retention rates. Also in some embodiments the number of user selections of displayed sub content within a particular piece of content is tracked and graphically displayed relative to a percentage of words read. In some embodiments drops in total user sessions and corresponding rises in total selections of sub content items are used to compute for each drop in sessions between sentences a relative drop ratio.

In some implementations e.g. a smart phone or e reader the display may be packaged together with the rest of device . However in other implementations a separate display device e.g. a monitor maybe be attached to device . While the illustrated embodiment shows a graphical border around DRDA DRDA simply refers to a region e.g. a window on display where text is serially presented in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and in particular implementations DRDA may or may not be outlined by a graphical border.

In the illustrated embodiment computer program product is loaded into memory to configure device in accordance with the present invention. In one embodiment text data may be loaded into memory for text processing and display processing by device as will be further described herein. Text data loaded into memory for text processing and display processing may be retrieved from persistent storage on a user device such as device and or may be received from one or more server computers through a connection to network e.g. the Internet .

Text data loaded into memory for text processing and display processing may be retrieved from persistent storage on a user device such as device and or may be received from one or more server computers through a connection to network e.g. the Internet .

One or more server computers may include for example one or more advertiser computers search engine computers content provider computers broadcasting provider computers web servers application servers and the like. Some of the content tracking and processing including textual content tracking and processing may be carried out by one or more remote computers such as server computers and then sent to end user device for RSVP display in DRDA on display . The results of the processed content including textual content may be presented within a browser or other software application installed on user device . In some embodiments the processing for RSVP display and content tracking may occur entirely offline on user device and optionally the results of the content tracking methods described herein may then be transmitted to server computer when a connection to network is available.

According to an aspect of the present invention content providers and advertisers may determine content and sequence of serial display and sub displays. Additionally a user may specify in user preferences used to determine sequencing and sorting of serially displayed content and how to choose or sort the sub content. The content served as sub content may be based on keywords corresponding to the words that have been serially displayed from the content.

Program product may be configured to enable system to take into account preferences of multiple entities for example the user content providers and advertisers when serially presenting content in serial display and sub display. Alternatively program product may be configured to only apply the settings and preferences of one of the entities or always override all settings based on a specific settings profile.

In an embodiment of the invention text which includes for example strings of characters e.g. letters numbers symbols etc. which constitute words numeric figures and combinations of both with punctuation marks and symbols note that words may include words represented by any human language including without limitation words represented by roman characters script elements or pictographic characters is presented serially for example one word at a time within DRDA . As referenced herein a display element will refer to a group of text data that is displayed at one time within DRDA . In other words display elements are displayed serially. In the primary embodiment discussed herein a display element will generally consist of one word. However in alternative embodiments two words may be presented as a single display element. Also in the primary embodiment two words are sometimes part of a single display element such as for example when a number e.g. 9 is displayed together with a unit e.g. feet so that for example the text 9 feet may constitute a single display element and be presented together.

In a conventional RSVP system each word is centered in the display area and the optimal fixation position shifts as words of differing lengths are sequentially displayed resulting in saccade movements as the eyes shift to the optimal fixation position. The reader has to refocus on the display every time a new word appears that is of a different length than the previous word. The reader s eyes will move from one character to the next to find the optimal position which is also referred to as a recovery saccade. In addition when a longer word follows a shorter one the saccadic movement direction will be from right to left. When reading text in lines in a traditional paragraph display most saccadic movement is from left to right so the reader is accustomed to this type of eye movement. Only occasionally if the optimal fixation position is not found directly the reader may have to move back from right to left. Thus conventional RSVP forces the reader to experience saccades which are not normal. Conventional RSVP approaches offer no solution to these problems. In order to prevent or minimize recovery saccades in an RSVP it is preferable to display each word such that the optimal fixation position does not shift in the display. The focal point of the reader can then remain fixed on the optimal fixation position which is a specific point in each word that is determined by the total number of characters or width of the word. This Optimal Recognition Position ORP can be identified in the display such that the reader s eyes are directed to focus there as the words are serially presented. An RSVP which incorporates an ORP is hereinafter referred to as ORP RSVP. With an ORP RSVP text can then be presented at a faster rate because no saccades occur during the presentation. In addition the elimination of saccades reduces eye fatigue and makes it more comfortable resulting in a better reading experience for the user. Embodiments described herein may be implemented using conventional RSVP or ORP RSVP.

With respect to embodiments implemented using ORP RSVP a corresponding method embodiment for serially displaying text on an electronic display comprises identifying an ORP for a plurality of words to be displayed and serially displaying the plurality of words such that the ORP of each word is displayed at a fixed display location on the electronic display. In some embodiments the ORP is identified as a character in the word. In another embodiment the ORP is identified as a proportionate position relative to the width of the word in pixels. In some embodiments visual aids are used to mark the fixed display location see e.g. hash marks and or an ORP within the word e.g. different colored font . In some embodiments for words that are four or more characters a word is displayed so that the fixed display location is closer to the beginning than to the end of the word.

In addition words are rarely greater than 13 characters according to Sigurd only 0.4 of the words in the English language are longer than 13 characters see Sigurd B. et al Word Length Sentence Length and Frequency ZIPF Revisited Studia Lingustica 58 1 pp 37 52 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Oxford UK 2004 and therefore for the vast majority of words it is preferable to limit the number of characters to the right side of the fixation point to 8 characters. Also in some embodiments a word having a length of greater than thirteen characters is divided into first and second display elements such that a first portion of the word is displayed first along with a hyphen and then the second portion of the word is displayed next. In some embodiments an empirically determined ORP of each display element is presented at a fixed location of the DRDA . For example each word of a plurality of words is serially presented and positioned in the display such that the ORP is displayed at a fixed display location within DRDA and this enables recognition of each word in succession with minimal saccade by the reader. Determining and displaying the ORP for display elements and presenting display elements within DRDA is described in more detail in co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 547 982 which is incorporated by reference above.

Configuring text content for RSVP display may include parsing text into a plurality of display elements inserting blank elements at the end of a sentence and determining a multiplier for each display element that can be used along with user selected settings and or other display parameters to determine a display time for each display element. While in some embodiments each element may be displayed for the same amount of time it has been demonstrated empirically that a longer display time is beneficial for comprehension of longer words. It has also been demonstrated empirically that a longer pause between sentences is beneficial for comprehension of longer sentences. Further details of certain systems and methods for preparing and displaying text using RSVP are described in co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 547 982 referenced above.

User device includes desktop homescreen manager to control various elements to be displayed on a homescreen e.g. a homescreen of a smart phone running a mobile operating system such as iOS Android or Windows Phone or a desktop display of a PC laptop etc. running an operating system such as Windows or Mac OS or a homescreen desktop screen of an intermediate portable device such as notepad touchpad e book reader smart watch head mounted display etc. running a corresponding operating system . For example desktop homescreen manager may control the icons widgets tiles windows folders etc. and other information that may be displayed on a desktop or homescreen. Input manager manages inputs received from one or more input mechanisms such as a touch screen trackball keyboard mouse microphone eye tracking a gesture detector or other natural interface input detector etc. For example text input may be provided using a virtual i.e. touch screen or physical keyboard mouse trackball etc. Alternatively or in addition a user may provide voice speech input via a microphone which may then be converted to text. Various serial display enabled applications including for example applications and may run on the device and may provide data to be displayed through desktop homescreen manager .

Various messages e.g. email SMS may be received over a network such as a wireless communications network connected to the Internet via a wireless interface not separately shown . Information received from the network such as from one or more remote servers may be provided to the applications by event manager and information may be passed from applications back to the network. Event manager may manage notification events that are presented to a user e.g. through display . For example event manager may receive notification events from the wireless network. Notification events may include for example receipt of text messages emails voicemails social network updates file transfers etc. Event manager may in turn forward the notification events to corresponding applications. For example an email notification may be forwarded to the email application. The application may then instruct the desktop or homescreen manager to display status or notification information to alert the user.

As will be described in further detail below RSVP library allows user device to present display elements using RSVP. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention applications and which may be email applications messaging application social networking applications word processing applications spreadsheet applications photo applications map applications webpage editors browser applications search applications video application augmented reality applications etc. may communicate with RSVP library through an RSVP application programming interface API not separately shown . For example each application and may include application specific RSVP software such as RSVP software and respectively which may allow applications and to detect presence of RSVP content. Upon detecting RSVP content RSVP software such as RSVP software and or may call RSVP library via the API. In response RSVP library may display RSVP notification markers icons display DRDA display RSVP content in DRDA etc. In some embodiments the application specific RSVP software such as RSVP software and or may instead be included in RSVP library . In some embodiments application specific RSVP software such as RSVP software and may additionally include logic to allow embedding of textual content within a file.

The RSVP library in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes RSVP notification markers or icons RSVP parser designated RSVP display area manager RSVP settings RSVP activation listener and RSVP duration indication . Although the software modules are illustrated separately in this example for clarity of explanation one or more modules may be combined or arranged in other ways.

RSVP notification markers or icons are displayed by RSVP library to alert a user of the presence of RSVP content. RSVP markers or icons may also include icons indicating sponsored content. RSVP parser parses textual data into individual display elements suitable for display in DRDA . Alternatively a parser may be invoked before serving content to a user. Designated RSVP display area manager displays DRDA when appropriate user input is received. Appropriate input includes a system event that notifies the RSVP library that user selected content is serially displayable in offline or online mode to serially display content automatically or user initiated input requesting RSVP display of the content.

RSVP settings include settings related to displaying display elements using RSVP such as the speed of display font font color selection of the type of user input to activate RSVP display block size for textual content and the like. RSVP activation listener detects appropriate user input which is intended to select a RSVP notification marker icon. RSVP duration indication determines the duration of the RSVP content which may be displayed for example adjacent to DRDA . In some embodiments the duration may be displayed as an amount of time e.g. in seconds . Alternatively or in addition the duration may be displayed graphically for example as a status bar. The duration of RSVP content may be computed for example based on reading speed. In this case if reading speed is 500 words per minute and the content contains 1000 words then the duration is computed as two 2 minutes.

Additional components of user device that are relevant to AR applications are also shown. These include camera manager and image processing application location sensor manager implemented with GPS direction sensor manager and orientation sensor manager .

User device sends a login request to server computer . The request is processed via RSVP API by RSVP service . RSVP service requests user authentication from the RSVP session manager which responds by authenticating the session. The RSVP service responds to user device and provides user access. The RSVP session manager sends user session information to RSVP persistence layer . Although illustrates the use of a user login authentication embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. A user login may not be necessary for example when tracking unrestricted content. User activity may be tracked without login credentials for example by using temporary session variables or other user tracking techniques may also be utilized in various implementations of embodiments of the present invention.

User device proceeds to request text from RSVP service . RSVP service associates the Text ID with the user session and provides the information to RSVP session manager . The RSVP session manager updates the user session with text information and provides the updated information to RSVP persistence layer . RSVP service initializes tracking information and updates RSVP session manager . RSVP service associates the text block with the Text ID and session and provides the information to RSVP session manager .

RSVP service provides a text block to user device . The RSVP service updates tracking information and provides the information to the RSVP session manager . For example the text block information is used to update the tracking information.

After user device finishes displaying the requested block the device requests the next text block from the RSVP service . The RSVP service updates tracking information and provides the information to the RSVP session manager . The RSVP service provides the next text block to user device .

When the display and tracking is finished or timed out user device request logout timeout from RSVP service . The RSVP service updates and finalizes the tracking information and provides the information to the RSVP session manager . The RSVP session manager updates user session with tracking information and provides the updated information to the RSVP persistence layer .

In yet another embodiment for certain applications notification markers icons may not be displayed. For example for SMS and or email applications where notification events typically include textual content RSVP display may be enabled by default such that content associated with all notification events for these applications may be displayed using RSVP upon user selection of a notification event or upon user interaction with a selectable item e.g. an email or a text message . As another example even when an underlying application s content is non textual the content items may be known to be associated with textual descriptions. For example a video application icon on a homescreen may be enabled to display textual descriptions using RSVP of new or featured video items by default from a home screen such that the video application s icon is selectable for RSVP display of such descriptions by default without the need for a separate RSVP specific notification marker.

In the example illustrated in if the user selects notification marker icon DRDA may be displayed on homescreen and DRDA may display using RSVP the first of two SMS messages which reads Martina please call me. It should be noted that illustrate time sequence snapshots of the content displayed in DRDA . For example shows that DRDA displays Martina at time 1 shows that DRDA displays please at second time shows that DRDA displays call at third time and shows that DRDA displays me at fourth time. DRDA may display an ORP of each word at a fixed display location between hash marks . As previously discussed an empirically determined ORP of each display element may be presented at a fixed location of DRDA the fixed display location being between hash marks . It should be noted that hash marks are shown in some but not all subsequent figures to avoid overcomplicating the figures and particular embodiments of the invention may be implemented using either ORP RSVP or conventional RSVP. In addition although DRDA is shown displayed on top of the display DRDA may be positioned in any portion of the display. Although the embodiment illustrated in shows display of textual content associated with a notification event using RSVP on a homescreen in some embodiments content may be displayed using RSVP on a screen other than the homescreen such as for example a lock screen. As will be apparent to one of skill in the art notification events are often displayed on a lock screen. In such an instance selecting the notification s on the lock screen may result in content associated with the notification event being displayed in a DRDA using RSVP on the lock screen. 

Upon user selection of notification marker icon DRDA may be displayed as shown in and Free breakfast may be displayed using RSVP in DRDA . It should be noted that illustrate time sequence snapshots of the content displayed in DRDA . For example shows that DRDA displays Free at time 1 and shows that DRDA displays breakfast at second time.

However if the notification event is determined to be displayable using RSVP a notification marker icon may be displayed in step . In one embodiment the notification marker icon may be overlaid on top of the icon representing the corresponding application see . In other embodiments the notification marker icon may be displayed adjacent to above or below the icon representing the corresponding application. As previously described the notification marker icon may also include a numerical indicator which may correspond to the number of notification events for the corresponding application. The notification marker icon may be selected in response to user input received at step . The user input may include for example a touch and hold of the notification marker icon a tap of the notification marker icon a selection of the notification marker icon using a mouse or trackball etc. As previously discussed in some embodiments a notification marker icon may be selected by simply hovering over the notification marker icon. In response to user selection of the notification marker icon the designated RSVP display area DRDA may be displayed in step . Textual content associated with the notification event may be displayed using RSVP in the DRDA in step . In one embodiment the textual content associated with the notification event may be displayed in the DRDA as long as appropriate user input is present. For example in the case where appropriate user input is a press and hold of the notification icon marker if the user releases the notification icon marker the DRDA stops displaying the RSVP content and is then hidden. In one embodiment the amount and type of content that gets displayed in DRDA may be defined or selected in RSVP Settings . For example in the case of an email it may be selected that the sender name subject of the email and the body of the email may be displayed using RSVP in DRDA. Alternatively it may be selected that only the sender name and subject of the email be displayed using RSVP in DRDA. In some embodiments RSVP content may contain additional embedded RSVP content as illustrated in for example . It may be determined in step if additional embedded text is present. If so a notification e.g. notification in may be displayed in step . In response to user input received at step the additional embedded text may be displayed in DRDA using RSVP. In some embodiments steps and may be optional. In other words all available RSVP content may be automatically displayed sequentially without awaiting user input.

If it is determined in step that a URL is included in the RSVP content an indication of the presence of a URL is displayed in step as shown in . User input indicating selection of the URL is received in step . In one embodiment the webpage corresponding to the URL may contain RSVP content. As previously described RSVP content may be embedded in a webpage using for example a HTML tag. It is determined in step if the webpage corresponding to the URL contains RSVP content. If it is determined that the webpage does not contain RSVP content the DRDA is hidden and a browser application is launched in step to display the webpage corresponding to the URL. If however the webpage is determined to contain RSVP content the RSVP content is displayed in the DRDA using RSVP in step .

If it is determined in step that embedded text is included in the RSVP content an indication of the presence of embedded text is displayed in step as shown in . User input indicating selection of the embedded text is received in step . In step the RSVP content is displayed in the DRDA using RSVP.

If it is determined that the file contains no RSVP content the application may proceed as normal in step . For example if the file is a photo and it does not contain RSVP content the application may simply display the photo normally. If however it is determined that the file contains RSVP content the application requests display of notification markers icons in appropriate locations in step . In the example of a photo the notification markers icons may need to be displayed in specific locations on the photo. In one embodiment the application may request for example RSVP library to display the notification markers icons. In another embodiment the application may request the operating system to display the notification markers icons. In yet another embodiment the application may obtain the notification markers icons from RSVP library and display the notification markers icons. In an alternate embodiment step of displaying notification markers icons is optional. A user device may be configured e.g. using RSVP settings in such that certain applications may display all content using RSVP. For example applications such as an email application a SMS application etc. which primarily receive textual data may be configured to display all content using RSVP. In such instances displaying a notification marker icon indicating the presence of RSVP content is not necessary as further described with respect to

Continuing with the description of upon receiving user input comprising selection of a particular notification marker icon at step the application may request display of the DRDA in step . In one embodiment the application may request for example RSVP library to display the DRDA. In another embodiment the application may request the operating system to display the DRDA. In yet another embodiment the application may itself e.g. using RSVP software in display the DRDA. The RSVP content associated with the user selected notification marker icon may be displayed in the DRDA using RSVP in step . It is determined in step if additional RSVP content is present. If so the additional RSVP content may be automatically displayed sequentially. For example as shown in if there are multiple notification markers icons DRDA may automatically sequentially display the RSVP content associated with each marker icon. In another embodiment user input may be requested before displaying RSVP content associated with each marker icon. As previously discussed the RSVP content may include one or more attachments. After displaying RSVP content process may be used to display any attachments included with the RSVP content.

In addition to display advertisements RSVP content may also be incorporated in for example sponsored search results. is a flow chart diagram of a process for configuring search results with RSVP content in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. One or more servers may receive a search query in step . In response to the search query at least one search result corresponding to the search query may be configured with content that is displayable using RSVP in step . In step the at least one search result may be transmitted to a browser application for display in the browser application. In one embodiment the search result s may be displayed as shown in 

In some embodiments users may embed RSVP content into files such as for example photos presentations maps etc. is a flow chart diagram of a process for embedding RSVP content in a file e.g. map photo diagram presentation word processing document spreadsheet etc. in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In step displayable contents of a file may be displayed by the appropriate application. For example a diagram may be displayed in a drawing application e.g. Microsoft Visio or a presentation may be displayed in a presentation application e.g. Microsoft PowerPoint . In some embodiments the application may be a desktop application while in other embodiments the application may be a mobile application or a web based application accessible via a browser. A user may specify whether to add global RSVP content or local RSVP content in step . In one embodiment an interface which allows the user to choose between global and or local RSVP content may be displayed. In some embodiments both local and global RSVP content may be embedded. As used herein global content refers to RSVP content associated with the file e.g. photo map presentation and or diagram in its entirety. In the case of a map in the example shown in notification indicates presence of global RSVP content such as Check out these three restaurants and is associated with the whole displayed map. By contrast notifications and indicate presence of local RSVP content associated with each location specified by notifications and . Similarly in the case of a photo in the example shown in notification indicates presence of global RSVP content such as These are my friends and is associated with the whole photo. By contrast notifications and indicate presence of local RSVP content associated with each location specified by notifications and . In another embodiment global content may include a description of the file s contents. In such an embodiment selecting a file e.g. by clicking on or hovering over the file s icon or name that includes embedded global RSVP content from a file management interface e.g. Windows Explorer or a homescreen may result in the global content being displayed using RSVP. It should be noted that in such an embodiment viewing the global RSVP content does not require opening the file with an associated application.

If the user chooses to add global RSVP content an interface which allows the user to input textual content which will be embedded as global RSVP content is displayed in step . In the embodiment described above where global content includes a description of the file the global content may be provided in the metadata of the file. For example a user may right click the file icon select an option to enter an RSVP description for the file and input the textual content.

User input including textual content may be received in step . In embodiments where text input is required text input may be provided using a virtual i.e. touch screen or physical keyboard mouse trackball etc. Alternatively or in addition the user may provide voice speech input via a microphone. The voice speech input may then be converted to text. If the user chooses to add local RSVP content an interface which allows the user to specify location s element s and or text selection and add the corresponding textual content which will be embedded as local RSVP content is displayed in step . For example the user may specify locations on photos maps etc. specify elements or objects in photos diagrams and presentations etc. User input including specified location s element s and or text selection and add the corresponding textual content may be received in step . In one embodiment the interface may also allow selection of text such that RSVP content may be associated with the selected text. In the case of a photo in addition to specifying locations on the photo the user may select areas of the photo such as for example a face of a person. The location s element s and or text selection information and the corresponding textual content may be saved in step . In one embodiment location s element s and or text selection information and the corresponding textual content may be saved in the meta data of the file. For example in the case of a photo the location s element s and or text selection information and the corresponding textual content may be saved in the EXIF data. In one embodiment the textual content may be saved as plain text in which case the textual data may be converted to RSVP content e.g. text that is configured to be displayed using RSVP prior to displaying. In other embodiments the textual content may be converted to RSVP content and the RSVP content may be saved in the meta data of the file.

As shown in upon user selection of notification marker DRDA may be displayed and as shown in RSVP content related to video item is displayed in DRDA . show time sequence snapshots of the content displayed in DRDA . For example shows that DRDA displays the word People at a first time shows that DRDA displays the word have at a next time and shows that DRDA displays the word played at third time.

As shown in this embodiment allows a user to receive more information about a particular video within the context of a small screen display before deciding whether to leave window and navigate to a new window related to a particular video item. The application interface is able to continue displaying window including the illustrated list of video items while displaying additional information about a selected video item in DRDA . This may be particularly useful in the context of video content applications because once the decision is made to view a particular video a large data stream may be initiated which can take significant time to display and can also spend a significant quantity of data against monthly maximums or otherwise incur additional charges for a user. Also it might be useful for a user to be able to quickly and easily obtain information about a particular video via RSVP text content without having to leave display of window so that a user can quickly learn additional information about several videos before selecting a video for viewing.

Although window shows a list of featured video items in alternative embodiments window may display a list of video items in response to a user search or it may display items automatically recommended for a particular user.

In shows video display window displaying an initial frame of the video My daughter loves walking the dog. As shown display window includes progress bar timeline bar . Markers and are displayed along progress bar to indicate time points in the video that are associated with RSVP content.

When a user selects start icon the video begins playing normally in window . When the video reaches frames associated with RSPV content the RSVP content associated with the relevant marker or becomes displayable in response to a user selection as shown in subsequent figures.

In the illustrated embodiment RSPV content is displayed in response to a user interaction. However an alternative embodiment can be configured to display embedded RSVP content automatically at particular time points in a video.

As shown in the video has progressed to nine seconds into the video and the RSPV content associated with marker has already been displayed in the manner shown in . Marker remains displayed on the identified object and it is now selected by a user interface action. As shown in when the user selects marker DRDA appears and begins displaying RSVP content. show a time sequence as DRDA displays the content associated with display marker . Specifically shows display at a first time of the word she. shows display at a second time of the word calls. shows display at a third time of the word him. shows display at a fourth time of the word Leo. In this particular embodiment the words are displayed such that an optimal recognition position of each word is at a fixed location within DRDA the fixed location being indicated by hash marks . In this particular embodiment the video progress is stopped while the RSVP content is displayed. All the words in the RSVP content associated with marker are displayed while the video is stopped at a frame corresponding to nine second into the video as shown in . However in alternative embodiments RSPV content such as that shown in could be displayed without stopping the video progress.

In this embodiment the RSPV content is displayed at the beginning of the excerpt while the video remains frozen at five seconds into the video. However in alternative embodiments RSVP content associated with an excerpt including in a video preview may be presented before and or during and or after the playing of the video frames of the excerpt.

When a user selects option from menu to insert an RSVP comment a secondary menu appears. Secondary menu includes option for entering a global comment option for inserting a local comment and option for inserting an object comment. If option is selected for inserting a global comment as shown in then a virtual keyboard appears not separately shown and the user can type in a comment that will be associated with the entire video. Such a comment will be displayable by RSVP upon for example selection of an RSVP marker displayed with a representation of the video as a video item included in a list of items as illustrated and described for example in the context of . Alternatively the user may be directed to speak the comment for entry by a speech recognition system not separately shown type the comment into a physical keyboard not separately shown or provide the comment through other known input techniques not separately shown .

Referring to step opens an RSVP enabled video file in response to user input . Step determines whether the file contains any RSVP content. If no then step proceeds to play the video in accordance with the video application s normal i.e. non RSPV video playing execution. If yes the step displays one or more RSVP markers along the video progress bar time line. Step determines whether the user has chosen based on user input to have RSPV content in the video file be played automatically. If no the method proceeds to step of described further below . If yes then step begins playing the video content. In some embodiments user input may be provided after each RSVP enabled video file is opened. In other embodiments user input may be provided through a user settings interface for determining default user preferences with respect to RSVP enabled video playback settings interface not separately shown .

During video playback by step step determines whether the next RSVP location in the video file has been reached. If no then step determines whether the video has finished. If yes then video playback ends at step . If no then step continues playing the video. However if the result of step is yes then step pauses video playback. Step displays the associated RSVP content in a DRDA.

Step determines whether there is RSVP sub content associated with the RSVP content displayed in step . If no then the method proceeds to step . If yes then step display titles for the sub content see e.g. the example shown in . In this embodiment the titles of sub content are shown for 2 seconds. However alternatives may show the titles for different amounts of time. Step determines whether user input has indicated that the user has selected to view the sub content. If no then step changes the marker corresponding to the primary RSVP content to indicate that it has been read e.g. by graying it out as illustrated in previous figures . If yes then step displays the sub content in the DRDA see e.g. as shown in . When the sub content is finished displaying then step changes the RSVP marker as previously described and the method returns to step to continue playing the video while step determines whether the next RSVP content segment has be reached during video playback.

Referring to if RSVP content has not been designated to display automatically in step then step proceeds to play the video in accordance with the video application s normal video playing execution. During video playback step determines whether the next RSVP location in the video file has been reached. If no then step determines whether the video has finished. If yes then video playback ends at step . If no then step continues playing the video. However if the result of step is yes then step determines whether the RSVP content at the current video location is object based e.g. as shown and described in the context of . If yes then step shows an RSPV marker on the relevant object in the video frame. If no then step shows an RSVP marker in the frame in a designated location see e.g. marker in in some embodiments the location may have been designated by an RSVP content author as illustrated in with respect to marker .

Step determines based on user input whether the user has selected to view the RSVP content associated with any of the marker s currently displayed in the video frame. If no then the method returns to step . If yes then step pauses video playing and step displays the corresponding textual content in a DRDA using RSVP.

Step determines whether there is RSVP sub content associated with the RSVP content displayed in step . If no then the method proceeds to step . If yes then step display titles for the sub content. Step determines whether user input has indicated that the user has selected to view the sub content. If no then step changes the marker corresponding to the primary RSVP content to indicate that it has been read e.g. by graying it out as illustrated in previous figures . If yes then step displays the sub content in the DRDA. When the sub content is finished displaying then step changes the RSVP marker as previously described and the method returns to step to continue playing the video while step determines whether the next RSVP content segment has been reached during video playback.

Method may be implemented for example on a user device executing a video editing annotating application such as application of that is enabled to process RSPV content by RSVP software which utilizes RSVP library .

Referring to step opens the video to which RSVP content is to be added. Step determines based on user input whether the user has selected to add or edit RSPV content related objects in the video. If yes then the method proceeds to step shown and described below in the context of . If no then the method proceeds to step . Step determines based on user input whether the user has selected to add or edit a global RSVP comment. If yes then step displays an interface for the user to provide input to add or edit a global comment to the video that will be displayable by RSVP. The method then proceeds to step . If the result of step is no then the method proceeds to step directly.

Step determines based on user input whether RSVP content is to be added to the video timeline to make the content displayable as a particular time in the video. If no the step saves the video and exits. If yes the step advances the video based on user input e.g. selecting a point on a progress bar to the time location in the video where the RSVP content is to be added. Step then displays an interface to the user to add content to be displayed via RSPV. As described previously in the context of such an interface may include a virtual keyboard speech recognition interface or other user interfaces for entering or editing textual content. Step receives user input that enters or edits textual content that is to be displayable to a content consumer via RSVP. Step then determines whether the user would like to add any secondary RSVP content. As previously described in the context of indicators for such additional content may be provided at the end of a primary RSVP display so that a content consumer can determine whether to select to view the additional content. The concepts illustrated there also apply to RSVP content added to video.

If the result of step is yes then step displays an interface to receive user input to add secondary content to be displayable by RSPV. The method then proceeds to step to receive the entered content. The method then proceeds to step . If the result of step is no then the method proceeds directly to step . Step based on user input selects how many frames should be associated with the currently entered RSPV content including the primary RSPV content received at step and any secondary content received at step . In various alternatives the frames may be represented by the number of frames or in a time duration of associated video content. The method then returns to step .

If the result of step is yes then step displays an interface to receive user input to add secondary content to be displayable by RSPV. The method then proceeds to step to save the RSVP entered content and any secondary entered RSPV content along with the identified object hotspot and to place an associated marker on the video timeline bar. If the result of step is no then the method proceeds directly to step . The method then proceeds to step to determine based on user input whether the user would like to add any more RSPV content to objects in the video. If the result of step is yes then the method returns to step . If the result of step is no then step saves the video and the process ends.

Step opens the video preview which may be a separate file or data stream distinct from the underlying video that is the subject of the preview while at the same time typically containing a portion of the same of the same content included in the underlying video . Step determines if the preview has any RSVP content. If no then step displays the video preview normally i.e. as it would any other video without RSVP content . If yes then step displays RSVP markers on the video timeline progress bar . Step then moves the current location indication on the progress bar to the first RSVP marker location. Step displays the RSVP content associated with the marker in a DRDA. After the first RSVP content segment finishes displaying then step plays the video excerpt that the preview file has associated with that RSVP segment. Step then changes the current RSVP marker to indicate that the RSVP content associated with that marker has been displayed e.g. by graying out the marker . Step determines whether the video preview contains additional RSVP enabled content. If no then step stops the video playback and displays the video timeline with markers. In one alternative the preview markers are individually selectable so that the user can go back and view individual segments without having to view the entire preview. If the result of step is yes then step repeats and advances to the next RSVP marker location in the timeline.

Step creates an AR element in the relevant AR service application. Such elements are well known and typically include displayable information that is associated with a real world object viewable by a user of the AR service. Step determines whether the AR element is designated to be displayable using RSVP. If no then the process proceeds to step . If yes then step prepares the text for RSPV display. In particular embodiments this may include various additional steps such as for example parsing it into a plurality of displayable elements inserting blank elements where appropriate calculating display time multipliers based on word length and determining an optimal recognition position character or proportionate position as further described in co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 547 982 incorporated herein by reference above. As is further explained therein in a particular implementation some or all steps for preparing text for RSVP display may be accomplished on a user device rather than remotely on a server computer. If there is any sub content associated with the AR element then step also prepares that sub content for RSVP display.

Step saves the AR element on the server. Step receives at the AR service application a request for a particular AR element from a user device. Step transmits the AR element to the requesting user device.

Process begins with step which detects AR elements received from an AR service such as AR service executing method to send AR elements including RSVP displayable content to a user device . Step determines whether the received AR element or elements include RSVP content. If no then step proceeds as the AR application normally would without RSPV content. If yes the step displays RSVP markers on objects views associated with real world objects. In one embodiment these markers include icons such as those illustrated in . In an alternative embodiment these markers may instead be or include short textual titles identifying the real world object. Step receives user input selecting a particular RSVP marker for display. Step displays the RSVP content corresponding to the selected marker in a DRDA. Step then determines whether there is any RSVP sub content for display. If no then step changes the marker corresponding to the RSVP content to indicated that it has been read. If yes then step displays titles for the sub content for two seconds. Step determines whether user input has indicated that the user has selected to view the sub content. If no then step changes the marker corresponding to the primary RSVP content to indicate that it has been read. If yes then step displays the sub content in the DRDA. When the sub content is finished displaying then the process returns to step to determine if there is any additional sub content sub content can also have additional sub content . Once all the RSVP content and sub content associated with a particular AR element has either been displayed or declined by the user for display the process then returns to step to wait for selection of another RSPV marker for RSVP display of content associated with another AR element.

Step receives a user request to display content including textual content in RSVP. The request may be generated as a result of a system event indicating that serial display functionality has been activated by the user automatically by the system when the RSVP application is launched or by a predetermined user input. The request may include login credentials and content related information including textual content information.

Step creates and saves a user session on the client device and on the RSVP server and initializes the content tracking variables. In some cases a user session is created including an anonymous User ID to keep track of the words downloaded and words read. The User ID is anonymous in this scenario as one example and is not limited thereto. For example the User ID may not be anonymous and may include identifying user information. The user session is used to track content use and includes values for identification variables including Session ID User ID a Text ID and values for tracking variables such as Words Downloaded and Words Read as described further in reference to Tables 1 3 below.

Step identifies the selected content and the content type and stores values for Content ID and Content Type variables. The content type may include the type of media of the selected content including whether there is textual content whether the content is paid content such as an online news article or e book content or ad content and the like. Each text may be represented as an entry in a texts table in a database including values for variables such as Text ID Text Title Text Icon Text Content and the like. When the content is ad content the Text Icon may be used to visually indicate sponsored content for example a brand logo or a sponsored content icon or a combination of the two.

The sub texts may be represented in a sub texts table including values for variables such as Text ID and Sub Text ID which may be used to link sub texts to texts. The user information may be tracked in a text users table including values for variables such as Text ID Anonymous ID and Current Retry ID. The sub text may be non sponsored or sponsored content and it may be free or paid content. Additionally the sub text may be reference content such as a translation of content into another language.

When tracking the user in a session currently reading content is associated with a particular Text ID the Text ID value as well as the other session variables Words Downloaded and Words Read are retained from the session based on the User Session ID.

The content may be entirely downloaded for offline use or partially downloaded in sections for online use or streamed for online use. When downloaded entirely the content may be prepared for serial display in segments for example by retrieving text based on block size. When content is downloaded in sections e.g. block by block display of a first content section can be initiated for a user without having to wait for the entire download. Additionally downloading or retrieving by block size allows for efficient use of memory and processing for example by storing the content that will actually be used and removing less content when the content will not be used.

Whether entirely downloaded or partially downloaded for online or offline use or streamed for online use the content may be retrieved block by block and displayed and tracked word by word. The content main content may have sub content. The sub content may be non sponsored content associated with the main content or it may be or include sponsored content referenced herein as ads for convenience chosen based on keywords in the text of the main content and or sub content for example from a web page in the search results single webpage on the website or may include specially prepared texts by a content provider. The text served as sub text may be based on keywords corresponding to the words that have been serially displayed from the content.

Each retry or re read of text may be represented in a retries table including Text ID Retry ID Words Downloaded and Words Read to precisely track how much of the text was read when retried. The retries table may also indicate how many times the user has read the same text and for how long.

Currently Reading Text ID as well as the other session variables Words Downloaded and Words Read are retained from the session based on the anonymous User Session ID.

The Block Size is the size of a block of text to download for the user. The Block Size can be either defined in the application as a constant for example 10 100 words or chosen by the user in the application OS settings or computed automatically based on the network connection quality and user reading speed and the like.

This process of tracking the text read in the user session provides for accurate tracking even if the network connection is lost because the latest downloaded number of words can always be used for further analysis by the text statistics tracker.

Step determines whether the content is to be used online. If yes then the content is divided into displayable content elements for partial download in step . If no then the entire selected content is downloaded to user device in step . The content may be downloaded via an encrypted connection and stored as encrypted content on the user device. Although not shown some content is only available for use online and thus steps and may be skipped in that case.

Additionally it may also be determined whether the content is larger than a predetermined size to determine whether to download fully or partially. The predetermined content size may be set in the user settings the RSVP server or determined based on connection quality or user device characteristics such as available memory or user characteristics such as reading speed and reading level.

Upon partial step or full step download the Content ID and the Session ID are associated and stored in an RSVP tracking database and updated in the user session not shown .

Step identifies a text block for serial display by querying the database and prepares it for the user. Each text is represented on the server side in a table e.g. as a row or column of data in a table in the database including a Text ID for example. The text block is identified by the Text ID starting from the Words Downloaded with a Block Size number of words. Additionally the block may be identified by the latest total Words Read by a user.

Step retrieves the identified text block and prepares it for serial display. The text block may be a section of the content including textual content. The textual content may be extracted from the content to be displayed using RSVP display on the user device. That is the text block is configured for RSVP display by parsing text included in the content and other displayable elements in the content and dividing the content into a plurality of displayable elements. The content may be flagged as displayable upon retrieving the text block or after preparing the content for serial display.

For example for webpage content the textual content may be extracted by parsing the HTML and scrubbing the webpage for text to display serially. As another example a content provider may provide content including text to be serially displayed using RSVP along with the content without the need for parsing the content.

Step initializes the content tracking variables including Words Downloaded and Words Read for each new block. Words Read is set to zero 0 and Words Downloaded is set to the block size of words to be serially displayed or the number of words downloaded to the device in this request or the number of words cached for this iteration of the display.

The Block Size can be either defined in the application as a constant for example 10 100 words or chosen by the user in the application OS settings or computed automatically based on the network connection quality and user reading speed. The block size may be also be chosen by a time interval such as the time it takes to read a single block for example on average or according to a user speed. For example if your reading speed is 500 words per minute then the block size would be determined to be 500. This would require a download every minute and may also be adjusted depending on the bandwidth of the user s network connection.

That is the Block Size may vary during the tracking process depending on other conditions and may also be adjusted during the tracking process by the user or by the system as needed. At the very least for example the block size of the last block of a text will be smaller than the other blocks unless the words in the text are evenly divisible by the block size.

Step serially displays the text block word by word and after each word step increments the Words Read session variable.

Step determines whether the user is still actively viewing the textual content for example by whether the user has stopped the RSVP display of the content. That is step determines whether the user stops displaying content. This may be determined for example by controlling the RSVP interface to stop the RSVP display or navigating away from the web page or other application interface window in which RSVP display of the content was triggered Additional factors may also be used to determine if the user is still actively viewing the content for example by monitoring the user s presence eye position the user s facial expression or other indicators via a camera or other monitoring means. Although not illustrated step determining may also be performed parallel to step displaying the content.

If the result of step is yes then step updates the Words Read value in persistent storage on the server side for example a database to be set equal to Words Downloaded minus Block Size plus Words Read. The Words Read value in the calculation is taken from session where it was incremented for each word read e.g. each word displayed via RSVP from the block in step . Method then proceeds to step described further below .

If the result of step is no then step determines whether the current block has finished displaying. If the result of step is no then step continues to serially display the block word by word and step continues to increment the Words Read variable. If the result of step is yes i.e. the block finished then step determines whether the text is finished.

If the result of step is yes then step determines whether there are sub texts to display to the user. After step not shown the content may be marked as read to indicate that the user previously accessed and read the content. Alternatively the content may be marked as read or accessed after step .

If step determines that there are sub texts the sub texts may be automatically presented based on the content author s request to present particular sub text. However they may also be generated based on keywords related to the parent text. For example a sub text may be generated to be displayed based on a degree of relatedness between the text content in a text table and text content in a sub text table.

The same sub text may appear within multiple related threads and a visual indication may be provided to distinguish such sub text. A visual indication may include for example graying out the title of the sub text or displaying an indicator or icon distinguishing the sub text element from other elements.

The sub text may be based on keywords corresponding to the words that have been serially displayed from the content at a predetermined point in the serial display. The content based on which the sub content is determined may be referred to as originating content for ease of explanation. The sub text or the sub content may be embedded in originating content or looked up dynamically from a lookup list of related keywords. The lookup list may be itself dynamic based on advertisement supply and demand or bidding outcomes at the time the list is generated.

The sub text may be displayed under the text display and may be linked to the original text. Specifically the title of the sub text is displayed and used to visually represent the sub text to the user. The sub text and the text may be visually linked circularly and functionally allow for circular navigation between texts and sub texts. Each sub text similar to the text may have another sub text displayed after the sub text.

If the result of step is yes then step displays the list of sub texts to the user. That is representations of the sub texts e.g. titles icons thumbnails and or other markers retrieved from the sub text elements are displayed to the user. Alternatively the sub texts may be displayed parallel to serially displaying originating content in addition to or instead of being displayed at the end of the block or at the end of the text of the originating content.

Once the user chooses the sub text to serially display by selecting the title of the sub text the currently serially displaying Text ID is set to the Sub Text ID and saved in the session counting variables are reset and the process returns to step .

If the result of step is no i.e. the block is finished but the next is not finished then in step the client application sends a request to the server with the current Session ID to get the next text block. Step sets the Words Read value in the database is set to Words Downloaded and the process return to step to identify the next block of text.

If the result of step is no i.e. there are no more sub texts then step stops the serial displaying and tracking process.

The content tracking described herein may be implemented by using an RSVP tracking database. The RSVP tracking database for example may be implemented to include a table such as table 1 below with values for variables including User ID Content ID Is Displayable Words Downloaded and Words Read. The field Is Displayable may be implemented as a flag to mark the selected content serially displayable to the user. The RSVP tracking database may also include additional information relevant to tracking content use for example a Request ID Request Entity Request Type Total Words Words Left Block Size Is Block Finished Is Text Finished and Is Charged fields. The tracking database may be used as a buying database to determine the appropriate charge to a user or an advertiser based on content used and words read.

The variables Is Block Finished and Is Text Finished may be implemented as flags used to indicate whether a downloaded block of text and whether the entire selected text is finished displaying to the user respectively. The Request ID may be used to keep track of each sequential request for content or partial content. The Request Entity field may be used to track whether the request is by a client or server or the like. The Request Type may be used to track whether the request is to get content or to put content for example by the client and by the server respectively. Words Left refers to words remaining in content.

The Block Size can be either defined in the application as a constant for example 10 100 words or chosen by the user in the application OS settings or computed automatically based on the network connection quality and user reading speed. Thus the Block Size varies during the tracking process depending on other conditions and may also be adjusted during the tracking process by the user or by the system as needed. At the very least for example the block size of the last block of a text will be smaller than the other blocks unless the words in the text are evenly divisible by the block size.

When selecting the next block the beginning of the block may be identified based on the latest Words Downloaded and Block Size values or may be identified based on Total Words Read or another bookmarking variable for example when the user stops reading a block and decides to finish the block at another time.

Table 1 shows one example of an RSVP tracking database table for tracking content including textual content as described herein.

In the example shown in Table 1 a user is represented as Client in the Request Entity field. The user requests Text ID 1234 which is 325 words long from the Server. In this case the Block Size is set as 100. The block size may be determined from the user settings the server settings or dictated by the content provider. The block size indicates that the text will be downloaded and used 100 words at a time. As described above words may refer to any displayable elements for example serially displayable textual content or other types of content of one or more words. The last entry in the tracking database where the Request Type value is Acknowledgement ACK may be used to update the user session by setting the final words read for Text ID to equal Words Read in the ACK entry.

Table 2 shows a case where the user loses connection before the ACK entry is sent or stored in the tracking table.

As shown in Table 2 the latest entry in Request ID 6 is used to update the user session with the latest Words Downloaded value 276. Alternatively depending on the settings on the server or user device set by the content provider or other entity the latest Words Read value may be used to update the user session.

As shown in Table 3 there are a total of 793 words for Text ID 919. The content is downloaded 100 words at a time based on the Block Size of 100 words. After reading the first block the reading is terminated mid use during the second block and the total Words Read are set to 147. The content use may be terminated mid use in various ways for example by monitoring the user via a camera or other monitoring means.

Alternatively or in addition to using a tracking database table these variables may be tracked in the user session with only the latest entry of values being saved in the user session and overwritten with the next request ID. In this case if a user stops reading mid use the last entry of values may be used. Additionally the user device will have the latest Words Read and thus the total words read may be updated when a connection is regained by calculating Words Downloaded minus Block Size plus Words Read.

The serial content display and tracking the analytics about the use of content relies on hardware configuration and data acquisition to track the amount of content used.

In Table 4 tracking the analytics about the use of content may be implemented as follows. As a downloaded block is being displayed line 18 continues to track words displayed by incrementing the WordsReadCount while the user is reading the words in the block i.e. while userIsReading true and WordsReadCount

In the user may choose a reading level used to select particular content. The user may also choose a reading speed for displaying content. Alternatively the system may choose the speed and level based on user settings or other settings to avoid repeatedly prompting the user to confirm or update speed setting. The content amount can be varied according to a user reading speed. The complexity level of the content including textual content may also be varied by a content provider according to reading speed or user reading level.

In speed and reading level are referred to simultaneously and both user speed and reading level may be used in process together or separately. The example illustrated in assumes for ease of explanation only that reading speed and reading level vary together i.e. slow speed corresponds to low reading level normal speed to medium level and fast speed to high level . However in alternative examples these values might vary differently. For example a user might have a low reading speed but set a high reading level in order to obtain more difficult content.

Step receives a user request to serially display content including textual content and creates a user session. The user session may include a Session ID a User ID a Text ID and tracking variables such as Words Downloaded and Words Read. The user session may also include user speed and reading level extracted from user information stored on the user device or on the server.

Step determines whether there is a previously set user speed and or reading level in the user device or the server specific to the user or to the content. If there is no previously set speed and or level information as determined in step then step prompts the user to enter a new user speed and or level. Here the user may enter a new custom speed or accept a proposed average speed or proposed custom speed. Additionally the user may be prompted in step to choose from various speed ranges of slow normal or fast speeds and reading levels of low medium or high.

Step updates the user speed and or level on the user device. If the user is logged in as determined in step then step updates the user speed and or level in a user database on the server. If the user is not logged in then step schedules to update the information on the user s next login. Whether or not the user is logged in after step step associates the updated user speed and or level with the user session.

If the result of step is yes then step prompts the user to verify the preset user speed and or level before proceeding. Step determines whether the user has chosen to proceed at the preset speed and or level. If not then step prompts the user to enter a new user speed and or level as described above. If the result of step is yes then step associates the user speed and or level with the user session.

Step delivers the selected content based on user speed and or level. As described above the user speed and or level may affect the speed of displaying the selected content. Further the complexity or level of the content including textual content may be set according to the user reading speed and or reading level or a combination of the two.

Step determines the speed or level as low medium or high. Depending on the user reading speed step or delivers respectively shorter normal or longer content. As such a content publisher or an advertiser may be able to address different market demographics depending on speed or reading level. For example an advertiser may provide several different ads to serve based on the speed or reading level. Step serially displays the content delivered shorter normal or longer .

Step determines whether there is more content to display. If no then the process stops at step . If yes then the process returns to step .

Referring to Step provides a user request to view textual content using serial display while being online. Step provides input from the user to activate serial display functionality. Here the functionality can be automatically activated by selecting serially displayable content or may be activated by launching a serial display enabled application.

Step determines whether the user is a new user by checking the user credentials. The credentials may be saved on the user device including a user name and password or may be anonymous credentials. If the result of step is no then step logs in the user automatically to the serial display enabled application. If the result of step is yes then step saves the new credentials in the serial display enabled application.

Step authenticates the user. Step provides user input selecting the textual content to display serially. Additionally step creates the user session and saves the session information on the client side. The session information may also be saved on the server side.

Session information includes the Session ID User ID Text ID Words Downloaded and Words Read. Words Read in the session is a value relative to the text block size.

Step verifies content availability for the user. Step associates and saves the User ID and the Text ID in tracking database DB . DB is a tracking database table including User ID Text ID Is Displayable Words Downloaded and Words Read fields.

Step adds the Text ID and tracking variables to the user session. Specifically at this stage the tracking variables Words Downloaded and Words Read are initialized to zero 0 . Step flags the user selected content as currently serially displayable to the user in the Is Displayable field of DB .

Step provides the selected serially displayable content for download. Step receives a user request to serially display content including textual content. The request may be generated as a result of a system event indicating that serial display functionality has been activated by the user automatically by the system when the RSVP application is launched or by a predetermined user input. The request may also include session information or login credentials including for example tracking variables and user specific information extracted from user settings or server settings such as user speed and reading level. The method then proceeds to step .

Referring now to and method step determines the next block which is the first block when initially executes in response to user input from based on Words Downloaded and Block Size. Block Size may be a preset constant 10 100 words chosen by the user in settings or determined based on various factors such as for example the network connection quality and or user speed.

Step downloads the text block determined by step from the server to the user device. Step increments Words Downloaded by the Block Size in the user session and the tracking database . Step sets the Words Read value to zero 0 in the user session.

Step displays the textual content of each block i.e. the next block word by word. After each word is displayed step increments the Words Read session variable by one 1 word.

Step determines whether the user stops reading. In the illustrated embodiment this is determined by whether the user has stopped the RSVP display of the content by for example controlling the RSVP interface to stop the RSVP display or navigating away from the web page or other application interface window in which RSVP display of the content was triggered In alternative embodiments additional factors might be used to determine if the user is still actively viewing the content for example by monitoring the user s presence eye position the user s facial expression or other indicators via a camera or other monitoring means. Additionally the user device may be monitored for going to idle state disconnected state or the user may affirmatively indicate that the user stopped reading.

If the result of step is no then step determines whether the block is finished. If the result of step is yes then step determines whether the text is finished. If the result of step is no then step sends a request to the server with the current Session ID to get the next text block. Step updates the Words Read value to Words Downloaded and method returns to step to determine the next block. If the result of step is yes then step charges the user based on the current value of the Words Read variable and the process stops at step .

If the result of step is yes then step sets the Words Read value to Words Downloaded minus Block Size plus Words Read from the user session. Step determines whether the user resumes reading the text via serial display at some later point in time i.e. resumes before a predetermined maximum passage of time or by a predetermined date . Resumption in reading may be indicated by for example the events described above with reference to step . If the result of step is no then step charges the user based on current value of the Words Read variable and the process stops at step . If the result of is yes then the process returns to step .

While step displays text word by word step determines whether the network connection was lost. If no then the method proceeds as indicated. However if step determines that the connection is lost then step charges the user based on the value of Words Downloaded. Thus the user is either charged for the blocks of text downloaded step or for total words read i.e. the value of the Words Read variable in the database step .

Although not illustrated step may determine whether a network connection was lost throughout method . Additionally although not illustrated may schedule a charge for the user based on words downloaded and charge the user if a network connection is not regained in a predetermined period of time. If step resumes serially displaying later the scheduled charge may be reset.

That is if at any time after step makes the content available for download and step initiates serial display the network connection is lost the tracking process waits for a network connection and continues attempting to check for the network connection. Once the network connection is re established the process communicates the latest tracking information to the server.

Referring first to step receives a user content request made online for serial display of the content viewed offline. Step receives a user request to activate serial display functionality. The user may initiate the request by for example the user accessing the serial display application on the user device or by performing a shortcut or gesture input on the user device.

Step determines whether the user has new user credentials. If no then step logs the user into the serial display application automatically. If yes then step saves the credentials for future logins. Step authenticates the user. Step receives user input to select the textual content to display serially offline.

Step creates the user session is created and saves session information on the client device. The session information includes a Session ID a User ID a Text ID Words Downloaded and Words Read.

Step verifies content availability for the user. The verification may involve for example determining whether the content is serially displayable to the user or whether the user has rights to view the content.

User session information is also saved in DB which includes User ID Text ID Is Charged Download Date Charge Date Words Downloaded and Words Read. Step adds the Text ID and tracking variables to the user session information . Step associates the User ID and Text ID by saving them together in DB . DB may be a buying database i.e. a tracking database used to determine the amount to charge based on words read or content used by the user or the advertiser.

Step downloads and saves the user selected content including textual content. Step prepares the content to be serially displayed and provides serially displayable content in offline mode to the user. The serial display application prepares the content for example by configuring content including textual content for RSVP display by parsing text included in the content and other displayable elements in the content and dividing the content into a plurality of displayable elements.

Step starts a timeout listener to charge the user for the entire text after a predetermined amount of time. For example the user may have 10 days to check out the content and if the user does not check the content back in and provide an update on how much of the content was read the user will be charged for the entire content by the end of 10 days. Use of the timeout period for charging is described further in the context of .

Step receives a user request to start serially displaying content including textual content in offline mode. The request may be generated as a result of a system event indicating that serial display functionality has been activated by the user automatically by the system when the RSVP application is launched or by a predetermined user input. The process then proceeds to step of process illustrated in .

Referring now to step displays the text word by word. After each word is displayed step increments the Words Read variable by one 1 . Step updates the Words Read value for this Text ID in the local database based on the new value.

Step determines whether a timeout has occurred based on the predetermined number of days as described with reference to step in . If the result of step is yes then step schedules to charge the user for the entire content. If the result of step is no then step schedules to charge the user based on the latest value of Words Read.

Step determines whether the user stopped reading. If the user did not stop reading then step continues serially displaying the content and the process returns to step . If the result of step is yes then step determines whether the content is finished. If the content is finished then step schedules to charge the user for the entire content.

If the result of step is no then step determines whether the user requests to continue displaying the content later i.e. before the timeout references in step . If yes then step continues serially displaying the content and the process returns to step . If not then step removes unread content from the user device.

Step determines whether a network connection is available. If no then step waits for a connection and loops back to step . If a network connection is available then step updates the Words Read variable in the server side buying database using the value from the local user device database. Step charges the user for the content based on the words read. Step sets the flag Is Charged for the User ID and Text ID to true. Step stops the timeout listener.

The sub ads may be pre generated by the advertiser or content publisher based on pre determined keywords within the originating ad or content and embedded within the originating ad or content upon serving the selected content to the user. In an alternative embodiment the sub ads may be dynamically generated based on the keywords related to the content read thus far while tracking the serial display of content by the advertiser or content publisher based on keywords within a pre determined keyword lookup table linking keywords to sub content for example sub ads or other sub content. However in the embodiment describe below sub ads are linked to the parent ad by the provider of the parent ad while the parent ad is dynamically generated based on the words that are serially displayed in non sponsored text.

RSVP content may include embedded text an attachment and or a URL as sub content. In addition to displaying an indication of a sub content on the display an indication of the type of sub content may also be indicated for example distinguishing whether the sub content is a text a file attachment or a URL. The file attachment may be for example a photo a map a document etc. When a user selects a sub content item for example a file attachment the application associated with the sub content is launched to open the sub content.

In the described embodiments sub ads and sub texts described below appear when the reading of text is stopped either by the user during the reading of the main ad or text or when the main ad or text reached the end. Additionally the sub ads and sub texts may be configured to appear during the main ad or text to allow the user to instantly recognize that the proper noun or key word will be available to read later so that the user does not need to stop to look for it during the currently displaying text. Although not illustrated the sub ads and sub texts may appear after a user initiated interruption in the serial display and tracking method.

The sub ads or other sub content items may be displayed on the interface of the user device as a circular path of cascading sub content items and upon navigation may end up back at a previous point in the loop. A previously read ad or other item can be displayed as grayed out to indicate to the user not to continue repeating the cycle. However a different visual feedback may be used to prevent the user from re looping unnecessarily.

When tracking ads the Ad User Session is updated on the server side database. For each user viewing an ad a new session with an anonymous ID is created to keep track of words downloaded and serially displayed.

A block of the ad is downloaded from the server to the user device. The Words Downloaded session variable as well as the database value is incremented by the Block Size upon each block download. Block Size can be either defined in the application as a constant for example of 10 100 words or chosen by the user in the application OS settings or computed automatically based on the network connection quality and user reading speed. Upon downloading the new block Words Read value in the session is set to zero 0 . While the RSVP Library is serially displaying the text block word by word the Words Read session variable is incremented for each word. If the network connection is lost latest downloaded number of words can be used for charging the company being advertised. Otherwise the advertiser may be charged based on words read within the ads being served.

The ad displaying and tracking process begins in step when a user is served an advertisement or a sub advertisement on a web page or application from the Internet.

Step receives a request to initiate serial display of the ad content including textual content. The request may be generated as a result of a system event indicating that serial display functionality has been activated by the user automatically by the system when the RSVP application is launched or by a predetermined user input.

Step marks the serial displayed sub ad as read by setting a corresponding Is Read variable associated with the content as true. The Is Read flag may be maintained in a user session or in a server side database corresponding to content.

Step for each user creates a new ad user session with value for variables including SessionID AnonymousID AdID CurrentRetryID WordsDownloaded and WordsRead. The user session information is partially associated with the information in ads table and retries table . The ads table includes AdID AdTitle AdIcon AdText and SubAdID. The retries table includes AdID AnonymousID RetryID WordsDownloaded and WordsRead. The retries table may be used to track how many retries were used for serially displaying the content. The words read and words downloaded upon retry may be tracked separately for each retry. That is each retry entry in the retries table may include different amounts for words read and words downloaded for each retry. The information in the retries table may be used when aggregating analytics about content use and when determining a charge for the advertiser based on the retries. For example an advertiser may be charged more if a user retried the sponsored content or may not be charged for any retries.

Step identifies the next block of the ad using the Ad ID Words Downloaded and Block Size information variables or by counting from the latest Words Read variable value. Step downloads the block identified in step from the server to the user device. Step increments the Words Downloaded session variable and database value by the Block Size. Step initializes the Words Read value to zero 0 for counting the new block. While blocks are downloaded at step step monitors the network connection to determine if it has been lost.

If the network connection has not been lost then step continues to update the ad user session information on the server. If yes then step schedules to charge the advertiser based on the latest number of downloaded words.

Although not illustrated step may monitor whether a network connect was lost throughout method . Additionally although not illustrated may schedule a charge for the user based on words downloaded and charge the user if a network connection is not regained in a predetermined period of time.

That is if at any time after step starts serially displaying the content of the ad including textual content the network connection is lost the tracking process waits for a network connection and continues attempting to check for the network connection. Once the network connection is re established the process resets the scheduled charge and communicates the latest tracking information to the server.

Step displays the content including textual content word by word. After each word is displayed in step step increments the WordsRead session variable by 1.

Step determines if the user stops reading e.g. by determining serial display of the ad has stopped . If yes then step updates the WordsRead value in the database to reflect the words read thus far by setting the Words Read value to equal to WordsDownloaded minus the BlockSize plus the WordsRead so far from the session. Step then determines whether the text has finished. If yes then the process goes to of method described further below with reference to for displaying any sub ads. If no then step determines whether the serial display of the ad resumes within a predetermined period of time e.g. before a timeout timer expires . If no then the process goes to of method . If yes then the process proceeds to step to get the next text block.

If the result of step is no then step determines if the block has finished. If no then step continues serially displaying the block word by word. If yes then step sets the WordsRead value in the database to the value of WordsDownloaded.

Step sends a request to the server with the Session ID to get the next text block to display and the process continues with step . At the end of method not shown the user may be charged based on the latest words read.

Step determines the sub ads if any to be displayed to by identifying any sub ads associated with the displayed ad in ads table . Step determines whether step identified any sub ads to display. If yes then step determines whether any of the identified sub ads are ads that have been previously read e.g. displayed . If there are previously read ads then step displays those ads as grayed out. If there are not any previously read sub ads then step provides a list of sub ads to the user.

Step receives a user action selecting a sub ad from the list provided in step the user action triggering RSPV display of the ad. In some embodiments the user action may be an active selection of an ad from the list. In other embodiments the user action may be a passive action for example simply not navigating away from or closing the window or page on which the list is displayed. In the latter case the first sub ad in the list is selected for display by RSVP. Upon determining that a sub ad is selected for display the system begins RSVP display of the sub ad.

Step sets the Ad ID in the user session to the sub ad ID to indicate the currently serially displaying ad and saves in the session information .

Step resets the tracking variables in the user session for example Session ID U ID Ad ID Current Retry ID Words Downloaded and Words Read. The process then proceeds to step in where a user is served an advertisement or a sub advertisement. The process tracks the sub ad selected in step for example in the same way as tracking an ad in .

If step determines that there are not any or any more sub ads to be displayed then step stops the serial display stops serial display. If the user re initiates serial display of the ad that has already been displayed in step then step updates the retries table by creating a new entry for the re read or partially re read content.

Step begins serially displaying a text that the user is required to read. Alternatively the text may be optional to read and compliance may refer to whether the user is continuously reading the text. Step starts a compliance check thread. Step initiates a frontal camera device. Most modern mobile devices include a frontal camera. Additionally most modern desktop PCs and laptops may include a frontal video camera for example a webcam. The camera may be integrated within the device or connected to the device or accessible and connected with the device.

In step the compliance thread sleeps for a predetermined number of milliseconds waiting for the compliance next check. The sleep time may be set by the user or the content provider in user or server settings.

Step determines whether a check timeout occurred. If yes then the content including textual content begins serially displaying. If a check timeout did not occur No in step then the compliance thread continues to sleep for the predetermined number of milliseconds in step before checking again.

Step determines a confidence level of a face being recognized. In some embodiments this is done by calling a face recognition library. Such libraries are well known. Such a call routine and the associated library may be part of the OS on the mobile device or implemented as a third party library. Step determines whether the confidence level is above a predetermined threshold. For a confidence factor between 0 and 1 a value of above 0.3 is usually a good threshold but other values may be considered. In alternative embodiments additional factors might be used to determine compliance for example by monitoring the user s presence eye position or other indicators via a camera or other monitoring means.

If the result of step is no than an Is Compliant variable value is set to false and the process proceeds to step . If the result of step is yes then the Is Compliant variable value is left at true if previously initialized as true .

Step determines whether serial displaying of text ended. If not the process returns to step and waits for the next check. If serial displaying has ended then step shows the compliance check result to the user. The result is either that compliance is confirmed or that the compliance check shows failure. Alternatively the compliance check result can be represented as a mean value of all confidence factors measured throughout the serial display.

When determining the mean confidence of factors checking intervals may be used to see if you are still in front of the camera by analyzing various levels of recognition. A thirty percent confidence factor that a person is in front of the camera may be a sufficient threshold for a successful compliance check for that time interval indicating a user being in front of the camera. Otherwise the compliance check is marked as failed for that time interval. When some checks fail and some checks pass mean value of all of the confidence factors may be used. If the mean is above 30 then the overall compliance check is successful. The time interval for compliance checks may be pre determined or could be a function of a user reading speed. For example the method may check compliance every 1000 words.

Step receives a request to start serially displaying non sponsored content in RSVP. The request may be generated by a user or as a result of a system event indicating that serial display functionality has been activated by the user automatically by the system when the RSVP application is launched or by a predetermined user input. The request may also include session information or login credentials including for example tracking variables and user specific information extracted from user settings or server settings such as user speed and reading level. The text may be currently accessible by the user device for example it might be saved locally on the device or on a user memory accessible by the user device such as a removable drive or cloud storage the textual content may be parsed to check the text for keywords. Alternatively a parser may be invoked before serving content to a user. The advertiser can provide a list of ads to be used with particular keywords. Similarly a content provider can provide a list of content to be used with particular keywords.

Step checks every word in the text of the non sponsored content against a database table containing advertising keywords.

Step based on the checking of step creates a lookup list containing keywords titles and icons in preparation for delivery to the user. This list may be used as a lookup list in the form of a lookup table stored on the server to retrieve sponsored content based on words displayed the sponsored content to be displayed as sub content along with other sub content items if any. The title and icon information in the lookup list may be used to show ads as sub content items at the end of a list of any non sponsored sub content items.

Step sends the list of found keywords to the user device. Step prepares the content to be serially displayed.

The content is prepared by for example by configuring content including textual content for RSVP display by parsing text included in the content and other displayable elements in the content and dividing the content into a plurality of displayable elements to display the elements serially.

In the illustrated embodiment the ads to be displayed as sub content items are generated dynamically from a lookup based on words displayed by RSVP in the non sponsored content. The lookup list may be itself dynamic not shown based on advertisement supply and demand or bidding outcomes at the time the list is generated. However in alternative embodiments the ads to be displayed as sub content items may be embedded in the requested non sponsored content.

Step serially displays the non sponsored content word by word and tracks words displayed. Once display has ended step determines whether there are sub content items.

If the result of step is yes then step displays a list of the sub content items. Step looks up ads based on words read i.e. displayed by RSVP and corresponding keywords from the lookup list created in step . Step appends the ad titles to the list of other sub content items displayed in step . If the result of step is no then the process proceeds directly to step to lookup the ads. In either case the method proceeds to step which displays the ads as sub content items by displaying representations of the ad e.g. ad title and or any corresponding ad icon .

Step determines if the user has selected a sub content item. If no then the process ends at step . If yes then step determines whether the item is a non sponsored content item or an ad. If an ad then step retrieves the full ad content from the ad server. If non sponsored content then the process proceeds directly to step . Step displays and tracks the sub content whether an ad retrieved by step or non sponsored sub content that has been retrieved already or by other means . The process then ends at step .

The tracking techniques described herein may be applied to any content including textual content that can be divided into displayable elements and serially displayed. The divided elements may be treated as words and the use of content including textual content may be tracked by the tracking methods and systems described herein. Further analytics can be performed for serial displays that are classified by the type of media that contain integrated serial displays. One example of tracking the creation and consumption of mixed media content that includes RSVP content and other content is shown in and

Step updates user information by storing values for Session ID identifying the request User ID identifying the user Start Time establishing the time stamp for the initiation of that session and the Session Type indicating whether the session is for creating RSVP or viewing RSVP content in this case the former . Step also updates RSVP content information with values for Media ID identifying the media item that to which the user has requested to add RSVP content Media Type identify whether the media request is for video photo map or text and the User ID connecting RSVP content information to the user session identified in table .

Step displays the requested media item in the RSVP enabled application. Step creates based on user input the first RSVP content item i.e. a particular segment of text to be displayed by RSVP either as global content associated with the entire media item or as embedded content associated with a particular location within the media item. The word embedded in this context simply means that it appears as local content within the media item i.e. in association with a particular part i.e. visual location and or time location of the media item. Various interfaces for viewing and creating RSVP enabled media as well as RSVP sub content are described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 730 163 filed Dec. 28 2012 incorporated herein by referenced. Interfaces for viewing and creating RSVP enabled videos and RSVP enabled video previews are more fully described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 919 848 filed Jun. 17 2013 incorporated herein by reference above. As the text in the RSVP content item is created in Step certain text segments within the RSVP content item may be designated as keywords based on user input or by algorithms designed to identify proper nouns and word combinations. The position of each keyword within the RSVP content item may be identified by the number of the first word in the keyword in the sequence of words in the RSVP content item.

After completion of step step updates activity information by adding and relating values that are associated with the Session ID including values for the following variables Activity ID which is used to record the creation or viewing of an RSVP content item in the session in this case the former and the RSVP Detail ID which uniquely identifies a particular RSVP content item in association with a particular Media ID RSVP Content ID and if applicable a particular RSVP Preview ID . Step also updates RSVP content information with the User ID and values for RSVP Preview ID identifying that RSVP content as part of a particular preview if so designated by the user RSVP Content ID identifying that RSVP content item in association with a particular Media ID RSVP Detail ID described above Previous RSVP Detail ID present if the RSVP content item is an updated version of a previously created RSVP content item this allows for associating multiple versions of RSVP content items as a content providing user attempts to improve consumption of particular content items as described more fully in the context of RSVP Content Type identifying the type as global or embedded Total Words the number of words in that RSVP content the Media Sequence Number identifying the order of display of that specific RSVP content if a preview is being created and Video Sequence Length the time length of a video sequence that is associated with that RSVP content if a video preview is being created . Step also updates keyword sequence information with the RSVP Detail ID Keyword ID identifying each keyword that has been designated in that RSVP content and RSVP Word Number the word number of the first word in each keyword in the sequence of words in that RSVP content .

Step determines whether the user wants to create any RSVP sub content items related to the RSVP content item that was created in step . If no the process proceeds to step . If yes the process proceeds to step to enable the user to create the RSVP sub content item or items. As each RSVP sub content item is created step updates activity information by adding and relating values for the Activity ID identifying the creation of the sub content item and the RSVP Detail ID uniquely identifying the particular RSVP sub content item created . Step also updates RSVP content information with values for RSVP Content ID associating the new RSVP sub content item with the specific RSVP content item created in step the RSVP Sub content ID identifying the RSVP item as an RSVP sub content item RSVP Detail ID RSVP Content Type identifying its type as embedded or global and Total Words the number of words in that RSVP content item .

Step determines if additional RSVP content items are to be created and added to the sequence in another desired location of the media. If yes then the process proceeds to back to step . If no then the process ends at step and the session is concluded.

Turning to in detail step receives a request to view a media item. In some embodiments the request may include session information or login credentials including for example tracking variables and user specific information extracted from user settings or server settings such as user speed and reading level. The requested media with RSVP content is identified by its Media ID or if applicable the combination of its Media ID and its Preview ID originally generated and stored as part of RSVP Content information of

Step displays a media item in which RSVP content has been previously created and tracked according to the example in . Step then updates user information by storing values for Session ID identifying the request for the media User ID identifying the user Start Time establishing the time stamp for the initiation of that session the Session Type records that the session is to view rather than create RSVP content and User Speed identifying the reading speed that has been selected for displaying RSVP to the user for the current request . Step determines whether the requested media item is a full version of the RSVP enabled media item or an RSVP enabled preview version for the item.

Continuing with the left flow result of step is that the selected content is a full version RSVP enabled media item step starts RSVP display of the first or next RSVP content segment i.e. RSVP content item in the media. Note that depending on the application the type of media item and or settings of the author provider and or user of the item each RSVP content segment may display at step automatically in a predetermined sequence or alternatively may display only in response to a specific user interface action. Step indicates that the current RSVP content segment i.e. the segment started at step has been stopped or has ended.

While the media and associated RSVP content segments are displaying step continues to update activity information by adding and relating values associated with the Session ID including values for the following variables Activity ID which identifies a request for viewing a particular RSVP content segment that is part of the media item associated with the Session ID End Time the time at the conclusion of the requested activity e.g. the time when the RSVP content segment ends or otherwise stops displaying RSVP Detail ID identifying the specific RSVP content segment and Words Read value that is incremented as additional words in the RSVP content segment are displayed and RSVP Sub content ID identifying each RSVP sub content that has been selected by the user .

Step determines if there are any RSVP sub content items related to the RSVP content displayed in step . If no then the process proceeds to step . If yes the process proceeds in step to display a list of titles of the RSVP sub content items from which the user can make a selection. If the user makes a selection the RSVP Sub content ID is updated in step . The process then proceeds back to step so that the selected RSVP sub content item can be displayed and tracked.

Step determines if display of the media has been canceled by the user e.g. the user has navigated away from the page or otherwise stopped display of the media . If yes then the process proceeds to step which updates activity information by adding and relating values that are associated with Session ID after which the process ends at step and the session is concluded. If no then the process returns to step and the user may select another RSVP content item or display of the next RSVP content segment may be initiated automatically and the process is repeated until the user decides to cancel the media.

Now turning to the right flow result of step is that the selected RSVP enabled content is an RSVP enabled media preview step starts RSVP display of the first or next RSVP content segment in the media preview. Step indicates that the current RSVP content segment i.e. the segment started at step has been stopped or has ended. Step determines if there are any RSVP sub content items related to the RSVP content segment displayed in step . If no the process proceeds to step . If yes then step displays a list of titles of the RSVP sub content items from which the user can make a selection. The process then proceeds back to step so that the selected RSVP sub content item can be displayed and tracked.

While the media and associated RSVP content segments are displaying step continues to update activity information by adding and relating values associated with the Session ID including values for the following variables Activity ID which identifies a request for viewing a particular RSVP content segment that is part of the media item associated with the Session ID End Time the time at the conclusion of the requested activity e.g. the time at the when the RSVP content segment ends or otherwise stops displaying RSVP Detail ID identifying the specific RSVP content segment and Words Read value that is incremented as additional words in the RSVP content segment are displayed .

Step determines if playing of the media preview has been canceled. If yes then the process ends at step and the session is concluded. If no then step starts the display of the next RSVP content in the sequence.

Now turning to in detail step receives a request to view a video. In some embodiments the request may include session information or login credentials including for example tracking variables and user specific information extracted from user settings or server settings such as user speed and reading level. The requested media with RSVP content is identified by its Media ID or if applicable the combination of its Media ID and its Preview ID originally generated and stored as part of RSVP Content information of

Step displays a video start screen and video timeline with RSVP markers. As described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 919 848 incorporated by reference above RSVP markers may be placed on a video timeline progress bar to indicate the presence of RSVP content associated with certain time points in the video. Step then updates user information by storing values for Session ID identifying the for request for the media User ID identifying the user Start Time establishing the time stamp for the initiation of that session the Session Type records that the session is to view rather than create RSVP content and User Speed identifying the reading speed that has been selected for displaying RSVP to the identified user for the current request . Step determines whether the selected content is a full RSVP enabled video or an RSVP enabled video preview.

Continuing with the left flow result of step is that the selected RSVP enabled content is an RSVP enabled video step starts RSVP display of the first or next RSVP content segment in the video. Note that it is assumed but not separately shown for purposes of this diagram that the user has selected the start button and that the video has begun playing. Step indicates that the current RSVP content segment i.e. the segment started at step has been stopped or has ended.

While the video and associated RSVP content segments are displaying step continues to update activity information by adding and relating values that are associated with Session ID including values for the following variables Activity ID which identifies a request for a particular RSVP content segment that is part of the video associated with Session ID End Time the time at the conclusion of the requested activity e.g. the time when the RSVP content segment ends or otherwise stops displaying RSVP Detail ID identifying the specific RSVP content segment Words Read value that is incremented as additional words in the RSVP content segment are displayed and Video Sequence Viewed indicating the time amount of the video that has been viewed thus far .

Step determines if there are any RSVP sub content items related to the RSVP content displayed in step . If no then the process proceeds to step . If yes the process proceeds in step to display a list of titles of the RSVP sub content items from which the user can make a selection. The process then proceeds back to step so that the selected RSVP sub content item can be displayed and tracked.

Step determines if viewing of the video has ended either because playback was canceled by the user or because the end of the video was reached . If yes then the process proceeds to step which updates activity information the value of the Video Sequence Viewed variable which indicates the time amount of video that been viewed up to the point where it ends or has been canceled by the user in step . The process ends at step and the session is concluded. If the result of step is no then video continues to play and the process returns to step to start the next RSVP segment when it is reached.

Now turning to the right flow result of step is that the selected RSVP enabled content is an RSVP enabled video preview step starts RSVP display of the first or next RSVP content segment in the video preview. Note that it is assumed but not separately shown for purposes of this diagram that the user has selected the start button and that the video preview has begun playing. Step indicates that the current RSVP content segment i.e. the segment started at step has been stopped or has ended. Step determines if there are any RSVP sub content items related to the RSVP content segment displayed in step . If no the process proceeds to step . If yes then step displays a list of titles of the RSVP sub content items from which the user can make a selection. The process then proceeds back to step so that the selected RSVP sub content item can be displayed and tracked.

While the RSVP content segments are displaying step continues to update activity information by adding and relating values that are associated with Session ID including values for the following variables Activity ID which identifies a request for a particular RSVP content segment that is part of the video preview associated with Session ID End Time the time at the conclusion of the requested activity e.g. the time when the RSVP content segment ends or otherwise stops displaying Words Read value that is incremented as additional words in the RSVP content segment are displayed and Video Sequence Viewed indicating the time amount of the video preview that has been viewed thus far .

Step determines if playing of the video preview has been canceled. If yes then the process ends at step and the session is concluded. If no then step starts the video sequence associated with the RSVP content segment just displayed. Step indicates that the current video sequence i.e. the sequence started at step has been stopped or has ended. Step determines if playing of the video preview has been canceled. If yes then the process ends at step and the session is concluded. If no then step determines whether the last RSVP content segment in the current preview has been displayed. If the result of step is yes then the process ends at step and the session is concluded. If the result of step is no then the process returns to step to begin displaying the next RSVP content segment of the current RSVP enabled video preview.

While the video sequences and RSVP content segments are displaying step continues to update activity information by adding and relating values that are associated with Session ID including values for the following variables Activity ID which identifies a request for a particular RSVP content segment that is part of the video associated with Session ID End Time the time at the conclusion of the requested activity e.g. the time when the RSVP content segment ends or otherwise stops displaying Words Read value that is incremented as additional words in the RSVP content segment are displayed and Video Sequence Viewed indicating the time amount of the video that has been viewed thus far .

In the process order is shown such that RSVP content is displayed before the related video sequence. However in an alternative embodiment this order can be reversed such that the video sequence is displayed first and then the RSVP content is displayed.

Examples of analytics data aggregated for creation and consumption of multimedia content integrated with RSVP content are shown below in Tables 5 7. For purposes of illustration data associated with RSVP enabled video previews that would be generated by the portion of process shown in the right side of the flow diagram of is shown. However those skilled in the art will understand how comparable data for RSVP enabled videos could be generated by the portion of process shown on the left side of the and that comparable data could also be generated for RSVP enabled media generated by process shown in

Tables 5 7 are conceptually linked based on relationships between the attributes i.e. column field names . This is explained further in the context of the examples below.

In this example there are thirteen 13 sessions which are each uniquely identified by the Session ID. The User ID records which of the six users has initiated each session and Start Time records when each session was initiated. The Session Type records whether the user created or viewed RSVP content. Speed records the setting of the RSVP speed by the user if the Session Type is view.

Table 6 shows an example of data for RSVP content information of that is related to the data from Table 5. As described above the RSVP enabled video preview includes a combination of video sequences and text information presented via RSPV. The RSVP enabled preview may be published by combining global RSVPs and or timeline specific embedded RSVPs with sequences of video. RSVP sub content items may be published by other users for selected RSVP content items.

In Table 6 the RSVP content for three different RSVP previews of one video identified by Media ID and Media Type is stored and identified. In this example each RSVP Detail ID uniquely identifies each RSVP content item in the context it appears in a media item and if applicable a media preview item. As shown in Table 6 the RSVP Detail ID attribute is related to other attributes including an RSVP Content ID RSVP Sub content ID if that RSVP content item is a sub content RSVP as well as other attributes of each RSVP content item including RSVP Content Type Total Words and Video Sequence Length if that RSVP content item is embedded and therefore has an associated video sequence . The Media Sequence Number identifies the sequence in which the particular RSVP segment appears in the corresponding RSVP enabled media preview. In this example the Media Sequence Number is only provided for embedded RSVP content items since global items do not necessarily appear in a sequence along the video timeline. In this example the values for Media Sequence Number correspond to the values for RSVP Content ID. However in alternative examples different previews might be created using the same content segments in a different order.

Table 7 shows an example of data for Activity information of that is related to the data from Tables 5 and 6 above.

In Table 7 the Activity information records the activities within six sessions and identified for example by the Activity IDs. Each Activity ID identifies the RSVP content item that is viewed by each user by its RSVP Detail ID and records for that activity the Words Read if the RSVP content item s text is displayed to the user and Video Sequence Viewed if that RSVP content item has an associated video sequence .

Referring to Table 7 the first row shows that for Activity ID 101 of Session ID 8 which from Table 5 is associated with user abc at time of 10 00 on date 06 06 13 and is of session type view with a speed of 300 words per minute and which from Table 6 is associated with the RSVP preview 1 for video 001 36 words were read of the RSVP content of RSVP Detail ID 1 . Referring to Table 6 the RSVP content of RSVP Detail ID 1 is a global RSVP of 36 words. Therefore all the content of this RSVP item was displayed for the user. Because the RSVP content was global and therefore associated with the preview as a whole rather than with any particular video sequence the values for Video Sequence Length in Table 6 and Video Sequence Viewed in Table 7 which are only relevant for particular sequences associated with non global RSVP content segments are necessarily null.

The second row indicates that during the second activity of the same session for the RSVP preview i.e. Session ID 8 associated with user abc and preview 1 an RSVP sub content segment was requested having an RSVP Detail ID 9. Referring to Table 6 the RSVP content of RSVP Detail ID 9 is a global sub content item RSVP Sub content ID 1 and related to RSVP Content ID 1 with 29 words. Referring back to Table 9 all 29 words were displayed for the user i.e. Words Read 29 .

The third fourth and fifth rows show data associated with the remaining three activities of this session completing the RSVP preview which from Table 6 can be established as RSVP Preview ID 1 has only five 5 RSVP content items . The last two RSVP content items of the RSVP preview RSVP Detail IDs 4 and 5 contain video sequences which from Table 6 have lengths of 00 51 and 01 09 respectively and were viewed completely as the Video Sequence Viewed values are the same as the Video Sequence Length values.

The remaining rows of Table 7 provide the data from the other sessions by the same user and several other users as listed in Table 5 including the same RSVP preview and two other previews listed in Table 6. As shown in Table 6 the illustrated previews corresponding to Preview IDs 1 2 and 3 are all associated with the same video corresponding to Media ID 1 .

The variables and tables described above are examples used merely for clarity of explanation of the tracking and analytics aggregating process and are not limited thereto. Also the particular table relationships illustrated above are selected in part for ease of explanation and might be varied in a particular implementation. To cite just one example Table 6 as shown includes a Media Type column. However such a variable and its corresponding data could be present instead in a separate media table that is related to Table 6 through the Media ID variable. Therefore in a more detailed example a table such as Table 6 would not necessarily need to include a Media Type column if it is included in a related table.

The variables and tables described above are used as examples for clarity of explanation of the tracking and analytics aggregating process and are not limited thereto.

Relevancy of a search result on a web page is subjective to a user performing the search. Therefore evidence of how likely a user is to find the result relevant combined with keyword scoring or other criteria can provide better search results. The RSVP tracking and trending data may be used to determine relevancy of a search result by an RSVP search enrichment process as described herein.

The RSVP search enrichment process begins when a user request is received to display content in RSVP. The RSVP content is provided and the content consumption is tracked. At the same time the content consumption data is generated and refined. Further content consumption data is aggregated and grouped by content user media and various other analytics. This data is used to enrich the user search results and provide more relevant results to the user.

When a user provides a search term an object list is extracted based on the search terms and provided to the user in the most relevant order to the user. The object list contains a list of content or pages that relate to at least one keyword or search term. The object list may be initially sorted by assigning an initial rank to each content or page within the list. This initial ranking may be determined using one or more various known search criteria including for example the number of other pages that link to the page or the frequency of keywords or search terms within the content or page.

The search results object list is then enriched by the RSVP analytics data to obtain an adjusted ranking to provide more relevant results. One example of enriching the object list is to adjust the ranking after assigning a higher weight to words read e.g. the total words displayed using RSVP in a page than to other factors e.g. user clicks links to the page etc. when determining the adjusted ranking of the object. Another example includes assigning a higher weight to the recent trend trajectory for words read of that website. Thus page ranking within an object list can be determined according to the Words Read or other RSVP tracking and trending data in addition to other weighting variables.

An object within an object list of search results would show up higher in search results because it has a higher number of words read as a running total of words read or because of an upward trending trajectory of most recent words read. Ranking can also be determined in combination with other criteria for example a number of links that lead to that content based on the search criteria or a number of clicks. In this case words read data or RSVP trending data may be used to adjust the existing ranking RSVP enriched search may also be applied to searching videos based on the analytics gathered for RSVP previews and video RSVP data. A video specific search may use RSVPs started and video tracking data as described further herein.

Now turning to in detail step receives search terms generated at least in part by a user performing a search. A user may perform a search by submitting search terms to a search application a web browser an RSVP enabled application or an RSVP search ranking application implementing method . The user search query includes at least one keyword or search term. In cases of using a web browser the search terms and clicks are tracked by search engines and web crawlers to generate usage data for generating search results.

Step requests a search result based on the search terms and the keywords in the entered search terms.

Step extracts an object list comprised of content and each content matches the search terms and at least one keyword. The object list includes search results each entry in the list may include for example a sort position a rank for the object an object identifier an object title and an object preview such as the first few characters or words of the textual content. The object list format may depend on the type of content being searched. For example when searching photos the object list may include a thumbnail of the photo being searched and the textual content associated with the photo for example from the caption of the image. As another example the content being searched may include a file being searched in a file system an email and or various other types of content. The sort position may be determined for example by how many times a file or photo has been opened or an email has been read.

After step extracts the object list step queries DB for relevant RSVP tracking data while step determines the initial content ranking for the objects in the object list as follows.

Step determines the initial content ranking of each content or page in the object list for example by determining the number of keywords present in the content or the number of user clicks or a combination of other factors. Step may be performed parallel to steps .

Step queries DB for relevant RSVP tracking and trending data. DB contains an aggregation of data which reflects how content on the Internet is actually viewed and read through the use of an RSVP application implementing the displaying and tracking methods previously described and an RSVP search ranking application implementing method . The RSVP data may also contain other knowledge about content usage such as content consumption trends. As described in the context of RSVP tracking and trending data may be aggregated and gathered in various ways to provide aggregated data that is available to queries for enriching search results. Aggregated tracking data includes a total aggregate of content read TACR for a particular media item Media ID as shown in media information which corresponds to media information of . TACR for a particular media item is determined based on the total count of words displayed using RSPV across all user view sessions. Trending data may be computed as the rate of change in the tracked data over a predetermined period of time.

Thus for example step may query DB to return from media information total aggregate content read i.e. TACR for each content media item in the object list. As another example step may request a trend trajectory factor from RSVP trends information for each content item in the object list.

Step provides the query result from DB which includes RSVP tracking and trending data relevant to the object list.

Applying the query result step adjusts the initial content ranking based on RSVP tracking and trending data in the query result. For example the initial rank may be adjusted by a factor of a TACR score for each content in the search results or object list. Additionally other RSVP data such as RSVP Read or RSVP Previews Read from Media information and RSVP Read Trend or RSVP Previews Read Trend from RSVP Trends information may be used to adjust each object rank.

Here RSVP data measures such as TACR and TACR Trend as described above may be used to increase or decrease initial content ranking of content to better indicate how interesting that content might be to the user performing the search. For example the initial content ranking of each content in the object list is adjusted by adding or multiplying by a fraction e.g. 0.1 of the page s trending score to the initial content ranking.

Additionally TACR and TACR trending factors may be combined to rank the content in the object list. For example the initial content ranking of each content in the object list is adjusted by adding some fraction e.g. 0.1 of the page s RSVP trending score and some fraction e.g. 0.01 of the page s TACR score to the initial content ranking. However in alternative implementation both factors are not necessarily needed to determine ranking. For example in particular alternative implementations only the trending information may be used or only the TACR may be used to determine the rank.

After adjusting the object list ranking by applying RSVP tracking and trending data step returns the RSVP enriched object list to the user. The object list may be returned entirely or in segments.

The data in RSVP DB is built from actual user attention related data reading of RSVP content collected from RSVP applications that can be distributed to users in all parts of the world. Thus the RSVP trending and tracking data stored in DB contains useful information that can be used to adjust an initial content ranking and produce more relevant and interesting results.

Initial content ranking or initial page ranking may be based for example on simple keyword frequency and the order in which search terms appear in an object or other factors such as click count or links to influence the initial page ranking RSVP data may be used in conjunction with initial rank data to rank search results or object lists.

The tracking and trending data in the RSVP database i.e. DB is continually being enhanced to support search engines and RSVP search ranking applications implementing method or any applications or programs that may rely on RSVP DB or RSVP tracking and trending data.

Accordingly using this data in a content ranking algorithm e.g. RSVP search ranking application implementing method or other ranking algorithm is an improvement over previous approaches in that it relies at least in part on more direct evidence of content consumption of individual users in the form of words displayed to users via RSVP.

RSVP search ranking application implementing method or other ranking algorithm may use two types of aggregated RSVP tracking and trending data stored in DB to gauge how relevant a particular content or page is for a given search term or keyword total aggregated data and trending data collected in part by RSVP content tracking. For example aggregated RSVP data may include Total Aggregate Content Read TACR data and RSVP trending data.

TACR data includes a total aggregate amount of content read for a specific media i.e. content item. TACR data goes beyond the concept of the page being linked from other locations and more accurately indicates the actual amount of content read i.e. displayed by RSVP on that page when linking to that page.

TACR trending data may be computed as the rate of change in the TACR data over time. If more people are reading a content than what is normal for that page the content is considered to have an upward trending trajectory. If fewer people are reading less content than normal for that content the content is considered to have a downward trending trajectory. If approximately the expected amount of content is being read in the content the trending is considered to be neutral or normal.

Normal or neutral trending may be determined by an average trend of a predetermined number of people a day reading a predetermined amount of content per day per user. If the number of people per day increases or the amount of content being read increases per day then the content is considered to have an upward trending trajectory. The trend may also be determined based on a number of unique people reading a predetermined percentage of the content.

With this measure a downward trending trajectory may actually decrease the content s rank. That is even though there are many keywords that match people are currently losing interest in the content.

The trend trajectory of content may be computed as Latest Trend Average Trend Average Trend where Latest Trend is the most recent value of the trending and Average Trend is the expected average trending over a historical time period.

Latest Trend and Average Trend may be calculated over predetermined time periods. Latest Trend may be calculated over a short predetermined time period for example one hour. Thus the Latest Trend can be computed by subtracting the value of the TACR from the previous hour from the current value of the TACR. Average Trend may be calculated over a longer predetermined time period for example one day or one week by averaging the Latest Trend values for that time period. Thus a trending of zero is neutral.

When Latest Trend is greater than Average Trend the trajectory is determined as upward trending. When Latest Trend is less than Average Trend the trajectory is determined as downward trending.

Trending may be represented in decimal form or as a percentage. For example when half as much content of a content is read than expected the trending trajectory may be represented as 0.5 or 50 when twice as many users read the content as expected the trending trajectory may be represented as 1.0 or 100 .

RSVP trending can produce more relevant results for example in a case where a famous company announces its intention to acquire another company. Many people flock to all of the news stories to learn about the details of the acquisition plans. The news content and pages start with a handful of visitors and the number continues to increase. This results in an increased upward trending trajectory for the content. Even though the news stories do not mention the name of the company more often than old content such as the company home page itself those pages would still rank higher in the search results due to their strongly upward trending trajectory. Furthermore even though the TACR may not be as high for the news content as compared to the company homepage itself the upward increase in TACR may result in a higher rank for the news results.

As another example the initial content rank can be normalized by the RSVP ranking program implementing method for a given content to lie within zero 0 and one 1 . One tenth 0.1 of the content s trending score 0.05 or 0.1 from the examples above and one hundredth 0.01 of the content s TACR score are added to the initial content ranking to obtain the RSVP enriched content ranking for that content.

Accordingly RSVP tracking and trending data can be used to adjust an estimate of how relevant a content is its ranking based on the actual reading of content not just clicks where it is not known if the content has been read and such ranking adjustments can be made in real time. This gives the ranking method described herein an advantage in that it can react quickly to the fluid nature of content on the Internet.

Table 13 shows an example of an initial search ranking result prior to applying enrichment using RSVP content tracking data. Position is the initial position based on the initial rank or raw rank of a search result.

Object ID can be a unique identifier for the object or a permalink directed to the content or a combination of the two. Each object ID is queried against the RSVP tracking and trending database to determine relevant RSVP tracking data.

Table 14 shows how the search result order from Table 13 may be adjusted by applying RSVP content tracking data specifically a normalized TACR value and a TACR trend value as described above.

In this example the RSVP content tracking data is the TACR normalized for all objects and the TACR Trend computed by the formula described above where Latest Trend Average Trend Average Trend where Latest Trend is the most recent value of the trending and Average Trend is the expected average trending over a historical time period. The RSVP Enrichment factor is then computed by the formula described above where one tenth 0.1 of the object s TACR Trend score and one hundredth 0.01 of the object s TACR score. The RSVP Enrichment Factor is then added to the initial Object Rank to obtain the RSVP Enriched Object Rank which is then used to determine the Adjusted Position in the search results. In the example above in Table 14 the object with an Initial Position of 4 has the highest TACR Trend indicating that its TACR is increasing the most of all the objects and corresponding RSVP Enrichment Factor thereby achieving the best Adjusted Position.

As previously described although the above example uses both Normalized TACR and TACR Trend values to obtain an RSPV enrichment factor in particular alternative implementations only the trending information may be used or only the TACR may be used to determine the rank. Also alternative formulas may be used that contain a different combination of both values than the formula set forth above.

The fields variables and tables described above are used as examples for clarity of explanation of the RSVP search result enrichment process and are not limited thereto.

If the RSVP content is sponsored content it may include RSVP sub content that is intended by the sponsor to be selected by the user in what is typically known in the advertising industry as a click through or conversion. An aspect of method may also be used to increase the total number of click throughs by users who are viewing the sponsored RSVP content.

Referring to method may be implemented on a user device such as user device of and one or more server computers such as server of including a database such as DB of . In this embodiment DB stores various tracking data related to tracking content creation and viewing by RSVP server computer or a server to which it is communicatively coupled. Thus process may be distributed across multiple servers and devices.

The steps for tracking RSPV content creation and RSVP content viewing are illustrated in and are not repeated here in the context of . However the selected relevant data fields from the same data structures tables of are shown here in . Specifically the relevant information from DB includes user information e.g. tracking information for the user who has created or viewed RSVP content RSVP content information tracking information for each RSVP content item and its related RSVP sub content items activity information tracking information for each activity by RSVP Detail ID and keyword information e.g. tracking information for each keyword in the RSVP content item by Keyword ID and RSVP Word Number .

Process begins with step which uses the data stored in DB to generate graphs including for example the two graphs plotted for a range of user view sessions of a specific RSVP content item as shown in . The first graph shows the relationship between total sessions in which users are engaged with particular piece of RSPV content and the percentage of words in the RSVP content that have been displayed in those sessions. The second graph plotted shows the relationship between selections of RSPV sub content items and the percentage of words in the RSVP content that have been displayed to users making such selections.

Step uses the returned data from the query of step along with the Total Words of the selected RSVP content obtained from the RSVP Content information to plot a relationship between active sessions see e.g. y1 axis in representing Total Sessions and the relative word position within the content see e.g. x axis in representing RSVP Read which defines the relative word position of a displayed word in the stream of words of the relevant RSVP content the words read percentage in this case in fact being a words displayed by RSPV percentage . Step generates graph of by plotting y1 f x where f x equals the total number of Session IDs of the Session IDs returned from the query for which

Step uses the same returned data from the query of step along with the Total Words of the selected RSVP content to plot a relationship between RSVP Read x axis of and Cumulative Click throughs y2 axis of . Note that although click through is a term generally associated with sponsored content ads the illustrated principles can be applied to enhance selection of sub content items whether the items are sponsored content or non sponsored content. Using the Session IDs obtained from the query of step the presence of any RSVP Sub Content ID associated with the Session ID in activity information indicates that selection of a sub content item occurred in that session in this context such a selection is considered to be a click through . Step generates graph by plotting y2 g x where g x equals the total number of RSVP Sub content IDs related to Session IDs for which

In the illustrated embodiment y1 f x and y2 g x are not plotted for every word. Rather they are only plotted for values of x corresponding to the first word of a sentence and the last word of a sentence. For example graph in shows black rectangles for the y1 data points corresponding to the first word of a sentence and the last word of a sentence. Similarly graph shows black circles for the y2 data points corresponding to the first word of a sentence and the last word of a sentence. Straight lines connect those data points. It can be empirically demonstrated that users are more likely to select to end RSVP display between sentences than mid sentence. Moreover a preferred RSVP implementation inserts short pauses between the last word of one sentence and the first word of a next sentence. Because users are more likely to stop display between sentences than mid sentence it will generally be efficient to determine user drops by only plotting data at the end of one sentence and the beginning of another. However in alternative embodiments graphs may be obtained by plotting data at more frequent intervals such as for example at every word.

Returning to steps identify potential opportunities for improving the amount of RSVP content read. To facilitate this identification a system implementing method displays keywords e.g. On Tour Neon Trees etc. along x axis see at a position corresponding to their location within the RSVP content i.e. using the corresponding RSVP Word Number from keywords sequence information . For example as shown in the keyword On Tour appears four words into the content Neon Trees appears seven words into the content etc. In this example one set of opportunities is identified by identifying the portions of the content associated with the most significant drops in the number of sessions. Identifying opportunities in this way is most relevant for RSPV content that does not have sub content items particularly RSVP content that does not have sponsored sub content items. The drops are visible in for example graph of Total Sessions versus RSVP Read . The line connecting the data points typically drops after each sentence in the RSVP content.

A second set of opportunities particularly applicable to content with sponsored sub content items for which obtaining a click through is particularly important is identified by determining the portions of the content associated with the smallest increases in Cumulative Click throughs. This can be seen for example by analyzing graph . The line connecting the data points typically rises after each sentence in the RSVP content.

In some embodiments at least a portion of step may be performed manually by inspecting graphs generated on a user device screen that is part of a computer system implementing method . For example as shown in visual inspection makes clear that particularly steep drops in Total Sessions occur at drops and . Therefore a content providing user might decide to alter the portion of the content that precedes each drop to determine if more content consuming users can be retained further into the content. Similarly with respect to graph visual inspection shows that only small increases in cumulative click throughs occur at rises and . Therefore a content providing user might decide to alter the portion of the content that immediately precedes each of the smallest rises in click throughs to determine if click throughs can be increased.

Alternatively this portion of step could be performed automatically using an algorithm executed by the computer system. In some cases the locations of the most significant drops on a graph like or the smallest rises on a graph like might not be visually clear on the graph in which case such automation identifying relevant content portions may be useful or necessary. An automated process for identifying drops and ranking is described further below in the context of step

A drop in Total Sessions along graph is not necessarily a negative event in terms of enhancing RSVP content consumption particularly with respect to content that has sponsored sub content items if the reason for the drop is that consuming user s clicked on an RSPV sub content item at a point during consumption of the main RSVP content item corresponding to the drop. Therefore step computes a numerical index with respect to certain drops in Total Sessions and certain rises in Cumulative Click throughs. In this example for each sentence the drop in Total Sessions and the rise in Cumulative Click throughs between that sentence and the next sentence is used. Specifically a computer system used to carry out process computers for each drop in Total Sessions between sentences of the content the following values a Relative Drop weighting the selected drop in Total Sessions against the total number of sessions for that content item and starting within the selected time window a Relative Rise weighting each corresponding rise in Cumulative Click throughs identified as corresponding to the selected drop in Total Sessions i.e. the Cumulative Click through rises are analyzed between the same sentences for which respective corresponding drops are analyzed against the total Cumulative Click throughs for the analyzed sessions and a numerical index defined as the ratio of Relative Drop to Relative Rise. For convenience the numerical index is referenced herein as the Relative Drop Ratio. 

More specifically the Relative Drop is computed from variables defined as follows referencing the axis labels of for ease of explanation TotalSessionsBeforeDrop i.e. the value of y1 just before the drop TotalSessionsAfterDrop i.e. the value of y1 just after the drop and TotalSessionsAtStart i.e. the value of y1 at x 0 which is the total number of sessions selected for analysis based on query see . Relative Drop is then given by the following equation 

The corresponding Relative Rise in Cumulative Click throughs is computed from variables defined as follows referencing again axis labels found in CumulativeClick throughsBeforeRise i.e. the value of y2 just before the rise CumulativeClick throughsAfterRise i.e. the value of y2 just after the rise and CumulativeClick throughsAtEnd i.e. the value of y2 at x 100 which is the total number of click throughs in all the sessions selected for analysis based on query see . Relative Rise is then given by the following equation 

The ratio of Relative Drop to Relative Rise yields a numerical index i.e. the Relative Drop Ratio. For a given drop in total sessions the Relative Drop Ratio is equal to the corresponding Relative Drop divided by the corresponding Relative Rise. To avoid an invalid number in case Relative Rise is zero a minimum value for relative rise can be specified as 1 . All the drops in Total Sessions occurring between the end of one sentence and the start of another can then be ranked in descending order of the value of their Relative Drop Ratios. The process then proceeds to step

Step identifies the keywords closely preceding the top ranked drop identified in step . The following process can be used by a computer performing step Using the RSVP Word Number call it RSVP Word Number for the word immediately preceding the drop identified in attempt a lookup of RSVP Word Numberto determine if it is present in keywords sequence information if yes then return corresponding Keyword Name value see Table 16 showing the relevant relations of data values if the user has not requested to obtain additional keywords then stop if no or if yes but the user has requested additional keywords then decrement n and repeat until the desired quantity of keywords have been returned.

In step the process of improving the RSVP content identified in step or Step is conducted manually by the content creator. In particular embodiments this manual analysis may involve various strategies including modifying repositioning or removing the identified content. Associations may be determined between other keywords or click through options which can guide the analysis.

Step publishes the improved RSVP content and gives it a new RSVP Detail ID that is associated with the RSVP Detail ID of the previous version of the RSVP content in RSVP Content information Previous RSVP Detail ID . As previously described creation of any updated RSVP content is tracked by method which updates RSVP content information and keywords sequence information for the improved RSVP content in DB .

Step generates and displays graphs for the new RSVP content version published in step . Specifically once step publishes the updated content it is tracked is for a range of new user view sessions as previously described in the context of method of . Once sufficient data from new user view sessions related to the new RSVP content version has been obtained then step operates to generate graphs for a range of new user sessions in the same manner that step generated graphs for a range of user sessions viewing the prior RSVP content version. as described further below shows an example of graphs generated for improved versions of the RSVP content associated with the graphs in . The new graphs can if desired be displayed together with the graphs for the prior versions of the content. Such compared graph displays are shown and described in the context of . This makes possible measuring for example the increase in Total Sessions and or Cumulative Click throughs at various points in the new RSVP content version as compared to the previous version.

As indicated above in the context of the search result rankings generated by method of depend in part on Words Read values. Therefore aside from the independent benefits of potentially increasing reader retention implementing method with respect to particular content can potentially also increase a search result ranking for that content when method is applied to search results that include that content.

The above text is presented to a user using RSVP which is illustrated and described in previous figures including for example as well as in many other previous figures. Also examples of presenting selectable sub content item representations designated as click through options along with a primary RSVP content item are shown in . In the primary example on which the data from is based it is assumed that when RSVP display stops either because the end of the text has been reach or because a user interface action stops the RSVP display prior to the end of the text selectable representations linking to sub content are displayed to the user. Presenting sub content selection options after the RSVP has stopped running is preferable in some respects because then sub content representations do not distract the user s eye from reading the main RSVP content while it is running. However in alternative embodiments sub content selection options can be presented before during and or after the main RSVP content has displayed.

In the example used to generate the data of after RSVP display of the above text ends or is stopped by the user the words homepage win backstage passes and tickets are presented to the user as selectable options representing links to sub content. The word homepage is linked to the band s homepage url www.maroon5.com and the phrases win back stage passes and tickets are linked to the ticket service promotion s url www.vipnation.com backstagepasses. The linked sub content may for purposes of counting click throughs be RSVP content or other content however in a preferred embodiment the sub content includes at least some content that is presented via RSPV.

The data in graph represented by square data points connected with a solid line shows the amount of users who have read a certain amount of the RSVP content. Approximately 940 000 users started reading the RSVP content. As shown approximately 50 000 users stopped reading after 5 of the RSVP content has been displayed. The significant drops of the graph appear at the end of sentences. Users are more likely to stop reading at these points than in mid sentence because the users have consumed a concluded i.e. somewhat self contained amount of content furthermore in some embodiments RSVP display pauses slightly after each sentence.

The data in graph represented by circular data points connected with a dashed line shows the total number of click through options selected across the analyzed user sessions Cumulative Click throughs . Graph rises while graph showing total active user sessions viewing the main RSVP content item drops. This is expected because in this particular example selection of a click through option stops RSVP display of the main RSVP content item. When the horizontal x axis reaches 100 graph ends. The amount of users at this point represents the users who have read the complete RSVP content. Although the RSVP content item has fully displayed the users still have the option of selecting click through options. Therefore the last rise segment of graph has a purely vertical direction i.e. infinite slope .

Display also shows keywords along x axis . In display keywords include keywords from the example of Table 15 shown with their corresponding RSVP Word Number at the position along axis that corresponds to the percentage of words displayed when the first word of the particular keyword is displayed. Combined consideration of graph and keywords provides a way to identify how many users have read what part of the RSVP content.

Following the process in steps of as previously described the best opportunities to improve the RSVP content of the example can be identified from analyzing graphs and of display . The RSVP content in this particular example is sponsored content so a primary objective is to increase the total number of Cumulative Click throughs. Using the process described above in the context of a Relative Drop Ratio can be computed for each clearly identifiable drop Total Session shown by graph of . As shown graph has identifiable drops including drops and . The data for each drop is shown in Table 17 including the Drop ID the drawing reference numbers for each drop are used as the Drop ID for ease of explanation Total Sessions before Drop and Total Sessions after Drop. The Drop Amount and Relative Drop values are computed according to the formula described above in the context of step . As shown graph has identifiable rises including rises and . The data for each of these rises in Cumulative Click throughs is also shown in Table 17 including the Rise ID the drawing reference numbers for each rise are used as the Rise ID for ease of explanation . The Rise Amount which is the Cumulative Click through value after the rise minus the Cumulative Click through value before the rise and Relative Rise value as well as the Relative Drop Ratio are computed according to the formula described above in the context of step . The Relative Drop Ratio is computed by dividing Relative Drop by Relative Rise.

In Table 17 it is evident that the two drops with the highest Relative Drop Ratio values are drop and drop . According to Step the keywords in the example that are associated with i.e. in the sentence prior to drop are on tour and Neon Trees found in the first sentence of the RSVP content and the keywords associated with drop are more stops found in the third sentence of the RSVP content .

As previously described step for improving the RSVP content is conducted by manually by the content creator. In this example the manual analysis includes modifying and repositioning content at the beginning of the content item including the content associated with the drops and e.g. the first and third sentences which immediately precede those drops. Associations between other keywords and the click through options can also guide the analysis. For example the keywords homepage tickets and win backstage passes are also used after RSVP display stops to represent the click through options homepage is linked to www.maroon5.com and win backstage passes and tickets are linked to www.vipnation.com backstagepasses . A rewritten version can place language more closely associated with the click through options near the beginning of the passage. Such a modification can improve the likelihood that if a user does stop reading early the user will select the click through options that are presented when RSVP stops.

As previously described the improved RSVP content is published according to Step . Table 18 shows the RSVP content information in DB for the improved RSVP content example.
