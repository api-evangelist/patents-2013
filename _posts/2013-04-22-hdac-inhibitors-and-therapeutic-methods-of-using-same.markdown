This invention was made with government support under grant number R01 AG022941 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the HDAC inhibitors to methods of increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and or chemotherapy comprising contacting the cell with one or more of the HDAC inhibitors and to therapeutic methods of treating conditions and diseases wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit for example a cancer an inflammation a neurological disease a neurodegenerative disorder stroke traumatic brain injury allograft rejection autoimmune diseases and malaria comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a present HDAC inhibitor to an individual in need thereof.

Inhibitors of HDACs modulate transcription and induce cell growth arrest differentiation and apoptosis. HDAC inhibitors HDACIs also enhance the cytotoxic effects of therapeutic agents used in cancer treatment including radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover recent research indicates that transcriptional dysregulation may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington s disease spinal muscular atrophy amyotropic lateral sclerosis and ischemia. For example suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA has been shown to penetrate into the brain to dramatically improve motor impairment in a mouse model of Huntington s disease thereby validating research directed to HDACIs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

A recent review summarized evidence that aberrant histone acetyltransferase HAT and HDAC activity may be a common underlying mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover from a mouse model of depression the therapeutic potential of HDACs in treating depression is discussed. See WO 2008 019025 designating the United States incorporated herein in its entirety.

Eleven isozymes in the HDAC family of enzymes which can be grouped into classes by their evolutionary relationships have been identified. Structure and function appear to be conserved among members of the various classes. The HDAC family is made up of class I HDACs including HDAC1 2 3 and 8 class IIa including HDAC4 5 7 and 9 class IIb including HDAC6 and 10 and a class IV enzyme HDAC11 A. J. de Ruijter et al. 2003 370 Pt 737 749 .

The class I HDACs are found primarily in the nucleus and are expressed in all tissue types except for the muscle cell specific HDAC8. The class I HDACs interact with many key transcription factors regulating gene expression including CoREST and NuRD. Class IIa HDACs have tissue specific expression and are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Unlike the other isozymes the class IIb HDAC6 does not extensively associate with transcription factors and acts as a deacetylase on non histone proteins including tubulin and HSP90 O. Witt et al. 2008 .

HDACs form multiprotein complexes with many regulatory proteins inside the cell. For example HDAC4 5 and 7 actually lack intrinsic deacetylase ability and gain activity only by interacting with HDAC3. Each isozyme interacts with a specific series of regulatory proteins and transcription factors and has a specific set of substrates and thus each regulates a specific series of genes and proteins O. Witt et al. 2008 . The design of selective HDAC isozyme inhibitors allows preferential inhibition of only the isozyme s relevant to a particular disease or condition thereby reducing the probability of counterproductive and or adverse effects resulting from an unwanted and undesired inhibition of other HDAC isozymes.

HDAC6 is the most abundant histone deacetylase isozyme in the human body and along with HDAC7 is the most commonly expressed isozyme in the brain A. J. de Ruijter et al. 2003 370 Pt 737 749 . HDAC6 is unique in that it does not form multiprotein complexes. Structurally significant features of HDAC6 include two deacetylase domains and a zinc finger motif. It is most commonly found in the cytoplasm but can be shuttled into the nucleus via its nuclear export signal. A cytoplasmic retention signal which sequesters the enzyme in the cytoplasm also was found A. Valenzuela Fernandez et al. 2008 18 6 291 297 . The functions of HDAC6 are unlike any of the other HDAC isozymes. Many non histone substrates are deacetylated by HDAC6 including tubulin HSP90 cortactin and peroxiredoxins O. Witt et al. 2008 R. B. Parmigiani et al. 2008 105 28 9633 9638 .

The design of HDACIs focuses on the three major domains of the enzyme molecule. A zinc binding group ZBG of the HDACI typically is a hydroxamic acid benzamide or thiol although other functional groups have been used. This ZBG moiety of the inhibitor chelates the zinc cofactor found in the active site of the enzyme. The ZBG moiety typically is bonded to a lipophilic linker group which occupies a narrow channel leading from the HDAC surface to the active site. This linker in turn is bonded to a surface recognition or cap moiety which typically is an aromatic group that interacts with residues at the surface of the enzyme K. V. Butler et al. 2008 14 6 505 528 .

Currently at least eleven HDACIs are in clinical development. These HDACIs can be divided into at least five chemical classes illustrated below based on their structure and in most cases they broadly and nonselectively inhibit class I II HDACs with varying efficiency. These five chemical classes are hydroxamates cyclic tetrapeptides cyclic peptides short chain fatty acids and benzamides. Typically known HDACIs fail to show prominent HDAC isozyme selectivity which as stated above can cause serious problems in a clinical setting especially in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein a prolonged drug administration of an HDACI is required. For example it has been found that some HDACIs enhance lung and microglial inflammation TSA and SAHA as well as high glucose induced inflammation. If this effect is linked to specific HDAC isozymes the use of certain HDACIs would be contraindicated in various diseases and conditions such as diabetes and asthma.

HDAC regulated factors have been implicated in the mechanisms of major central nervous system CNS disorders. In Parkinson s disease PD synuclein binds to histones and inhibits HAT activity causing neurodegeneration. Application of HDACIs to PD neurons blocks synuclein toxicity. Dysregulation of histone acetylation involving CBP a neuroprotective transcription factor with histone acetyltransferase activity has been found in Huntington s disease HD Alzheimer s disease AD and Rubinstein Taybi syndrome T. Abel et al. 2008 8 1 57 64 . In a cellular model of AD cell death was accompanied by loss of CBP function and histone deacetylation. The mutant HD protein htt interacts with CBP inhibiting the HAT activity and causing cell death. Treatment with an HDACI helps to restore histone acetylation protecting against neurodegeneration and improving motor performance in a mouse model of HD C. Rouaux et al. 2004 68 6 1157 1164 .

Various studies directed to the application of HDACIs in the context of CNS disorders have implicated the class II HDACs particularly HDAC6 as potential therapeutic targets. One investigation revealed that inhibition of HDAC6 could be beneficial as a treatment for HD a disease for which no pharmacological treatment is available. The mutant htt protein found in HD disrupts intracellular transport of the pro survival and pro growth nerve factor BDNF along the microtubule network causing neuronal toxicity. Inhibition of HDAC6 promotes transport of BDNF by promoting tubulin hyperacetylation. TSA trichostatin A a nonselective HDAC inhibitor was found to facilitate transport and release of BNDF containing vesicles J. P. Dompierre et al. 2007 27 13 3571 3583 . These results provide a biological basis for the identification and development of HDACIs and particularly HDAC6 selective inhibitors as a treatment for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

HDACIs prevent or delay neuronal dysfunction and death in in vitro and in vivo models thereby indicating that HDACIs are broadly neuroprotective. For example HDACIs have shown therapeutic efficacy in the polyglutamine expansion disorder Huntington s disease. While the neuroprotective mechanisms of the HDACIs in rodent models are not yet understood it is clear that HDACIs induce the expression of certain genes that confer neuroprotection. The upregulation of HSP 70 and Bcl 2 through the inhibition of HDAC has been observed in the cortex and striatum of rats after focal cerebral ischemia. HSP 70 expression has been found to result in neuroprotection in a number of disease models including Alzheimer s disease AD Parkinson s disease PD and Huntington s disease HD .

Studies also provide good evidence that HDACI induced p21cip1 waf1 expression may play a significant role in HDACI mediated neuroprotection. It recently was reported that p21cip1 waf1 overexpression protects neurons from oxidative stress induced death that p21cip1 waf1 is induced in the rodent brain by HDAC inhibition and that homozygous loss of p21cip1 waf1 exacerbates damage in a mouse MCAO reperfusion model of ischemic stroke. In a similar study the HDAC inhibitor TSA was shown to increase gelsolin expression in neurons and that gelsolin expression is necessary for neuroprotection in an oxygen glucose deprivation model of neurodegeneration and a mouse MCAO reperfusion model of ischemic stroke.

Alternatively unrelated to histone acetylation and gene upregulation proteins such as alpha tubulin and HSP90 are targets for acetylation and become acetylated when HDACs are inhibited. In tumor cells the acetylation of HSP90 has been shown to decrease HSP90 ability to interact with certain client proteins and thereby abrogate chaperone function. With regard to stroke and traumatic brain injury TBI as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases the inhibition of HSP90 is predicted to have a positive effect on neuronal survival. Indeed the pharmacological HSP90 inhibitor Geldanamycin and its analogs have been shown to be neuroprotective in a number of stroke models. HSP90 inhibition and the consequent release of heat shock factor HSF to the nucleus may also in part explain an upregulation of HSP70 in the brain during focal ischemia and HDACI treatment.

In addition HDACIs are useful in the treatment of cancers. For example histone acetylation and deacetylation play important roles in chromatin folding and maintenance Kornberg et al. Bjorklund et al. 1999 96 759 767 Struhl et al. 1998 94 1 4 . Acetylated chromatin is more open and has been implicated in the increased radiation sensitivities observed in some cell types Oleinick et al. 1994 66 523 529 . Furthermore certain radiation resistant human cancer cells treated with the HDACI inhibitor TSA were sensitized to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Thus HDACIs appear useful as radiation sensitizing agents.

WO 2008 055068 designating the U.S. and incorporated herein in its entirety discloses numerous diseases and conditions treatable by HDACIs including the underlying science and reasoning supporting such treatments.

HDAC6 therefore has emerged as an attractive target for drug development and research. C. M. Grozinger et al. 1999 96 4868 73 and C. Boyault et al. 2007 26 5468 76. Presently HDAC6 inhibition is believed to offer potential therapies for autoimmunity cancer and many neurodegenerative conditions. S. Minucci et al. 2006 6 38 51 L. Wang et al. 2009 8 969 81 J. P. Dompierre et al. 2007 27 3571 83 and A. G. Kazantsev et al. 2008 7 854 68. Selective inhibition of HDAC6 by small molecule or genetic tools has been demonstrated to promote survival and re growth of neurons following injury offering the possibility for pharmacological intervention in both CNS injury and neurodegenerative conditions. M. A. Rivieccio et al. 2009 106 19599 604. Unlike other histone deacetylases inhibition of HDAC6 does not appear to be associated with any toxicity making it an excellent drug target. O. Witt et al. 2009 277 8 21. Tubacin an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and used in models of disease has helped to validate in part HDAC6 as a drug target but its non drug like structure high lipophilicity ClogP 6.36 KOWWIN and tedious synthesis make it more useful as a research tool than a drug. S. Haggarty et al. 2003 100 4389 94. Other compounds also have a modest preference for inhibiting HDAC6. S. Schafer et al. 2009 4 283 90 Y. Itoh et al. 2007 50 5425 38 and S. Manku et al. 2009 19 1866 70. 

In summary extensive evidence supports a therapeutic role for HDACIs in the treatment of a variety of conditions and diseases such as cancers and CNS diseases and degenerations. However despite exhibiting overall beneficial effects like beneficial neuroprotective effects for example HDACIs known to date have little specificity with regard to HDAC inhibition and therefore inhibit all zinc dependent histone deacetylases. It is still unknown which is the salient HDACI s that mediate s neuroprotection when inhibited. Emerging evidence suggests that at least some of the HDAC isozymes are absolutely required for the maintenance and survival of neurons e.g. HDAC1. Additionally adverse side effect issues have been noted with nonspecific HDAC inhibition. Thus the clinical efficacy of present day nonspecific HDACIs for stroke neurodegenerative disorders neurological diseases and other diseases and conditions ultimately may be limited. It is important therefore to design synthesize and test compounds capable of serving as potent and preferably isozyme selective HDACIs that are able to ameliorate the effects of neurological disease neurodegenerative disorder traumatic brain injury cancer inflammation malaria autoimmune diseases immunosuppressive therapy and other conditions and diseases mediated by HDACs.

An important advance in the art would be the discovery of HDACIs and particularly selective HDAC6 inhibitors that are useful in the treatment of diseases wherein HDAC inhibition provides a benefit such as cancers neurological diseases traumatic brain injury neurodegenerative disorders stroke malaria allograft rejection rheumatoid arthritis and inflammations. Accordingly a significant need exists in the art for efficacious compounds compositions and methods useful in the treatment of such diseases alone or in conjunction with other therapies used to treat these diseases and conditions. The present invention is directed to meeting this need.

The present invention relates to HDACIs pharmaceutical compositions comprising the HDACIs and methods of treating diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit such as a cancer a neurological disease a neurodegenerative disorder stroke an inflammation traumatic brain injury rheumatoid arthritis allograft rejection autoimmune diseases and malaria comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI to an individual in need thereof. The present invention also relates to a method of increasing the sensitivity of a cancer cell to radiotherapy and or chemotherapy. In some embodiments the present HDACIs exhibit selectivity for particular HDAC isozymes such as HDAC6 over other HDAC isozymes.

In another embodiment the present invention provides a method of treating a condition or disease by administering a therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI of structural formula I to an individual in need thereof. The disease or condition of interest is treatable by inhibition of HDAC for example a cancer a neurodegenerative disorder a traumatic brain injury a neurological disease an inflammation stroke an autoimmune disease allograft rejection and malaria.

The present HDACIs contain a bidentate chelate as the ZBG. Preferably a present HDACI contains a relatively short linker group between the ZBG and the aromatic surface recognition group e.g. contains a 0 to 5 carbon atom chain. The aromatic surface recognition group is a tricyclic moiety such as carbazole i.e. 

It has been found that a degree of isoform selectivity for an HDACI can be achieved by manipulating the surface recognition group in concert with the ZBG. In particular a combination of steric and electronic properties of the surface recognition group modulates the ability of the compounds to target different isoforms via interactions with an HDAC surface. Such considerations led to the present HDACIs having a carbazole type surface recognition group that exhibits selectivity in the inhibition of HDAC6.

These and other novel aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.

The present invention is directed to novel HDACIs and their use in therapeutic treatments of for example cancers inflammations traumatic brain injuries neurodegenerative disorders neurological diseases strokes autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and malaria. The present HDACIs also increase the sensitivity of a cancer cell to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and or chemotherapy.

The present invention is described in connection with preferred embodiments. However it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. It is understood that given the description of the embodiments of the invention herein various modifications can be made by a person skilled in the art. Such modifications are encompassed by the claims below.

The term a disease or condition wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit pertains to a condition in which HDAC and or the action of HDAC is important or necessary e.g. for the onset progress expression of that disease or condition or a disease or a condition which is known to be treated by an HDAC inhibitor such as e.g. TSA pivalolyloxymethylbutane AN 9 Pivanex FK 228 Depsipeptide PXD 101 NVP LAQ824 SAHA MS 275 and or MGCD0103 . Examples of such conditions include but are not limited to cancer psoriasis fibroproliferative disorders e.g. liver fibrosis smooth muscle proliferative disorders e.g. atherosclerosis restenosis neurodegenerative diseases e.g. Alzheimer s Parkinson s Huntington s chorea amyotropic lateral sclerosis spino cerebellar degeneration inflammatory diseases e.g. osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis diseases involving angiogenesis e.g. cancer rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis diabetic retinopathy hematopoietic disorders e.g. anemia sickle cell anemia thalasseimia fungal infections parasitic infections e.g. malaria trypanosomiasis helminthiasis protozoal infections bacterial infections viral infections and conditions treatable by immune modulation e.g. multiple sclerosis autoimmune diabetes lupus atopic dermatitis allergies asthma allergic rhinitis inflammatory bowel disease and for improving grafting of transplants . One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether a compound treats a disease or condition mediated by HDAC for any particular cell type for example by assays which conveniently can be used to assess the activity of particular compounds.

The term second therapeutic agent refers to a therapeutic agent different from an HDACI of structural formula I and that is known to treat the disease or condition of interest. For example when a cancer is the disease or condition of interest the second therapeutic agent can be a known chemotherapeutic drug like taxol or radiation for example.

The term HDAC refers to a family of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from a protein for example the amino groups of lysine residues at the N terminus of a histone. The HDAC is a human HDAC including HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC3 HDAC4 HDAC5 HDAC6 HDAC7 HDAC8 HDAC9 HDAC10 and HDAC11. The HDAC also can be derived from a protozoal or fungal source.

As used herein the terms treat treating treatment and the like refer to eliminating reducing relieving reversing and or ameliorating a disease or condition and or symptoms associated therewith. Although not precluded treating a disease or condition does not require that the disease condition or symptoms associated therewith be completely eliminated including the treatment of acute or chronic signs symptoms and or malfunctions. As used herein the terms treat treating treatment and the like may include prophylactic treatment which refers to reducing the probability of redeveloping a disease or condition or of a recurrence of a previously controlled disease or condition in a subject who does not have but is at risk of or is susceptible to redeveloping a disease or condition or a recurrence of the disease or condition treatment therefore also includes relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis. The term treat and synonyms contemplate administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to an individual in need of such treatment. A treatment can be orientated symptomatically for example to suppress symptoms. It can be effected over a short period be oriented over a medium term or can be a long term treatment for example within the context of a maintenance therapy.

The term therapeutically effective amount or effective dose as used herein refers to an amount of the active ingredient s that when administered is are sufficient to efficaciously deliver the active ingredient s for the treatment of condition or disease of interest to an individual in need thereof. In the case of a cancer or other proliferation disorder the therapeutically effective amount of the agent may reduce i.e. retard to some extent and preferably stop unwanted cellular proliferation reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. retard to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. retard to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth reduce HDAC signaling in the target cells and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To extent the administered compound or composition prevents growth and or kills existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic.

The term container means any receptacle and closure therefor suitable for storing shipping dispensing and or handling a pharmaceutical product.

The term insert means information accompanying a pharmaceutical product that provides a description of how to administer the product along with the safety and efficacy data required to allow the physician pharmacist and patient to make an informed decision regarding use of the product. The package insert generally is regarded as the label for a pharmaceutical product.

 Concurrent administration administered in combination simultaneous administration and similar phrases mean that two or more agents are administered concurrently to the subject being treated. By concurrently it is meant that each agent is administered either simultaneously or sequentially in any order at different points in time. However if not administered simultaneously it is meant that they are administered to an individual in a sequence and sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect and can act in concert. For example an HDACI of structural formula I can be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time as a second therapeutic agent. A present HDACI and the second therapeutic agent can be administered separately in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. When a present HDACI and the second therapeutic agent are not administered concurrently it is understood that they can be administered in any order to a subject in need thereof. For example a present HDACI can be administered prior to e.g. 5 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours 96 hours 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks 8 weeks or 12 weeks before concomitantly with or subsequent to e.g. 5 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours 96 hours 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks 8 weeks or 12 weeks after the administration of a second therapeutic agent treatment modality e.g. radiotherapy to an individual in need thereof. In various embodiments an HDACI of structural formula I and the second therapeutic agent are administered 1 minute apart 10 minutes apart 30 minutes apart less than 1 hour apart 1 hour apart 1 hour to 2 hours apart 2 hours to 3 hours apart 3 hours to 4 hours apart 4 hours to 5 hours apart 5 hours to 6 hours apart 6 hours to 7 hours apart 7 hours to 8 hours apart 8 hours to 9 hours apart 9 hours to 10 hours apart 10 hours to 11 hours apart 11 hours to 12 hours apart no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In one embodiment the components of the combination therapies are administered at 1 minute to 24 hours apart.

The effectiveness or potency of an HDACI of structural formula I with respect to inhibiting the activity of an HDAC is measured by an ICvalue. The quantitative ICvalue indicates the concentration of a particular compound that is needed to inhibit the activity of an enzyme by 50 in vitro. Stated alternatively the ICvalue is the half maximal 50 inhibitory concentration of a compound tested using a specific enzyme e.g. HDAC of interest. The smaller the ICvalue the more potent the inhibiting action of the compound because a lower concentration of the compound is needed to inhibit enzyme activity by 50 .

In preferred embodiments a present HDACI inhibits HDAC enzymatic activity by about at least 50 preferably at least about 75 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 .

Compounds of the present invention were tested for ICvalues against both HDAC6 and HDAC1. In some embodiments a present compound also was tested against HDAC1 2 3 4 5 8 10 and 11. The tested compounds showed a range of ICvalues vs. HDAC6 of about 1 nm to greater than 30 m and a range of ICvalue vs. HDAC1 of about 91 nm to greater than 30 m. Therefore in some embodiments an HDAC of structural formula I is a selective HDAC6 inhibitor which because of a low affinity for other HDAC isozymes e.g. HDAC1 give rise to fewer side effects than compounds that are non selective HDAC inhibitors.

In some embodiments the present HDACIs interact with and reduce the activity of all histone deacetylases in a cell. In some preferred embodiments the present HDACIs interact with and reduce the activity of fewer than all histone deacetylases in the cell. In certain preferred embodiments the present HDACIs interact with and reduce the activity of one histone deacetylase e.g. HDAC 6 but do not substantially interact with or reduce the activities of other histone deacetylases e.g. HDAC 1 HDAC 2 HDAC 3 HDAC 4 HDAC 5 HDAC 7 HDAC 8 HDAC 9 HDAC 10 and HDAC 11 .

The present invention therefore provides HDACIs of structural formula I for the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC has a beneficial effect. Preferably a compound of structural formula I is selective for HDAC6 over the other HDAC isozymes by a factor of at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 20 at least 50 at least 100 at least 500 at least 1000 at least 2000 at least 3000 and preferably up to about 4000. For example in various embodiments an HDACI of structural formula I exhibits an ICvalue versus HDAC6 that is about 350 or about 1000 times less than the ICvalue vs. HDAC1 i.e. a selectivity ratio HDAC1 IC HDAC6 IC of about 350 or about 1000.

Other assays also showed a selectivity of a present compound for HDAC6 over HDAC1 2 3 4 5 8 10 and 11 of about 1000.

The HDAC1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 assays used isolated recombinant human protein HDAC3 NcoR2 complex was used for the HDAC3 assay. Substrate for HDAC1 2 3 6 10 and 11 assays is a fluorogenic peptide from p53 residues 379 382 RHKKAc substrate for HDAC8 is fluorogenic diacyl peptide based on residues 379 382 of p53 RHKK . Acetyl Lys trifluoroacetyl AMC substrate was used for HDAC4 5 7 and 9 assays. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and tested in 10 dose ICmode with 3 fold serial dilution starting at 30 M. Control Compound Trichostatin A TSA was tested in a 10 dose ICwith 3 fold serial dilution starting at 5 ICvalues were extracted by curve fitting the dose response slopes. Assays were performed in duplicate and ICvalues are an average of data from both experiments.

HDAC Activity Assays HDAC assay is performed using fluorescently labeled acetylated substrate which comprises an acetylated lysine side chain. After incubation with HDAC deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate such that in a second step treatment with the detection enzyme produces a fluorophore. HDACs 1 and 6 were expressed as full length fusion proteins. Purified proteins were incubated with 50 M fluorescently labeled acetylated peptide substrate and test compound for 2 hours at room temperature in HDAC assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 137 mM NaCl 2.7 mM KCl 1 mM MgCl 1 DMSO and 1 BSA.

Reactions were terminated by the addition of the Developer after 2 hours and the development of fluorescence signal which was relative to the amount of deacetylated peptide was monitored by time course measurement of EnVision PerkinElmer . The HDAC activity was estimated from the slope of time course measurement of the fluorescence intensity. The slope of no enzyme control substrate alone was served as background and Enzyme activity was calculated using background subtracted slope of no inhibitor control DMSO as 100 activity.

To date HDACIs have demonstrated a relatively non specific inhibition of various HDAC isozymes. Most HDACI so far identified primarily inhibit HDAC 1 2 3 and 8 producing an antiproliferative phenotype which is useful for oncology applications but not for the many non oncology applications of HDACIs. K. B. Glaser et al 2003 310 529 36. The potential toxicities associated with the inhibition of certain HDAC isozymes can lead to additional difficulties for the clinical development of pan HDAC i.e. nonselective HDAC inhibitors. Because the network of cellular effects mediated by acetylation is so vast and because inhibition of some HDAC isozymes may lead to undesirable side effects HDAC isozyme selective inhibitors hold a greater therapeutic promise than their nonselective counterparts.

As illustrated below many HDACIs of the present invention exhibit selective inhibition of HDAC6 compared to other HDAC isozymes.

Data are shown as ICvalues in M standard deviation. Values are the mean of two experiments except TSA which is a mean of 9 experiments. Compounds were tested in duplicate in a 10 dose ICmode with 3 fold serial dilution starting from 30 M solutions. ICvalues were extracted by curve fitting the dose response slopes. TSA was used as an internal standard.

Assays values are an average of two experiments. ISOX was previously found to have a low picomolar ICat HDAC6. When ISOX was tested in these assays an HDAC6 ICvalue of 2.4 nM was observed. After investigating the source of this discrepancy it was found that lack of a detergent Triton X100 in the original assay caused the anomalously high activity.

Compound 6 demonstrates excellent HDAC6 potency and selectivity with an ICof 14 nM at HDAC6 and an about 1000 fold selectivity against HDAC1. Compound 7 demonstrated even greater potency and selectivity with an ICof 1.4 nM at HDAC6 and 3700 fold selectivity against HDAC 1. Compounds 5 7 exhibited greatly enhanced activity and selectivity compared to compounds 1 4. It is theorized but not relied upon that the tolyl linker imparts a bent conformation which forces tighter interactions between the tricycle and the catalytic channel rim giving a greater response to structural changes made to the tricycle. It is further theorized but not relied upon that the enhanced selectivity of the carboline derivatives also may result from the presence of the N methyl group because this substituent further expands the dimensions of the cap group thus further favoring interactions with HDAC6.

The present HDACIs were compared to other compounds reported to be highly selective for HDAC6. Tubacin was found to potently inhibit HDAC6 with an ICvalue of 4 nM and 350 fold selectivity over HDAC1. Compounds 6 and 7 are far more selective for HDAC6 than any other compounds reported in literature. Compounds 6 and 7 also possess properties making them useful drug products e.g. ClogP 2.41 KOWWIN and tPSA 57 for both compounds 6 and 7 AlogPs water solubility 45.2 mg l for compound 6 and 43.7 g l for compound 7. The tertiary amine group of the compounds can be used to form pharmaceutically useful salts thus facilitating compound solubilization. Furthermore their facile three step syntheses allow easy scale up for in vivo studies.

Compound 6 was profiled against all 11 HDAC isozymes to investigate its ability to induce tubulin acetylation in cells as well as to profile its neuroprotective action in a cell model of oxidative stress. Tubacin also was tested at all 11 HDAC isoforms Table 2 . Compound 6 was substantially more selective than Tubacin at all isozymes except HDAC8 and maintained over 1000 fold selectivity against all isoforms excluding HDAC8 where it displayed 58 fold selectivity. The moderate activity of compound 6 at HDAC8 may be the product of a known conformational change that occurs upon binding to HDAC8 which dilates the catalytic pocket to better accommodate the bulky tricyclic group.

In one embodiment the present invention relates to a method of treating an individual suffering from a disease or condition wherein inhibition of HDACs provides a benefit comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula I to an individual in need thereof.

The methods described herein relate to the use of an HDACI of structural formula I and an optional second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit. The methods of the present invention can be accomplished by administering an HDACI of structural formula I as the neat compound or as a pharmaceutical composition. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition or neat HDACI of structural formula I can be performed during or after the onset of the disease or condition of interest. Typically the pharmaceutical compositions are sterile and contain no toxic carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds that would cause an adverse reaction when administered.

In many embodiments an HDACI of structural formula I is administered in conjunction with a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of a disease or condition wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit. The second therapeutic agent is different from the HDACI of structural formula I . An HDACI of structural formula I and the second therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. In addition an HDACI of structural formula I and second therapeutic agent can be administered from a single composition or two separate compositions. An HDACI of structural formula I and the second therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially to achieve the desired effect.

The second therapeutic agent is administered in an amount to provide its desired therapeutic effect. The effective dosage range for each second therapeutic agent is known in the art and the second therapeutic agent is administered to an individual in need thereof within such established ranges.

The present invention therefore is directed to compositions and methods of treating diseases or conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit. The present invention also is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an HDACI of structural formula I and an optional second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit. Further provided are kits comprising an HDACI of structural formula I and optionally a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit packaged separately or together and an insert having instructions for using these active agents.

An HDACI of structural formula I and the second therapeutic agent can be administered together as a single unit dose or separately as multi unit doses wherein the an HDACI of structural formula I is administered before the second therapeutic agent or vice versa. One or more dose of an HDACI of structural formula I and or one or more dose of the second therapeutic agent can be administered. The HDACIs of structural formula I therefore can be used in conjunction with one or more second therapeutic agents for example but not limited to anticancer agents.

Within the meaning of the present invention the term disease or condition denotes disturbances and or anomalies that as a rule are regarded as being pathological conditions or functions and that can manifest themselves in the form of particular signs symptoms and or malfunctions. As demonstrated below an HDACI of structural formula I is a potent inhibitor of HDAC and can be used in treating diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit for example cancer a neurological disease a neurodegenerative condition traumatic brain injury stroke an inflammation an autoimmune disease autism and malaria.

In one embodiment the invention provides a method for treating cancer comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an amount of an HDACI of structural formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof sufficient to treat the cancer. An HDACI of structural formula I can be used as the sole anticancer agent or in combination with another anticancer treatment e.g. radiation chemotherapy and surgery.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for increasing the sensitivity of a cancer cell to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and or chemotherapy comprising contacting the cell with an HDACI of structural formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount sufficient to increase the sensitivity of the cell to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and or chemotherapy.

In a further embodiment the present invention provides a method for treating cancer comprising a administering to an individual in need thereof an amount of a compound of structural formula I and b administering to the individual an amount of radiotherapy chemotherapy or both. The amounts administered are each effective to treat cancer. In another embodiment the amounts are together effective to treat cancer.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for treating cancer said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of an HDACI of structural formula I effective to treat cancer.

This combination therapy of the invention can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of various cancers. In a specific embodiment the individual in need of treatment has previously undergone treatment for cancer. Such previous treatments include but are not limited to prior chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery or immunotherapy such as cancer vaccines.

In another embodiment the cancer being treated is a cancer which has demonstrated sensitivity to radiotherapy and or chemotherapy or is known to be responsive to radiotherapy and or chemotherapy. Such cancers include but are not limited to non Hodgkin s lymphoma Hodgkin s disease Ewing s sarcoma testicular cancer prostate cancer ovarian cancer bladder cancer larynx cancer cervical cancer nasopharynx cancer breast cancer colon cancer pancreatic cancer head and neck cancer esophageal cancer rectal cancer small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer brain tumors or other CNS neoplasms.

In still another embodiment the cancer being treated has demonstrated resistance to radiotherapy and or chemotherapy or is known to be refractory to radiotherapy and or chemotherapy. A cancer is refractory to a therapy when at least some significant portion of the cancer cells are not killed or their cell division is not arrested in response to therapy. Such a determination can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells using the art accepted meanings of refractory in such a context. In a specific embodiment a cancer is refractory where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced or has increased.

Other cancers that can be treated with the compounds and methods of the invention include but are not limited to cancers and metastases selected from the group consisting of solid tumors including but not limited to fibrosarcoma myxosarcoma liposarcoma chondrosarcoma osteogenic sarcoma chordoma angiosarcoma endotheliosarcoma lymphangiosarcoma lymphangioendotheliosarcoma synovioma mesothelioma Ewing s tumor leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma colon cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer pancreatic cancer bone cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer esophageal cancer stomach cancer oral cancer nasal cancer throat cancer squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma sweat gland carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma papillary carcinoma papillary adenocarcinomas cystadenocarcinoma medullary carcinoma bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell carcinoma hepatoma bile duct carcinoma choriocarcinoma seminoma embryonal carcinoma Wilms tumor cervical cancer uterine cancer testicular cancer small cell lung carcinoma bladder carcinoma lung cancer epithelial carcinoma glioma glioblastoma multiforma astrocytoma medulloblastoma craniopharyngioma ependymoma pinealoma hemangioblastoma acoustic neuroma oligodendroglioma meningioma skin cancer melanoma neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma blood borne cancers including but not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute lymphoblastic B cell leukemia acute lymphoblastic T cell leukemia acute myeloblastic leukemia acute promyelocytic leukemia acute monoblastic leukemia acute erythroleukemic leukemia acute megakaryoblastic leukemia acute myclomonocytic leukemia acute nonlymphocyctic leukemia acute undifferentiated leukemia chronic myclocytic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia hairy cell leukemia and multiple myeloma acute and chronic leukemias lymphoblastic myelogenous lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemias lymphomas Hodgkin s disease and non Hodgkin s lymphoma multiple myeloma Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia heavy chain disease and polycythemia vera.

The HDACIs of structural formula I can also be administered to prevent progression to a neoplastic or malignant state including but not limited to the cancers listed above. Such prophylactic use is indicated in conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer in particular where non neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia metaplasia or most particularly dysplasia has occurred for review of such abnormal growth conditions see Robbins and Angell 19762d Ed. W.B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia pp. 68 79 . Hyperplasia is a form of controlled cell proliferation involving an increase in cell number in a tissue or organ without significant alteration in structure or function. For example endometrial hyperplasia often precedes endometrial cancer and precancerous colon polyps often transform into cancerous lesions. Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell. Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells. A typical metaplasia involves a somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium. Dysplasia is frequently a forerunner of cancer and is found mainly in the epithelia it is the most disorderly form of non neoplastic cell growth involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in the architectural orientation of cells. Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large deeply stained nuclei and exhibit pleomorphism. Dysplasia characteristically occurs where chronic irritation or inflammation exists and often is found in the cervix respiratory passages oral cavity and gall bladder.

Alternatively or in addition to the presence of abnormal cell growth characterized as hyperplasia metaplasia or dysplasia the presence of one or more characteristics of a transformed phenotype or of a malignant phenotype displayed in vivo or displayed in vitro by a cell sample from a subject can indicate the desirability of prophylactic therapeutic administration of the composition of the invention. Such characteristics of a transformed phenotype include for example morphology changes looser substratum attachment loss of contact inhibition loss of anchorage dependence protease release increased sugar transport decreased serum requirement expression of fetal antigens disappearance of the 250 000 dalton cell surface protein.

In a specific embodiment leukoplakia a benign appearing hyperplastic or dysplastic lesion of the epithelium or Bowen s disease a carcinoma in situ are pre neoplastic lesions indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention.

In another embodiment fibrocystic disease cystic hyperplasia mammary dysplasia particularly adenosis benign epithelial hyperplasia is indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention.

The prophylactic use of the compounds and methods of the present invention are also indicated in some viral infections that may lead to cancer. For example human papilloma virus can lead to cervical cancer see e.g. Hernandez Avila et al. 1997 28 265 271 Epstein Barr virus EBV can lead to lymphoma see e.g. Herrmann et al. 2003 199 2 140 5 hepatitis B or C virus can lead to liver carcinoma see e.g. El Serag 2002 35 5 Suppl 2 S72 8 human T cell leukemia virus HTLV I can lead to T cell leukemia see e.g. Mortreux et al. 2003 17 1 26 38 human herpesvirus 8 infection can lead to Kaposi s sarcoma see e.g. Kadow et al. 2002 3 11 1574 9 and Human Immune deficiency Virus HIV infection contribute to cancer development as a consequence of immunodeficiency see e.g. Dal Maso et al. 2003 4 2 110 9 .

In other embodiments a subject exhibiting one or more of the following predisposing factors for malignancy can be treated by administration of the HDACIs and methods of the invention a chromosomal translocation associated with a malignancy e.g. the Philadelphia chromosome for chronic myelogenous leukemia t 14 18 for follicular lymphoma etc. familial polyposis or Gardner s syndrome possible forerunners of colon cancer benign monoclonal gammopathy a possible forerunner of multiple myeloma a first degree kinship with persons having a cancer or procancerous disease showing a Mendelian genetic inheritance pattern e.g. familial polyposis of the colon Gardner s syndrome hereditary exostosis polyendocrine adenomatosis medullary thyroid carcinoma with amyloid production and pheochromocytoma Peutz Jeghers syndrome neurofibromatosis of Von Recklinghausen retinoblastoma carotid body tumor cutaneous melanocarcinoma intraocular melanocarcinoma xeroderma pigmentosum ataxia telangiectasia Chediak Higashi syndrome albinism Fanconi s aplastic anemia and Bloom s syndrome see Robbins and Angell 19762d Ed. W.B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia pp. 112 113 etc. and exposure to carcinogens e.g. smoking and inhalation of or contacting with certain chemicals .

In another specific embodiment the HDACIs and methods of the invention are administered to a human subject to prevent progression to breast colon ovarian or cervical cancer.

In one embodiment the invention provides methods for treating cancer comprising a administering to an individual in need thereof an amount of an HDACI of structural formula I and b administering to the individual one or more additional anticancer treatment modality including but not limited to radiotherapy chemotherapy surgery or immunotherapy such as a cancer vaccine. In one embodiment the administering of step a is prior to the administering of step b . In another embodiment the administering of step a is subsequent to the administering of step b . In still another embodiment the administering of step a is concurrent with the administering of step b .

In one embodiment the additional anticancer treatment modality is radiotherapy and or chemotherapy. In another embodiment the additional anticancer treatment modality is surgery.

In still another embodiment the additional anticancer treatment modality is immunotherapy such as cancer vaccines.

In one embodiment an HDACI of structural formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered adjunctively with the additional anticancer treatment modality.

In a preferred embodiment the additional anticancer treatment modality is radiotherapy. In the methods of the present invention any radiotherapy protocol can be used depending upon the type of cancer to be treated. Embodiments of the present invention employ electromagnetic radiation of gamma radiation 10to 10m X ray radiation 10to 10m ultraviolet light 10 nm to 400 nm visible light 400 nm to 700 nm infrared radiation 700 nm to 1 mm and microwave radiation 1 mm to 30 cm .

For example but not by way of limitation X ray radiation can be administered in particular high energy megavoltage radiation of greater that 1 MeV energy can be used for deep tumors and electron beam and orthovoltage X ray radiation can be used for skin cancers. Gamma ray emitting radioisotopes such as radioactive isotopes of radium cobalt and other elements can also be administered. Illustrative radiotherapy protocols useful in the present invention include but are not limited to stereotactic methods where multiple sources of low dose radiation are simultaneously focused into a tissue volume from multiple angles internal radiotherapy such as brachytherapy interstitial irradiation and intracavitary irradiation which involves the placement of radioactive implants directly in a tumor or other target tissue intraoperative irradiation in which a large dose of external radiation is directed at the target tissue which is exposed during surgery and particle beam radiotherapy which involves the use of fast moving subatomic particles to treat localized cancers.

Many cancer treatment protocols currently employ radiosensitizers activated by electromagnetic radiation e.g. X rays. Examples of X ray activated radiosensitizers include but are not limited to metronidazole misonidazole desmethylmisonidazole pimonidazole etanidazole nimorazole mitomycin C RSU 1069 SR 4233 EO9 RB 6145 nicotinamide 5 bromodeoxyuridine BUdR 5 iododeoxyuridine IUdR bromodeoxycytidine fluorodeoxyuridine FUdR hydroxyurea cis platin and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.

Photodynamic therapy PDT of cancers employs visible light as the radiation activator of the sensitizing agent. Examples of photodynamic radiosensitizers include the following but are not limited to hematoporphyrin derivatives PHOTOFRIN benzoporphyrin derivatives NPe6 tin etioporphyrin SnET2 pheoborbide a bacteriochlorophyll a naphthalocyanines phthalocyanines zinc phthalocyanine and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.

Radiosensitizers can be administered in conjunction with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds in addition to a present HDACI such compounds including but not limited to compounds that promote the incorporation of radiosensitizers to the target cells compounds that control the flow of therapeutics nutrients and or oxygen to the target cells chemotherapeutic agents that act on the tumor with or without additional radiation or other therapeutically effective compounds for treating cancer or other disease. Examples of additional therapeutic agents that can be used in conjunction with radiosensitizers include but are not limited to 5 fluorouracil 5 FU leucovorin oxygen carbogen red cell transfusions perfluorocarbons e.g. FLUOSOLW DA 2 3 DPG BW12C calcium channel blockers pentoxifylline antiangiogenesis compounds hydralazine and L BSO.

In a preferred embodiment an HDACI of structural formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered prior to the administration of radiotherapy and or chemotherapy.

In another preferred embodiment an HDACI of structural formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered adjunctively with radiotherapy and or chemotherapy.

An HDACI of structural formula I and additional treatment modalities can act additively or synergistically i.e. the combination of an HDACI of structural formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an additional anticancer treatment modality is more effective than their additive effects when each are administered alone . A synergistic combination permits the use of lower dosages of an HDACI of structural formula I and or the additional treatment modality and or less frequent administration of an HDACI of structural formula I and or additional treatment modality to a subject with cancer. The ability to utilize lower dosages of an HDACI of structural formula I and or an additional treatment modality and or to administer a compound of the invention and the additional treatment modality less frequently can reduce the toxicity associated with the administration without reducing the efficacy of an HDACI of structural formula I and or the additional treatment modality in the treatment of cancer. In addition a synergistic effect can result in the improved efficacy of the treatment of cancer and or the reduction of adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the administration of an HDACI of structural formula I and or an additional anticancer treatment modality as monotherapy.

In one embodiment the HDACIs of structural formula I may act synergistically with radiotherapy when administered in doses typically employed when such HDACIs are used alone for the treatment of cancer. In another embodiment the HDACIs of structural formula I may act synergistically with radiotherapy when administered in doses that are less than doses typically employed when such HDACIs are used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer.

In one embodiment radiotherapy may act synergistically with an HDACI of structural formula I when administered in doses typically employed when radiotherapy is used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In another embodiment radiotherapy may act synergistically with a compound of the invention when administered in doses that are less than doses typically employed when radiotherapy is used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer.

The effectiveness of the HDACIs of structural formula I as HDAC inhibitors for sensitizing cancer cells to the effect of radiotherapy can be determined by the in vitro and or in vivo determination of post treatment survival using techniques known in the art. In one embodiment for in vitro determinations exponentially growing cells can be exposed to known doses of radiation and the survival of the cells monitored. Irradiated cells are plated and cultured for about 14 about 21 days and the colonies are stained. The surviving fraction is the number of colonies divided by the plating efficiency of unirradiated cells. Graphing the surviving fraction on a log scale versus the absorbed dose on a linear scale generates a survival curve. Survival curves generally show an exponential decrease in the fraction of surviving cells at higher radiation doses after an initial shoulder region in which the dose is sublethal. A similar protocol can be used for chemical agents when used in the combination therapies of the invention.

Inherent radiosensitivity of tumor cells and environmental influences such as hypoxia and host immunity can be further assessed by in vivo studies. The growth delay assay is commonly used. This assay measures the time interval required for a tumor exposed to radiation to regrow to a specified volume. The dose required to control about 50 of tumors is determined by the TCD50 assay.

In vivo assay systems typically use transplantable solid tumor systems in experimental subjects. Radiation survival parameters for normal tissues as well as for tumors can be assayed using in vivo methods known in the art.

The present invention provides methods of treating cancers comprising the administration of an effective amount of an HDACI of structural formula I in conjunction with recognized methods of surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapies including for example chemical based mimics of radiotherapy whereby a synergistic enhancement of the effectiveness of the recognized therapy is achieved. The effectiveness of a treatment can be measured in clinical studies or in model systems such as a tumor model in mice or cell culture sensitivity assays.

The present invention provides combination therapies that result in improved effectiveness and or reduced toxicity. Accordingly in one aspect the invention relates to the use of the HDACIs of structural formula I as radiosensitizers in conjunction with radiotherapy.

When the combination therapy of the invention comprises administering an HDACI of structural formula I with one or more additional anticancer agents the HDACI of structural formula I and the additional anticancer agents can be administered concurrently or sequentially to an individual. The agents can also be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of one or more anticancer agents for a period of time followed by the administration of one or more different anticancer agents for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration i.e. the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the anticancer agents of being administered to avoid or reduce the side effects of one or more of the anticancer agents being administered and or to improve the efficacy of the treatment.

An additional anticancer agent may be administered over a series of sessions anyone or a combination of the additional anticancer agents listed below may be administered.

The present invention includes methods for treating cancer comprising administering to an individual in need thereof an HDACI of structural formula I and one or more additional anticancer agents or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. An HDACI of structural formula I and the additional anticancer agent can act additively or synergistically.

It is a further aspect of the invention that the HDACIs of structural formula I can be administered in conjunction with chemical agents that are understood to mimic the effects of radiotherapy and or that function by direct contact with DNA. Preferred agents for use in combination with the HDACIs of structural formula I for treating cancer include but are not limited to cis diamminedichloro platinum II cisplatin doxorubicin 5 fluorouracil taxol and topoisomerase inhibitors such as etoposide teniposide irinotecan and topotecan.

Additionally the invention provides methods of treatment of cancer using the HDACIs of structural formula I as an alternative to chemotherapy alone or radiotherapy alone where the chemotherapy or the radiotherapy has proven or can prove too toxic e.g. results in unacceptable or unbearable side effects for the subject being treated. The individual being treated can optionally be treated with another anticancer treatment modality such as chemotherapy surgery or immunotherapy depending on which treatment is found to be acceptable or bearable.

The HDACIs of structural formula I can also be used in an in vitro or ex vivo fashion such as for the treatment of certain cancers including but not limited to leukemias and lymphomas such treatment involving autologous stem cell transplants. This can involve a multi step process in which the subject s autologous hematopoietic stem cells are harvested and purged of all cancer cells the subject is then administered an amount of an HDACI of structural formula I effective to eradicate the subject s remaining bone marrow cell population then the stem cell graft is infused back into the subject. Supportive care then is provided while bone marrow function is restored and the subject recovers.

The present methods for treating cancer can further comprise the administration of an HDACI of structural formula I and an additional therapeutic agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof. In one embodiment a composition comprising an HDACI of structural formula I is administered concurrently with the administration of one or more additional therapeutic agent s which may be part of the same composition or in a different composition from that comprising the HDACI of structural formula I . In another embodiment an HDACI of structural formula I is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent s .

In the present methods for treating cancer the other therapeutic agent may be an antiemetic agent. Suitable antiemetic agents include but are not limited to metoclopromide domperidone prochlorperazine promethazine chlorpromazine trimethobenzamide ondansetron granisetron hydroxyzine acethylleucine monoethanolamine alizapride azasetron benzquinamide bietanautine bromopride buclizine clebopride cyclizine dimenhydrinate diphenidol dolasetron meclizine methallatal metopimazine nabilone oxyperndyl pipamazine scopolamine sulpiride tetrahydrocannabinols thiethylperazine thioproperazine and tropisetron.

In a preferred embodiment the antiemetic agent is granisetron or ondansetron. In another embodiment the other therapeutic agent may be an hematopoietic colony stimulating factor. Suitable hematopoietic colony stimulating factors include but are not limited to filgrastim sargramostim molgramostim and epoietin alfa.

In still another embodiment the other therapeutic agent may be an opioid or non opioid analgesic agent. Suitable opioid analgesic agents include but are not limited to morphine heroin hydromorphone hydrocodone oxymorphone oxycodone metopon apomorphine normorphine etorphine buprenorphine meperidine lopermide anileridine ethoheptazine piminidine betaprodine diphenoxylate fentanil sufentanil alfentanil remifentanil levorphanol dextromethorphan phenazocine pentazocine cyclazocine methadone isomethadone and propoxyphene. Suitable non opioid analgesic agents include but are not limited to aspirin celecoxib rofecoxib diclofinac diflusinal etodolac fenoprofen flurbiprofen ibuprofen ketoprofen indomethacin ketorolac meclofenamate mefanamic acid nabumetone naproxen piroxicam and sulindac.

In still another embodiment the other therapeutic agent may be an anxiolytic agent. Suitable anxiolytic agents include but are not limited to buspirene and benzodiazepines such as diazepam lorazepam oxazapam chlorazepate clonazepam chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam.

In addition to treating cancers and sensitizing a cancer cell to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy the HDACIs of the present invention are used in methods of treating diseases conditions and injuries to the central nervous system such as neurological diseases neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic brain injuries TBIs . In preferred embodiments a present HDACI is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier to inhibit HDAC in the brain of the individual.

It has been shown that HDAC6 inhibition protects against neuronal degeneration and stimulates neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion neurons therefore indicating methods of treating CNS diseases. Accordingly compound 6 was examined in a model of oxidative stress induced by homocysteic acid HCA . This model leads to depletion of glutathione the major intracellular antioxidant. HDAC6 inhibition rescues neuronal death in this model possibly by causing hyperacetylation of peroxiredoxins. Previous work reported that nonselective hydroxamic acid HDACIs displayed considerable toxicity to the primary cortical neurons. A. P. Kozikowski et al. 2007 50 3054 61. 

In the HCA induced neurodegeneration assays TSA was moderately neuroprotective at 0.5 M although protection declined at higher concentrations due to dose dependant neurotoxicity . Compound 6 displayed dose dependent protection against HCA induced neuronal cell death starting at 5 M with near complete protection at 10 M . This compares well with published results showing that Tubacin induces tubulin acetylation at 5 M and protects prostate cancer LNCaP cells from hydrogen peroxide induced death at 8 M via peroxiredoxin acetylation. R. B. Parmigiani et al. 2008 105 9633 8. Importantly when tested alone at all of the concentrations shown compound 6 exhibited no toxicity indicating that neurotoxicity is likely a product of class I HDAC inhibition and not a property inherent to hydroxamic acids. Compound 6 is the first neuroprotective hydroxamic acid based HDACI that does not cause neuronal death when tested alone in the HCA model. These results demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition provides a method for treating neurodegenerative conditions.

The data summarized in was obtained according to the following neuroprotective assay. Primary cortical neuron cultures were obtained from the cerebral cortex of fetal Sprague Dawley rats embryonic day 17 . All experiments were initiated 24 hours after plating. Under these conditions the cells are not susceptible to glutamate mediated excitotoxicity. For cytotoxicity studies cells were rinsed with warm PBS then placed in minimum essential medium Invitrogen containing 5.5 g liter glucose 10 fetal calf serum 2 mM L glutamine and 100 M cystine. Oxidative stress was induced by the addition of the glutamate analog homocysteate HCA 5 mM to the media. HCA was diluted from 100 fold concentrated solutions that were adjusted to pH 7.5. In combination with HCA neurons were treated with either TSA or compound 6 at the indicated concentrations. Viability was assessed after 24 hours by the MTT assay 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide method.

Compound 6 also was found to ameliorate associative memory following A elevation. In this test mice were infused with A 42 via cannulas implanted into dorsal hippocampus 15 minutes prior to training. Compound 6 was dosed ip 25 mg kg 2 hours before training. Fear learning was assessed 24 hours later.

Contextual fear conditioning performed 24 hours after training showed a reduction of freezing in A infused mice compared to vehicle infused mice . Treatment with compound 6 ameliorates deficit in freezing responses in A infused mice and has no effect in vehicle infused mice . Compound 6 alone did not affect the memory performance of the mice. In addition treatment had no effects on motor sensorial or motivational skills assessed using the visible platform test in which compound 6 was injected twice a day for two days. During these experiments no signs of overt toxicity including changes in food and liquid intake weight loss or changes in locomotion and exploratory behavior were observed.

These results demonstrate that the HDACIs of the present invention are beneficial against impairment of associative memory following A elevation.

The HDACIs of structural formula I therefore are useful for treating a neurological disease by administration of amounts of an HDACI of structural formula I effective to treat the neurological disease or by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising amounts of an HDACI of structural formula I effective to treat the neurological disease. The neurological diseases that can be treated include but are not limited to Huntington s disease lupus schizophrenia multiple sclerosis muscular dystrophy dentatorubralpallidoluysian atrophy DRRLA spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA and fine spinocerebellar ataxias SCA1 SCA2 SCA3 MJD Machado Joseph Disease SCA6 and SCA7 drug induced movement disorders Creutzfeldt Jakob disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Pick s disease Alzheimer s disease Lewy body dementia cortico basal degeneration dystonia myoclonus Tourette s syndrome tremor chorea restless leg syndrome Parkinson s disease Parkinsonian syndromes anxiety depression psychosis manic depression Friedreich s ataxia Fragile X syndrome spinal muscular dystrophy Rett syndrome Rubinstein Taybi syndrome Wilson s disease and multi infarct state.

In a preferred embodiment the neurological disease treated is Huntington s disease Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease spinal muscular atrophy lupus or schizophrenia.

A present HDACI also can be used with a second therapeutic agent in methods of treating conditions diseases and injuries to the CNS. Such second therapeutic agents are those drugs known in the art to treat a particular condition diseases or injury for example but not limited to lithium in the treatment of mood disorders estradiol benzoate and nicotinamide in the treatment of Huntington s disease.

The present HDACIs also are useful in the treatment of TBIs. Traumatic brain injury TBI is a serious and complex injury that occurs in approximately 1.4 million people each year in the United States. TBI is associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms and disabilities including a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease.

TBI produces a number of pathologies including axonal injury cell death contusions and inflammation. The inflammatory cascade is characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and activation of microglia which can exacerbate other pathologies. Although the role of inflammation in TBI is well established no efficacious anti inflammatory therapies are currently available for the treatment of TBI.

Several known HDAC inhibitors have been found to be protective in different cellular and animal models of acute and chronic neurodegenerative injury and disease for example Alzheimer s disease ischemic stroke multiple sclerosis MS Huntington s disease HD amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS spinal muscular atrophy SMA and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA . A recent study in experimental pediatric TBI reported a decrease in hippocampal CA3 histone H3 acetylation lasting hours to days after injury. These changes were attributed to documented upstream excitotoxic and stress cascades associated with TBI. HDACIs also have been reported to have anti inflammatory actions acting through acetylation of non histone proteins. The HDAC6 selective inhibitor 4 dimethylamino N 5 2 mercaptoacetylamino pentyl benzamide DMA PB was found to be able to increase histone H3 acetylation and reduce microglia inflammatory response following traumatic brain injury in rats which demonstrates the utility of HDACIs as therapeutics for inhibiting neuroinflammation associated with TBI.

The present HDACIs therefore also are useful in the treatment of inflammation and strokes and in the treatment of autism. The present HDACIs further can be used to treat parasitic infections e.g. malaria toxoplasmosis trypanosomiasis helminthiasis protozoal infections see Andrews et al. 2000 30 6 761 768 .

In certain embodiments the compound of the invention can be used to treat malaria. A present HDACI can be co administered with an antimalarial compound selected from the group consisting of aryl amino alcohols cinchona alkaloids 4 aminoquinolines type 1 or type 2 folate synthesis inhibitors 8 aminoquinolines antimicrobials peroxides naphthoquinones and iron chelating agents. The antimalarial compound can be but is not limited to quinine quinidine mefloquine halfantrine chloroquine amodiaquine proguanil chloroproquanil pyrimethamine primaquine 8 4 amino 1 methylbutyl amino 2 6 dimethoxy 4 methyl 5 3 trifluoromethyl phenoxy quinoline succinate WR238 605 tetracycline doxycycline clindamycin azithromycin fluoroquinolones artemether areether artesunate artelinic acid atovaquone and deferrioxamine. In a preferred embodiment the antimalarial compound is chloroquine.

The present HDACIs also can be used as imaging agents. In particular by providing a radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled HDACI of structural formula I the labeled compound can image HDACs tissues expressing HDACIs and tumors. Labeled HDACIs of structural formula I also can image patients suffering from a cancer or other HDAC mediated diseases e.g. stroke by administration of an effective amount of the labeled compound or a composition containing the labeled compound. In preferred embodiments the labeled HDACI is capable of emitting positron radiation and is suitable for use in positron emission tomography PET . Typically a labeled HDACI of structural formula I is used to identify areas of tissues or targets that express high concentrations of HDACs. The extent of accumulation of labeled HDACI can be quantified using known methods for quantifying radioactive emissions.

HDACIs of structural formula I useful in the imaging methods contain one or more radioisotopes capable of emitting one or more forms of radiation suitable for detection by any standard radiology equipment such as PET SPECT gamma cameras MRI and similar apparatus. Preferred isotopes including tritium H and carbon C . Substituted HDACIs of structural formula I also can contain isotopes of fluorine F and iodine I for imaging methods. Typically a labeled HDACI of structural formula I contains an alkyl group having a C label i.e. a C methyl group or an alkyl group substituted with F I I I or a combination thereof.

Fluorescently labeled HDACIs of structural formula I also can be used in the imaging method of the present invention. Such compounds have an FITC or carbocyamine moiety.

The labeled HDACIs and methods of use can be in vivo and particularly on humans and for in vitro applications such as diagnostic and research applications using body fluids and cell samples. The imaging methods using a labeled HDACI of structural formula I are discussed in WO 03 060523 designating the U.S. and incorporated in its entirety herein. Typically the method comprises contacting cells or tissues with a radiolabeled compound of structural formula I and making a radiographic image i.e. a sufficient amount to provide about 1 to about 30 mCi of the radiolabeled compound.

Preferred imaging methods include the use of labeled HDACIs of structural formula I which are capable of generating at least a 2 1 target to background ratio of radiation intensity or more preferably about a 5 1 about 10 1 or about 15 1 ratio of radiation intensity between target and background.

In preferred methods the labeled HDACIs of structural formula I are excreted from tissues of the body quickly to prevent prolonged exposure to the radiation of the radiolabeled compound administered to the individual. Typically labeled HDACIs of structural formula I are eliminated from the body in less than about 24 hours. More preferably labeled HDACIs are eliminated from the body in less than about 16 hours 12 hours 8 hours 6 hours 4 hours 2 hours 90 minutes or 60 minutes. Typically preferred labeled HDACIs are eliminated in about 60 to about 120 minutes.

The HDACIs of structural formula I also are useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and inflammations. Compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in overcoming graft and transplant rejections and in treating forms of arthritis.

Despite successes of modern transplant programs the nephrotoxicity cardiovascular disease diabetes and hyperlipidemia associated with current therapeutic regimens plus the incidence of post transplant malignancies and graft loss from chronic rejection drive efforts to achieve long term allograft function in association with minimal immunosuppression. Likewise the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease IBD including Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis is increasing. Animal studies have shown that T regulatory cells Tregs expressing the forkhead transcription family member Foxp3 are key to limiting autoreactive and alloreactive immunity. Moreover after their induction by sostimulation blockade immunosuppression or other strategies Tregs may be adoptively transferred to na ve hosts to achieve beneficial therapeutic effects. However attempts to develop sufficient Tregs that maintain their suppressive functions post transfer in clinical trials have failed. Murine studies show that HDACIs limit immune responses at least in significant part by increasing Treg suppressive functions R. Tao et al. 13 1299 1307 2007 . and that selective targeting of HDAC6 is especially efficacious in this regard.

With organ transplantation rejection begins to develop in the days immediately post transplant such that prevention rather than treatment of rejection is a paramount consideration. The reverse applies in autoimmunity wherein a patient presents with the disease already causing problems. Accordingly HDAC6 mice treated for 14 days with low dose RPM rapamycin are assessed for displaying signs of tolerance induction and resistance to the development of chronic rejection a continuing major loss of graft function long term in the clinical transplant population. Tolerance is assessed by testing whether mice with long surviving allografts reject a subsequent third party cardiac graft and accept additional donor allografts without any immunosuppression as can occur using a non selective HDACI plus RPM. These in vivo studies are accompanied by assessment of ELISPOT and MLR activities using recipient lymphocytes challenged with donor cells. Protection against chronic rejection is assessed by analysis of host anti donor humoral responses and analysis of graft transplant arteriosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in long surviving allograft recipients.

The importance of HDAC6 targeting is assessed in additional transplant models seeking readouts of biochemical significance as is monitored clinically. Thus the effects of HDAC6 in targeting in renal transplant recipients monitoring BUN proteinuria and islet allografts monitoring blood glucose levels are assessed. Renal transplants are the most common organ transplants performed and the kidney performs multiple functions e.g. regulating acid base metabolism blood pressure red cell production such that efficacy in this model indicates the utility of HDAC6 targeting. Likewise islet transplantation is a major unmet need given that clinical islet allografts are typically lost after the first one or two years post transplant. Having a safe and non toxic means to extend islet survival without maintenance CNI therapy would be an important advance. Transplant studies also are strengthened by use of mice with floxed HDAC6. Using existing Foxp3 Cre mice for example the effects of deletion of HDAC6 just in Tregs is tested. This approach can be extended to targeting of HDAC6 in T cells CD4 Cre and dendritic cells CD11c Cre for example. Using tamoxifen regulated Cre the importance of HDAC6 in induction vs. maintenance of transplants with implications for short term vs. maintenance HDAC6I therapy is assessed by administering tamoxifen and inducing HDAC6 deletion at varying periods post transplant.

Studies of autoimmunity also are undertaken. In this case interruption of existing disease is especially important and HDAC6 targeting can be efficacious without any requirement for additional therapy in contrast to a need for brief low dose RPM in the very aggressive fully MHC mismatched transplant models . Studies in mice with colitis indicated that HDAC6 Tregs were more effective than WT Tregs in regulating disease and tubacin was able to rescue mice if treatment was begun once colitis had developed. These studies are extended by assessing whether deletion of HDAC6 in Tregs Foxp3 Cre vs. T cells CD4 Cre vs. DC CD11c Cre differentially affect the development and severity of colitis. Similarly control of colitis is assessed by inducing HDAC6 deletion at varying intervals after the onset of colitis with tamoxifen regulated Cre.

Compound 6 has been shown to enhance murine Treg suppression at a concentration of greater than 100 M. Compound 6 also has been shown to prolong cardiac allograft survival in mice.

Compound 6 further demonstrates anti arthritic efficacy in a collagen induced arthritis model in DBA1 J mice. In this test DBA1 J mice male 7 8 weeks were used with 8 animals per group. Systemic arthritis was induced with bovine collagen type II and CFA plus an IFA booster injection on day 21. Both ENBREL and compound 6 were dosed IP on day 28 for 2 consecutive weeks compound 6 compound only . Compound 6 was dosed at 50 and 100 mg kg. No loss of body weight was observed in either group.

The results are summarized in containing graphs of Average Arthritic Score vs. Days of Treatment. Compound 6 performed as well as ENBREL at 50 mg kg and outperformed ENBREL at 100 mg kg.

Therefore despite efforts to avoid graft rejection through host donor tissue type matching in the majority of transplantation procedures immunosuppressive therapy is critical to the viability of the donor organ in the host. A variety of immunosuppressive agents have been employed in transplantation procedures including azathioprine methotrexate cyclophosphamide FK 506 rapamycin and corticosteroids.

HDACIs of structural formula I are potent immunosuppressive agents that suppress humoral immunity and cell mediated immune reactions such as allograft rejection delayed hypersensitivity experimental allergic encephalomyelitis Freund s adjuvant arthritis and graft versus host disease. HDACIs of the present invention are useful for the prophylaxis of organ rejection subsequent to organ transplantation for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for the treatment of psoriasis and for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes Crohn s disease and lupus.

A therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI of structural formula I can be used for immunosuppression including for example to prevent organ rejection or graft vs. host disease and to treat diseases and conditions in particular autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and conditions. Examples of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases include but are not limited to Hashimoto s thyroiditis pernicious anemia Addison s disease psoriasis diabetes rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus dermatomyositis Sjogren s syndrome dermatomyositis lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis Reiter s syndrome arthritis rheumatoid arthritis arthritis chronic progrediente and arthritis deformans and rheumatic diseases autoimmune hematological disorder hemolytic anaemia aplastic anaemia pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopaenia systemic lupus erythematosus polychondritis sclerodoma Wegener granulamatosis dermatomyositis chronic active hepatitis psoriasis Steven Johnson syndrome idiopathic sprue autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease endocrine opthalmopathy Graves disease sarcoidosis primary biliary cirrhosis juvenile diabetes diabetes mellitus type I uveitis anterior and posterior keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis interstitial lung fibrosis psoriatic arthritis and glomerulonephritis.

An HDACI of structural formula I can be used alone or in conjunction with a second therapeutic agent known to be useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases inflammations transplants and grafts such as cyclosporin rapamycin methotrexate cyclophosphamide azathioprine corticosteroids and similar agents known to persons skilled in the art.

In the present method a therapeutically effective amount of one or more HDACI of structural formula I typically formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical practice is administered to a human being in need thereof. Whether such a treatment is indicated depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment diagnosis that takes into consideration signs symptoms and or malfunctions that are present the risks of developing particular signs symptoms and or malfunctions and other factors.

An HDACI of structural formula I can be administered by any suitable route for example by oral buccal inhalation topical sublingual rectal vaginal intracisternal or intrathecal through lumbar puncture transurethral nasal percutaneous i.e. transdermal or parenteral including intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous intracoronary intradermal intramammary intraperitoneal intraarticular intrathecal retrobulbar intrapulmonary injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site administration. Parenteral administration can be accomplished using a needle and syringe or using a high pressure technique.

Pharmaceutical compositions include those wherein an HDACI of structural formula I is present in a sufficient amount to be administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. The exact formulation route of administration and dosage is determined by an individual physician in view of the diagnosed condition or disease. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide levels of an HDACI of structural formula I that is sufficient to maintain therapeutic effects.

Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds of structural formula I can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index which is expressed as the ratio between LDand ED. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from such data can be used in formulating a dosage range for use in humans. The dosage preferably lies within a range of circulating compound concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.

A therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI of structural formula I required for use in therapy varies with the nature of the condition being treated the length of time that activity is desired and the age and the condition of the patient and ultimately is determined by the attendant physician. Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the HDACI that are sufficient to maintain the desired therapeutic effects. The desired dose conveniently can be administered in a single dose or as multiple doses administered at appropriate intervals for example as one two three four or more subdoses per day. Multiple doses often are desired or required. For example a present HDACI can be administered at a frequency of four doses delivered as one dose per day at four day intervals q4d 4 four doses delivered as one dose per day at three day intervals q3d 4 one dose delivered per day at five day intervals qd 5 one dose per week for three weeks qwk3 five daily doses with two days rest and another five daily doses 5 2 5 or any dose regimen determined to be appropriate for the circumstance.

The dosage of a composition containing an HDACI of structural formula I or a composition containing the same can be from about 1 ng kg to about 200 mg kg about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg or about 1 mg kg to about 50 mg kg of body weight.

The above dosages are exemplary of the average case but there can be individual instances in which higher or lower dosages are merited and such are within the scope of this invention. In practice the physician determines the actual dosing regimen that is most suitable for an individual patient which can vary with the age weight and response of the particular patient.

An HDACI of structural formula I used in a method of the present invention typically is administered in an amount of about 0.005 to about 500 milligrams per dose about 0.05 to about 250 milligrams per dose or about 0.5 to about 100 milligrams per dose. For example an HDACI of structural formula I can be administered per dose in an amount of about 0.005 0.05 0.5 5 10 20 30 40 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 or 500 milligrams including all doses between 0.005 and 500 milligrams.

The HDACIs of the present invention typically are administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention are formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of HDACIs of structural formula I .

The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant or excipient with which an HDACI of structural formula I is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. The carriers can be saline gum acacia gelatin starch paste talc keratin colloidal silica urea and the like. In addition auxiliary stabilizing thickening lubricating and coloring agents can be used. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is a preferred carrier when the HDACI of structural formula I is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The present compositions if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents.

These pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured for example by conventional mixing dissolving granulating dragee making emulsifying encapsulating entrapping or lyophilizing processes. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. When a therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI of structural formula I is administered orally the composition typically is in the form of a tablet capsule powder solution or elixir. When administered in tablet form the composition additionally can contain a solid carrier such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. The tablet capsule and powder contain about 0.01 to about 95 and preferably from about 1 to about 50 of an HDACI of structural formula I . When administered in liquid form a liquid carrier such as water petroleum or oils of animal or plant origin can be added. The liquid form of the composition can further contain physiological saline solution dextrose or other saccharide solutions or glycols. When administered in liquid form the composition contains about 0.1 to about 90 and preferably about 1 to about 50 by weight of a compound of structural formula I .

When a therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI of structural formula I is administered by intravenous cutaneous or subcutaneous injection the composition is in the form of a pyrogen free parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable solutions having due regard to pH isotonicity stability and the like is within the skill in the art. A preferred composition for intravenous cutaneous or subcutaneous injection typically contains an isotonic vehicle. An HDACI of structural formula I can be infused with other fluids over a 10 30 minute span or over several hours.

HDACIs of structural formula I can be readily combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the active agents to be formulated as tablets pills dragees capsules liquids gels syrups slurries suspensions and the like for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding the HDACI of structural formula I to a solid excipient optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable auxiliaries if desired to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include for example fillers and cellulose preparations. If desired disintegrating agents can be added.

An HDACI of structural formula I can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampules or in multidose containers with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending stabilizing and or dispersing agents.

Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active agent in water soluble form. Additionally suspensions of an HDACI of structural formula I can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils or synthetic fatty acid esters. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension. Optionally the suspension also can contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively a present composition can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use.

An HDACI of structural formula I also can be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas e.g. containing conventional suppository bases. In addition to the formulations described previously the HDACI of structural formula I also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection. Thus for example the HDACIs of structural formula I can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins.

In particular the HDACIs of structural formula I can be administered orally buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. Such liquid preparations can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents. The HDACIs of structural formula I also can be injected parenterally for example intravenously intramuscularly subcutaneously or intracoronarily. For parenteral administration the HDACIs are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which can contain other substances for example salts or monosaccharides such as mannitol or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood.
