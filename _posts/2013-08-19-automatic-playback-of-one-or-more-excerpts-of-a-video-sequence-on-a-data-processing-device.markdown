Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

Example embodiments as described below may be used to provide a method a device and or a system of automatic playback of one or more excerpt s of a video sequence on a data processing device. Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments.

In one or more embodiments output data associated with processing through processor may be input to a multimedia processing unit configured to perform encoding decoding associated with the data. In one or more embodiments the output of multimedia processing unit may be rendered on a display unit e.g. a Liquid Crystal Display LCD display a Cathode Ray Tube CRT monitor through a multimedia interface configured to convert data to an appropriate format required by display unit .

It is obvious that an operating system may execute on data processing device . shows operating system as being stored in memory e.g. non volatile memory . In one or more embodiments data processing device may execute a multimedia application e.g. Windows Media Player on processor shows multimedia application as being stored in memory to be executed on processor . In one or more embodiments multimedia application may utilize an Application Programming Interface API of a multimedia framework to be discussed with regard to in order to execute processing associated therewith.

File reader may be configured to enable reading of data e.g. video file multimedia file from a source. Parser e.g. Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG parser Audio Video Interleave AVI parser may parse a stream of the data into constituent parts thereof. Decoder may decode a compressed or an encoded version of the data and renderer may transmit the decoded data to a destination e.g. a rendering device . The rendering process may also include processes such as displaying multimedia on display unit playing an audio file on a soundcard writing the data to a file etc. It is obvious that the aforementioned engines or modules are merely shown for illustrative purposes and that variations therein are within the scope of the exemplary embodiments.

In one or more embodiments user interface may include a slider configured to enable user seek to a point in time within a video sequence associated with video file . shows providing an ability to user to control duration of a trailer of the video sequence associated with video file through user interface . Here user may opt to start the trailer from a fixed point in time of the video sequence and end at a fixed point in time of the video sequence. In other words the trailer may begin at a fixed point in time of the video sequence and may continue for a fixed duration. User may also move slider to begin from a desired point in time. Another possibility shown in may involve the trailer beginning at the fixed point in time of the video sequence and continuing for a random duration e.g. as randomly determined through processor decoder .

Further it is obvious that the trailer may begin at a random point in time e.g. determined through processor decoder of the video sequence and may continue for a random duration thereof. Alternately processor decoder may determine interesting content of the video sequence e.g. based on a key frame of the video sequence and one or more video frames referencing the key frame and may enable rendering of the interesting content for a duration corresponding thereto.

In one or more embodiments once support for the trailer highlights playback discussed above is determined processor e.g. the engines discussed with regard to may execute on processor may start reading video frames of video file from a point in time corresponding to a preference of user . Alternately by default processor may start reading video frames of video file from a point in time corresponding to a beginning of the video sequence associated therewith. In another example embodiment processor may start reading video frames of video file from a point in time randomly determined.

In certain scenarios in accordance with seeking to the point in time corresponding to the start of the trailer processor or decoder may be configured to begin decoding from a key frame closest to the aforementioned point in time as shown in an example reason may be the unavailability of a video frame at the aforementioned point in time. In one or more embodiments the decoding of appropriate video frames may proceed until the point in time corresponding to the end of the trailer. shows a flowchart summarizing the high level operations involved in playing an excerpt or trailer of a video sequence associated with video file according to one or more embodiments. In one or more embodiments operation may involve obtaining through processor a length of the video sequence associated with video file . In one or more embodiments operation may also involve obtaining through processor duration of the excerpt or trailer to be played. In one or more embodiments operation may involve checking through processor as to whether the length of the video sequence is large enough to extract the excerpt based on the duration thereof.

In one or more embodiments if the result of operation is a no operation may involve playing e.g. on user interface the complete video sequence. In one or more embodiments if the result of operation is a yes operation may involve checking as to whether the end of the video sequence is reached. In one or more embodiments if the result of operation is a no operation may involve playing the video sequence for the duration of the excerpt obtained through processor . Else in one or more embodiments video playback may be exited.

It should be noted that the trailer may not be limited to merely playing one excerpt of the video sequence. In one or more other embodiments processor may enable playing of an excerpt followed by seeking to another point in time of the video sequence. Then processor may be configured to play another excerpt of pre determined e.g. user determined or random duration. The number of excerpts may also be pre determined e.g. user determined or randomly determined.

It should be noted that processor or decoder may select an appropriate number of video frame s around the each key frame to provide for an effect of completeness to a partial video sequence associated therewith. In one or more embodiments the decoded each key frame and the one or more video frame s temporally closest thereto may be composited e.g. through processor decoder with one or more other sets of decoded key frames and one or more video frame s temporally closest thereto to form highlights of the video sequence. In one or more embodiments text data audio data e.g. a voice over graphics data and or other video data may be superimposed through processor at appropriate temporal points in time of highlights to provide for completeness thereof. shows text data audio data graphics data and video data as being stored in memory to be appropriately applied onto highlights through processor .

It should be noted that each video frame may have timestamp information shown as being stored in memory thereof available to decoder or processor to convenience seeking to appropriate points in time during generation of the trailer and or compositing video frames together during generation of highlights . Further in one or more embodiments user may be provided the option e.g. through user interface to save the trailer and or highlights of the video sequence into memory .

It is obvious that the engines of multimedia framework may be executed through processor . The driver component or equivalent software thereof discussed above may be stored in memory to be installed on data processing device after for example a download through the Internet. Alternately an external memory may be utilized therefor. Also instructions associated with the driver component may be embodied on a non transitory medium readable through data processing device such as a Compact Disc CD a Digital Video Disc DVD a Blu ray Disc a floppy disk a hard drive and a diskette. The aforementioned instructions may be executable through data processing device .

The sets of instructions associated with the driver component or equivalent software thereof and or the generation of the trailer and or highlights are not limited to specific embodiments discussed above and may for example be implemented in operating system an application program e.g. multimedia application a foreground or a background process a network stack or any combination thereof. Also it is obvious that the trailer highlights playback process may be initiated through a physical button on data processing device a touchscreen option on data processing device a menu option on screen on data processing device etc. Further user may be provided an option to enable disable trailer highlights playback in data processing device . Other variations are within the scope of the exemplary embodiments discussed herein.

Thus exemplary embodiments provide user with a means to obtain a glimpse of a long video sequence through the trailer highlights without manual fast forwarding and or seeking to points in time of the video sequence through user interface . Exemplary embodiments are amenable to implementation at video stores e.g. physical and online and or parlors where user may obtain glimpses of video sequences. Last but not the least exemplary embodiments provide for fun and entertainment value to user through the capability to generate trailers highlights of video sequences.

In one or more embodiments operation may then involve decoding through processor video frames of video file corresponding to the one or more excerpt s and the reference video frames thereof following the automatic reading for rendering thereof on data processing device .

Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments. For example the various devices and modules described herein may be enabled and operated using hardware circuitry firmware software or any combination of hardware firmware and software e.g. embodied in a non transitory machine readable medium . For example the various electrical structures and methods may be embodied using transistors logic gates and electrical circuits e.g. Application Specific Integrated Circuitry ASIC and or Digital Signal Processor DSP circuitry .

In addition it will be appreciated that the various operations processes and methods disclosed herein may be embodied in a non transitory machine readable medium and or a machine accessible medium compatible with a data processing system e.g. data processing device and may be performed in any order e.g. including using means for achieving the various operations .

Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
