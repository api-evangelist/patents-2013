This invention was made in whole or in part with government support under Grant Number U54 AI 57168 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to methods and compositions of preventing infection by PDX virus using compounds that interfere viral DNA replication.

Poxviruses are the largest known animal viruses. They are DNA viruses that replicate entirely in the cytoplasm. The 191 kbp genome is a double stranded DNA molecule whose ends are covalently connected by single stranded hairpin loops of 101 nucleotides. The sequences that form the hairpins are AT rich and lie at the ends of 12 kbp inverted terminal repetition elements that contain short direct repeats and several open reading frames.

Poxviruses infect most vertebrates and invertebrates causing a variety of diseases of veterinary and medical importance. The one large family Poxyiridae has two main subfamilies the chordopoxyirinae which infect vertebrates and the entomopoxyirinae which infect insects. Humans are the sole hosts of two poxviruses variola virus smallpox virus and molluscum contagiosum virus although many members of Orthopoxvirus Parapoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus can infect both animals and humans. Vaccinia virus is the virus used in the variola virus vaccine and it is widely used as a model poxvirus.

At least two variants of variola virus are known and they cause two forms of smallpox variola major with a case fatality rate of 30 40 and variola minor with a much reduced fatality rate of about 1 . At the genome level the two variants are very similar. Thus essentially all of the encoded proteins are nearly identical.

Essential viral enzymes have frequently proven to be good targets for antiviral drugs for example HIV reverse transcriptase and protease .

The E9 DNA polymerase required for DNA replication acts in concert with accessory proteins to attain efficient processive synthesis. Accessory proteins include the A20 protein D4R and others. The viral DNA polymerase is an established drug target as exemplified by azidothymidine AZT which inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase and acyclovir which is efficiently phosphorylated by the herpes simplex virus viral thymidine kinase resulting in a triphosphate that preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerase.

Naturally occurring variola virus has been eradicated from the planet. Given the virulence of this virus and its ability to spread in a population the consequences of an intentional release of variola virus could be devastating. Official stocks of the virus are closely held but it is not known whether undeclared stocks exist so it is difficult to assess the current degree of risk. Safer vaccines and therapeutics that can mitigate the consequences of infection would together provide a strong deterrent to any intentional release.

The rapid mechanistic plate assay a high throughput screening of a chemical library of chemical compounds was used to identify inhibitors of processive DNA synthesis. The vaccinia virus VV E9 DNA polymerase protein and the processive VV proteins A20 and D4R were used as targets for the inhibitors screened.

A template with biotin attached to its 5 end and a primer annealed to its 3 end was bound to the streptavidin coated wells of 96 well plates. The premix solution containing vaccinia cytoplasmic extract and dNTPs with DIG dUTP substituted for dTTP was then added to the wells of the plates. This was followed by the addition of the chemical test compounds. The plates were incubated to enable the DNA synthesis reaction to proceed. Then the reaction was stopped and the incorporation of dNTPs into synthesized DNA was detected by an ELISA reaction that employs anti DIG antibody conjugated to peroxidase.

250 pmol 1.525 g of primer and 250 pmol 8.25 g of biotinylated template were mixed in 0.25 mL PBS pH 7.3 and annealed by heating to 90 C. for 5 minutes followed by cooling to room temperature. Then the annealed primer template P T was diluted to 0.1 M with cold PBS and stored at 20 C.

0.2 pmol of P T 1.22 ng of primer and 6.6 ng of template in 100 L were added to each well of the streptavidin coated plates followed by incubation of the foil covered wells for 90 min at 37 C. or overnight at 4 C.

The P T binding solution was removed from the 96 well plates and 25.2 L of the premix solution was added to each well followed by the addition of the chemical test compound or HO 24.8 L to a final reaction volume of 50 L 2. 3. Then the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 C. for 90 min. For a negative control a separate premix solution was used in which E9 A20 and D4R were absent. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 L of 0.5 M EDTA.

The reaction mixture was removed and wells were washed six times with 200 225 250 275 300 and 325 L of wash buffer.

100 L anti DIG POD working solution final concentration of 200 mU mL in PBS 1 blocking reagent was added followed by incubation at 37 C. for 1 h.

The anti DIG POD working solution was removed followed by washing six times with 200 225 250 275 300 and 325 L of wash buffer.

The ABTS substrate for POD was added to the wells. Color development generally occurred within 5 30 min to produce an OD 405 nm of 0.4 1.0.

The NCI Training and Diversity Set libraries were obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch Developmental Therapeutics Program National Cancer Institute. The Training Set contains 230 anti cancer compounds that are frequently used to confirm the reproducibility of high throughput screening assays. The Diversity Set comprises 1 992 compounds selected from approximately 140 000 compounds using the Chem X program Accelrys San Diego Calif. USA . These compounds represent diversity in terms of three dimensional pharmacophores.

Vaccinia virus polymerase E9 putative processivity factor A20 and UDG D4 proteins were expressed from pcDNA3.2 v5 Invitrogen in vitro using Promega TNT coupled transcription translation system. KSHV DNA polymerase 8 Pol8 and processivity factor 8 PF8 were translated in vitro from pTM1 Pol8 and pTM1 PF8 respectively. To confirm expression an aliquot of the translation reactions were labeled with S methionine fractionated on an SDS 10 polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The vaccinia virus infected cell lysate was prepared according to previously described methods. The WR strain of vaccinia virus a thymidine kinase deficient mutant was used to infect monolayers of BSC 1 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 15. The vaccinia infected cells were incubated at 37 C. for 6 h in the presence of hydroxyurea. The cells were harvested by scraping then pelleted at 500 rpm. The pellet was washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS followed by hypotonic buffer 10 mM Hepes 1.5 nM MgCl 10 mM KCl . After resuspension in hypotonic buffer the cells were Dounce homogenized and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 30 min. The suspension was passed through a 2 micron filter to remove the viral cores and nuclear particles. The vaccinia infected lysate was stored in 80 C. in the presence of 20 glycerol.

A rapid plate DNA synthesis assay was performed using vaccinia infected cell lysate. A 1.2 1 ratio of a 20 mer oligonucleotide primer 5 GCGAATGAATGACCGCTGAC 3 SEQ ID No. 1 and a 5 end biotinylated 100 mer oligonucleotide template 5 Biotin GCACTTATTGCATTCGCTAGTCCACCTT GGATCTCAGGCTATTCGTAGCGAGCTACGCGTACGTTAGCTTCGGTCATCCCGTCAGC GGTCATTCATTGGC 3 SEQ ID No. 2 were heated at 90 C. for 5 min and annealed by gradual cooling to room temperature. The annealed primer template P T was diluted with PBS to a concentration of 10 pmol L. The 96 well microtiter streptavidin coated plates Streptawell plates Roche Applied Science Indianapolis Ind. USA were coated with 5 pmol well of the P T solution and incubated at 37 C. for 90 min. The wells were washed with 100 L PBS. Control DMSO acyclovir prodrug azidothymidine AZT prodrug and ethylenediamine tetracetic acid EDTA and test compounds were individually added to the wells to a final concentration of 167 M. The vaccinia virus used in this primary screen is a thymidine kinase deficient mutant and therefore resistant to AZT and acyclovir prodrugs which require phosphorylation. The 60 L DNA synthesis reaction mixture contained 100 mM NH SO 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 3 mM MgCl 0.1 mM EDTA 0.5 mM DTT 2 glycerol 40 ug mL BSA 5 uM dNTPs 1 uM digoxigenin 11 2 deoxyuridine 5 triphosphate DIG dUTP Roche Applied Science and 1 L vaccinia lysate. The plates were incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. Total DNA synthesis activities were determined by measuring incorporation of DIG dUTP. The activity was quantified by a DIG detection ELISA kit Roche Applied Science using anti digoxigenin peroxidase anti DIG POD and its substrate 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate ABTS and by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm on a microplate reader Tecan Genius Pro Tecan US .

The selectivity screen was used to eliminate general and irrelevant inhibitors of vaccinia DNA synthesis. The microplate assay was optimized for KSHV Pol8 PF8 DNA synthesis. P T solution of 0.2 pmols was added to each well. Each reaction well received control or test compounds and 2 L each of in vitro translated Pol8 and PF8. The reaction time was extended to 1 h at 37 C. The buffer BSA and dNTP conditions used were the same as described for vaccinia vide supra.

Two separate plate assays were used to distinguish polymerase versus processivity inhibitors. For the polymerase inhibition assay a biotinylated primer template 5 GCGAATGAATGACCGCTGAC 3 SEQ ID No. 1 5 Biotin GCACTTATTGCATTCGCTAGTCCACCTTGGATCTCAGGCTATTCGTA GCGAGCTACGCGTACGTTAGCTTCGGTCATCCCGTCAGCGGTCATTCATTGGC 3 SEQ ID No. 2 was designed so that the DIG epitope would be uniformly incorporated throughout the template. The DNA synthesis reaction was performed using a low salt buffer 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 3 mM MgCl 0.1 mM EDTA 0.5 mM DTT and 2 glycerol and 1 L polymerase enzyme E9. For the processivity inhibition assay a second biotinylated primer template 5 GCCAATGAATGACCGCTGAC 3 5 Biotin AGCACTATTGACATTACAGAGTCGCCTTGGCTCTCTGGCTGTTCGTTGCGGGCTCCGCG TGCGTTGGCTTCGGTCGTCCCGTCAGCGGTCATTCATTGGC 3 was designed so that the DIG epitope would be incorporated at the distal end of the template. The plate assay was conducted using a high salt buffer 100 mM NH SO 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 3 mM MgCl 0.1 mM EDTA 0.5 mM DTT 2 glycerol .

One hundred nL of compound or natural extract dissolved in DMSO were transferred from the library plates with 384 pin arrays. Reactions were started by loading 10 L of a 3 reaction mixture. After quick centrifugation plates were incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes. The DNA synthesis reactions were stopped with 30 L of a solution containing 50 mM EDTA and 2 SDS in 10 mM Tris pH8. Incorporation of DIG 11 dUTP in the newly synthesized DNA strand was measured with peroxidase conjugated anti digoxigenin antibody anti DIGPOD . Wells were flow washed with 400 L PBS 0.1 Tween 20 at the lowest dispensing speed and loaded with 4.5 mU of anti DIG POD in 30 L PBS blocking solution. After gently rocking at room temperature for 1 h the antibody solution was removed and wells were flow washed as above.

Throughout the study thymidine kinase TK deficient strain of vaccinia virus provided by Drs. G. Cohen and R. Eisenberg was used to infect BSC 1 cells 34 . Vaccinia virus infected cell lysate was prepared as previously described 16 . Briefly the cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 15. The vaccinia infected cells were incubated at 37 C. for 6 h in the presence of hydroxyurea then harvested by scraping and pelleted at 500 rpm. The pellet was washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS followed by hypotonic buffer 10 mM Hepes 1.5 mM MgCl 10 mM KCl . The cells were then Dounce homogenized and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 30 min. The cell suspension was passed through a 2 micron filter to remove the viral cores and nuclear particles. At this point the vaccinia infected cytoplasmic lysate was stored in 80 C. in the presence of 20 glycerol. Vaccinia E9 A20 and D4 proteins were translated in vitro as previously described 34 . The proteins were expressed from pcDNA3.2 v5 Invitrogen in vitro using Promega TNT coupled transcription translation system. The translation reactions were labeled with S methionine fractionated on 10 SDS PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

A rapid plate DNA synthesis assay 19 was performed using optimized conditions. Briefly a 1.2 1 ratio of a 20 mer oligonucleotide primer 5 GCGAATGAATGACCGCTGAC 3 SEQ ID No. 1 and a 5 end biotinylated 100 mer oligonucleotide template 5 Biotin AGCACTATTGACATTACAGAGTCGCCTTGGCTCTCTGGCTGTTCGTTGCGGGCTCCGCG TGCGTTGGCTTCGGTCGTCCCGTCAGCGGTCATTCATTGGC 3 were annealed and loaded into a 96 well microtiter streptavidin coated plate Streptawell plates Roche Applied Science Indianapolis Ind. USA at 5 pmol well. The wells were incubated at 37 C for 90 min and washed with 100 L PBS.

The plates were read at an absorbance of 405 nm on a microplate reader Tecan Genius Pro Tecan US .

African green monkey kidney BSC 1 cells were grown in Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS Gibco BRL Life Technologies Gaithersburg Md. and 0.1 gentamicin antibiotic at 37 C. in a humidified 5 COenvironment. Confluent BSC 1 cells were infected with vaccinia virus at an MOI of 0.005 in 48 well plate. One hour post infection 400 L of the test compounds and control were added per well at concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 200 M and incubated at 37 C. for 16 hours. Viridicatumtoxin tetracycline and control cidofovir were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with the medium. A 5 solution of formaldehyde in PBS was used to fix the cells. After washing twice with PBS the plate was stained with 0.2 crystal violet in 50 ethanol.

A cytotoxicity assay that measures the release of glyceraldehydes 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH was conducted using the aCella TOX bioluminescence cytotoxicity kit Cell Technology Inc. Mountainview Calif. following the manufacturer s protocol. Briefly BSC 1 cells were grown to confluency in white 96 well cell culture plates at 37 C. in DMEM containing 10 FBS and 0.1 gentamicin in the presence or absence of inhibitor 200 nM to 200 M . A lysing agent that produces maximum release of GAPDH served as a positive control.

In determining the cellular therapeutic index no tests were conducted at concentrations greater than 200 M due to the limited availability of the compounds and solubility issues at higher stock concentrations. The concentration of inhibitor that causes half of the maximum cell cytotoxicity CC50 and the concentration that reduces 50 of the plaques IC were used to determine the therapeutics index as follows 

The cell viability at the plaque ICvalue was performed using two independent methods cell counting and MTT assay. For the cell counting method cells were incubated overnight at 37 C. to sub confluency in 48 well plates. The compounds dissolved in DMSO were further diluted in media to a final concentration required to achieve the plaque ICvalue. The cells were incubated with the compounds for 24 hrs. The media was removed the cells trypsinized and stained with tryphan blue and counted. The MTT assay was also used to confirm cell viability at the plaque IC. Cells were seeded at 1.5 10cells well in a 96 well plate and incubated overnight at 37 C. at 5 CO. Compounds dissolved in DMSO were mixed with media to obtain the concentration required to achieve the plaque ICvalue and incubated with the cells for 16 h. Each well received 20 L of the MTT solution 5 mg MTT mL PBS and the plate was rocked for 5 min. The plates were incubated for an additional 5 h to metabolize MTT after which the media was removed and the plates were air dried. To resuspend the formazan the end product of the MTT assay 200 L of DMSO was added to each well and the plates were rocked for 5 10 min. Absorbance was read at 560 nm.

BSC 1 cells in 48 well plates were infected with vaccinia virus at an MOI of 30. The test compounds were added to a final concentration of 20 M and incubated at 37 C. Infection time points were obtained by removing the media lysing and scraping the cells into pre cooled tubes. Total RNA from the samples were isolated using RNeasy mini RNA kit from Qiagen and quantified by measuring the absorbance on Nanodrop Nanodrop Technologies Wilmington Del. . Equal aliquot volumes of each sample were reverse transcribed according to Superscript first strand DNA synthesis system Invitrogen protocol. Quantitative RT PCR was performed using LightCycler DNA Master Sybr Green from Roche and primers designed to probe for early E3 late F9 viral genes and host GAPDH mRNA expression. The levels of expressed viral genes were normalized according to the level of GAPDH. The primer pairs used were F9L Fwd GGACAGTTTAAAAATTGCGCGCTCCG F9L SEQ ID No. 3 Rev CGTCTAGATCTATTC CTATTT CTTCAG CGATAGC SEQ ID No. 4 B5R Fwd CTTCGGATCCAAATGCTGTCTGCG SEQ ID No. 5 B5R Rev CGCCGTTGCAACTTAGTGT CATGGTG SEQ ID No. 6 E3L Fwd GGAATCGAA GGAGCTACTGCTGCAC E3L SEQ ID No. 7 Rev CTTATCCGCCTCCGTTG TCATAAACC SEQ ID No. 8 gapdh Fwd CCATGGTGAAGGTGAAGACTGC SEQ ID No. 9 GAPDH Rev CAGCCTTGAC AGTGC CATGG SEQ ID No. 10 . The thermal cycler conditions were 10 min at 95 C. 45 cycles of 5 s at 95 C. followed by 5 s at 60 C. and 5 s at 72 C. All of the samples were assayed in duplicate. A DNA standard calibration curve was plotted using known concentrations of standard cDNA and primers.

Cells were harvested and lysed at 4 C. Cells were pelleted 300 g 2 min and 4 LDS was added to the supernatant that was heated to 95 C. and loaded onto a 10 Bis Tris gels Invitrogen . Proteins on the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with primary E3 L1 and GAPDH antibodies secondary anti mouse or anti rabbit peroxidase conjugated antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence Pierce . The vaccinia antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. G. Cohen and R. Eisenberg.

Using the invented mechanistic Rapid Plate Assay See also U.S. Pat. No. 6 204 028 a chemical library was screened for compounds that block vaccinia virus DNA synthesis. Then compounds that blocked vaccinia virus DNA synthesis in the Rapid Plate Assay were further tested for preventing vaccinia virus from infecting tissue culture cells plaque reduction with minimal toxicity.

The following compounds the details of which are set forth in Table 2 were effective in blocking the replication of vaccinia virus in cells and thus can be as therapeutic compounds for blocking smallpox virus replication. Additional particularly effective compounds were found structures XLIV and XLV .

For this study the rapid plate assay was performed in a microtiter plate in which a 100 nucleotide template with biotin covalently linked to its 5 end was immobilized onto the streptavidin coated wells. A 20 nucleotide primer was annealed to the 3 end of template. Vaccinia lysate was added to each well of the plate to allow incorporation of the four dNTPs as well as digoxigenin dUTP. A peroxidase conjugated anti digoxigenin antibody that recognizes digoxigenin in the newly synthesized DNA generated a colorimetric reaction that was quantified with a plate reader at 405 nm.

The rapid plate assay was used to screen the NCI Diversity and Training Set library of 2 222 compounds. This library contains diverse three dimensional structures representative of approximately 140 000 compounds from the NCI DTP library. For this primary screen all compounds were tested at a concentration 167 M. The results of a typical plate are represented in . Compounds that inhibit DNA synthesis hit compounds were identified by a decrease in absorbance at 405 nm. A total of 169 compounds decreased DNA synthesis by 50 or greater giving a hit rate of 7.6 .

169 hit compounds obtained from the primary screen Step I were tested to determine if these vacccinia inhibitors were also able to block DNA synthesis conducted by a completely different polymerase and processivity complex. For this purpose the unrelated KSHV DNA polymerase Pol8 and processivity factor PF8 were used. Compounds that block DNA synthesis of vaccinia virus but not KSHV are of greatest interest since irrelevant reasons for the inhibition e.g. DNA intercalation and DNA groove binding are eliminated. Moreover these vaccinia virus selective inhibitors unlikely bind to conserved structural motifs of the KSHV and vaccinia proteins. Compounds in step II that inhibited KSHV DNA synthesis by 50 or greater were considered nonspecific. The results of this step yielded 47 compounds giving a hit rate of 2.1 from Step I 2 222 compounds . Results of one of the selectivity plates are presented in . The compounds that inhibited both KSHV and vaccinia were set aside for future cytotoxicity testing since they have a general preference for viral proteins as opposed to cellular proteins.

A20 D4 and E9 proteins are necessary and sufficient for vaccinia processive DNA synthesis. Thus the assays were designed to distinguish between vaccinia inhibitors that target nucleotide incorporation by E9 alone from inhibitors that target processive incorporation of dozens to thousands of nucleotides by the triad A20 D4 and E9.

To distinguish polymerase from processivity inhibitors altered versions of the plate assay were employed. To define polymerase inhibitors E9 activity was examined in low salt. In low salt DNA polymerases were able to synthesize fully extended strands in the absence of processivity factors. The uniform template which contains evenly distributed sites for DIG dU incorporation was used to test for polymerase inhibitors . By contrast to identify processivity inhibitors the experiments were performed in high salt in which E9 exhibits limited nucleotide incorporation whereas processive strand synthesis by the A20 D4 E9 triad is preferred. To assay for processivity the distal template was used to allow DIG dU to be incorporated only at the distal 3 end of the nascent DNA. Two compounds 69343 and 55636 were designated as polymerase inhibitors since they prevented E9 from incorporating nucleotides on the uniform template . As expected these polymerase inhibitors also blocked the distal template since vaccinia DNA synthesis is dependent on the incorporation of dNTPs by E9. In contrast two compounds 123526 and 124808 were designated as processivity inhibitors since they prevented DNA synthesis by the triad on the distal template but not on the uniform template .

Of the 47 compounds that passed Step II 43 compounds did not inhibit either the polymerase or processivity assays. This result was due to the different protein sources used infected cell lysate in Step I vs. in vitro translated proteins in Step III. Thus screening stringency can be greatly increased by switching from one protein source to another.

The ability of compounds to inhibit DNA synthesis in the rapid plate assay was confirmed using the M13 DNA synthesis assay. In the M13 assay full length DNA strands of 7 249 nucleotides are produced and visualized by autoradiography. Because of the length of the product the M13 assay served as a rigorous test for processive DNA synthesis. As shown in lane 2 full length double stranded M13 DNA was successfully synthesized in the presence of the A20 D4 E9 triad. The brackets shown in indicate the formation of greater than unit length products. The synthesis of M13 DNA was blocked by increasing concentrations of the two polymerase inhibitors NSC 69343 lanes 3 7 and NSC 55636 lanes 8 12 and the two processivity inhibitors NSC 123526 lanes 13 17 and NSC 124808 lanes 18 22 . Most notably the polymerase inhibitor NSC 69343 completely inhibited M13 DNA synthesis at 100 M lane 5 . All of the other compounds inhibited at concentration between 100 M and 1 mM.

A plaque reduction assay was used to evaluate the antiviral activity of the two polymerase inhibitors and the two processivity inhibitors that were selected from the screening assays . BSC 1 cells were infected with 100 150 pfu of vaccinia virus and the inhibitors were added to the cell monolayer 1 h post infection at a final concentration of 100 M. This final concentration of 100 M was based on the ability of known inhibitors to reduce plaque formation by approximately 50 following infection of BSC 1 cells by vaccinia virus. The results are summarized in Table I. Surprisingly NSC 69343 the more potent polymerase inhibitor based on in vitro assays was less remarkable in its ability to reduce viral plaques 40 as compared to NSC 55636 the less potent polymerase inhibitor which caused significant plaque reduction 95 . As for the two processivity inhibitors NSC 123526 showed appreciable plaque reduction 72 as compared with NSC 124808 36 .

Cytotoxicity of the four inhibitors of vaccinia DNA synthesis was determined using the aCella Tox assay. This assay quantifies the cellular release of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH which is essential for the production of ATP in the glycolysis pathway. G3PDH released into the cell media is used in a coupled reaction to generate ATP which is then detected by luciferase luciferin bioluminescence. As indicated in Table I and at 100 M all of the inhibitors resulted in cell cytotoxicity lower than 50 . The two processivity inhibitors NSC 123526 and 124808 exhibited the same levels of cytotoxicity 21 whereas the polymerase inhibitors NSC 55636 and 69343 exhibited toxicities of 14 and 17 respectively. Most interestingly the least cytotoxic inhibitor NSC 55636 is also the most potent plaque reducer.

Cellular Therapeutic Indices for Polymerase Inhibitor NSC 55636 and Processivity Inhibitor NSC 123526

The polymerase inhibitor NSC 55636 and processivity inhibitor NSC 123526 were considered to be the most significant compounds based on their efficacy at reducing vaccinia virus plaques with the least cytotoxicity. To establish the cellular therapeutic index

These experimental settings provided the selection of functional inhibitors that block vaccinia DNA synthesis elimination of general and irrelevant inhibitors distinguish whether the polymerase or the processive mechanism is targeted. The first screening step which uses infected cell lysate was designed for poxviruses which are unique amongst the DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm. This provides a great advantage since there are no competing nuclear polymerases in the cytoplasmic lysate that contribute to anomalous results. The second screening step eliminates irrelevant inhibitors such as DNA intercalators and DNA groove binders. Moreover this step identifies antiviral compounds that were directed against viral polymerases. The third screening step which distinguishes inhibition of the polymerase or processive mechanism is also applicable to other viruses and eukaryotes that engage processivity complexes in their DNA synthesis. Using this stepwise approach promising therapeutics that target the processivity complex of poxviruses were successfully found.

The stepwise screening delivered two compounds which have distinct modes of inhibiting polymerase processive vaccinia DNA synthesis. The first compound NSC 55636 inhibited the catalytic activity of E9 DNA polymerase Tables 1 and 2 . By contrast the second compound NSC 123526 inhibited the processive activity of the triad A20 D4 and E9 Tables 1 and 2 .

The polymerase inhibitor NSC 55636 also known as Fentichlor is an antibacterial anthelmintic and antifungal agent. This study shows that NSC 55636 is a promising poxvirus inhibitor due to its high cellular therapeutic index of greater than forty reflecting its ability to effectively block vaccinia virus infection with minimal cytotoxicity.

The processivity inhibitor NSC 123526 is an S fluorenylcysteine compound. The cysteine moiety renders the compound cell permeable and delivers the flourenyl group to the interaction site inducing local conformational changes.

This study has yielded two other compounds that were effective in blocking vaccinia DNA synthesis in the in vitro rapid plate assays while not as effective in cell based assays. The polymerase inhibitor NSC 69343 is in fact tetracycline an antibiotic that inhibits the prokaryotic 30S ribosome Tables 1 and 2 .

In summary the sequential rapid plate screening provides a clear route for the identification of lead compounds with inhibitory activities towards poxvirus DNA synthesis. The stepwise design incorporated filters that i examined compounds that block viral DNA synthesis ii selectively removed compounds that inhibited DNA synthesis in a general or irrelevant manner and iii distinguish whether the inhibitors were blocking polymerase or processive mechanisms. This screening strategy yielded two candidate compounds for vaccinia NSC 55636 and NSC 123526 representing a hit rate of 0.1 . Characterization of the A20 D4 E9 triad will provide insights into the mechanism of inhibition by these compounds and allow us to generate analogs that achieve maximum antiviral activity. The sequential screening approach can be modified to identify polymerase and processivity inhibitors of other viruses and microbial agents.

Infected cytoplasmic extracts were used as the source of viral proteins for the rapid plate assay. Poxviruses are unique amongst DNA viruses in that their replication occurs solely within the cell cytoplasm. This provided an advantage for preparing viral replication proteins that were free of nuclear enzymes involved in cellular DNA synthesis. Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from vaccinia infected BSC 1 cells were shown to be completely separated from nuclear proteins as verified by Western blot with the cytoplasmic marker Actin and the nuclear marker Rb1 . Moreover cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells had little to no DNA synthesis activity further indicating that the DNA synthesis activity of infected cell extracts was exclusively due to vaccinia cytoplasmic components and not to nuclear contaminants . Before proceeding with the major high throughput screening HTS the assay was adapted to a 384 well platform. DNA synthesis reactions were performed in streptavidin coated 384 well plates for 30 minutes at 37 C in a final reaction volume of 30 L. Each well contained 100 mM ammonium sulfate 0.5 M digoxigenin 11 2 2 deoxy uridine 5 triphosphate 2 pmoles biotinylated primer template and 0.2 mU vaccinia DNA polymerase see Methods for details . The assay was evaluated for plate uniformity and signal variability by testing three plates on two different days. No drift or edge effects were observed and the calculated values for signal to background signal to noise coefficient of variation and screening window coefficient Z factor validated the assay as suitable for HTS. The results were reproducible and the screening window coefficient Z factor had an excellent value of 0.95. Next the assay was validated by robotically testing 1 520 chemical compounds with known pharmacological activities. Out of the 58 hit compounds that blocked the colorimetric reaction 39 are known to bind DNA or inhibit DNA and RNA polymerases which indicated that the assay is capable of detecting inhibitors of DNA synthesis. A survey of the current literature found that the remaining 19 hit compounds were never reported as inhibitors of DNA synthesis.

The rapid plate assay was used to perform a robotic HTS to evaluate a total of 45 832 low molecular weight synthetic compounds MW

Dose Dependent Inhibition of Vaccinia Catalyzed DNA Synthesis and Determination of the ICValues in the Rapid Plate Assay

The 93 synthetic compounds above were analyzed in both enzymatic and in vitro cell based assays. Compounds were suspended in DMSO at a final concentration of 20 mM and tested manually in the rapid plate assay for inhibition of DNA synthesis catalyzed by vaccinia proteins. The assay was performed in 96 well plates in conditions similar to those used for the primary high throughput screen. Compounds were tested in triplicate over a range of concentrations and the percentage inhibition values were fitted to sigmoidal dose response curves. For each compound a dose dependent inhibition curve was generated from which the 50 inhibitory concentration IC50 was determined. The dose response curves for five of the compounds is presented in . All chemicals inhibited vaccinia virus catalyzed DNA synthesis in the rapid plate assay. The IC50 values for 89 compounds ranged from 0.5 M to 400 M while 4 compounds showed only partial inhibition at concentrations of 400 M or higher.

The 93 DNA synthesis inhibitors above were first tested in a plaque reduction assay to stop the formation of vaccinia virus plaques on BSC 1 cell monolayers. The plaque reduction assay uses a very low amount of vaccinia virus just enough to give approximately 50 plaques in each well of a 48 well plate. Each compound was tested in triplicate and the results were used to estimate the compound concentrations for which the number of viral plaques was reduced to approximately half effective concentration 50 or EC50 Table 4 . Next the 93 compounds were tested in a cell protection assay. The cell protection assay was performed with amounts of virus capable of lysing every cell in the culture during the 20 hour incubation period. Compounds with antiviral properties preserve the monolayer s integrity and the adherent cellular mass is stained to generate the read out signal absorbance at 570 nm . Each compound was tested in triplicate over a range of concentrations up to 200 M in two fold serial increments and dose dependent plots were generated by fitting the results on four parameter sigmoidal response curves. These plots were used to calculate the compound concentrations at which 50 antiviral protection was observed as compared to the unprotected DMSO control. While both these assays measure the antiviral activity they differ by the amount of virus used to infect the cell monolayer. As it can be seen in Table 4 there is an overall concordance between the EC50 values obtained in the plaque reduction assay and the cell protection assay which suggests that both assays are good indicators of a compound s efficacy to block viral infection.

The cell protection assay above indirectly measures the compounds cytotoxicity in that compounds which successfully protect against viral infection must do so without destroying the cells. Furthermore the compounds cytotoxicity was assessed in an assay that measures the metabolic activity of cells exposed to chemicals in the absence of virus. After culturing the cells in the presence of compounds cell viability was determined by adding a cell impermeable water soluble tetrazolium salt that is reduced extracellularly to a dark red soluble formazan and is monitored spectrophotometrically. Cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the reduction of tetrazolium salt due to metabolic activity of BSC 1 cells exposed to compounds relative to DMSO alone. The percent cytotoxicity was fitted onto four parameter sigmoidal dose response curves and the 50 toxic concentration values TC50 were determined. As expected cytotoxicity increases with the incubation time. Some compounds exhibited very little cytotoxicity in overnight cultures and their cytotoxic effects for 3 or 5 day incubation period were determined.

The compounds identified using HTS were selected based on their ability to block vaccinia catalyzed DNA synthesis irrespective of the mechanism of inhibition. Some of these inhibitors function by binding DNA and thus stopping DNA strand extension by polymerase. Such compounds affect indiscriminately many cellular and viral processes that involve DNA. To investigate if the hit compounds have affinity for DNA antiviral activity was tested in the presence of large amounts of genomic double stranded DNA added in the cell virus culture. Since cells do not take up DNA under normal culturing conditions this exogenous DNA remains outside the cells and traps any DNA binding compound resulting in which leads to a loss of that compound s antiviral activity.

The selectivity index for each compound was calculated as the ratio between the TC50 in the 20 hour cytotoxicty assay and the EC50 in the cell protection assay. Some compounds with very low toxicity had less than 50 cytotoxic effect at the highest tested concentration of 200 M and their TC50 s were estimated as greater than 200 M in the 20 hours assay. It is noted that in order to obtain EC50 and TC50 values that can be compared to generate accurate SI s the cell protection assay and the cytotoxicity assay need to be performed in similar conditions fast growing BSC 1 cells exposed to compounds or virus compound mixtures for the same length of time.

Viridicatumtoxin and tetracycline were compared for their effectiveness in blocking DNA synthesis using the rapid plate assay. In this assay DNA synthesis initiated from a primer annealed to a 100 nucleotide template. The primer annealed template was tethered to a streptavidin coated plate by a biotinylated moiety on its 5 end. DNA synthesis was conducted in low salt which enables vaccinia E9 DNA polymerase produced by in vitro translation to perform extended strand synthesis. A failure to incorporate dNTPs in the presence of test compounds i.e. viridicatumtoxin or tetracycline indicates that E9 polymerase is inhibited. As seen in and Table 5 the ICvalues obtained for the inhibition of vaccinia DNA synthesis by tetracycline 54 M and viridicatumtoxin 63 M were similar.

In order to evaluate the ability of viridicatumtoxin to inhibit vaccinia virus infection a plaque reduction assay was employed. As represented in and Table 5 viridicatumtoxin was able to reduce the number of plaques at near nanomolar concentrations ICof 1.6 M . It is noted that at very high concentrations of viridicatumtoxin 100 M the cells began to detach. By contrast tetracycline was ineffective at reducing vaccinia plaques IC 200 M .

To determine the cytotoxicity of viridicatumtoxin on cells the aCella TOX assay was used. This assay quantifies the cellular release of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH which is essential for the production of ATP in the glycolysis pathway. Briefly GAPDH that is released into the cell media is used in a coupled reaction to generate ATP which can be detected by luciferase luciferin bioluminescence. The CCfor viridicatumtoxin in the GAPDH release assay was greater than 200 M Table 5 indicative of low cellular cytotoxicity. The therapeutic index value for viridicatumtoxin calculated from the cell cytotoxicity CCand plaque reduction IC was greater than 125.

Two different assays were used to determine the viability of the cells at the ICconcentration of viridicatumtoxin 1.6 M . About 90 of the cells remained viable as determined by the cell count assay and about 85 of the cells remained viable as measured by the MTT assay Table 5 .

Late viral gene expression is dependent upon vaccinia DNA synthesis. To test if viridicatumtoxin prevents expression of vaccinia late genes but not early genes representative viral marker genes were used to evaluate early and late vaccinia expression in the presence and absence viridicatumtoxin. A quantitative RT PCR analysis to detect early and late viral mRNA production was performed first. RNAs from different time points of viridicatumtoxin treated 20 M and untreated vaccinia virus infected cells were converted into cDNAs using oligo dT. Specific primer pairs were used to amplify regions of the vaccinia early E3 vaccinia late F9 and cellular GAPDH cDNAs by quantitative real time PCR. For quantitation GAPDH was used to normalize the levels of E3 and F9. As shown in both in the presence and absence of viridicatumtoxin production of early E3 mRNA was maximum at 3 h.p.i. and dropped back to low levels by 5 h.p.i. By contrast as shown in in the absence of viridicatumtoxin the production of late F9 mRNA began to increase at 5 h.p.i. and continued to increase thereafter. However in the presence of viridicatumtoxin there was only a marginal increase in F9 mRNA expression by 5 h.p.i. that plateaued until the last time point 8 h.p.i. . The prevention of vaccinia late mRNA expression by viridicatumtoxin was substantiated by examining vaccinia early and late marker proteins by western blot analysis. As shown in in untreated infected cells the E3 marker protein appeared at 2 h post infection and continued to increase to the last time point 8 h.p.i. . In the presence of viridicatumtoxin there was only a slight delay in appearance of E3 3 h.p.i. . However there is no significant difference in the levels of E3 in the presence or absence of viridicatumtoxin at 5 and 8 h.p.i. By contrast the vaccinia late marker protein L1 which is involved in viral assembly 26 27 31 was significantly decreased in the presence of 20 M viridicatumtoxin both at the time of its appearance at 5 h.p.i. as well as at 8 h.p.i. This ability of viridicatumtoxin to block late viral protein expression is in accord with its ability to inhibit late mRNA expression.

For HTS the rapid plate assay was adapted to a robotic platform. The DNA synthesis reactions were performed in 384 well plates coated with streptavidin SigmaScreen plates Sigma Aldrich cat. no. S8686 . In each well reactions were conducted with 0.5 L of vaccinia virus to extract containing 0.2 mU DNA polymerase activity in 20 mM Tris Cl pH7.5 100 mM ammonium sulfate 5 mM MgCl 0.1 mM EDTA 0.5 mM DTT 4 glycerol 40 g mL BS A 5 M each of dATP dCTP and dGTP 4 M dTTP 0.5 M DIG 11 dUTP in a total volume of 30 L. Two pmol of biotinylated primer template dissolved in 30 L PBS were immobilized on streptavidin coated wells. The unbound primer template was removed and the wells were washed twice with 50 L of PBS and loaded with 20 L reaction buffer 20 mM Tris Cl pH7.5 . Then 100 nL of each compound or natural extract dissolved in DMSO were transferred from the library plates by an Epson transfer robot Epson Robots Carson Calif. fitted with a 384 pin array. DNA synthesis was initiated by loading 10 L of a 3 reaction mixture. After brief centrifugation plates were incubated at 37 C. for 30 mM The DNA synthesis reaction was stopped with 30 L of a solution containing 50 mM EDTA and 2 SDS in 10 mM Tris pH 8. Incorporation of DIG 11 dUTP in the newly synthesized DNA strand was detected with peroxidase conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody anti DIG POD . Wells were flow washed with 400 L of PBS containing 0.1 Tween 20 at the lowest dispensing speed and loaded with 4.5 mU of anti DIG POD in 30 L of PBS blocking solution. After gently rocking at room temperature for 1 h the antibody solution was removed and wells were flow washed as above. Then 30 L of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate ABTS peroxi dase substrate dissolved in citrate buffer was added and plates were gently rocked at room temperature for 1 h. Color development was stopped with 1.0 L of 4 SDS and absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Readings from each well were divided by the plate median and the percent inhibition was determined relative to the values of uninhibited reaction controls.

Confluent BS C 1 cells infected with vaccinia virus WR at an MOI of 15 in the presence of 10 mM hydroxyurea were harvested 6 h post infection. Hydroxyurea inhibits viral DNA replication and transcription of intermediate and late viral mRNA s allowing only the expression of early gene products and not the abundant late viral genes. Processive DNA synthesis is an early activity of the vaccinia virus and thus is not affected by hydroxyurea. Infected cells were carefully scraped off the plates washed once with hypotonic buffer 1.5 mM MgCl 10 mM KCl 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5 resuspended in cold hypotonic buffer incubated on ice for 10 min and lysed by gentle dounce homogenization. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min. The cytoplasmic extracts were filtered twice through 0.2 m and shown to be free of infectious particles as determined by plaque assay. Glycerol was added to 20 final concentration and aliquots were stored at 80 C.

The 1520 chemical compounds with known biological activities used for assay validation were from two collections BIOMOL ICCB Known Bioactives 1 480 compounds and NINDS Custom Collection 1040 compounds . A total of 45832 synthetic compounds representing 11 independent libraries ChemDiv 3 16544 compounds MixCommercial 5 268 compounds Maybridge 4 4576 compounds ActiMol TimTec 1 8518 compounds Bionet 2 1700 compounds Enamine 1 6004 compounds I.F. Laboratory 1 6543 compounds I.F. Laboratory 2 292 compounds Maybridge 2 704 compounds MixCommercial 4 331 compounds and Peakdale 2 352 compounds were tested in duplicate at a single concentration of 16.7 g mL which is equivalent to a molar concentration of 33 167 M depending on the molecular weight of each individual compound. Natural extracts with inhibitory activity were identified by screening the Stan Foundation Extracts 2 library 1000 extracts from plants used in traditional Chinese medicine and two collections of partially purified extracts from endophytic fungi ICBG Fungal Extracts 1 851 extracts and ICBG Fungal Extracts 2 460 extracts . The natural extracts resuspended in DMSO at 15 mg mL were also tested in duplicate at 50 g mL final working concentration. The chemical libraries were supplied by the National Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease NSRB at the Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology ICCB Harvard Medical School where the robotic HTS was performed.

Milligram quantities of the HTS hit compounds for follow up studies were purchased from various vendors and suspended in DMSO at a final concentration of 20 mM. Each hit compound was retested over a range of concentrations for its ability to inhibit vaccinia virus DNA synthesis. Assays were performed in 96 well plates in conditions similar to those for the HTS. Each compound was tested in triplicate in 2 fold serial dilutions and the IC50 was calculated with the Prism software GraphPad Software Inc. for linear regression.

BS C 1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium DMEM to containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS 50 mg L gentamicin sulfate Gibco BRL Life Technologies Gaithersburg Md. and grown at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere with 5 CO2. For the plaque reduction assay 6 10cells well were seeded in 48 well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were infected with 50 plaque forming units pfu well of vaccinia virus WR in the presence of the HTS hit compounds at various concentrations. After 20 h cells were fixed with 5 formaldehyde in PBS and stained with 0.2 crystal violet dissolved in 50 ethanol. Wells were washed dried and plaques were counted under the microscope. The EC50 values were estimated as the concentration of compound that caused a reduction in the number of plaques by 50 .

The cell protection assay was performed using similar conditions to the plaque reduction assay. BS C 1 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 1.5 10cells well and grown overnight. The cells were infected with 2000 pfu well of vaccinia virus WR in the presence of inhibitors. After incubating at 37 C. for various times 20 48 and 72 h cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. The excess dye was washed away and the cellular mass fixed on the bottom of the wells was allowed to dry overnight. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured. Each compound was tested in triplicate in 2 fold serial dilutions and EC50 values were calculated using the Prism software for linear regression.

To investigate if the hit compounds retain their antiviral potency in the presence of exogenous DNA the cell protection assay was performed with 400 g mL of type DI DNA sodium salt from salmon testes Sigma Saint Louis Mo. added in the growth medium. The final concentration of compound derived DMSO was 1 v v in all cell based assays. For the control wells that contained no compound an appropriate volume of DMSO was added to achieve a final concentration of 1 .

Compound cytotoxicity was measured with the Cell Proliferation Reagent WST 1 Roche Applied Science Indianapolis Ind. following the manufacturer s protocol. BS C 1 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 5000 cells well in 50 L growth medium without phenol red. Next day 50 L well of growth medium containing the tested compounds were added and cultures were grown for 20 h at 37 C. Then 10 L of WST 1 reagent were added to each well plates were incubated at 37 C. for 30 min and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Each to compound was tested in triplicate in 2 fold serial dilutions and TC50 values were calculated using the Prism software for linear regression. To measure the compound cytotoxicity over longer incubation periods the number of BS C 1 cells seeded was adjusted 1000 cells well for 3 day cytotoxicity and 200 cells well for 5 day cytotoxicity. This ensured that cells did not grow past confluency by the end of the experiment and that the read out signal remained in the linear range.

Identification of Small Chemical Inhibitors of Vaccinia Virus DNA Synthesis with a Rapid Plate Assay Designed for High Throughput Screening.

Inventor of the instant application has developed a rapid plate assay to identify inhibitors of vaccinia virus DNA synthesis that target the viral DNA polymerase and its associated factors required for processivity. Briefly a 5 biotinylated DNA template annealed to an oligonucleotide primer at its 3 end is immobilized onto streptavidin coated wells. In the presence of the viral polymerase and its associated factors dNTP s and digoxigenin labeled 2 deoxy uridine 5 triphos phate DIG 11 dUTP are incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA strand. DNA synthesis activity is measured by the detection of digoxigenin using an enzyme linked antibody that generates a colorimetric reaction.

Replication of poxviruses occurs solely within the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic extracts from infected BS C 1 cells were used as the source of vaccinia proteins for the rapid plate assay. These cytoplasmic extracts were confirmed to be completely free of nuclear proteins by Western blot with antibody specific for the nuclear marker retinoblastoma protein Rb1 . Moreover cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells had little to no DNA synthesis activity in the rapid plate assay indicating that the DNA synthesis activity of infected cell extracts was exclusively due to vaccinia cytoplasmic proteins and not to nuclear enzymes involved in cellular DNA synthesis .

Before proceeding with the HTS the rapid plate assay was adapted for use with the Epson compound transfer robot Epson Robots Carson Calif. . DNA synthesis reactions were optimized without inhibitors in streptavidin coated 384 well plates. This robotic procedure exhibited plate uniformity and no signal variability when tested in multiple plates on different days. No drift or edge effects were observed and the calculated values for signal to background signal to noise coefficient of variation and screening window coefficient Z factor validated the assay as suitable for HTS. The robotic plate assay was reproducible and the Z factor had an excellent value of 0.95.

Next the optimized assay was validated by testing 1520 chemical compounds with known pharmacological activities. These known bioactive compounds are compiled in two libraries and include more than half of the drugs currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Out of the 58 compounds that blocked the colorimetric reaction of the rapid plate assay 39 are known to bind DNA or inhibit DNA or RNA polymerases which confirmed that the assay was indeed capable of detecting inhibitors of DNA synthesis. Interestingly with respect to the remaining 19 known compounds this is the first report to reveal that they are capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis.

The optimized robotic plate assay was then used to identify novel vaccinia DNA synthesis inhibitors by performing a HTS of 45832 small synthetic compounds MW

At this point the inventor of the instant application decided to pursue only the synthetic hit compounds because they have defined structures and are available as purified chemicals. These synthetic hit compounds represent a wide range of structures which the inventor was able to classify into 59 different chemical families. All of the strong and most of the intermediate inhibitors from the combinatorial synthetic libraries were confirmed to block vaccinia DNA synthesis upon manual retesting in the 96 well rapid plate assay. Follow up studies were conducted on 93 of the synthetic inhibitors from which all of the structural families are represented. These compounds were evaluated for potency in blocking vaccinia DNA synthesis in vitro protecting cultured cells from infection with vaccinia virus as well as cellular toxicity.

The inhibitory concentrations IC50 for each of the 93 synthetic compounds were determined. The assay was performed in 96 well plates using conditions similar to those used for the primary HTS. Each compound dissolved in DMSO was tested in triplicate over a range of concentrations for inhibition of DNA synthesis catalyzed by vaccinia proteins. The percentage inhibition values were fitted on sigmoidal dose response curves from which the IC50 was determined. Three representative dose response curves are presented in . The ICvalues for 89 compounds ranged from 0.5 to 400 M while four compounds showed less than 50 inhibition at concentrations of 400 M or higher Tables 6 and 7 .

The 93 DNA synthesis inhibitors were first tested in a plaque reduction assay to determine if they could prevent the formation of vaccinia virus plaques on BS C 1 cell monolayers. For the plaque reduction assay cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection moi to generate approximately 50 vaccinia virus plaques in each well of a 48 well plate. Each compound was tested in triplicate over a range of concentrations and the results were used to estimate the EC50 the effective concentration of compound required to reduce the number of viral plaques by 50 . The EC50 values for 75 compounds ranged from 5 to 200 M while 18 compounds had no effect on the number of plaques Tables 6 and 7 .

Next the 93 compounds were tested in a cell protection assay. This assay was performed with amounts of virus capable of lysing every cell in the culture during the 20 h incubation period. Compounds with antiviral properties protect the cell monolayer from infection as determined by the cellular mass stained for absorbance at 570 nm. Each compound was tested in triplicate over a range of concentrations up to 200 M in 2 fold serial dilution increments. Dose dependent plots were generated by fitting the results on four parameter sigmoidal response curves. These plots were used to calculate for each compound the concentration at which 50 antiviral protection is obtained relative to the unprotected DMSO control . Twenty nine of the 75 compounds that were active in the plaque assay also protected cells from viral infection with EC50 values as low as 9.6 M Table 6 .

While both the plaque reduction and the cell protection assays measure the antiviral activity of compounds they differ dramatically by the amount of virus used to infect the cell to monolayer. Nevertheless as seen in Table 6 there is an overall concordance between the EC50 values obtained with these two assays confirming the efficacy of these hit compounds in blocking viral infection.

The cell protection assay presented above indirectly measures cytotoxicity in that compounds that protect against viral infection must a priori perform this function without disrupting the cells. However to directly assess the cytotoxicity of each of the 93 compounds the inventor of the instant application employed a cytotoxicity assay that measures the metabolic activity of cells exposed to chemicals in the absence of virus. After culturing cells in the presence of inhibitors cell viability was determined by spectrophotometrically measuring the reduction of a water soluble tetrazolium salt to a dark red formazan which is catalyzed by a mitochondrial activity. The percent cytotoxicity relative to the DMSO control was fitted onto four parameter sigmoidal dose response curves and the 50 toxic concentration values TC50 were determined. After 20 h 15 compounds had negligible cytotoxicity even at the highest working concentration of 200 M. Not surprisingly longer incubation periods of 72 and 120 h led to increased cytotoxicity Table 7 .

On the basis of the results of cell culture assays the 93 compounds fell into 3 groups group I consisted of 18 compounds that had no effect on cells Table 7 group II consisted of 46 compounds that inhibited viral infection but were cytotoxic at similar concentrations Table 7 group III consisted of 29 compounds that inhibited viral infection at concentrations lower than the cytotoxic concentration Chart 1 Table 6 .

Of note the 18 synthetic compounds from group I did not have any effect in cell based assays when tested at concentrations up to 200 M they did not inhibit viral plaque formation they did not protect cells from viral infection and they did not show any cytotoxicity. All of these 18 compounds had tested positive in the rapid plate assay some of them being very potent inhibitors of vaccinia DNA synthesis in vitro with IC50 values as low as 1.3 M Table 7 . This lack of antiviral activity and cytotoxicity is most probably due to the inability of these compounds to permeate the cell membrane. Chemical modifications that increase lypophilicity and cell permeability may confer antiviral activity to these in vitro DNA synthesis inhibitors and convert them into attractive lead compounds.

The selectivity index SI for each compound was calculated as the ratio between TC50 in the 20 h cytotoxicity assay and EC50 in the cell protection assay. Six compounds had a SI of 4 or higher with the most effective compound having a SI of 13 reflecting the ability to block vaccinia virus infection at concentrations significantly lower than those producing cytotoxicity Table 6 . Of note the SI for many compounds is a conservative estimate because 50 cytotoxicity was not attained at the highest tested concentration of 200 M. e.g. compound 3 in Table 6 . As reference for antiviral activity the inventor of the instant application tested the well known antipoxvirus drug CDV which functions as a chain terminator to inhibit viral DNA synthesis. CDV had a SI of greater than 4 which is in accord with the values previously reported. The compounds of the invention have potencies comparable to CDV indicating their significance as potential poxvirus therapeutics.

The compounds identified in our primary HTS were selected by their ability to block vaccinia virus DNA synthesis. Although many hit compounds are likely inhibit DNA synthesis by interfering with a specific mechanistic step e.g. the catalytic incorporation of dNTP s by DNA polymerase the inventor was concerned that some hit compounds bind to DNA e.g. by intercalation in which case they would nonspecifically inhibit DNA polymerases from incorporating nucleotides. To eliminate such nonspecific inhibitors their antiviral activities were tested in the presence of large amounts of genomic double stranded DNA added to the media of vaccinia infected cells Because cells do not take up exogenous DNA under normal culturing conditions this DNA serves to trap nonspecific DNA binding compounds and disable their cellular uptake. Compounds that were affected by the exogenous DNA were identified by the loss of antiviral activity. As shown in Table 6 a total of 16 compounds retained their antiviral activity in the presence of the extracellular DNA trap indicating that these compounds were relevant inhibitors that block a mechanistic step in DNA synthesis.

When tested in 20 h assays three relevant hit compounds had a SI of 4 or higher with the most effective compound having a SI of 13 Table 6 . These 16 compounds were tested for cell protection and cytotoxicity over longer times 48 h and 72 h . At these longer times the compounds showed diminishing antiviral activity and increasing cytotoxicity as compared to the overnight assays. The antiviral activities of four compounds were high enough to allow calculation of EC50 values but 12 compounds showed less than 50 protection in the 72 h assays. When calculable the SI for each compound was lower in the 72 h assay than in the overnight assays. For example compound I has an SI of 13.2 over 20 h and an SI of 3.2 over 72 h. The solubility of the 16 compounds was verified in cell growth medium over the range of concentrations used in the activity assays. Light scattering measurements indicated that 11 compounds were completely soluble while five compounds 8 10 12 13 and 16 were just slightly insoluble at the EC.

The inventor of the instant application has discovered 16 inhibitors of vaccinia DNA synthesis that have antiviral activity. These 16 inhibitors were identified by the HTS of 49663 compounds using an in vitro DNA synthesis rapid plate assay. All of the inhibitors effectively block viral infection with minimal toxicity to the cells and could not be trapped outside the cells by exogenous DNA indicating that their antiviral activity is mediated by the disruption of an essential step in the mechanism of viral DNA synthesis. Of particular interest three of the inhibitors had selectivity indexes that approximate that of CDV the well known poxvirus DNA synthesis inhibitor. Because these new inhibitors are not nucleoside analogues they are expected to block vaccinia DNA synthesis through a mechanism that is distinct from that of CDV a nucleoside analogue. Further development of these 16 synthetic compounds could lead to useful pox antiviral compounds that will complement the inhibitory activity of CDV and thus reduce the emergence of drug resistant mutants. On the basis of the high sequence similarity between the proteins of vaccinia and variola viruses that are responsible for DNA synthesis these new inhibitors can be equally effective against smallpox. Future enzymatic and virological studies will identify the specific DNA synthesis proteins targeted by these poxvirus inhibitors.
