title: Laser mapping tool and weapon replacement fixture
abstract: A platform mapping tool for mapping a weapon platform includes a mandrel inserted in one of a weapon barrel and a weapon replacement fixture barrel. The tool generates a laser cone centered on the bore centerline of the weapon. The laser cone illuminates a defined cone of dispersion of ammunition. Areas where the laser cone intersects the weapon platform correspond to undesirable weapon firing positions. The undesirable firing positions can be digitized and loaded into the weapon's fire control system.

The present application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 708 805 filed on Oct. 2 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

A weapon may be mounted on a vehicle or on another type of platform. The vehicle or other platform may be on land in the air or at sea. The weapon must be mounted in such a way to prevent damage to the mounting platform caused by the ammunition fired from the weapon and or caused by the weapon physically striking the platform. At the same time it is desirable to maximize the safe firing arcs of the weapon. Thus the weapon platform must be mapped from the perspective of the centerline of the bore of the weapon. The weapon platform map includes the various azimuths and elevations at which the weapon may be fired and traversed.

In the past platform mapping was accomplished using an active or demilitarized weapon and a single beam laser. Obtaining a weapon to use for platform mapping can be difficult in some locations and may require extensive pre planning. Weapons are not easily transported due to weight and security concerns. Additionally active weapons require certified personnel to escort the weapon. And a problem with single beam lasers is the small diameter cylindrical beam produced by the single beam lasers. A cylindrical beam does not accurately simulate the cone of dispersion of some fired ammunition or other tolerance issues such as a margin of safety.

The cone of dispersion is a conical space centered on the bore centerline of the weapon and extending outward from the weapon s muzzle. Using a single beam laser a weapon may erroneously be determined to be safe to fire if the bore centerline does not intersect the weapon platform. Because of dispersed ammunition the weapon may actually damage the platform when fired even if the bore centerline does not intersect the weapon platform.

Three dimensional computer models of weapon platforms are not suitable because the models are often not current accurate or available. Equipment is often added to or customized for weapon platforms and the 3 D models of the basic platform do not reflect the final configuration of the weapon platform. Scanning devices may be used to create a contour map of a weapon platform but the scanning devices are expensive difficult to transport and unnecessarily precise.

A need exists for a simple effective easily transportable apparatus for mapping a vehicle or other weapon platform to determine no fire elevation azimuth combinations and no traverse elevation azimuth combinations.

One aspect of the invention is a platform mapping tool. The platform mapping tool includes a base wheel having a central axis. An adjustable kinematic mount is spaced apart from and rigidly fixed to the base wheel. The kinematic mount is centered on the central axis. A laser cone generator is fixed to the kinematic mount and centered on the central axis. The laser cone generator includes a laser a diffractive optical element a lens tube and lenses disposed in the lens tube. The lenses include first and second plano convex lens and a plano concave lens. The laser beam from the laser source is transformed by the diffractive optical element and the lenses into a diverging ring with an angular divergence that is invariant of a focus of the diverging ring.

The adjustable kinematic mount may include at least two diagonally opposed adjusters for collimating the laser beam.

A mandrel may be concentrically fixed to the base wheel on a side of the base wheel opposite the kinematic mount. The platform mapping tool may include a barrel with a bore therein. The mandrel may be inserted in the bore concentric with a centerline of the bore.

In one embodiment the barrel is a weapon barrel and the mandrel is inserted in a muzzle of the weapon barrel.

In another embodiment the barrel is a component of a weapon replacement fixture and is not a weapon barrel.

The weapon replacement fixture may include a receiver forward base removably fixed to the barrel and a receiver aft base removably fixed to the receiver forward base.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of mapping a platform for a weapon. The weapon has a bore centerline and a muzzle. The method includes providing a platform mapping tool having a laser cone generator. The laser cone generator projects a laser cone having an axis coincident with the bore centerline and an apex located substantially at a location of the muzzle of the barrel of the weapon. The laser cone is projected for a plurality of positions of the weapon. The method includes identifying a group of the plurality of positions in which the projected laser cone intersects the platform.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A weapon platform mapping apparatus includes an opto mechanical assembly for projecting a laser cone. The laser cone is a right circular cone. The central axis of the laser cone is aligned with the location of the centerline of the bore of a weapon mounted on a platform. If the weapon is present on the platform the opto mechanical assembly is mounted to the weapon s barrel. If the weapon is not present on the platform the opto mechanical assembly is mounted to a weapon replacement fixture. In either case the opto mechanical assembly is placed at the location corresponding to the weapon s muzzle. The apex of the laser cone may be located axially distal of the actual muzzle location because of the standoff dimension of the mechanical mount assembly.

To map a weapon platform the weapon or weapon replacement fixture with the platform mapping apparatus attached thereto is moved through various positions azimuth elevation combinations . At each position of the weapon or weapon replacement fixture the laser cone projected by the platform mapping apparatus occupies or defines the space where the weapon s ammunition may travel after leaving the muzzle. This space may also include a margin of error beyond actual observed ammunition dispersion.

Weapon positions in which the laser cone intersects the platform are not allowable firing positions for the weapon. By moving the weapon or weapon replacement fixture through all possible positions of the weapon one may determine the azimuth elevation combinations for which firing or traversing the weapon may damage the platform. The azimuth elevation combinations may be digitized and loaded into the weapon s fire control system to prevent the weapon from firing on and damaging the platform.

Mounted at the location of the muzzle of weapon is an opto mechanical assembly described in detail below that generates a right circular laser cone . is a schematic side view of laser cone and is a schematic end view of laser cone . The cone angle d is shown in . At any axial location along laser cone cone has a center and an annular perimeter or ring . Center is collinear with the bore centerline X of barrel of weapon . In ring abuts or is tangent to platform at points A and B and does not intersect platform . Thus the position of weapon in is an allowable firing position. The dotted line in represents the closest allowable firing positions of the bore centerline to platform for the portion of platform near structures and .

For various reasons weapon may not always be available or may not be mounted on platform . In lieu of weapon a weapon replacement fixture may be used when mapping platform . Functionally the weapon replacement fixture must provide a mounting location for the opto mechanical laser assembly. When the opto mechanical laser assembly is mounted to the weapon replacement fixture the laser assembly s spatial location must be the same as when the laser assembly is mounted to weapon for all possible azimuth elevation combinations of weapon .

Barrel base may be fixed to receiver forward base using for example removable fasteners not shown . The fasteners may be disposed in openings in barrel base and the abutting portion of receiver forward base . Receiver forward base may be fixed to receiver aft base using fasteners disposed in corresponding openings in forward and aft bases . Receiver aft base may include a pair of lugs or bosses having openings therein for pinning or fixing aft base to weapon platform . Receiver forward base may include an opening for pinning or fixing base to weapon platform . Depending on the type of weapon the configuration of fixture may vary. However the modular nature of fixture is desirable so that it can be easily disassembled packed in a case and carried by a person on a commercial passenger airplane. To minimize weight fixture may be made of for example aluminum.

Mapping apparatus may include a mandrel . One end of mandrel may be fixed to an opening in base wheel by for example threading. The other end of mandrel is inserted in weapon barrel or weapon replacement fixture barrel . Mandrel is concentric with central axis C. For some calibers for example .50 caliber or less the outside diameter of mandrel may be just less than the inside diameter of weapon barrel or the inside diameter of weapon replacement fixture barrel . For larger calibers mandrel may include spring loaded spacers that center mandrel in the barrel.

The components of laser cone generator are shown schematically in . A laser assembly includes a laser a diffractive optical element and an exit aperture . A power supply for laser may be for example a battery pack or a power cord inserted in a power outlet. The diffractive optical element or hologram alters the laser beam from a collimated parallel beam to a diverging ring cone and a central collimated beam. The combined laser and diffractive optical element is a commercially available off the shelf item. The angular divergence of the ring or cone is initially defined by the diffractive optical element .

After exiting aperture light beam L is projected through first and second plano convex lenses and a plano concave lens . Lenses and are disposed in lens tube . The lens assembly is telecentric. Plano convex lenses act as a single lens to establish an effective focal length for achieving the desired beam divergence cone angle d shown in . The lens assembly redefines the initial angular divergence of the cone established by the diffractive optical element to the desired divergence angle d for mapping. In one embodiment the cone angle d is six degrees. The cone angle d may be changed by using a different set of plano convex lenses.

Plano concave lens focuses beam L without affecting its divergence to achieve the best possible laser cone resolution. The focus of the cone corresponds to the radial width of the annulus or ring that defines the perimeter of the cone. Greater focus corresponds to a thinner ring . Regardless of the degree of focus i.e. width of ring the angle d is always maintained because of the telecentric nature of the lens assembly. In other words the angular divergence of a circle that is centered in the width of the annulus or ring is invariant of the width of the ring .

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention with a cone angle d of six degrees plano convex lens has the properties R1 26.25 mm R2 infinity thickness 2.5 mm diameter 12.7 mm plano convex lens has the properties R1 23 mm R2 infinity thickness 2.75 mm diameter 12.7 mm and plano concave lens has the properties 7.07 mm R2 infinity thickness 2.25 mm diameter 9 mm. In this exemplary embodiment and referring to distance g from the laser aperture to the convex surface of lens is 22.3 mm distance h from the planar rear surface of lens to the convex surface of lens is 3.5 mm and distance i from the planar rear surface of lens to the concave surface of lens is 11.75 mm.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
