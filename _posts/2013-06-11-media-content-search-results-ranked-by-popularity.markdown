This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 846 442 filed Jul. 29 2010 entitled Media Content Search Results Ranked by Popularity which is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 716 236 filed Mar. 9 2007 entitled Media Content Search Results Ranked by Popularity the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

As the variety of television programming and media content sources continues to increase viewers may want to locate television media content and programming choices that may be of interest to them. In addition to scheduled television program broadcasts television viewing options also include on demand choices which enable a viewer to search for and request media content for viewing when convenient rather than at a scheduled broadcast time.

A viewer can initiate a search for a list of television programming choices in a program guide also commonly referred to as an electronic program guide or EPG . A search is typically based on text string matching and an alphabetical list of programs and or movies is filtered and returned in response to the search request. Another type of search for television programming choices is a field based search such as a search for new movies or sports . Text string matching is a fairly limited form of searching in that a viewer s results will be limited to a set of programs that happen to have the search string in a particular field and therefore the search results are dependent on what the metadata creators add to the field descriptions. This leads to the viewer obtaining results that either do not have the desired program or bury the desired program in a long list of results because many programs have the same text string. In addition if a viewer misspells a search term the search system can return unwanted results or even no results at all.

Unwanted too many or even no search results can lead to viewer dissatisfaction when wanting to locate television programming that may be of interest to the viewer. In addition a search initiated via a program guide may be cumbersome for a viewer who enters the search term s with a remote control device. Further a slowly delivered search response from a search system of a content provider can increase the frustration of repeated searching for the viewer.

This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts of media content search results ranked by popularity. The simplified concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In embodiments a search request for television media content can be initiated by a viewer and the television media content that is relevant to the search request can be identified. The relevant television media content can then be ranked based on a popularity rating and the relevant television media content can be displayed in an ordered list that is ordered by popularity rankings.

In other embodiments a television client device can receive a search request for television media content and a search module can identify the television media content that is relevant to the search request. A tracking module can track one or more searches for the television media content information requests programming choices recordings and or new television media content to develop a popularity rating. The tracking module can then rank the relevant television media content based on the popularity rating to determine popular media content. A list of the popular media content can be displayed to include likely viewer choices. The tracking module can be implemented as a component of the television client device as a component of a content provider that provides the television media content to the television client device or as a component of both.

One or more embodiments of media content search results ranked by popularity enables a viewer to enter search term s to initiate a search request for television media content and to receive a list of media content whose identification and ordering is informed by a popularity measure such as a popularity rating. The list of media content can be organized based on the popularity of the television media content as determined from tracked television media content. The television media content such as programs movies music on demand media content network based applications and the like can be tracked to identify and rank the media content that a viewer or viewers would likely search and request for viewing. The popularity of the tracked media content can be estimated to provide a viewer with likely programming choices for viewing rather than simply returning an alphabetical list of television viewing selections when a viewer initiates a search request.

While features and concepts of the described systems and methods for media content search results ranked by popularity can be implemented in any number of different environments computing systems entertainment systems and or other various configurations embodiments of media content search results ranked by popularity are described in the context of the following example systems and environments.

Client device can be implemented as any one or combination of a television set top box a digital video recorder DVR and playback system an appliance device a gaming console and or as any other type of television client device or computing based device that may be implemented in a television entertainment and information system. In this example client device includes one or more processor s media content e.g. received media content or media content that is being received and recording media that maintains recorded media content .

Client device also includes a tracking module a search module and a program guide application all of which can be implemented as computer executable instructions and executed by the processor s to implement embodiments of media content search results ranked by popularity. Additionally client device can be implemented with any number and combination of differing components as further described with reference to the example client device shown in .

Although the tracking module search module and program guide application are each illustrated and described as single applications each can be implemented as several component applications or modules distributed to perform one or more functions of media content search results ranked by popularity. Further although the tracking module search module and program guide application are illustrated and described as separate applications the tracking module search module and or program guide application can be implemented together as a single application in the client device to implement embodiments of media content search results ranked by popularity.

The media content and or the recorded media content can include television programs or programming which may be any form of programs commercials music movies and video on demand media content. Other media content can include interactive games network based applications music streamed from a computing device to the client device as well as any other audio video and or image content received from any type of media content source.

The recording media along with a playback application can be implemented as a DVR system to record and maintain the recorded media content . The television client device can be configured for communication with the content provider s via a communication network which in this example can include an IP based network as described with reference to the communication network s shown in . Client device receives the media content and or the recorded media content from content server s of the content provider s via the communication network . The communication network can be implemented using any type of network topology and or communication protocol and can be represented or otherwise implemented as a combination of two or more networks.

In one or more embodiments the tracking module can be implemented to track various aspects of television programming and recordings at the client device . For example the tracking module can track television programming choices selected by a viewer who interacts with the client device searches for television media content initiated by a viewer the recorded media content listings for new television media content and or any other type of requests for television media content initiated by a viewer at client device .

The tracking module can include popularity metadata from which a popularity rating for television media content can be determined or generated. The popularity of television media content can be determined according to a popularity factor ranking and or index when tracking various aspects of television programming and recordings at client device . The popularity metadata can include data and real time tracking information corresponding to viewer programming choices e.g. specific shows or a series of programs that a viewer selects to watch search requests for media content recordings information requests new television media content and the like.

Further the popularity metadata can include the data and tracking information corresponding to one or multiple viewers. For example many search requests from different viewers can be encompassed in the metadata associated with a particular program. The tracking module can then determine the popularity of the particular program based on how often the media content is selected for viewing recording information requests and or any other type of viewer interaction. The tracking module can also be implemented for collaborative filtering to identify a series of programs as popular media content for a viewer at the client device .

In addition to the traditional metadata associated with television media content such as a title the actors a genre and a description of the media content the popularity metadata can include the tracking data as well as additional information. For example the popularity metadata can include ratings from ratings providers such as NIELSEN and or ARBITRON data for a previous week month or other duration to approximate how many viewers watched a particular program.

The popularity metadata can also include projected popularity rankings for new and or upcoming television media content that will likely be requested often by many viewers. For example the ranking of programming associated with the SUPER BOWL can be increased in advance of when the SUPER BOWL is played. In addition the popularity metadata can include any other popularity metrics upon which to base a popularity factor ranking and or index to determine popular media content.

In one or more embodiments client device includes the program guide application that can be implemented to process program guide data from which a program guide can be rendered and or displayed for viewing on display device . A program guide may also be commonly referred to as an electronic program guide or an EPG . In this example a program guide search interface is displayed on display device and includes a search input field via which a viewer can input search term s to initiate a search request for television media content. A viewer can input the search term s to initiate the search request utilizing an input device such as the remote control.

In an embodiment the search module can receive a search request for television media content when initiated by a viewer and identify the television media content that is relevant to the search request. The tracking module can then rank the relevant television media content based on a popularity rating and the relevant television media content can be displayed in an ordered list that is ordered by popularity rankings. The relevant television media content can include one or more likely viewer choices of popular media content displayed in the ordered list.

In an embodiment the search results for television media content can include relevant media content based on a partial match to a search term of a viewer initiated search request. For example a viewer may enter only Super as shown on the display device in the search input field . The search module may identify many different media content choices having a partial match to the search term Super . From the identified media content that is relevant to the search request the tracking module can determine that the viewer is likely requesting television media content associated with the SUPER BOWL if the search request is initiated at a time when the SUPER BOWL is an often requested and or anticipated event. For example the popularity metadata associated with the SUPER BOWL will reflect many search viewing and or recording requests from multiple viewers. The tracking module can then rank the relevant television media content based on a popularity rating generated from the popularity metadata .

Once a viewer learns that a specific and or complete text match is not necessary when initiating a search request to find television media content the viewer can reduce the inputs needed via the search input field . Reducing the number of search inputs also makes searching easier for the viewer particularly when utilizing the remote control input device which can be cumbersome to enter the search characters.

In another embodiment the search module can be implemented to identify media content that is relevant to a search request from the popularity metadata based on an incorrect search term of the search request. For example a viewer may want to watch a particular movie such as a movie entitled Irretrievably Broken but has forgotten the title of the movie. The viewer may inadvertently enter a search request of Retrievable . If the entered text string Retrievable were compared in a text based search to the title metadata fields for television media content a match to the sought after movie will not be located. However the search module can compare the entered text string Retrievable to the popularity metadata . A popularity result of the movie Irretrievably Broken which most closely matches the viewer request will be returned when the popularity metadata associated with the movie reflects multiple search viewing and or recording requests. The likely viewer choice can then be displayed in a list of popular media content from which the viewer can select to receive the requested movie for viewing.

In another example the popularity of media content can optionally be customized for a particular viewer in the popularity metadata . For example a viewer may enter a search request for a particular word such as Star in the search input field on display device . The search module may identify the programs Star Gazers and Star Singers as relevant media content to the search request. The tracking module may then rank Star Gazers as the most likely relevant media content for the viewer because a history of this viewer s television programming choices in the popularity metadata indicates that the viewer watches the program Star Gazers even though the program Star Singers may currently be a more popular program among multiple viewers.

In another example one friend may call another to say watch the reality show that is on right now and the called viewer can then enter a search request for Reality in the search input field . The search module can receive the search request for Reality and compare the search term entry to the popularity metadata and the genre metadata fields to locate the likely television reality program. The reality show can be identified by the tracking module as the likely viewer choice because the program is currently being broadcast and has been selected for viewing by many other viewers.

In an embodiment the tracking module can also rank television media content that is identified as being relevant to a search request based on a projected popularity of new television media content. When new or upcoming television media content is scheduled to be available the media content can be weighted to establish a popularity basis for the new media content.

In a projected popularity ranking scenario or optionally a manual ranking scenario a network operator at a content provider may assume that an upcoming event or program will be popular and often requested for viewing and or recording. However the upcoming event or program will not have any associated tracking and or popularity metadata to indicate a popularity history of the program before the program is available for viewing. Projected rankings may therefore be accomplished by manual assignment of popularity values to the upcoming media assets to match the operator s prediction of the popularity of the media. Alternatively popularity values can be derived from historical data e.g. for an annual show popularity ratings for the program historically or popularity of the content in other media forms e.g. for a new Pay Per View movie the popularity ranking can be derived from the movie s success in the theatres .

The tracking module can then rank the program having the weighted popularity as a likely selectable viewing option for a viewer. For example if a new movie that has been popular in the theatres is about to be released for video on demand viewing a network operator can project the popularity of the movie by weighting it to influence the popularity of the media content.

After the relevant television media content is identified by the search module the tracking module can rank the relevant television media content based on a popularity rating to determine popular media content in one or more embodiments. A list of the popular media content or just the higher ranking popular media content can then be displayed on the display device in response to a viewer initiated search request. An example of a list of popular media content is further described with reference to the example shown in . The media content can be ranked according to viewer s programming choices viewer s recording choices information requests that are initiated or spawned from initial search results and or by any other metric by which the media content can be ranked.

In alternate embodiments of media content search results ranked by popularity a content provider can be implemented to include a tracking module. A tracking module at a content provider can also update popularity metadata to track the various aspects of television programming and recording selections of multiple viewers at multiple television client devices. These embodiments are further described with reference to the example system shown in . Alternatively both content provider s and television client devices can include an implementation of tracking modules to track the television programming and recording selections together or optionally independently.

Further any of the television client devices can be implemented with any number and combination of differing components as further described with reference to the example client device shown in .

In this example content provider includes a tracking module having popularity metadata . In one or more embodiments tracking module can be implemented to track various aspects of television programming and recordings at the client systems N . For example the tracking module can track television programming choices selected by multiple viewers that interact with the client devices searches for television media content initiated by the multiple viewers television media content recorded by the multiple viewers listings for new television media content and or any other type of requests for television media content initiated by the multiple viewers at the various client systems N .

The tracking module can include popularity metadata from which the more popular media content can be determined. The popularity of television media content can be determined according to a popularity rating factor ranking and or index when tracking the various aspects of television programming and recordings at the client systems N . The tracking module can determine or develop a popularity rating for particular media content based on how often the media content is selected for viewing recording information requests and or any other type of viewer interaction.

The popularity metadata can include data and the real time tracking information corresponding to viewer programming choices search requests for media content recordings information requests new television media content and the like. In an embodiment the real time tracking information can be obtained via the communication network when implemented as a network that includes a back channel or other two way communication link between the content provider and the television client systems N . In an IPTV system such as shown in an IP based network provides two way communication via which the tracking module receives real time tracking information for viewer initiated media content interactions at the client systems N .

Although data streams of media content are not shown specifically the arrowed communication links and the communication network illustrate various data communication links that include data streams of media content. Additionally it is contemplated that any one or more of the arrowed communication links can facilitate two way data communication such as from the content provider to television client system and vice versa.

The popularity metadata can also include additional information such as ratings from ratings providers to approximate how many viewers watched a particular program. The popularity metadata can also include projected popularity rankings for new and or upcoming television media content that will likely be requested often by many viewers.

The tracking module can receive a search request for television media content via the communication network when the search request is initiated by a viewer at a television client system N . In one or more embodiments the tracking module can be implemented to rank television media content that is relevant to a search request based on the popularity rating as determined from the popularity metadata . A list of popular media content or just the higher ranking popular media content can then be displayed at a client system N in response to a viewer initiated search request.

The popularity metadata is one example of the popularity metadata included with the tracking modules and described with reference to . In one or more embodiments the tracking module can be implemented to track various television media content programming recording and information selections by a viewer or a group of viewers. The tracking module then maintains information pertaining to the tracked television programming choices recordings and information selections as the popularity metadata .

In this example the popularity metadata includes data and tracking information about television media content choices television programming choices searches for television media content recorded television media content information requests for television media content and or new television media content . The tracking module can rank television media content that is relevant to a search request based on a popularity rating to determine popular media content. The list of popular media content can then be generated to include all of the popular media content or just the higher ranking popular media content. The list of popular media content can be displayed at the client system in response to a viewer initiated search request for media content. A viewer at client device can then select a programming choice from the list with a remote control input device .

In one or more embodiments the list of popular media content can be displayed to optionally include paid placement of particular media content at a position in the list that is more prominent than popular media content without paid placement. For example a business method may allow a content provider to pay for the placement of a new video on demand movie at a prominent position in the list for likely viewer selection. In an example the list of popular media content can be displayed to include paid placement of particular media content at a first position in the list. Alternatively the list of popular media content can be displayed to include a likely viewer choice at the first position in the list.

In this example the list of popular media content includes paid placement of media content at the first position in the list and then includes likely viewer choices at the subsequent positions in the list. For example a likely viewer choice based on the television programming choices of the viewer e.g. a user history popularity can be displayed at a second position in the list. Further at least an additional likely viewer choice based on the television programming choices of multiple viewers e.g. a general history popularity can be displayed at a third position in the list.

In this example a viewer may enter a search request for a particular word such as Star in the search input field on display device . A search module of client device may then identify any number of various programs movies and or other media content corresponding to the search term Star . A tracking module of client device can then rank the various programs movies and or other media content i.e. the relevant television media content based on a popularity rating. The ordered list of relevant television media content can then be displayed from which a viewer can select one of the media content for viewing with the remote control input device .

The ordered list of search results for the television media content is shown on display device in a viewer navigable grid of a program guide that enables a viewer to navigate the grid and select media content for viewing. In addition to the list of television media content the ordered list can include any type of associated numeric and or channel designators as additional information about particular television media content.
