This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 404 390 filed Feb. 24 2012 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 486 153 filed Jun. 17 2009 which further claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 073 330 filed Jun. 17 2008. The foregoing related applications in their entirety are incorporated herein by reference.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women and one of the top two causes of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer in the world is increasing and it is estimated that the disease will affect 5 million women in the next decade. Treatments permit control of symptoms prolongation of survival and maintenance of quality of life. However in about 40 to 50 of all patients treated with curative intent incurable metastatic disease will develop. Since there is no cure for metastatic breast cancer current therapeutic goals are palliative.

In several cancer types deregulation of growth factor signaling is observed associated with a hyperactivation of the ErbB receptors. The ErbB receptor family includes ErbB 1 also known as HER 1 epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR ErbB 2 a.k.a. neu or HER 2 HER 3 a.k.a. ErbB 3 and HER 4 a.k.a. ErbB 4 . Overexpression of ErbB 1 is observed in non small cell lung cancer NSCLC 40 80 breast cancer 14 91 and pancreatic cancer 30 89 . In NSCLC activation by mutation of amplification of ErbB 1 also occurs in 10 to 30 of patients.

Overexpression of ErbB 2 usually resulting from erbB 2 gene amplification is observed in tumor tissue in 25 to 30 of patients of patients with metastatic breast cancer MBC and is associated with malignant transformation. ErbB 2 overexpression is usually associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype worse overall prognosis and faster relapse times at all stages of cancer development. In women with MBC this overexpression confers a relative resistance to treatment with either anthracycline alkylator or taxane based chemotherapy. ErbB 2 overexpression in tumorigenesis has been mainly studied in breast cancers but is also observed in other cancers.

Among current therapeutics for cancers specifically those characterized by overexpression of ErbB 2 are vinorelbine trastuzumab and HKI 272. Vinorelbine a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid having broad antitumor activity acts through microtubule disruption. Vinorelbine presents a lower neurotoxicity profile than vincristine or vinblastine. Vinorelbine has been shown to be less toxic to axonal microtubules than vincristine or vinblastine at therapeutic concentrations. In studies conducted on subjects with advanced breast cancer treatment with vinorelbine as a single agent is at least as efficient as other chemotherapies but with a lower risk of toxicity. However the risk of toxicity increases in parallel with the number of previous anticancer treatments.

Trastuzumab HERCEPTIN drug is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular domain of ErbB 2. It presents significant clinical benefit and significant antitumor activity when used alone or in combination with taxanes in metastatic breast cancer in first line treatment or in patients who have tumor progression after chemotherapy. Because of the improvement in survival trastuzumab based therapies have become standard of care for women with ErbB 2 positive MBC. For women with advanced or metastatic disease breast cancer eventually recurs despite trastuzumab treatment. Trastuzumab based therapy is also associated with potential cardiac toxicity. Certain breast cancer cells are resistant to trastuzumab due to the occurrence of secondary ErbB 2 mutations such as truncation of extracellular domain ErbB 2 receptor. Such mutations can result in cancer cells which are not recognized by the antibody.

In recent studies trastuzumab in combination with either vinorelbine or taxane paclitaxel with or without carboplatin or docetaxel was utilized to treat subjects with ErbB 2 overexpressing MBC. As expected the most frequent grade toxicity observed with the combination of trastuzumab and vinorelbine was neutropenia.

HKI 272 is a small molecule irreversible pan ErbB receptor inhibitor specific for epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB 1 or EGFR ErbB 2 HER 2 and ErbB 4 HER 4 . HKI 272 blocks kinase activity of the receptor through binding to the intracellular adenosine triphosphate ATP binding site of the receptor. HKI 272 blocks ErbB receptor autophosphorylation in cells at doses consistent with inhibition of cell proliferation. In vitro HKI 272 alone inhibits kinase activity of ErbB 1 ErbB 2 and HER 4 inhibits tumor cell growth with breast and lung tumor cell lines and presents a potent growth inhibition of lung cancer cells resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib. In vivo HKI 272 blocks tumor growth in xenograft animal models. Overall HKI 272 is less potent against ErbB 1 dependent tumors than ErbB 2 dependent tumors in vivo even though it has equivalent activity against the 2 kinases in vitro.

There remains a need in the art for therapeutic methods regimens compositions and kits which are useful in treating metastatic breast cancer and solid tumors.

This invention addresses the need in the art by providing regimens compositions and methods using a HKI 272 compound and a vinorelbine compound for the treatment of cancers such as solid tumors and metastatic breast cancer.

In one aspect regimens for treating a neoplasm in a subject are provided and include administering a vinorelbine compound and administering a HKI 272 compound. Desirably the vinorelbine compound is vinorelbine and the HKI 272 compound is HKI 272. In one embodiment the neoplasm is breast cancer.

In another aspect a regimen for treating a solid tumor associated with overexpression or amplification of HER 2 in a subject is provided wherein one cycle of the regimen includes 21 days. The regimen includes orally administering at least one unit dose of HKI 272 starting on day 1 of the cycle and intravenously administering at least one unit dose of vinorelbine on days 1 and 8 of the cycle.

In a further aspect a regimen for treating a metastatic cancer associated with overexpression or amplification of HER 2 in a subject is provided. One cycle of the regimen includes 21 days and the regimen includes orally administering at least one unit dose of HKI 272 starting on day 2 of the cycle and intravenously administering at least one unit dose of vinorelbine on days 1 and 8 of the cycle.

In still another aspect a product comprising a vinorelbine compound and HKI 272 compound is provided as a combined preparation for simultaneous separate or sequential use in treating a neoplasm in a mammal.

In yet a further aspect a pharmaceutical pack for treating a neoplasm in one individual mammal is provided and includes a at least one unit dose of vinorelbine and b at least one unit dose of HKI 272.

In another aspect a pharmaceutical composition is described and contains vinorelbine HKI 272 and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In still another aspect a method of treating a neoplasm associated with overexpression or amplification of HER 2 in a mammal in need thereof is provided and includes administering a unit dose of a vinorelbine compound and administering a unit dose of a HKI 272 compound.

Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention.

This invention provides compositions methods and regimens using a combination of a HKI 272 compound and a vinorelbine compound for the treatment of cancers. This invention provides in one embodiment compositions comprising HKI 272 and vinorelbine for the treatment of neoplasms. Also provided are products containing HKI 272 and vinorelbine formulated for simultaneous separate or sequential use in treating neoplasms in a mammal. The invention is also useful as an adjuvant and or neoadjuvant therapy of earlier stages of breast cancer. The invention provides in another embodiment methods for the combined use or administration of a HKI 272 compound and vinorelbine compound.

Without wishing to be bound by theory the inventors hypothesize that the combination of HKI 272 and vinorelbine for treating a neoplasm is desirable because HKI 272 targets the intracellular ErbB 2 kinase rather than the extracellular domain. Thus this combination has different mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance and then presents an advantage over the therapeutic combination of trastuzumab and vinorelbine. Further the combination of HKI 272 and vinorelbine is anticipated to be more effective than combinations of vinorelbine with other pan ErbB inhibitors due to the tyrosine kinase inhibition activity of HKI 272 through an irreversible binding at a targeted cysteine residue in the ATP binding pocket of the receptor.

These methods combinations and products are useful in the treatment of a variety of neoplasms particularly those associated with overexpression or amplification of HER 2. In one embodiment the neoplasm is a solid tumor or an advanced solid tumor. In a further embodiment the neoplasm is metastatic. In another embodiment neoplasms that may be treated as described herein include e.g. lung cancers such as bronchioalveolar carcinoma and non small cell lung cancer breast cancers such as metastatic breast cancer and HER 2 positive breast cancer prostate cancers myeloma head and neck cancer transitional cell carcinoma small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix. In still another embodiment the neoplasm is resistant to trastuzumab.

The regimens methods and compositions described herein include the concurrent simultaneous sequential or separate administration of the components i.e. a HKI 272 compound and a vinorelbine compound. The term composition as used herein is intended to cover both pharmaceutical compositions in which 2 or more components are mixed compositions of matter such as pharmaceutical kits and packs in which the components are individually packaged for concurrent simultaneous sequential or separate administration. In one aspect of the invention a combination includes simultaneous administration of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds. In a further aspect of the invention a combination includes sequential administration of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds. In one embodiment the HKI 272 is administered before the vinorelbine compound. In another embodiment the vinorelbine compound is administered before the HKI 272 compound. In another aspect a combination includes separate administration of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds in a particular therapeutic regimen in which the two components of the combination are administered at specific times and amounts with respect to each other. In one embodiment the combination of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds produces a more beneficial therapeutic effect than that achievable by the administration of either a HKI 272 compound alone or a vinorelbine compound alone. Where the administration of those agents is sequential or separate the delay in administering the second component should not be such as to lose the benefits provided the combination therapy.

In one embodiment the combination of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds is particularly well suited for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In another embodiment the combination of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds are well suited for treatment of breast kidney bladder mouth larynx esophagus stomach colon ovary and lung and polycystic kidney disease.

Suitable examples of pharmaceutical carriers used herein include but are not limited to excipients diluents fillers disintegrants lubricants and other agents that can function as a carrier. The term pharmaceutically acceptable excipient means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe non toxic and desirable and includes excipients that are acceptable for veterinary use as well as for human pharmaceutical use. Such excipients can be solid liquid semisolid or in the case of an aerosol composition gaseous. Pharmaceutical compositions are prepared in accordance with acceptable pharmaceutical procedures such as described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences 17th edition ed. Alfonoso R. Gennaro Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1985 . Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are those that are compatible with the other ingredients in the formulation and biologically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers for a tablet or caplet formulation include e.g. inert excipients such as lactose sodium carbonate calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or alginic acid binding agents such as gelatin or starch lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and anti oxidants such as ascorbic acid. Tablet or caplet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract or to improve their stability and or appearance using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art. In one embodiment the weight of the tablet is at least about 20 30 40 50 60 or 70 mg.

The regimens described herein may also include the administration of other agents. In one embodiment the regimen further includes administration of a taxane e.g. docetaxel and paclitaxel e.g. a suspension of paclitaxel bound to albumen nanoparticles which is available as the ABRAXANE reagent . Paclitaxel may also be administered on a weekly schedule at doses 60 100 mg madministered over 1 hour weekly or 2 3 weekly doses followed by a one week rest. In one embodiment paclitaxel is administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 175 mg m optionally followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg m or paclitaxel administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg m optionally followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg m. In patients previously treated with therapy for carcinoma paclitaxel can be injected at several doses and schedules. However the optimal regimen is not yet clear. The recommended regimen is paclitaxel 135 mg mor 175 mg madministered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks. These doses may be altered as needed or desired.

In another embodiment a combination described herein may further include an antineoplastic antimetabolite as described in US Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005 0187184 or 2002 0183239 which are hereby incorporated by reference. As used herein accordance the term antimetabolite means a substance which is structurally similar to a critical natural intermediate metabolite in a biochemical pathway leading to DNA or RNA synthesis which is used by the host in that pathway but acts to inhibit the completion of that pathway i.e. synthesis of DNA or RNA . More specifically antimetabolites typically function by 1 competing with metabolites for the catalytic or regulatory site of a key enzyme in DNA or RNA synthesis or 2 substitute for a metabolite that is normally incorporated into DNA or RNA and thereby producing a DNA or RNA that cannot support replication. Major categories of antimetabolites include 1 folic acid analogs which are inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase DHFR 2 purine analogs which mimic the natural purines adenine or guanine but are structurally different so they competitively or irreversibly inhibit nuclear processing of DNA or RNA and 3 pyrimidine analogs which mimic the natural pyrimidines cytosine thymidine and uracil but are structurally different so thy competitively or irreversibly inhibit nuclear processing of DNA or RNA. Representative examples of antimetabolites include without limitation 5 Fluorouracil 5 FU 5 fluoro 2 4 1H 3H pyrimidinedione topical cream FLUOROPLEX or EFUDEX drugs topical solution FLUOROPLEX or EFUDEX drugs injectable ADRUCIL drug or flurouracil floxuradine 2 deoxy 5 fluorouridine injectable FUDR or floxuradine thioguanine 2 amino 1 7 dihydro 6 H purine 6 thione oral tablets thioguanine cytarabine 4 amino 1 3 D arabinofuranosyl 2 1H pyrimidinone liposomal injectable DEPOCYT reagent liquid injectable cytarabine or CYTOSAR U drug fludarabine 9 H Purin 6 amine 2 fluoro 9 5 O phosphono D a rabinofuranosyl liquid injectable FLUDARA 6 Mercaptopurine 1 7 dihydro 6H purine 6 thione oral tablets PURINETHOL methotrexate MTX N 4 2 4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl L glutamic acid liquid injectable methotrexate sodium or FOLEX oral tablets methotrexate sodium gemcitabine 2 deoxy 2 2 difluorocytidine monohydrochloride isomer liquid injectable GEMZAR capecitabine 5 deoxy 5 fluoro N pentyloxy carbonyl cytidine oral tablet XELODA pentostatin R 3 2 deoxy beta D erythro pentofuranosyl 3 6 7 8 tetrahydroimidazo 4 5 d 1 3 diazepin 8 ol liquid injectable NIPENT trimetrexate 2 4 diamino 5 methyl 6 3 4 5 trimethoxyanilino methyl quinazoline mono D glucuronate liquid injectable NEUTREXIN cladribine 2 chloro 6 amino 9 2 deoxy D erythropento furanosyl purine liquid injectable LEUSTATIN .

The term biochemical modulating agent is well known and understood to those skilled in the art as an agent given as an adjunct to anti cancer therapy which serves to potentate its antineoplastic activity as well as counteract the side effects of the active agent e.g. an antimetabolite. Leucovorin and levofolinate are typically used as biochemical modulating agents for methotrexate and 5 FU therapy. Leucovorin 5 formyl 5 6 7 8 tetrahydrofolic acid is commercially available as an injectable liquid leucovorin calcium or WELLCOVORIN and as oral tablets leucovorin calcium . Levofolinate pharmacologically active isomer of 5 formyltetrahydrofolic acid is commercially available as an injectable containing ISOVORIN or as oral tablets ISOVORIN .

As used herein the term effective amount or pharmaceutically effective amount refers to the amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system animal individual or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician which includes one or more of the following 1 preventing the disease e.g. preventing a disease condition or disorder in an individual that may be predisposed to the disease condition or disorder but does not yet experience or display the pathology or symptomatology of the disease 2 inhibiting the disease e.g. inhibiting a disease condition or disorder in an individual that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease condition or disorder i.e. arresting or slowing further development of the pathology and or symptomatology and 3 ameliorating the disease e.g. ameliorating a disease condition or disorder in an individual that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease condition or disorder i.e. reversing the pathology and or symptomatology . For example an effective amount when administered to a subject to treat cancer is sufficient to inhibit slow reduce or eliminate tumor growth in a subject having cancer.

Use of a combination of the HKI 272 compound and vinorelbine compound also provides for the use of combinations of each of the agents in which one or both agent is used at subtherapeutically effective dosages. Subtherapeutically effective dosages may be readily determined by one of skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. In one embodiment the subtherapeutically effective dosage is a dosage which is effective at a lower dosage when used in the combination regimen described herein as compared to the dosage that is effective when used alone. Also provided are one or more of the active agents in the combinations herein to be used in a supratherapeutic amount i.e. at a higher dosage in the combination than when used alone. In this embodiment the other active agent s may be used in a therapeutic or subtherapeutic amount.

The term treating or treatment refers to any indicia of success in amelioration of an injury pathology or condition including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement remission diminishing of symptoms or making the injury pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient slowing the rate of degeneration or decline making the final point of degeneration less debilitating or improving a subject s physical or mental well being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters including the results of a physical examination neurological examination and or psychiatric evaluation. Accordingly the term treating includes the administration of the HKI 272 and vinorelbine compounds to a subject to prevent or delay to alleviate or to arrest or inhibit development of the symptoms or conditions associated with cancers including tumor growth associated with cancer. A skilled medical practitioner will know how to use standard methods to determine whether a patient is suffering from a disease associated with cancer by examining the patient and determining whether the patient is suffering from cancer.

As used herein the term providing with respect to providing a HKI 272 compound and a vinorelbine compound means either directly administering the HKI 272 compound and vinorelbine compound or administering a prodrug derivative or analog which will form an effective amount of the HKI 272 compound and or vinorelbine compound within the body.

Each column of wells contained a different dilution of HKI 272 and solutions of vinorelbine were added to each well at a variety of dilutions with respect to the HKI 272 dilutions the highest final concentration of HKI 272 was 1 M for the H1650 and H1666 cell lines the highest final concentration of HKI 272 was 9 M for the H1975 cell line and the highest final concentration of vinorelbine was 0.1 M for all of the cell lines . Following incubation of the cell plates at 37 C. 5 COfor 72 hours cell proliferation was assessed.

Patients having diagnosed non metastatic breast cancers are treated using a regimen of HKI 272 and vinorelbine. Patients are administered HKI 272 at either dose level 1 or 2. Dosing of HKI 272 begins at cycle 1 day 1 with daily oral administration of HKI 272 at the dosages in Table 3. HKI 272 is taken orally on the remaining days of the each cycle. On those days that HKI 272 and vinorelbine are administered on the same day i.e. days 1 and 8 of the cycle HKI 272 is administered prior to the vinorelbine infusion.

Vinorelbine is administered on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle provided that the combination of HKI 272 and vinorelbine is well tolerated and there is no evidence of disease progression. Vinorelbine is administered intravenously using preferentially a central venous route through a free flowing IV line over approximately 10 minutes followed by 125 mL of saline solution infused over approximately 30 minutes.

If the patient has any serious side effects during the treatment dose adjustments of HKI 272 and or vinorelbine are permitted. See Tables 4 and 5.
