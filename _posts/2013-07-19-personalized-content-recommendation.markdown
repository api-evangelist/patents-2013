The present subject matter relates in general to a method for content recommendation and in particular to a method for recommending personalized content.

Advances in electronic communication technologies have facilitated widespread distribution of media content. Personal computers handheld devices mobile phones set top box devices and other media content access devices are increasingly being used to access store download share and or process various types of media content such as video audio photographs and or multimedia. The advent of computer technology and entertainment until now has continued to provide new media content and selection options for consumers.

With the development of compact and portable mobile devices users are able to access multimedia content such as music and movie on personal mobile devices anytime and anywhere. On the go availability of content has allowed users to view content of their interests in a short span of time and in ways never possible using traditional broadcasting and reception techniques. When the technology is used effectively the user experience is smooth and leads to user satisfaction.

It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any block diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative systems embodying the principles of the present subject matter. Similarly it will be appreciated that any flow charts flow diagrams state transition diagrams pseudo code and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable medium and so executed by a computer or processor whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown.

The present subject matter relates to systems and methods for providing personalized content recommendation and content availability information. The systems which may implement the described methods may include systems capable of providing information to users like but not limited to desktop computers hand held devices laptops or other portable computers mobile phones and set top boxes. Although the description herein is with reference to set top boxes and smart phones the methods may be implemented in other devices and systems as well albeit with a few variations as will be understood by a person skilled in the art.

With advances in telecommunication technology such as internet and direct to home DTH exchange of the information has evolved multifold. Users are able to order download and view multimedia contents such as movies audio visual contents pictures etc. Also with the growth of computer performances personal computers can now store a large volume of information. In such environment users wish to access their multimedia content on their personal device anytime and anywhere. In the midst of such a vide variety of available content and content providers the user is perplexed to decide as to which content to watch and from which source.

For example television service providers provide a wide variety of channels to their users such as scheduled channels and on demand channels. These channels provide a large number of media content to the users at different time instances. More often than not based on competitor s services and attempt to reach to more number of users television service providers tend to provide option of more number of channels at lesser prices. Generally the television service providers while providing a large number of channels also provide a listing of available content with respect to each channel. Such a listing may either be in the form of printed catalogues or may be through a typical electronic program guide EPG . Television service providers providing DTH services sometimes also provide video on demand VOD content listings through a separate and distinct interface for the benefit of users. Therefore information of content available at each channel provided by television service providers is made available to the users. Similarly content aggregators such as YouTube and Netflix also provide a wide variety of content for consumers to rent buy or view for free.

Hence users today have various options of content providers providing different and varied contents through available modes of telecommunication. Although the availability of more content providers with increased content provides users with option of more choices or more number of channels the users are left confused and puzzled with questions such as what to watch when to watch and where to watch.

For instance when a user wishes to view a content of his choice the user may have to search for the content on various platforms. If the user wishes to watch a movie XYZ the user may browse for availability of the movie XYZ on websites at nearby theatres in various catalogues of television channels comments and suggestions about the movie in various blogs posters video clippings and the like. Therefore it is more of a cumbersome difficult and time consuming task for the users to identify a channel a content provider or a location where the content of their interest is available.

According to an implementation of present subject matter systems and methods for providing personalized content recommendation and content availability is described herein. On one hand the described methods may provide recommendation of contents based on personal preference of users and tailored to their interests on the other hand the methods may also provide information of such content s availability at various platforms. In other words the described methods provide with specific and relevant information related to any content available for the users to utilize. In said implementation the personalized content may include movies television programs theater performances music concerts sports matches stand up performances or any other audio visual content.

In an implementation available content for users may be filtered based on their interests and later provided to the users for viewing. The user may view the content of interest on any personalized device such as a television a smart TV a digital storage device a digital media adapter DMA a BLU RAY player a BLU RAY recorder a personal computer PC a laptop computer a tablet computer a personal computer television PC TV a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a portable video player a Smartphone an iPad or any other computing equipment or wireless device and or combination thereof.

In an implementation of the present subject matter to provide personalized content recommendation and content availability information content metadata is gathered based on certain user specific parameters. The user specific parameters may include but not limited to demographic data psychographic data and interests of other users in the user s geographical location. The demographic data may include data from a behavior graph of the people in the location the people s interests their likes and dislikes

The gathered content metadata may be stored in a repository. These content metadata are more content specific rather than source specific. The content metadata may be gathered as source specific and later may be converted to a content specific metadata. For example if users in a geographical location have viewed details regarding a recently released movie content metadata of the movie may be gathered based on number of people who have viewed the movie likes and dislikes made by the other users rating for the movie by the other users etc. The gathered content metadata of the movie may be specific to a source at which the movie is available. Such content metadata may be considered as source specific. Further availability of the movie at various sources description of the movie its posters stills of the movie and the like may be gathered and they may be regarded as content specific metadata.

In an implementation of the present subject matter to provide personalized recommendation of content to users a primary content metadata is determined from amongst the gathered content metadata based on a set of activity parameters. The activity parameters include factors such as historical viewing data of the user comments suggestions blogs likes dislikes and ratings for content from user s friends and data related to user viewed content on secondary sources such as websites relating to booking a movie ticket or relating to events happening in the geographical location.

In said implementation initially the primary content metadata may be gathered based on the historical viewing data of the user. The historical viewing data may include contents viewed or browsed by the user in his previous activities. Each activity may signify a level of interest associated with the contents and may be measured. For example the user may click on a content of his interest and such activity may be regarded as casual activity. Further the user may view more details associated with the content of his interest and may choose to rent the content. This activity may be regarded as genuine activity. The genuine activity indicates the affinity that the user has for the content. The content associated with the casual activity and genuine activity may comprise movies and television shows. Thus for example in relation to movies and television shows the primary content metadata gathered based on the historical viewing data of the user may include content metadata associated with celebrities and genre based on the movies and television shows.

However the primary content metadata may also be gathered based on suggestions from friends and user s viewing content at secondary sources. User s friend list from the user s social networking page may be collected and activity data of each friend may be obtained and measured. The activity data may indicate viewing patterns associated with the content and may be measured based on celebrity and genre which map to those celebrity and genre as in the historical viewing data of the user. For example if a friend views a content associated with a particular celebrity and genre and if this content maps to a content which is viewed by the user also then such a content may be scored as 1 . The scoring may be increased based on the number of friends who have viewed the content. Further the user may view multiple other contents such as quiz contests adventurous shows video songs news related to a sport and a recipe on other sources like YouTube and Netflix . The user may also express his interest on his social networking page.

Hence in operation a first set of content metadata may be identified based on the historical viewing data. The first set may include content metadata gathered individually for the content associated with historical view of users such as the celebrity and the genre. A second set of content metadata may be gathered based on likes dislikes and rating by the user s friends associated with other celebrities other genres or based on content viewed by the friends where the content is associated with the same interest of the user Further a third set of content metadata form viewing data of the user at secondary sources like YouTube Netflix etc. respectively may be also be gathered.

In one implementation of the present subject matter in order to determine the primary content metadata a combination of the three sets of content metadata the first set the second set and the third set and corresponding scoring of the content metadata may be considered. In an implementation the contents of the first set and the third set may be combined. This combination essentially includes content associated with user s interest either viewed at one platform or at multiple other platforms. It will be appreciated that the determining of primary content metadata may include combination of any two sets among the three sets or a union of the three sets in order to result in content metadata aligned to the likes preferences and interests of the user.

Further the primary content metadata may be rated or scored based on a content rating parameter. The content rating parameter may include but not limited to ratings of the content from various third party source ratings provided to the content by user s friends and a frequency with which the content is accessed by other users. For example if the primary content metadata describes a movie ABC the movie may be further rated based on content rating parameters. In such a situation if the movie ABC is previously viewed by three of user s friends then the primary content metadata for the movie may be scored as 3 . Further if there is a rating of 3.5 that has been provided to the movie by a movie rating agency the rating of 3.5 and 3 may be commonly considered to rate the movie ABC for the user. Similarly other platforms and their ratings may also be considered prior to generating a final rating score for the movie. In one implementation the scoring may also consider rating provided by the user s friends their likes and dislikes.

The third party source may include web sites and private portals which consist of content availability information and ratings of various contents. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that in order to rate the primary content metadata ratings may be obtained from various possible sources for effective rating.

In another implementation of the present subject matter a secondary content metadata may be determined based on the rated primary content metadata. The secondary content metadata may include highest rated primary content metadata or primary content metadata which have got a score above a pre determined threshold.

Further in one implementation the content availability information for content associated with the secondary content metadata may be obtained. The content availability information may be obtained during the initial gathering of content metadata or after the rating of primary content metadata. Finally the secondary content metadata with the content availability information may be recommended to the user. The recommendation may also be provided in a unified view which may include various other details about the content such as rating provided by the friends overall rating number of likes and dislikes indicated by thumbs up or thumbs down icons and comments related to the content.

In another implementation the user may enter his choice of interest and content gathering may be performed based on the choice of interest. Since the user indicates his choice the content gathering may be more deterministic. Personalized content recommendation in such cases also may include content availability information and content ratings.

System s implementing the disclosed method s include but are not limited to hand held devices multiprocessor system microprocessor based programmable consumer electronics laptops network computers minicomputers mainframe computers and the like. Although the present subject matter recites the word movies to illustrate the content the subject matter does not intent to limit the content to movies. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that content may also include any visuals or audio video content such as television programs advertisements etc.

It should be noted that the description merely illustrates the principles of the present subject matter. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements that although not explicitly described herein embody the principles of the present subject matter and are included within its spirit and scope. Furthermore all examples recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the present subject matter and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions. Moreover all statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the present subject matter as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass equivalents thereof.

It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the words during while and when as used herein are not exact terms that mean an action takes place instantly upon an initiating action but that there may be some small but reasonable delay such as a propagation delay between the initial action and the reaction that is initiated by the initial action.

While aspects of described system s and method s of personalized content recommendation system can be implemented in any number of different computing systems environments and or configurations the implementations are described in the context of the following exemplary system s and method s .

The system described herein can be implemented in any network environment comprising a variety of network devices including routers bridges servers computing devices storage devices etc. In one implementation the system is implemented in one or more user devices . . . N individually and commonly referred to as user device s hereinafter. The user devices may include multiple applications that may be running to perform several functions as required by different users and individual organizations. The system can be implemented in a computing device such as a laptop computer a desktop computer a notebook a workstation a mainframe computer a server and the like. The user devices may be implemented as but are not limited to desktop computers hand held devices laptops or other portable computers tablet computers mobile phones PDAs Smartphones land line phones and the like. In one implementation the user device is communicatively connected to one or more potential sources . . . N individually and commonly referred to as source s hereinafter which are capable of providing content through a network .

The network may be a wireless or a wired network or a combination thereof. The network can be a collection of individual networks interconnected with each other and functioning as a single large network e.g. the internet or an intranet . Examples of such individual networks include but are not limited to Global System for Mobile Communication GSM network Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS network Personal Communications Service PCS network Time Division Multiple Access TDMA network Code Division Multiple Access CDMA network Next Generation Network NGN Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN and Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN . Depending on the technology the network includes various network entities such as gateways routers however such details have been omitted for ease of understanding.

The source includes not limiting to websites private portals information retrieval databases and the like. Websites may include Facebook Twitter Orkut Picasa Hi5 and the like which are capable for sharing media contents text documents pictures blogs videos and or combinations thereof. Further the user device may also receive content from a telecommunication tower or a satellite communication tower hereinafter referred to as tower .

In one implementation of the present subject matter apart from the user device a user may utilize a set top box STB connected to a display unit such as the television TV to avail available content. The user device and the STB may also be connected through wireless network to facilitate easy transfer of data. The tower and the STB may be connected through wires and cables. In said implementation the system may also be implemented in the STB and may include a recommendation module .

According to an implementation of the present subject matter the system is configured to gather content metadata from various sources such as source and tower . In said implementation the gathering may be based on user specific parameters. To provide personalized recommendation of content and its availability a primary content metadata may be determined from amongst the gathered content metadata based on activity parameters. The primary content metadata may then be rated based on third party ratings to generate a secondary content metadata. The secondary content metadata from amongst the rated primary content metadata may then be recommended to the user by the recommending module . The recommended secondary content metadata may also include content availability information. The content availability information may convey details regarding where and when the content is available. For example the content availability information may be recited as Watch quiz contest on ABC channel at 8.30 pm .

The functions of the various elements shown in the figure including any functional blocks labeled as processor s may be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software. When provided by a processor the functions may be provided by a single dedicated processor by a single shared processor or by a plurality of individual processors some of which may be shared. Moreover explicit use of the term processor should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software and may implicitly include without limitation digital signal processor DSP hardware network processor application specific integrated circuit ASIC field programmable gate array FPGA read only memory ROM for storing software random access memory RAM non volatile storage. Other hardware conventional and or custom may also be included.

The interface s may include a variety of software and hardware interfaces for example interface for peripheral device s such as a keyboard a mouse a microphone an external memory a speaker and a printer. Further the interface s may include one or more ports for connecting the system with other computing devices such as web servers and external databases. The interface s may facilitate multiple communications within a wide variety of protocols and networks such as a network including wired networks e.g. LAN cable etc. and wireless networks e.g. WLAN cellular satellite etc.

The memory may be coupled to the processor and may include any computer readable medium known in the art including for example volatile memory such as Static Random Access Memory SRAM and Dynamic Random Access Memory DRAM and or non volatile memory such as Read Only Memory ROM Erasable Programmable ROMs EPROMs flash memories hard disks optical disks and magnetic tapes.

The system may also include module s and data . The modules and the data may be coupled to the processors . The modules amongst other things include routines programs objects components data structures etc. which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The modules may also be implemented as signal processor s state machine s logic circuitries and or any other device or component that manipulate signals based on operational instructions.

In another aspect of the present subject matter the modules may be computer readable instructions which when executed by a processor processing unit perform any of the described functionalities. The machine readable instructions may be stored on an electronic memory device hard disk optical disk or other machine readable storage medium or non transitory medium. In one implementation the computer readable instructions can be also be downloaded to a storage medium via a network connection.

The module s includes for example a content gathering module a primary content module a rating module a recommending module and other module s . The other module s include programs that supplement applications or functions performed by a personalized content recommending system such as system . The data serves amongst other things as a repository for storing data obtained and processed by one or more module s . The data includes for example user specific data activity data and other data . The other data includes data generated as a result of the execution of one or more modules in the other module s .

According to an implementation of the present subject matter the content gathering module is configured to gather content metadata from various sources based on user specific parameters. The user specific parameters can include but not limited to demographic data psychographic data and interests of general users in the user s geographical location. The demographic data may include data from a behavior graph of the people in the location the people s interests their likes and dislikes. A user s behavior may be determined through Application Programming Interface s APIs which may be utilized along with data mining techniques to identify interests likes and dislikes of users in a region.

As would be appreciated the gathered content metadata may be source specific where the content metadata defines that which source provides what all content. In other words content that is available at various sources may be identified while gathering the content metadata based on the user specific parameters. In case the content metadata is associated with movies or television shows the contents thus gathered based on user specific parameters may be associated with a celebrity and a genre. For example the content may be a movie and the movie may be associated with a celebrity C such as Jennifer Anniston Tom Cruise etc and genre G such as drama horror romance family animated etc. Such gathered content metadata may be converted to content metadata which are specific to the content associated with the content metadata. The content gathering module may also be configured to identify the celebrities and genres from content associated with user specific parameters and gather content metadata based on the celebrities and genres. The content specific content metadata may include various details about the content associated with content metadata such as its availability at various sources its posters description of the content news relating to the content etc. The gathered content metadata may be individually stored in user specific data .

The content gathering module may be further configured to obtain content availability information for the content associated with gathered content metadata. The content availability information may include details regarding the content such as time duration venue of content availability etc. For example the content availability information for a movie may share theatres at which the movie is played timings of playing the movie contact co ordinates of the theatre s channels which would telecast the movie along with timings and days sources from which the movie can either be bought or rented such as Netflix e commerce websites movie stores etc.

In one implementation of the present subject matter the primary content module is configured to identify a primary content metadata from the gathered content metadata based on activity parameters associated with the user. The activity parameters can include multiple factors such as historical viewing data of the user comments suggestions blogs likes dislikes and ratings for content from user s friends and data related to user viewing content on secondary sources.

The primary content module may determine the primary content metadata based on three different sets of content metadata. A first set of primary content metadata may be determined based on the historical viewing data of the user. The historical viewing data can include searches performed content viewed content rented content rated content purchased and content explored by the user in his previous activities. For example a user may have watched a lot of romantic movies in which many of the actors playing various roles were common. In such a scenario the primary content module may be configured to determine a first set of primary content metadata that includes romantic movies similar to what the user has watched and other movies of the actors which are common in the movies watched by the user. Each user activity may be assigned a qualitative score based on value added by the activity. Table 1 lists the activities that may be performed by the user and corresponding scores for such activities which are indicative of the value addition.

The user activities may include activities like check in and search. Such activities may be regarded as casual activities since they do not add much value addition to the gathering of primary content metadata. Activities like viewing details about the content rating the content renting the content may be considered as genuine activities. When all casual activities put together they may be scored less compared to the genuine activities put together. The genuine activities may be indicative of interest and affinity of the user associated with the content. The first set may also include other factors such as viewing format preferred by the user duration of the content and category of the content such as general parental guidance adult and the like. The user activities may be determined as depicted in table 2.

In said implementation the primary content module may also determine a second set of primary content metadata based on comments suggestions likes and dislikes of friends of the user. For example the friends of the user may have commented on few contents or may have suggested few contents for viewing. In such scenario the primary content module may gather primary content metadata based on the suggestions. If the suggested content is common with content in the historical viewing data the primary content module may gather content metadata associated with similar content. In other words if the suggestion made by the friends already exists in the first set the primary content module may gather content metadata related to the celebrity or genre of the suggested content. The likes and dislikes given by the friends may also enhance the primary content module for better content gathering. The primary content module may store the activities of the friends in activity data . The activities of the friends may also be scored as listed in table 1. The activities of the friends may indicate to the user the contents viewed by the friends and may be depicted as listed in table 3.

Further the primary content module may also determine a third set of primary content metadata based on content viewed accessed browsed by the user at secondary sources. For example if the first set of primary content metadata was gathered based on the content viewed by the user on his television through a set top box the third set of primary content metadata may be obtained through various secondary sources like websites visited by the user and the audio visual content viewed movie trailers viewed by the user at websites like YouTube news searched by the user through his Smartphone etc. The activities of the user at the secondary source Netflix may be depicted as shown in table 4.

Similarly in another example the user may have booked movie tickets through an e portal and may have searched for details regarding entry tickets to a cricket match. While watching the movie the user may update status in social networking sites as watching movie XYZ . The user may also comment on the movie suggest the movie to be watched by other users may like or dislike the movie by clicking on thumbs up or thumbs down icons respectively in websites which shares details about the movie. In such case primary content metadata similar to the movie with regards to celebrity or genre for which the user has booked tickets or a movie which the user has already viewed and the cricket match to be occurring may be gathered. Hence the primary content module may be configured to gather primary content metadata based on activity parameters associated with the user.

Every content that the user views may be segregated into categories such as general G parental guidance suggested PG parents strongly cautioned PG 13 restricted R and no one 17 and under admitted NC 17 . When the user views any content besides gathering the activities the primary content module may also ascertain a score based on the activity performed and the category to which the content belongs. The scoring of the activity of the user may be as depicted in Table 5 a and the scoring of the activity of the friends may be as depicted in Table 5 b .

In one implementation the activity of the user may also be scored based on the celebrity and genre associated with the content viewed. In order to recommend content which are aligned to the preference and interests of the user the primary content module may also consider the celebrity scores and the genre scores for the activities of the user. The celebrity score and the genre scores for the user activities may be as depicted in table 6 a and table 6 b respectively and the celebrity score and the genre scores for the friends activities may be as depicted in table 7 a and table 7 b respectively.

In one implementation the primary content module may determine a combination of all the content gathered through the first second and third set of primary content metadata scoring of the activities of the user and the category or genre with high score to identify a set of primary content metadata representing content to be recommended to the user associated with his interest and liking. In an implementation the primary content module may be further configured to identify presence of a particular primary content metadata in more than one set. If there exists a primary content metadata present in more than one set such primary content metadata may be scored with a high value or may be regarded as important to be recommended as compared to other content identified. The primary content module may also store details of the secondary sources history of searches and activities of user in the activity data .

When the primary content module has determined a final set of primary content metadata associated with a set of contents gathered based on the scores of activity associated with celebrity and genre the content gathering module may check for the availability of these contents on various sources such as the television in next 7 days. The content gathering module may be configured to obtain a choice of number of days from the user to check for the content availability for those days. For example the content availability information for the final set of primary content metadata may indicate the timings and channels for each of the content which may be aired on the next 7 days. In case where the user selects the number of days such as next 4 days etc. the content availability information for the telecast of the content for such number of days may be obtained. When a particular content not falling under the categories of movies or television shows the content gathering module may identify other sources where the content may be available. In case the content is a theatrical show or a drama the content gathering module may be obtain venue information timings description etc for the same drama or for other dramas.

In another implementation of the present subject matter the rating module is configured to generate a statistical profile of the user based on the user s likes and dislikes. The user s likes and dislikes may be determined based on user s activity parameters. The statistical profiling may be based on user preferences and interests. The user interests may also be ascertained by explicit method or implicit method. The explicit method of ascertaining user interests may include a set of questions to the user. The questions may be constructed in way to extract the user preferences. Such explicit ascertaining may be performed for a new user or for a user without any background information. From the answers to the questions preferences of the user may be studied. Implicit method of ascertaining user preferences may be performed while the user searches for content on various different sources. The statistical profiling may provide with a unified view of the user s interest based on his past activities. It would be understood that the statistical profiling may allow accountability for modifications in user s likes and dislikes from time to time which may also change over a period of time. In said implementation the primary content module may be further configured to utilize the statistical profiling of the user generated by the rating module to determine the set of primary content metadata from amongst the three sets of identified content metadata.

According to an implementation of the present subject matter the rating module is configured to rate the primary content metadata gathered in the three sets based on content rating parameter the scoring of the user activities and the scoring of the friends activities. The rating module can be configured to obtain ratings for the content associated with the primary content metadata from available rating sources and third parties including the sources . The content rating parameter may include rating from third party source such as IMDb Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer Flixter and Netflix and ratings given by the friends of the user. The rating module may rate the primary content metadata and the scoring list based on ratings obtained from source s or based on ratings obtained from third party source or rating given by the friends or combination of ratings to generate a consolidated rating for the content represented by the set of primary content metadata. The rated final set of primary content metadata may be obtained as two individual sets based on celebrity and scoring and may be as depicted in table 8 a and table 8 b respectively.

The recommending module may generate a set of secondary content metadata based on the final set of rated primary content metadata. The secondary content metadata may include primary content metadata with high ratings. The recommending module is further configured to provide the content availability information of the content represented by the secondary content metadata. For example the primary content module may determine 4 different contents to be recommended to a user based on activity parameters associated with the user and his available statistical profile. The rating module may then rate the 4 content based on content rating parameters where the rating of such contents is a combination of ratings available from third party sources such as IMDb Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer Flixter and Netflix . In such a scenario if from amongst the 4 contents the aggregate rating of only 3 contents is identified to be above a pre defined threshold the identified 3 contents may be identified as a secondary content metadata. The secondary content metadata may then be provided to the user as a recommendation along with the availability of the content associated with the secondary content metadata. In one implementation the recommended set of secondary content metadata may be depicted as in table 9 below. It will be appreciated that the table 9 is just a representation of the recommendation and shall not be treated as the exact recommendation provided. It may be understood by a person skilled in the art that the recommendation may include various colorful posters and pictures to illustrate or depict the recommended content.

In one implementation of the present subject matter from amongst the recommendations provided to the user based on the secondary content metadata on the user device the user may decide to access a content by selecting the content from amongst the recommendations. The selection may provide the user with access options based on the availability for the user to choose from. For example if the content which the user wishes to access is a movie which is available at multiple sources such as YouTube Netflix Channel A Channel B and in a multiplex nearby the options may be provided by the user to choose from. The user may choose to watch the movie at the multiplex and may select the option of multiplex. In such situations the recommendation module may redirect the user to the portal of the multiplex to allow the user to book a ticket based on his choice of time. It may also happen that the user may choose the watch the movie at channel B on his TV such as the TV . In such a situation the selection of the user for channel B may initiate the user device to act as a remote control and may cause the STB to switch to channel B. According to an implementation of the present subject matter the switching of the secondary content metadata onto a TV is performed through the set top box STB . The user device may provide a channel switch request to the STB such that the user may view the selected content on channel B.

According to implementation of the present subject matter the recommending module is still further configured to provide a mash up option and a second screen view in the user device . Based on the secondary content metadata which the user clicks as his preference the mash up option enables the user to view but not limited to promos profile of an actor photo gallery and ratings associated with the preference. The second screen view is provided to the user to view comments from the friends on a social networking page or a celebrity fan page. The second screen view may also enable the user to post his comments and ratings while watching the content telecast on the TV .

The method may be described in the general context of computer executable instructions. Generally computer executable instructions can include routines programs objects components data structures procedures modules functions etc. that perform particular functions or implement particular abstract data types. The method may also be practiced in a distributed computing environment where functions are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment computer executable instructions may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.

The order in which the method is described is not intended to be construed as a limitation and any number of the described method blocks can be combined in any order to implement the methods and or an alternative method. Additionally individual blocks may be deleted from the methods without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore the methods and can be implemented in any suitable hardware software firmware or combination thereof. The methods and is explained with reference to the personalized content recommendation system however it will be understood that the methods can be implemented in other systems as well.

Referring to method at block content metadata are gathered based on user specific parameters. The user specific parameters may include demographic data psychographic data and interests of other users in the user s geographical location. The demographic data may include data from a behavior graph of the people in the location the people s interests their likes and dislikes.

At block a primary content metadata is determined from amongst the gathered content metadata based on at least one activity parameter. The activity parameters may include multiple factors such as historical viewing data of the user comments suggestions blogs likes dislikes and ratings for content from user s friends and data related to user viewing content on secondary sources. The primary content metadata may be determined based on one of the activity parameters or a combination of parameters.

At block the primary content metadata is rated based on a content rating parameter to identify a secondary content metadata. The content rating parameter may include rating from third party source and ratings given by the friends of the user. The primary content metadata may be rated based on individual consideration of content rating parameters or may be based on combination of content rating parameters and at least one of the activity parameters.

At block content availability information for content associated with a secondary content metadata is ascertained. The secondary content metadata may be determined based on the ratings of the primary content metadata. The content availability information may include details related to the content such as when and where the content is available.

At block the secondary content metadata along with the content availability information is provided to the user in the user device.

Referring to the method at block at least one choice of the user associated to access a content is obtained. The choice made by the user may be based on the provided recommendation to the user through the secondary content metadata.

At block the user device establishes a connection with a set top box. The connection may be obtained through pairing the set top box to the user device. Once the user device and the set top box are connected with each other the user may be able to control the set top box from the user device. The connection may enable efficient transfer of data. Besides receiving data from the user device the set top box also receives television channel broadcasting data from a satellite television tower.

At block the user device causes the set top box to switch to a channel based on selection of associated content. The switching is enabled based content availability information of the content associated with the secondary content metadata.

In an implementation one or more of the method s described herein may be implemented at least in part as instructions embodied in a non transitory computer readable medium and executable by one or more computing devices. In general a processor for example a microprocessor receives instructions from a non transitory computer readable medium for example a memory and executes those instructions thereby performing one or more method s including one or more of the method s described herein. Such instructions may be stored and or transmitted using any of a variety of known computer readable media.
