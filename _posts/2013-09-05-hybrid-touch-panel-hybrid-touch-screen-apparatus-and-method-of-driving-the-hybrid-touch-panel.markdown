In the first gate line GLIN and the third gate line GLIN may be sensor gate lines activated during a sensing operation and the second gate line GLIN and the fourth gate line GLIN may be display gate lines activated during a display operation. In other words in the touch panel TP the display gate lines may be used to reset the sensing unit SENU.

The type of the second touch variation TVAL is different from that of the first touch variation TVAL. For example the first touch variation TVAL may indicate whether the touch panel TP is physically touched and the second touch variation TVAL may indicate whether the touch panel TP is optical touched as will be described in detail below. Unless specified otherwise it is hereinafter assumed that the first sub sensing unit SENU senses physical touch and the second sub sensing unit SENU senses optical touch.

Referring to the display unit DPU generates an image voltage Vimg corresponding to image data IDTA that is to be displayed in response to activation of a corresponding gate line among the first gate line GLIN to the fourth gate line GLIN. The first gate line GLIN to the fourth gate line GLIN may be different types of gate lines or some of the first gate line GLIN to the fourth gate line GLIN may be the same gate line. The first gate line GLIN to the fourth gate line GLIN may be disposed adjacent to or apart from one another and may each include a plurality of lines as will be described in detail below. A gate driver generates signals across the first gate GLIN to the fourth gate GLIN.

When a touch panel is an in cell type in which a display unit and a sensing unit are disposed on the same layer an aperture ratio may be reduced due to the sensing unit. To minimize a reduction in the aperture ratio a first electrode and a second electrode may be arranged as illustrated in .

Referring to in the touch panel TP both a first electrode ELT and a second electrode ELT may be formed at a first side of a liquid crystal LC. The first electrode ELT may be a pixel electrode and a second electrode ELT may be a common electrode.

As will be described below each of pixels included in the display unit DPU may include a transistor that is turned on to apply an image voltage Vimg to the first electrode ELT in response to activation of a display gate line DGL. The image voltage Vimg is a voltage that corresponds to the image data IDTA to be displayed and that is applied to a source line connected to one terminal of the transistor. A common voltage reference voltage may be applied to the second electrode ELT. A twisting degree of the liquid crystal LC varies according to the difference between voltages of the first electrode ELT and the second electrode ELT and the transmittance of backlight varies according to the twisting degree of the liquid crystal LC thereby displaying the image data IDTA.

As illustrated in in the touch panel TP the second electrode ELT may be used as a sensing electrode SELT that senses whether touch is made as will be described in detail below. In both the first electrode ELT and the second electrode ELT are formed at the first side of the liquid crystal LC whereas in a touch panel of a first electrode ELT is disposed at a first side of a liquid crystal LC and a second electrode ELT is disposed at a second side of a liquid crystal LC. In this case as illustrated in an aperture ratio may be reduced since the area of a sensing electrode SELT should be increased due to an interference effect occurring among the first electrode ELT the second electrode ELT and the sensing electrode SELT.

The touch panel TP may have the first electrode ELT and the second electrode ELT in a structure as illustrated in thereby preventing a reduction in the aperture ratio. A structure and operation of a sensing unit that performs sensing included in a touch panel in which a first electrode ELT and a second electrode ELT are included in the structure as illustrated in and the second electrode ELT is used as a sensing electrode SELT that senses whether touch is made will now be described.

The display unit DPU applies an image voltage Vimg to the first electrode ELT in response to the display gate line DGL. A liquid crystal may be driven according to a voltage difference Vdiff between the first electrode ELT and the second electrode ELT. Electric charges corresponding to the voltage difference Vdiff between the first electrode ELT and the second electrode ELT are charged in a storage capacity of the display unit DPU which is described in detail below. In the display gate line DGL may be the same as the second gate line GLIN or the fourth gate line GLIN illustrated in .

As described above the first sub sensing unit SENU senses whether a finger capacitance Cfig occurs due to physical touching of the touch panel TP based on a voltage variation Vvar at the second electrode ELT in response to activation of the sensor gate line SGL. The finger capacitance Cfig is a parasitic capacitance formed due to a voltage difference between a finger as an electric capacitor and the second electrode ELT caused by physical touch.

The sensor gate line SGL of may be the same as the first gate line GLIN of . The touch panel TP of includes the second sub sensing unit SENU similar to the touch panel TP of . Thus the touch panel TP of may sense not only physical touch but also another touch e.g. optical touch. However for convenience of explanation only the first sub sensing unit SENU that senses physical touch is illustrated in .

A value sensed by the first sub sensing unit SENU is output as sensing current Ivia the sensing line SLIN. A structure and operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU of will now be described in more detail.

As described above the second electrode ELT may be a common electrode. The gate line GLINmay be the same as the sensor gate line SGL of and the gate line GLINmay be the same as the display gate line DGL of . Thus the first selection transistor SELT is gated in response to activation of the sensor gate line SGL and supplies sensing current I which corresponds to a voltage variation Vvar at the second electrode ELT sensed by the first sensing transistor SENT to the sensing line SLIN.

The voltage variation Vvar at the second electrode ELT may be based on a ratio of a finger capacitance Cfig and a coupling capacitance Ccap between the second electrode ELT and the sensor gate line SGL. For example if the finger capacitance Cfig is not formed i.e. if touch is not made then a voltage of the second electrode ELT may be equal to a voltage applied to the sensor gate line SGL. However if the finger capacitance Cfig is formed for example if the finger capacitance Cfig and the coupling capacitance Ccap are the same then the voltage of the second electrode ELT may be half the voltage applied to the sensor gate line SGL. When the first sensing transistor SENT is turned on the first sensing transistor SENT may generate the sensing current Ito correspond to the ratio of the finger capacitance Cfig and the coupling capacitance Ccap.

After touch is sensed in response to activation of the sensor gate line SGL as described above the second electrode ELT is reset in response to deactivation of the sensor gate line SGL and activation of the display gate line DGL. For example the first reset transistor REST may reset the second electrode ELT by a common voltage.

Referring to both the other terminal of the first sensing transistor SENT and the other terminal of the first reset transistor REST may be connected to the sensor gate line SGL. By sharing the other terminal of the first sensing transistor SENT with another transistor a parasitic capacitance that may be generated due to a variation in the finger capacitance Cfig may be reduced.

As described above a coupling capacitance Ccap is formed by the second electrode ELT and the source and drain electrodes S and D and whether touch occurs may be sensed according to whether a finger capacitance Cfig occurs.

As described above the display unit DPU is activated by the display gate line DGL and applies an image voltage Vimg corresponding to image data IDTA transmitted via source lines SOUL to the first electrode ELT. The source lines SOUL may include three lines e.g. R G and B lines. Although not shown in the first electrode ELT may be connected to a drain of a switching transistor ST of the display unit DPU. A voltage difference Vdiff between the first electrode ELT and the second electrode ELT changes a cell capacitance Cto drive a liquid crystal to correspond to the image voltage Vimg. If the second electrode ELT is a common electrode a common voltage Vcom is applied to the second electrode ELT. A storage capacitor Cof the display unit DPU is charged to correspond to the image voltage Vimg.

A first display gate line DGL and a second display gate line DGL are sequentially activated a first display unit DPU and a second display unit DPU sequentially drive the liquid crystal and then the first sensor gate line SGL is activated. The second display gate line DGL may be the same as the second gate line GLIN of .

When the sensor gate line SGL is activated the display gate line DGL is deactivated and the first electrode ELT is thus floated. The liquid crystal may be maintained in a state driven by the second display unit DPU a voltage of a storage capacitor Cst of the second display unit DPU until a subsequent display gate line third display gate line DGL is activated.

When the first sensor gate line SGL is activated a voltage variation Vvar at the second electrode ELT due to generation of a finger capacitance Cfig is sensed as sensing current Ias described above. Although illustrates some sensing pixels SPIX of the first sub sensing unit SENU additional sensing pixels may be included in the first sensing unit SENU.

In a gate voltage of the first sensing transistor SENT of the first sub sensing unit SENU may have a first level L when the finger capacitance Cfig is formed and may have a second level L when the finger capacitance Cfig is not formed.

First reset transistors RESTand RESTof the first sub sensing unit SENU reset the second electrode ELT before and after a sensing operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU is performed. For example the first reset transistors RESTand the RESTmay reset the second electrode ELT with the common voltage Vcom.

After the first sensor gate line SGL is deactivated the third display gate line DGL is activated and the display and sensing operations described above are repeatedly performed. However as will be described below the sensing operation of the second sub sensing unit SENU may be different from that of the first sub sensing unit SENU. For convenience of explanation the second sub sensing unit SENU is not illustrated in .

Also one first sub sensing unit SENU may not be shared by two or more display units. As illustrated in one first sub sensing unit SENU may be included in each of display units. A case where one first sub sensing unit SENU is included in each of the display units may also be set according to touch sensitivity and display pixel size.

In the embodiment of the first sub sensing unit SENU includes both the first reset transistors RESTand RESTthat reset the second electrode ELT before a sensing operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU is performed and the second electrode ELT is reset after the sensing operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU is performed and when the display gate line DGL is activated but the example embodiments are not limited thereto.

Referring to a first sub sensing unit SENU of the touch panel TP may include only a first reset transistor REST and may additionally include a display reset unit DRU. Thus a second electrode ELT may be reset by the first reset transistor RESTbefore a sensing operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU is performed and may be reset by the display reset unit DRU in response to a display reset signal DRST after the sensing operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU is performed and when a display gate line DGL is activated. The display reset signal DRST may be transmitted to the display reset unit DRU by a control logic not shown that may be included in a touch screen apparatus THCA described below with reference to .

Examples of the first sub sensing unit SENU of have been described above. Examples of the second sub sensing unit SENU of will now be described.

Thus the touch panel TP is capable of sensing not only optical touch but also physical touch as described above and may thus by implementing a product employing a laser remote control technology e.g. an electronic blackboard or a large scale smart television TV . Furthermore since the touch panel TP is manufactured to be capable of sensing different types of touches manufacturing costs are reduced thereby securing competitive price. Also since the touch panel TP may perform sensing at high speeds through current sensing other than charge sensing the touch panel TP may be easily applied to a large scale panel using a high frame frequency. Optical sensing performed by the second sub sensing unit SENU of the touch panel TP will be described below in detail.

While a gate voltage that is lower than a threshold voltage is applied to the second sensing transistor SENT the second sensing transistor SENT senses a variation in a drain source current according to whether light is incident thereon. One terminal the other terminal and a gate of the second sensing transistor SENT are connected to a gate line GLINn the second selection transistor SELT and a gate line GLINn 1 respectively. The gate line GLINn may be the same as the third gate line GLIN of and the gate line GLINn 1 may be the same as the fourth gate line GLIN of . As described above the third gate line GLIN of may be a sensor gate line that is activated during a sensing operation and the fourth gate line GLIN may be a display gate line that is activated during a display operation.

One terminal the other terminal and a gate of the second selection transistor SELT may be connected to a sensing line SLIN the other terminal of the second sensing transistor SENT and the gate line GLINn respectively.

When the gate line GLINn is activated and a voltage that is higher than the threshold voltage is thus applied to the gate of the second selection transistor SELT the second selection transistor SELT is turned on. When the gate line GLINn 1 is deactivated the second sensing transistor SENT is turned off. Gate lines of the touch panel TP are sequentially activated such that only one of the gate lines is activated at a time. Thus while the gate line GLINn is activated the gate line GLINn 1 is deactivated. Thus the second sensing transistor SENT gated by the gate line GLINn 1 is turned off. As described above the second sensing transistor SENT may be a photo transistor embodied as an oxide semiconductor transistor.

Thus sensing current Icorresponding to the drain source current of the second sensing transistor SENT flows from the source the other terminal of the second sensing transistor SENT to the sensing line SLIN via the turned on second selection transistor SELT. The amount of the sensing current Isupplied to the sensing line SLIN from the second sensing transistor SENT varies according to the intensity of light incident on the second sensing transistor SENT as illustrated in .

When the gate line GLINn is deactivated and the gate line GLINn 1 is activated the second selection transistor SELT is turned off and the second sensing transistor SENT is turned on to reset the second sensing transistor SENT by a voltage applied to the gate line GLINn 1. Such a reset operation is performed to remove electric charges trapped in the second sensing transistor SENT which is a photo transistor as will be described in detail with reference to below.

For example when light and a negative gate voltage are supplied to the second sensing transistor SENT that is an oxide semiconductor transistor holes generated in the channel layer due to the light may be moved to and trapped at the interface between the gate insulating film and the channel layer. The trapped electric charges may not be removed until a sufficient high positive voltage is applied to a gate of the second sensing transistor SENT. Thus once the electric charges are trapped the amount of the drain source current Imay not be reduced even if the incident light is discontinued. The electric charges trapped in the second sensing transistor SENT that is an oxide semiconductor transistor may be removed through the reset operation as described above.

A touch panel capable of sensing light uses a fine optical sensing device capable of sensing light. An example of the optical sensing device may be an amorphous silicon TFT a Si TFT . When light is sensed using such an oxide semiconductor transistor electron mobility is high the light can thus be easily sensed and only a switch transistor second selection transistor SELT of for switching the oxide semiconductor transistor is used. Thus when a touch panel is designed or produced it is possible to remove limitations to increasing the size of the touch panel due to a parasitic capacitance and prevent a delay in a sensing operation.

When a first display gate line DGL and a second display gate line DGL are sequentially activated a first display unit DPU and a second display unit DPU sequentially drive a liquid crystal not shown and a first sensor gate line SGL is then activated. As a voltage applied to the first sensor gate line SGL changes from logic low L to logic high H and the first sensor gate line SGL is thus activated the first selection transistor SELT is turned on. Thus a voltage variation Vvar in a second electrode ELT caused by a finger capacitance Cfig is sensed as sensing current Iby a first sensing transistor SENT. As described above a gate voltage of the first sensing transistor SENT may have a first level L when the finger capacitance Cfig is formed and may have a second level L when the finger capacitance Cfig is not formed.

When the voltage applied to the first sensor gate line SGL changes again from the logic high H to logic low L and the first sensor gate line SGL is thus deactivated a third display gate line DGL and a fourth display gate line DGL are sequentially activated to perform a display operation. A reset operation of the first sub sensing unit SENU when the third display gate line DGL is activated is as described above and is not described here in detail.

Then a second sensor gate line SGL is activated. When a voltage applied to the second sensor gate line SGL changes from logic low L to logic high H and the second sensor gate line SGL is thus activated a second selection transistor SELT is turned on. Thus sensing current Icorresponding to a variation in light sensed by the second sensing transistor SENT is supplied to a sensing line SLIN. A reset operation of the second sub sensing unit SENU when a fifth display gate line DGL is activated is as described above and is not described again here.

For convenience of explanation in sources and drains of the switching transistor ST the second sensing transistor SENT and the second selection transistor SELT are not illustrated. The first sub sensing unit SENU and the second sub sensing unit SENU that may not be connected to each other are illustrated to be disposed adjacent to each other. Although not shown in a gate source or drain of each of the transistors may be connected to the gates lines DGL to DGL SGL and SGL of or the sensing line SLIN of via contacts not shown . However one terminal S of the first reset transistor REST is connected to a second electrode ELT a gate G of the first sensing transistor SENT is connected to the second electrode ELT and one terminal D of the first sensing transistor SENT is connected to one terminal S of the first selection transistor SELT.

The first sub sensing unit SENUsenses a first type of touch variation in response to activation of a gate line GLINn outputs sensing current Icorresponding to the first type of touch variation to a sensing line SLIN and is reset in response to deactivation of the gate line GLINand activation of a gate line GLIN. The second sub sensing unit SENUsenses a second type of touch variation which is different from the first type of touch variation in response to activation of a gate line GLIN outputs sensing current Icorresponding to the second type of touch variation to the sensing line SLIN and is reset in response to deactivation of the gate line GLINand activation of the gate line GLIN.

The gate line GLINof may be the same as the first gate line GLIN of and the gate line GLINof may be the same as the third gate line GLIN of . The gate line GLINof may be the same as the second gate line GLIN or the fourth gate line GLIN of .

For example the gate line GLINand the gate line GLINmay be disposed adjacent to each other. A common reset line RLINfor resetting the first sub sensing unit SENUand the second sub sensing unit SENUmay be connected to the same gate line GLIN. For example the gate line GLINmay be disposed adjacent to the gate line GLINor the gate line GLIN.

The node voltage Vmay be expressed as follows Equation 1 wherein V may denote a node voltage Vof a reset first node similar to a first voltage Villustrated in V denotes a voltage applied to the second electrode ELET of V denotes a voltage applied to a gate line GLIN and C denotes a reference capacitance.

Referring to a reference capacitance Cis a capacitance formed on a first layer LAY between a gate GAT and a first electrode ELET on a substrate SUB of the touch panel TP and the cell capacitance Cis a cell capacitance formed on a second layer LAY between the first electrode ELET and a second electrode ELET. The first layer LAY may be a layer treated with a gate insulator and passivation. The second layer LAY may be a layer filled with a conductive material. Locations of the first electrode ELET and the second electrode ELET illustrated in are just illustrative and example embodiments are not limited thereto. In the touch panel TP the first electrode ELET and the second electrode ELET may be disposed as illustrated in . illustrates a case where the reference capacitance Cis formed between the first node ND and an arbitrary gate line GLIN. An example of the arbitrary gate line GLINis described with reference to below.

When a physical touch occurs as illustrated in to reduce the thickness of the second layer LAY the reference capacitance Cis a fixed value but a cell capacitance Cincreases. Thus a node voltage Vis increased. When the node voltage Vis greater than a threshold voltage of the first sensing transistor SENT the first sensing transistor SENT is turned on to form drain source current corresponding to a gate source voltage of the first sensing transistor SENT.

In one terminal the other terminal and a gate of the first selection transistor SELT may be connected to a sensing line SLIN one terminal of the first sensing transistor SENT and a gate line GLIN respectively. The first selection transistor SELT may supply drain source current corresponding to a variation in a gate source voltage of the first sensing transistor SENT variation in the node voltage Vof the first node ND to the sensing line SLIN in response to activation of a first gate line.

One terminal the other terminal and a gate of the first reset transistor REST may be connected to a gate of the first sensing transistor SENT the gate line GLIN and a reset line RLIN respectively. Thus when the gate line GLINis deactivated and the reset line RLINis activated the first reset transistor REST is turned on to reset the node voltage V. As described above the reset line RLINmay be connected to a gate line GLINand may thus be activated in the same manner as the gate line GLINis activated.

While a gate voltage that is lower than a threshold voltage is applied to the second sensing transistor SENT the second sensing transistor SENT senses a variation in drain source current according to whether light is incident thereon. One terminal the other terminal and a gate of the second sensing transistor SENT are connected to a power supply voltage VDD source the second selection transistor SELT and a reset line RLIN. One terminal the other terminal and a gate of the second selection transistor SELT are connected to a sensing line SLIN the other end of the second sensing transistor SENT and a gate line GLIN.

When the gate line GLINis activated to apply a voltage which is equal to or higher than the threshold voltage to the gate of the second selection transistor SELT the second selection transistor SELT is turned on. On the other hand when the reset line RLINis deactivated the second sensing transistor SENT is turned off. As described above the reset line RLINis connected to a gate line other than the gate line GLIN. The gate lines of the touch panel TP are sequentially activated such that only one of the gate lines is activated at a time. Thus while the gate line GLINis activated the gate line connected to the reset line RLINare deactivated. Thus the second sensing transistor SENT gated by the reset line RLINis turned off.

Thus sensing current Icorresponding to drain source current of second sensing transistor SENT flows to the sensing line SLIN via the turned on second selection transistor SELT i.e. from the source the other end of the second sensing transistor SENT to the sensing line SLIN. The second selection transistor SELT may be turned off when the gate line GLINis deactivated and may be turned on and reset when the reset line RLINis activated.

Reset lines RLINof the first sub sensing unit SENU and the second sub sensing unit SENU may be commonly connected to a gate line GLIN. For example a gate line GLINconnected to the reset line RLINof and a gate line GLINconnected to the reset line RLINof may be commonly connected to the gate line GLIN. The gate line GLINmay be located adjacent to the gate line GLIN. The first sub sensing unit SENU and the second sub sensing unit SENU may sequentially perform the sensing operation and may be simultaneously reset in response to activation of the gate line GLIN.

A reference capacitor Cof the first sub sensing unit SENU included in the touch panel TP of is connected to the gate line GLINbut the example embodiments are not limited thereto. As described above the reference capacitor Cof the first sub sensing unit SENU may be a gate line e.g. a gate line GLIN not shown among the two gate lines adjacent to the gate line GLIN except for the gate line GLIN.

When a voltage applied to the gate line GLINchanges from logic low L to logic high H and the gate line GLINis thus activated the first selection transistor SELT is turned on to apply a variation node voltage V in a cell capacitance Csensed by the first sensing transistor SENT to the sensing line SLIN P Sensing . When the voltage applied to the gate line GLINchanges from logic high H to logic low L and the gate line GLINis thus deactivated a voltage applied to the gate line GLINadjacent to the gate line GLINchanges from logic log L to logic high H and the gate line GLINis thus activated to turn on the second selection transistor SELT. Thus a variation in light sensed by the second sensing transistor SENT is supplied to the sensing line SLIN P Sensing .

In this case as illustrated in the node voltage Vand the sensing current Ivary depending on whether a touch event occurs. If the gate line GLINis activated a physical touch as illustrated in is sensed the node voltage Vhas a voltage corresponding to the logic high H the gate line GLINis activated and an optical touch as illustrated in is sensed then the sensing current Iis maintained at logic high H.

When the gate line GLINis deactivated and the gate line GLINadjacent to the gate line GLINis activated a first reset transistor REST of the first sub sensing unit SENU and a second reset transistor REST of the second sub sensing unit SENU are turned on to simultaneously perform the reset operation described above on the node voltage Vand the second sensing transistor SENT P Reset Reset .

The touch panel TP senses an optical touch together with the physical touch. The second sub sensing unit SENU of supplies sensing current Icorresponding to a variation I in drain source current Iof the second sensing transistor SENT that changes from first current I to second current I due to the optical touch to the sensing line SLIN.

The gate lines GLINand GLINof may be the same as the first gate line GLIN and the third gate line GLIN of . The gate lines GLINand GLINof may be the same as the second gate line GLIN and the fourth gate line GLIN of . In other words the gate line GLINillustrated in may function as both a sensor gate line and a display gate line. This is because as illustrated in the sensing unit SENU is connected to a gate line to which a display unit DPU is connected in the touch panel TP of similar to the touch panel TP of .

Referring to a variation node voltage V in a cell capacitance Cis sensed when the gate line GLINis activated P Sensing and not only a variation in the intensity of light is sensed but also a first reset transistor REST of the first sub sensing unit SENU is reset when a gate line GLINis activated P Sensing Reset . When a gate line GLINis activated a second sensing transistor SENT of the second sub sensing unit SENU is reset P Reset .
