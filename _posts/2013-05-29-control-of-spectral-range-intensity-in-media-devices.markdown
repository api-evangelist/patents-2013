title: Control of spectral range intensity in media devices
abstract: Illumination of a display is controlled so as to modulate the intensity of emissions in one or more spectral ranges over time while content is being presented. Usage data indicative of user interaction with the presented content or previously presented content can be used to generate or modify a pattern profile. The pattern profile is used to control light emitters of a media device. Various operating modes respectively directed to decreasing or increasing intensity over time within certain portions of the visible spectrum can be used during the presentation of written, video or other content.

A wide variety of media devices are used to view written content video presentations and the like. Examples of such media devices include electronic book readers eBook readers tablet computers smartphones medical devices in vehicle systems wearable computers and other equipment. Users employ such media devices under differing circumstances including business or industrial settings while traveling on mass transit within academic classrooms and within their homes and other personal environments.

Certain implementations and embodiments will now be described more fully below with reference to the accompanying figures in which various aspects are shown. However various aspects may be implemented in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

Media devices allow users to view written video and other visual audio content by way of electronic apparatus. The electronic apparatus may include a display used to present viewable content to a user. Touch sensitive controls of the display or other user inputs allow the user to control consumption of the content. For example the user may activate controls to move forward or backward through written content such as by the turning of virtual pages initiate playback of video content halt such playback adjust sound volume and so on.

The displays may be constructed using backlit displays front lit displays emissive pixel displays or other suitable constructs. Light emitters used in these various contexts can include light emitting diodes LEDs quantum dots and so on. Other suitable illumination resources can also be used. In implementations using backlit or front lit displays a light distribution element such as a light guide formed as a sheet can be used to spread light from the light emitter or emitters uniformly over or behind the presentation area of the display. The result is that a user can view the presented content in situations having little or no ambient lighting.

The light emitters can be controlled to modulate intensity of spectral content of emitted light at one or more ranges of wavelengths. For example red green blue RGB LEDs have respective diodes corresponding to different regions of the visual spectrum and these diodes may be individually electrically biased or driven to provide a particular overall emission color as desired. Spectral content of the light emitters in the green and blue wavelengths for example may be selectively increased or decreased.

Research into the nature of human sleep suggests that there is a relationship between the color content of light viewed by a person and the secretion of melatonin in the brain. Melatonin is a hormone which participates in regulation of sleep wake cycles and the overall circadian rhythm of mammals including humans. In particular the secretion of melatonin may result in drowsiness and lower body temperature. Studies have shown that light in the blue region of the visible spectrum affects melatonin secretion or uptake and thus can inhibit the onset of sleep. Of particular interest is light in the spectral range of 400 nanometers to 550 nanometers with light at 484 nanometers perhaps being the wavelength of greatest effect on melatonin. Other ranges within the visible spectrum can also be of interest.

Users of media devices view many types of content under countless situations. In one illustrative scenario a user is reading a novel or other text prior to going to sleep. It is desirable to such a user to aid the natural onset of drowsiness and to fall asleep without undue difficulty. In another illustrative scenario a user is reviewing a training video having several key learning objectives. Such a user wishes to remain alert and have good retention of the material covered in the presentation even though viewing the video at a late hour. Therefore it is desirable to control the resources of a media device to aid such users in their respective goals.

In one example a media device controls its illumination resources so as to reduce light intensity within a spectral range of interest e.g. including blue light over time while content is being presented on a display. Such a reduction of intensity is performed according to a pattern profile i.e. a time dependent intensity modulation function and is directed to helping a user fall asleep normally or at least not inhibit such sleep . In another example a media device increases light intensity within the spectral range over time while content is being presented. Such an increase in intensity is performed according to a pattern profile and is directed to aiding a user in remaining awake and attentive.

Usage data both previously acquired and real time can be used by a processor or controller of a media device to define or select a pattern profile or to modify a pattern profile in use while content is being presented. The usage data may be acquired from the media device from other media devices or from other devices providing services to one or more media devices. Illustrative usage data can include without limitation content viewing times content viewing quantities content types user rates of viewing content rates at which a user is turning virtual pages user backtracking or rewinding within content or other characteristics of interaction with content.

Usage data from one or more media devices or other devices can be communicated to one or more servers configured to perform various analytical operations on the usage data. These analytical operations may include averaging bin sorting outlier filtering and so forth which are configured to address different media device user goals. Based on output from the analytical operations pattern profiles may be generated or modified. The pattern profiles processed usage data or both may be communicated back to the media devices for use during operations.

A pattern profile can include linear ramping increasing or decreasing one or more dwell periods non linear time dependent portions or other characteristics. Thus a pattern profile can describe a simple linear transition or a relatively complex piece wise construct of various functions. Each pattern profile is used by a lighting control module to control light intensity within a spectral range over time between an initial magnitude and a terminal magnitude. Thus various goals such as maintaining user wakefulness or aiding user restfulness may be aided by controlling spectral emissions from a media device while a user is viewing content thereon.

The media device also includes one or more light emitters each being configured and controlled to illuminate the display or a portion of the display such as in the case of an emissive display. Non limiting examples of light emitters includes light emitting diodes LEDs full spectrum or red green blue RGB LEDs quantum dots or other suitable entities. As depicted the media device includes a total of three light emitters distributed along an edge wise aspect of the display . Other light emitter counts or placements relative to the display can also be used. A light spreading entity such as a formed platen or light pipe array can also be used to uniformly illuminate the area of the display by way of the light emitters . Thus the light emitters collectively define at least part of an illumination resource of the media device .

The light emitters are individually controllable such that the overall color of light emitted from the display is selectively adjustable. That is a user sees or perceives an illuminated area that is uniform in color and intensity throughout the display . The illuminated area aids in viewing in low ambient lighting situations and does not obscure the presented content .

The media device includes a presentation module configured to present content using one or more of the output devices haptic auditory and so forth such as the display or another device or resource of the media device . The presentation module may be configured to produce audible output as well. The presentation module can be defined by or include any suitable resources or constituency such as without limitation machine executable program code electronic circuitry and the like.

A lighting control module is configured to control the respective light emitters . The lighting control module can be defined by or include any suitable constituency such as without limitation machine executable program code electronic circuitry and the like. In one example the lighting control module includes driver circuitry configured to individually drive or bias the light emitters in accordance with signaling received from a processor or controller of the media device .

Usage data is stored within the media device . The usage data is acquired during normal operation and corresponds to a user interaction with the presented content . Non limiting examples of the usage data include a period of time that presented content is presented a time of day that a user begins viewing the presented content a time of day that a user ends viewing the presented content a rate at which a user turns virtual pages of the presented content detection that a user has backtracked or rewound within the presented content detection that the media device is in motion during presentation of the presented content a geographic location of the media device during presentation of the presented content and so forth.

In one sense the usage data includes characteristics of the presented content viewing habits of a user . For example the usage data can indicate that the user views textual content e.g. a novel during evening hours presumably before going to sleep. In another example the usage data can indicate that the user views video content during morning hours while in motion perhaps on public transit. In still another example the usage data can indicate that a user typically slows their content viewing rate about a half hour prior to ending a content viewing session. Countless other correlations or conclusions can also be drawn using the usage data .

The usage data can also include user input or responses to various queries regarding operating preferences use of sleep or alertness aiding operating modes user feedback on the effectiveness of previously used operating modes and so forth. Such queries optional responses and the like can be presented as presented content on the display .

One or more pattern profiles are stored within the media device . Each pattern profile is defined by a time dependent function used for modulating the intensity of illumination over time from the media device within one or more spectral ranges of visible light. A pattern profile is used by the lighting control module or by a processor that signals the lighting control module so as to control the intensity within the spectral range s and thus the overall color of the light emitted by the lighting resources of the media device . Each pattern profile can be derived or generated using the usage data and can include linear ramping portions dwell portions non linear portions or other suitable characteristics.

The media device is configured to communicate with other entities by way of one or more networks . The networks can include the Internet or access thereto local area networks LANs wide area networks WANs and so on. Other media devices respectively being the same as or differing from the media device can also be connected to communicate with each other or other entities by way of the network s .

A content and operations server server is configured to communicate with the media device and the other media devices by way of one or more of the networks . The server is a remote entity with respect to the media device without regard for respective geographic locations. The server stores usage data . The usage data can include raw usage data received from the media device and the other media devices . The usage data can also include usage data that has been analyzed or processed by a lighting mode determination module . The lighting mode determination module is configured to process the usage data in accordance with any suitable statistical operation heuristic function or other suitable technique. Such processed usage data can also be communicated to the media device and the other media devices i.e. designated as usage data .

The lighting mode determination module may use the usage data to derive one or more pattern profiles . For example based on the usage data indicating particular times of day which the user reads text or watches video a particular pattern profile may be generated for that user . The pattern profile may be used as provided by the server or may be modified by the lighting control module of the media device . Some of the pattern profiles can be directed to assisting the user in the natural onset of sleep while viewing the presented content . Others of the pattern profiles can be directed to assisting the user in remaining alert while viewing the presented content . The pattern profiles one some or all can be communicated to the media device and the other media devices i.e. as pattern profiles by way of the network s .

In some implementations the lighting mode determination module may be configured to push or override the lighting control module of the media devices . For example the lighting mode determination module of the server may be configured to send a command or pattern profile to the media devices in use at a boarding school. This command or pattern profile may be configured to facilitate sleep at a particular time of day.

Account data is also stored within the server and may include information regarding individual users groups of users or demographics related to users . Non limiting examples of the account data can include user ages specific or bins geographic locations specific or regions content subscription data or histograms income information specific or bins billing or payment information and so forth. The account data may be used in generating or modifying one or more of the pattern profiles or put to other purposes.

Content is also stored within the server . The content can include text based viewable content videos having moving pictures and sound photographic images technical or business presentations static or video and so on. The content can be selectively communicated to the media device and the other media devices . In one or more examples the content includes one or more novels each formatted as some number of virtual pages that the user can proceed through forward or backward by gesturing input to the display . Other content can also be included.

The figures in this disclosure are illustrative. In some instances various features have been exaggerated in size for clarity of illustration. The figures are not necessarily to scale and may not necessarily be proportionate with one another.

The respective diodes i.e. light emitters of the graph can be individually controlled or modulated so that color content emitted by a display is selectively adjustable. Such modulation can be performed by a lighting control module in accordance with a pattern profile .

A graph depicts an emission intensity curve for normal operations of a media device . The graph is illustrative and the specific characteristics thereof are not limiting with respect to the present application. The graph corresponds to normal light intensities across a range of the visible spectrum while content is being viewed on a media device . That is the graph depicts a normal spectral response curve emitted by a display while presenting the full originally intended color for some presented content . In one example the graph depicts the spectral intensity curve that a user perceives at the beginning of a content viewing session.

Also depicted is a graph portion depicting a reduction of intensities for a portion of the spectrum of the graph . The graph portion corresponds to light intensities within a spectral range i.e. sub range that are reduced while content is being viewed on a media device . The graph portion corresponds to spectral content in or including the blue area of the visible spectrum. Continuing the example cited immediately above the graph as attenuated within the graph portion depicts an intensity curve that a user perceives at or near the end of a presented content viewing session. Thus the reduced blue content depicted by the graph portion is directed to aiding a user in the normal onset of sleep.

A graph depicts an emission intensity curve for other normal operations of a media device . The graph is illustrative and non limiting. The graph corresponds to light intensities across a range of the visible spectrum while presented content is being viewed on a media device . In one example the graph depicts the spectral intensity curve that a user perceives at the beginning of a presented content viewing session.

A graph portion depicts an increase of intensities for a portion of the graph . The graph portion corresponds to intensities within a spectral range including the blue portion of the visible spectrum which are increased while content is being viewed on a media device . The graph as enhanced within the graph portion depicts an intensity curve that a user perceives at or near the end of a presented content viewing session. The increased blue content depicted by the graph portion is directed to aiding a user in remaining alert while viewing presented content .

A spectral transition sequence sequence depicts a change or shift in the spectrum i.e. emitted light color content of display of the media device . The media device is characterized by initial spectrum at the beginning of the sequence . The initial spectrum includes intensities in the visual spectrum such that a normal color balance is perceived by a user at the beginning of a content viewing session or period. Notably intensities within a spectral range including the blue region of the visible spectrum are at normal or unmodified levels in the initial spectrum .

Later in the sequence the media device is characterized by an intermediate spectrum . The intermediate spectrum includes reduced intensities within the spectral range resulting in a somewhat redder or amber hue to the overall color emission. However the presented content remains clearly perceptible without being unduly distractive to a user .

At the end of the sequence the media device is characterized by a terminal spectrum . The terminal spectrum includes significantly reduced intensities within the spectral range resulting in a noticeably redder or amber overall color emission. The presented content remains clearly perceptible. The blue light content of the terminal spectrum is lesser than that of the intermediate spectrum which in turn is lesser than that of the initial spectrum .

A pattern profile represents or prescribes emission intensity within the spectral range that is attenuated over time during the sequence . Thus the pattern profile depicts a time dependent function used in controlling or modulating the light emitters of the media device .

The pattern profile includes a linear ramp portion extending from a beginning instant to a change instant. The linear ramp portion defines a temporal majority of the pattern profile . The intensity of emissions within the spectral range is decreased linearly over time during the linear ramp portion . The pattern profile also includes a dwell portion extending from the change instant to an end instant. The intensity of emissions within the spectral range is held constant during the dwell portion .

The spectral transition sequence and the pattern profile are illustrative of any number of operations wherein spectral emissions from a media device are modulated over time so as to reduce blue light content. The immediately foregoing operation is directed to aiding a user with the onset of drowsiness and sleep as is a typical goal when reading prior to bedtime.

The overall time span of the pattern profile can be any suitable period such as 40 minutes 1 hour 2 hours and so forth. In turn the reduction in intensity amplitude can be any suitable value of fraction such as one half 25 40 and so forth. The specific amplitude swing in spectral range intensity or the time period over which it occurs or both can be determined at least in part using usage data or processed or otherwise . Thus the pattern profile can be derived or calculated using previously acquired content presentation start and end times e.g. viewing session begins at night geographic location e.g. at home and so on.

Later in the sequence the display of the media device is characterized by an intermediate spectrum . The intermediate spectrum includes increased intensities within the spectral range resulting in a somewhat bluer hue to the overall color emission. However overall color control is such that presented content remains readily perceptible.

At the end of the sequence the display of the media device is characterized by a terminal spectrum . The terminal spectrum includes significantly increased intensities within the spectral range such that a noticeably bluer overall color emission results. Yet the presented content remains clear and readily perceptible. The blue light content of the terminal spectrum is greater than that of the intermediate spectrum which in turn is greater than that of the initial spectrum .

A pattern profile represents or prescribes emission intensity within the spectral range that is increased or enhanced over time during the sequence . Thus the pattern profile depicts a time dependent function used for controlling or modulating the light emitters of the media device .

The pattern profile includes a non linear portion that starts at a beginning instant. The intensity of emissions within the spectral range is increased non linearly e.g. logarithmically etc. over time during the non linear portion . The profile pattern also includes a first linear ramp portion that beginnings immediately after the non linear portion . The intensity of emissions within the spectral range increase linearly over time during the first linear ramp portion .

The pattern profile also includes a second linear ramp portion which begins immediately after the first linear ramp portion . The intensity of emissions within the spectral range increase linearly over time during the second linear ramp portion at a slope or time rate of change that is greater than that of the first linear ramp portion . The pattern profile further includes a third linear ramp portion which begins immediately after the second linear ramp portion and terminates at the end of the pattern profile . The intensity of emissions within the spectral range increase linearly over time during the third linear ramp portion at a slope that is lesser than that of the second linear ramp portion .

The spectral transition sequence and the pattern profile are illustrative of various contemplated operations such that emissions from a media device are modulated over time so as to increase blue light content. The immediately foregoing operation is directed to aiding a user in remaining alert so as to avoid drowsiness as is a typical goal when retention and understanding of viewing content is a priority such as during the later evening hours.

One or more of the respective portions or the pattern profile as a whole may be generated or characterized at least in part using one or more of the usage data or the account data . In one example the account data indicates that a particular user is in the 45 50 years of age bin. Usage data or correlated to the 45 50 years of age bin indicates that such users are aided to natural sleep if the non linear portion is defined by a particular function. Thus the pattern profile may be modified so as to include that particular function or its characteristics. Other uses of the account data or the usage data may also be performed.

Other operations may also be performed using the ambient light sensor .

Such orientation signaling may be correlated to a user position upright reclined and so forth during viewing of presented content .

Information sent to or generated within the media device can also include an indication of whether or not a user has backtracked turn back a page or pages or rewound and reviewed video content backtracking . Backtracking can be defined as yes no or I O flagging a quantification of the backtracked content or a cumulative count of detected backtracking events. In one example the backtracking indicates that a user backtracked 2 pages of written material during a current viewing session.

Information sent to or generated within the media device can also include an indication of whether or not the media device is in motion during a presentation of viewable content motion . Motion can be defined in simple yes no or I O flagging. Alternatively the motion can include a quantification of time or approximate average velocity of such motion such as determined by way of accelerometers. In one example the motion indicates that a user is in motion during a current viewing session.

Information sent to or generated within the media device can also include a geographic location of the media device during a presentation of viewable content location . Location can be defined in geographical coordinates as determined using the location sensor global positioning resources a postal zip code or telephonic area code as determined by cellular network communications and so forth. In one example the location indicates that a user is at their home address while viewing content during a current session.

Information sent to or generated within the media device can also include an orientation of the media device during a presentation of viewable content orientation . Orientation may be quantified in units of degrees or radians of arc away from either an upright or level position as determined using the orientation sensor . Roll or tilt angle of the media device about one or two other axis may also be respectively sensed and quantified. Other units of measure or corresponding data may also be used.

The media device can store accumulate or process any or all of above. Such accumulated information can define in whole or in part the usage data . In turn the usage data can be communicated in whole or in part to other media devices to the server or both by way of the network s . In turn the media device and the server can generate modify or communicate pattern profile s and respectively between each other or other entities.

Block determines a stop time and a pattern profile to be used with the presented content . For example a user may seek to view written material a novel on the display of the media device . Additionally the user is initiating such content presentation at 8 o clock in the evening. The media device determines by way of the processor s and the usage data that the user will likely read the presented content for 1 hour and then presumably retire to sleep.

The media device then selects a pattern profile in accordance with a sleep assistance mode modifying the pattern profile in accordance with the present mode. For purposes of a present example it is assumed that the media device selects the pattern profile and modifies its characteristics in accordance with the 1 hour estimated presentation period.

Block presents content on the display of the media device . In the present example a written novel received previously from the content of the server is presented on the display of the media device . Such presentation is made under the control of the processor s presentation module or other resources of the media device .

Contemporaneous with the beginning of the presented content the processor s signals the lighting control module causing it to drive or bias the light emitters such that a normal color balance of light illuminates the display . The illuminated area is characterized by light emissions having a normal spectral content in the blue light region of the visible spectrum i.e. the spectral range .

Block reduces intensity in the spectral range in accordance with the pattern profile . In the present example the processor s signals the lighting control module based on the modified pattern profile . This signaling causes the lighting control module to drive or bias the light emitters so as to reduce emissions within the spectral range over time resulting in reduced illumination in the blue range of the visual spectrum. Generally the pattern profile or another pattern profile is configured such that color content shift in the illumination of the media device is undetectable to the human eye on a moment to moment basis.

Block determines whether or not it is time to stop the presented content . The determination is made in accordance with 1 hour viewing time estimated at block . If the stop time has not yet arrived the process proceeds on to block . If the stop time has arrived the process proceeds on to block .

Block determines whether or not a user has slowed their rate of viewing the presented content . The determination is made in accordance with one or more detected user interactions with the presented content. In the present example the processor s determines if the user is turning virtual pages of content at lesser than a predetermined threshold rate. If content viewing has slowed per the detection schema then the process proceeds to block . If the content viewing has not slowed then the process proceeds back to block .

Block adjusts the pattern profile based on the determination made at block above. In the present example the pattern profile is further modified so as to reduce spectral range intensity at a greater rate that is by increasing the downward slope of the linear ramp portion . Thus the dwell portion may be extended in time reduced to a lower than originally determined magnitude or both. The 1 hour viewing time is preserved as the overall content presentation period in this example. The process then proceeds back to block .

Block triggers other operations of the media device . In the present example the stop time has arrived as determined at block . The processor s signals the lighting control module and other resources of the media device such that the presentation of written content the novel is ended. The media device can now shutdown present other content or perform other operations accordingly.

Block determines a viewing goal and a pattern profile for presented content . For example a user may seek to view a video presentation a business report on the display of the media device . Additionally the user is initiating the presented content at 9 o clock in the evening. The media device determines by way of the processor s and the usage data that the user will likely want to view the entire presentation which is 72 minutes long.

The media device then selects a pattern profile in accordance with an alertness assistance mode modifying the pattern profile in accordance with the present mode. For purposes of a present example it is assumed that the media device selects the pattern profile and modifies its characteristics in accordance with the 72 minute estimated presentation period.

Block presents content on the display of the media device . In the present example the business report received previously from the content of the server is presented on the display of the media device . Such presentation is made under the control of the processor s presentation module or other resources of the media device .

Contemporaneous with the beginning of the video content presentation the processor s signals the lighting control module causing it to drive the light emitters so as to illuminate the display with a normal color balance of light. The illuminated area is characterized by light emissions of normal spectral content including within the blue light region of the visible spectrum.

Block increases intensity in the spectral range in accordance with the pattern profile . In the present example the processor s signals the lighting control module based on the modified pattern profile . This signaling causes the lighting control module to drive the light emitters so as to increase emissions within the spectral range over time resulting in increased illumination color content in the blue range of the visual spectrum. The user perceives illumination of the display that is shifting or transitioning toward a bluer hue while the video content is being presented.

Block determines whether or not the user has reached the estimated presented content viewing goal. The determination is made in accordance with whether the full 72 minute video has yet been presented. If the video presentation is not yet complete then the process proceeds on to block . If the video presentation is complete then the process proceeds on to block .

Block determines whether or not the user has accelerated their rate of viewing the presented content . The determination is made in accordance with detected user interactions with the presented content . In the present example the processor s determines if the user is moving forward through the video at greater than normal playback speed by way of fast forwarding jumping forward in the video content or by another technique. If the presented content viewing has accelerated then the process proceeds to block . If the presented content viewing has not accelerated then the process proceeds back to block .

Block adjusts the pattern profile based on the determination made at block above. In the present example the pattern profile is further modified so as to increase spectral range intensity at a reduced rate in view of the determination that the user will likely finish viewing the presentation ahead of the estimated schedule. Thus one or more of the portions can be varied so that illumination in the spectral range blue light content is less intense at the end of the video presentation then as originally determined. The process proceeds back to block .

Block triggers other operation of the media device . In the present example all of the video content has been presented as determined at block . The processor s signals the lighting control module and other resources of the media device such that the presentation of video content is ended. The media device can now shutdown present other content or perform other operations accordingly.

Block determines a page turn rate. For example a user is viewing written content formatted as a sequence of virtual pages mimicking a book. The processor s determine a rate at which the user is turning virtual pages while the presented content is on the display . Such a rate can be quantified in units of pages minute seconds page and so forth.

Block determines if the page turn rate is below a threshold. In the present example the processor s compares the rate determined at block above with a predetermined threshold value. If the page turn rate is not lesser than the threshold value the process proceeds to block . If the page turn is lesser than the threshold value the process proceeds to block .

Block maintains a pattern profile of spectral range intensity. In the present example the processor s signals the lighting control module to modulate increase or decrease light emissions in a spectral range over time according to a presently used pattern profile . The present characteristics of that pattern profile are maintained in response to the comparison made at block above. The process proceeds back to block .

Block adjusts the pattern profile of spectral range intensity. In the present example the processor s alters one or more characteristics of the presently used pattern profile in response to the determination made at block above. For non limiting example respective ramping slopes portion time periods non linear functions or other attributes can be adjusted in accordance with detecting a slowing of the rate at which the user is viewing content. The process proceeds back to block .

Block detects for user backtracking while viewing content . For example a user is viewing written content formatted as a sequence of virtual pages. The processor s monitors the turning of virtual pages on the display . Such monitoring can include without limitation setting or toggling a bit or flag according to a backward progression through the presented material even if only a single page.

Block determines if backtracking was detected at block above. If backtracking is not detected the process proceeds to block . If backtracking is detected the process proceeds to block .

Block maintains a pattern profile of reduced spectral range intensity. In the present example the processor s signals the lighting control module to decrease light emissions in a spectral range over time according to a presently used pattern profile . The particular pattern profile being used corresponds to assisting a user in achieving a natural onset of sleep at the end of their estimated presented content viewing period. The process proceeds back to block .

Block adjusts the pattern profile of reduced spectral range intensity. In the present example backtracking is interpreted as indicating fatigue on the part of the user . The processor s responds to this interpretation by changing one or more characteristics of the current pattern profile . For non limiting example respective ramping slopes dwell portion time periods or other attributes can be adjusted in response to detecting user backtracking within the presented content . The process proceeds back to block .
