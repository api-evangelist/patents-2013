This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 598 713 filed on Feb. 14 2012 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

One embodiment is directed to a tray for use in a subrack of a rack the tray comprising a printed circuit board configured so that a plurality of connections can be made at a plurality of positions on the printed circuit board. Each of the plurality of connections involves at least one connector having an RFID tag associated therewith. The tray further comprises a plurality of RFID antennas integrated into the printed circuit board each the RFID antennas associated with a respective one of the positions. The printed circuit board is configured to localize a field emitted from each RFID antenna so that only the RFID tag associated with that RFID antenna is energized and read.

Another embodiment is directed to a method of using a tray. The tray comprises a printed circuit board and a plurality of RFID antennas integrated into the printed circuit board. Each the RFID antennas associated with a respective one of a plurality of positions on the printed circuit board. The method comprises making a plurality of connections at the plurality of positions on the printed circuit board. Each of the plurality of connections involves at least one connector having an RFID tag associated therewith. The method further comprises energizing and reading the RFID tags using the RFID antennas and localizing a field emitted from each RFID antenna so that only the RFID tag associated with that RFID antenna is energized and read.

Each subrack comprises an enclosure and a shelf . Each subrack is configured so that the shelf can slide in and out of an opening formed in the front of the enclosure . A front panel is attached to the front of the shelf so that when the shelf has been completely pushed into the enclosure the front panel can be flipped up to close the front opening of the enclosure . Also the font panel can be flipped done to allow the shelf to slide out of the enclosure .

Each subrack includes a backplate that extends generally vertically from the top of the shelf . Each subrack includes multiple trays that are vertically stacked. Each tray is rotatably mounted to the backplate so that the tray can flipped up in order to provide access to the tray that is underneath it if there is one . Also each tray is removably mounted to the backplate so that the tray can be easily removed from the subrack in order to assist in providing access to that tray or to trays that are underneath it. The tray can also be easily re mounted to the backplate .

In this example as shown in the backplate is vertically disposed at angle so that the trays are arranged in a stair step configuration though this need not be the case .

In the exemplary embodiments described here each tray incorporates managed connectivity technology. Generally a plurality of connections can be made at a plurality of positions on the tray where each of the plurality of connections involves at least one connector. The managed connectivity technology generally takes the form of a device for example an RFID tag or an EEPROM that is attached to or integrated into at least one connector used to make each such connection. Information is stored in the managed connectivity connector device. In these examples as explained in more detail below the tray is configured so that either side of the tray can be used as the patch side of the tray . Also the tray is configured to read the information stored in the managed connectivity devices.

More specifically in the example describe here each tray is configured to hold multiple fiber optic adapters where each adapter is associated with one of the plurality of positions where a connection can be made . Each adapter is configured to optically couple each optical fiber in a set of one or more optical fibers to a respective optical fiber in another set of one or more optical fibers. Typically each such set of one or more optical fibers is terminated with a connector . Most typically each such adapter is used to couple a single fiber to another single fiber. Each adapter comprises two ports to receive and hold the two connectors in place while optically coupling the fibers.

Examples of fiber optic adapters and connectors that can be used include SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors. Other adapters and connectors can used.

In this example the fiber optic adapters are arranged and held on the tray so that the ports on each side of the adapters all face the same direction and are aligned with one another. In the following description each tray and the adapters held by that tray are described as having a first or left side and a second or right side.

Also as shown in in this example each adapter is held on the tray by a plastic clip . This allows each fiber optic adapter to be easily removed and attached to the tray .

In this example each tray can be configured to have one side of the tray and adapters serve as the patch field or patch side . The patch side is the side of the tray and adapters where the optical patching is performed. The other side of the tray and adapters serve as the fixed side . Typically connectors attached to one end of optical patch cords are attached to the ports on the patch side. Connectors attached to the other end of the patch cords exit that tray and are typically connected to a port on the patch side of another adapter or another device in the network.

Connectors attached to one end of the fixed optical cabling are attached to the ports on the fixed sides. The fixed optical cabling can be an optical pigtail in which case the other end of the pigtail comprises a fiber that is spliced for example using a smooth to another longer optical fiber that exits the tray . The other end of the longer cable is connected as appropriate for example at another optical node located somewhere else in the network . The fixed optical cables that are connected to the ports on the fixed side of the tray can themselves exit the tray like the patch cords attached to the ports on the patch side of the tray and can be connected as appropriate for example at another optical node located somewhere else in the network .

As shown in each tray typically is configured to include two removable island assemblies where one island assembly is attached to the patch side of the tray and the other island assembly is attached to the fixed side of the tray . The island assemblies are configured to facilitate the routing and or splicing of the fiber optic cabling that is attached to the ports on that side. The island assemblies in each tray can be reconfigured as needed by removing and inserting appropriate island assemblies .

In this example the connectors attached to the patch side of the adapters have RFID tags shown in attached or integrated into them. The RFID tags store a unique identifier for the connector and or the patch cord that can be used to identify which patch cord is attached to each patch port . The RFID tags can store other information and can be written to as well as read from

A printed circuit board also referred to here as the tray PCB is attached to the bottom of each tray . The tray PCB includes a respective RFID antenna or coil and respective LED or other visual indicator positioned near each side of each fiber optic adapter . That is each fiber optic adapter has a associated pair of RFID antennas a first one of which is located near a first one port of the adapter and second one of which is located near the other port of the adapter .

Each RFID antenna or coil is used for reading an RFID tag inserted into the respective port and each LED or other visual indicator is used for visually identifying the respective port for example in connection with guiding a technician in carrying out a work order .

Even though the ports on only one side of the tray are used as the patch ports at any given time there are RFID antennas or coils and LEDs or other visual indicators positioned on each side of the adapters so that the same tray and tray PCB can be used to support patching on either side of the tray .

A PCB is mounted in the shelf of each subrack . This PCB is also referred to here as the subrack PCB or the subrack controller card . Components of the subrack PCB are coupled to components on each of the tray PCBs using a backplane PCB . The subrack PCB includes a flexible circuit or ribbon cable to which a suitable backplane connector is attached. This backplane connector is attached to a connector on the backplane PCB .

Likewise each tray PCB includes a flexible circuit or ribbon cable to which a suitable backplane connector is attached. This backplane connector is attached to a connector on the backplane PCB . In this example the backplane connector of each tray is held in place by a pair of tethers for example plastic tethers typically used for attaching price tags to items of clothing and the like that are attached to both the tray and the backplane connector . See . The tethers and backplane connector are configured so that when the tray is removed from the backplate backplane PCB the tethers will pull the backplane connector out of the connector on the backplane before the flexible circuit or ribbon cable is pulled on. This is done to protect the flexible circuit or ribbon cable from being damaged by removing the tray from the backplane . Also the tethers help hold the backplane connector in place to ease insertion of the backplane connector onto the connector on the backplane PCB when the tray is re attached.

In this example the backplate to which the trays are attached comprises the backplane PCB . That is the functions of the backplate are performed at least in part by the backplane PCB . Moreover the backplane PCB includes cut outs to which plastic strain relief cables can be attached. Strain relief cables are used to hold the fiber optic cabling attached to the ports of that tray in place so as to relieve the strain for example due to pulling on the cables that otherwise might affect the cables or the connections provided at the ports or splices housed in the tray .

As shown in the subrack PCB includes an RFID reader . The RFID reader can be selectively coupled to the pair of RFID antennas or coils positioned near each of the adapters in each subrack . To do this the subrack PCB includes a first multiplexer to couple the RF I O port of the RFID reader to another multiplexer located on one of the tray PCBs . A multiplexer located on each tray PCB is used to selectively couple the RF I O port of the RFID reader to one of the RFID antenna pairs included on that tray PCB .

In this way only one RFID reader is needed to read RFID tags associated with each of the many fiber optic adapters held on the many trays of the subrack .

A controller is located on the subrack PCB and a controller is located on each of the tray PCBs . Each controller and can be implemented using a suitable programmable processor for executing software. The software executing on the programmable processor performs at least some of the processing described here as being performed by each of the controllers and .

The subrack controller is coupled to the RFID reader the subrack multiplexer and an LED that is mounted to the subrack for example to the front panel of the subrack . Also the subrack controller is coupled to each of the tray controllers via the backplane .

Each tray controller is coupled to the tray multiplexer on that tray and the LEDs or other visual indicators on that tray .

The subrack controller is coupled to an overall rack controller also referred to here as the analyzer . The analyzer is configured to cause the subrack controller and the tray controllers to read the RFID tag that is attached to any connector inserted into each patch port . This can be done in a polling manner where periodically each such patch port is read. This can be done in other ways as well. Reading of a particular RFID tag is done by instructing the subrack controller and tray controller to configure the multiplexers and to couple the RFID reader to the appropriate RFID antennas or coils .

In order to reduce the I O pin count and trace routing complexity for a given adapter the RFID antennas and LEDs on both sides of the adapter are coupled to the tray controller and to power and ground using the same PCB traces. That is a first set of PCB traces for coupling the RFID antennas and LEDs on the left side of each adapter and a second separate set of PCB for coupling the RFID antennas and LEDs on the right side of that adapter need not be provided instead for each adapter only a single set of PCB traces need be provided for coupling the RFID antennas and LEDs on both sides of each adapter to the tray controller and power and ground.

The analyzer is also configured to communicate the information read from the RFID tags to middleware software in the manner described in the following US Patent Applications all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 152 624 filed on Feb. 13 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS AND METHODS also referred to here as the 624 Application U.S. patent application Ser.

In on example the middleware software includes or is coupled to a database or other data store not shown for storing the information provided to it. The middleware software also includes functionality that provides an interface for external devices or entities to access the information maintained by the middleware software . This access can include retrieving information from the middleware software as well as supplying information to the middleware software . In this example the middleware software is implemented as middleware that is able to provide such external devices and entities with transparent and convenient access to the information maintained by the middleware software . Because the middleware software aggregates information from the relevant devices in the network and provides external devices and entities with access to such information the external devices and entities do not need to individually interact with all of the devices in the network that provide such information nor do such devices need to have the capacity to respond to requests from such external devices and entities.

The middleware software in this example implements an application programming interface API by which application layer functionality can gain access to the physical layer information maintained by the middleware software using a software development kit SDK that describes and documents the API.

One example of such middleware software is the Infrastructure Configuration Manager ICM that is commercially available from TE Connectivity.

The analyzer is also configured to instruct the subrack controller and or the tray controllers to turn on the LEDs or other visual indicators as appropriate for example in connection with instructing a technician in carrying out a work order or to signal an error condition . For example the analyzer can be configured to guide a technician in carrying out a work order by visually signally which ports are to be affected by a particular step in the work order using the LEDs . Also the LEDs can be used to provide a visual indication as to whether each step was properly carried out. Data read from the RFID tags is also used to determine if each step was properly carried out for example in similar manner as is described in the previously mentioned US patent applications .

Communications occur between the analyzer and the subrack and tray PCBs and via a cable that connects the analyzer to the subrack PCB . Also power is supplied to the components on the subrack and tray PCBs and from the analyzer on this cable . In one example this connection is implemented as a RS422 serial connection. In this example as shown in the subrack PCB includes two connectors that can be used for connecting the cable from the analyzer to the subrack PCB . Also these two connectors can be oriented at an angle for example 30 degrees to 45 degrees to facilitate routing this cable in a manner that is compatible with the fiber optic cables in the rack . Either of the two connectors can be used depending on what is more convenient for connecting to the analyzer . Also the two connectors can be used to connect multiple subracks to the analyzer using a daisy chain topology.

As shown in the tray can include pockets in the plastic of the tray to accommodate components that are mounted to the underside of the tray PCB board . This enables the tray PCB to lay flat in the tray .

In order to support a high density of RFID antennas and fiber optic adapters it is helpful to be able to localize or constrain the field emitted from each RFID antenna so that only the appropriate RFID tag is energized and read. One of example of how to do this is shown in . The ground planes surround the conductive plane in which the RFID inductors coil or antenna are formed. Openings are formed in the upper ground plane in order to enable RF signals to pass between the RFID antenna and any RFID tag positioned above it. The rest of the ground plane serves to constrain the RFID signals. Also in this example the openings formed in the bottom of the ground plane serve to let some of the RFID signals escape through the bottom to reduce the size of the field that is created above the tray PCB .

The layers of the tray PCB are also configured so that for each RFID antenna on each tray the tray PCB includes a respective C shaped open copper track feature and a respective O shaped closed copper track feature that concentrically surround the coil assembly . In the particular example shown in the C shaped open feature is located inside of the O shaped closed feature . Each respective coil assembly C shaped open feature and O shaped closed feature are isolated from each another.

Each C shaped open feature provides a dampening field for producing a rectangular region of interest ROI box for addressing misalignment problems that may otherwise occur in general usage. Each C shaped open feature also provides rear field dampening to the tray below. Each O shaped closed features provides protection against cross talk that may otherwise occur among adjacent RFID antennas where each such O shaped closed feature is implemented as shorted turn that produces a corresponding nulling field.

In some embodiments it is necessary to position a daughter board onto the tray PCBs . For example in some embodiments a storage device such as an EEPROM is attached to each of the fiber optic connectors which is read in the manner described in the United States Patent Applications cited above. This is done instead of using RFID technology to read RFID tags . One example of this type of technology is the QUAREO technology that is commercially available from TE Connectivity. This technology is also referred to here as Connection Point Identifier or CPID technology.

In this example which can be implemented using QUAREO technology the storage device interface comprises four leads a power lead a ground lead a data lead and an extra lead that is reserved for future use. A suitable protocol for example the UNI O protocol can be used for communicating over the single data lead.

In such an example four contacts are positioned above each adapter that are configured to come into electrical contact with the four corresponding storage device leads on a connector inserted in that adapter . Appropriate traces are provided on the tray PCB in the tray to couple these adapter contacts to the tray controller via multiplexer and to power and ground. The connectivity between the subrack controller and the tray controllers is provided in the manner described above. In this way the QUAREO or similar CPID technology can be integrated into what is otherwise an RFID subrack to support the mixing and matching of CPID and RFID trays in the field.

The contacts for reading the storage devices also referred to here as CPID contacts can be attached to a daughter board shown in . It is helpful to precisely align this daughter board while attaching it to an appropriate daughter board connector on the tray PCB . One way of doing this is shown in . One side of the daughter board has one or more metal pins extending from it. The tray PCB includes a corresponding plastic post . The pins and posts are arranged so that each pin can be inserted into the top of a corresponding one of the posts on the tray PCB . In this way the connectors and on the daughterboard and tray PCB can more easily be connected while providing more precise alignment of the items on the daughter board for example the interfaces for reading the EEPROMS which in this example are positioned above the fiber optic adapters which are preferably precisely aligned in order to read the EEPROMS .

Also the CPID contacts can be placed on both sides of the adapters so that either side of the adapters can be used as the patch field in the manner described above connection with RFID versions of trays. In order to reduce the I O pin count and trace routing complexity for a given adapter CPID contacts on both sides of the adapter are coupled to the tray controller and to power and ground using the same PCB traces. That is a first set of PCB traces for coupling the CPID contacts on the left side of each adapter and a second separate set of PCB for coupling the CPID contacts on the right side of that adapter need not be provided instead for each adapter only a single set of PCB traces need be provided for coupling the CPID contacts on both sides of each adapter to the tray controller and power and ground.

Although the preceding examples have been described above in connection with optical connectors and adapters one of ordinary skill in the art can recognize that the techniques described here can be used with other types of communication media such as copper communication media connectors and jacks and plugs for example those described in the United States Patent Applications described above .
