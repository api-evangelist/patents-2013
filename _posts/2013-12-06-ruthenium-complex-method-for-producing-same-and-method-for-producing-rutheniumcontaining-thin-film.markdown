The present invention relates to a ruthenium complex useful as a raw material for the production of a semiconductor element a production method thereof and a method for producing a ruthenium containing thin film using the ruthenium complex.

Ruthenium has features e.g. exhibiting high electrical conductivity permitting the formation of an electrically conductive oxide having a high work function and ensuring excellent etching characteristics and excellent lattice matching with copper and therefore is attracting attention as a material for a memory electrode such as DRAM a gate electrode a copper wiring seed layer adhesion layer etc. In the next generation semiconductor device a highly miniaturized and highly three dimensional design is employed for the purpose of more enhancing the memory capacity or responsiveness. Accordingly in order to use ruthenium as a material constituting the next generation semiconductor device it is required to establish a technique of uniformly forming a ruthenium containing thin film with a thickness of approximately from a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers on a three dimensioned substrate. As the technique for producing a metal thin film on a three dimensioned substrate use of a vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction such as atomic layer deposition method ALD method and chemical vapor deposition method CVD method is believed promising. For example in the case of depositing metallic ruthenium as a next generation DRAM upper electrode by using this vapor deposition method a metal oxide such as ZrOis used as a capacitor insulating film for the underlying base and therefore the deposition may be performed under the conditions using an oxidizing gas. In the case of using ruthenium as a next generation DRAM lower electrode or a copper wiring seed layer adhesion layer titanium nitride tantalum nitride etc. is expected to be employed as a barrier metal for the underlying base. When a barrier metal is oxidized at the time of production of a ruthenium containing thin film there arises a problem such as deterioration of the barrier performance defective conduction to a transistor due to rise in the resistance value and reduction in the responsiveness resulting from an increased interconnection capacity. For the purpose of avoiding such a problem a material enabling the production of a ruthenium containing thin film even under the conditions without using an oxidizing gas such as oxygen and ozone is demanded.

In Non Patent Document 1 and Non Patent Document 2 2 4 dimethyl 1 oxa 2 4 pentadienyl 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ruthenium and 2 4 di tert butyl 1 oxa 2 4 pentadienyl 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ruthenium are described as a compound having a structure similar to that of the ruthenium complex 1a of the present invention. However the compounds described in those documents are limited to a complex having an 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. In addition the synthesis methods described in those documents are based on a reaction of chloro 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ruthenium with lithium enolate or a reaction of chloro 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ruthenium with an enone derivative and potassium carbonate and are different from the production method of the present invention. Furthermore those documents are absolutely silent as to using such a complex as a material for the production of a ruthenium containing thin film.

A cationic ruthenium complex cyclopentadienyl tris nitrile ruthenium is useful as a raw material for synthesis of various ruthenium complexes including the ruthenium complex of the present invention. Non Patent Document 3 describes a method for producing Ru CH MeCN PF by irradiating Ru CH CH PF with light in acetonitrile. In addition Non Patent Document 4 describes a method for producing Ru CH MeCN PF by reacting ruthenocene with aluminum chloride aluminum titanium chloride naphthalene and potassium borofluoride to prepare an naphthalene complex and further reacting acetonitrile therewith.

However the synthesis methods of a cationic tris nitrile complex described in Non Patent Document 3 and Non Patent Document 4 have a problem for example that equipment for intense ultraviolet irradiation is necessary or an expensive raw material or a large amount of a reactive agent is used and these methods can hardly be a practical production method excellent in the cost benefit.

As a cationic tris nitrile ruthenium complex having a monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand methylcyclopentadienyl tris acetonitrile ruthenium is described in Non Patent Document 5. In addition as a cationic ruthenium complex having a pentasubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl tris acetonitrile ruthenium is described in Non Patent Document 6. However there is no report on a cationic tris nitrile ruthenium complex having a monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand containing an alkyl group having a carbon number of 2 to 6.

In Non Patent Document 7 tricarbonyl 1 3 5 7 cyclooctatetraene ruthenium Ru CH CO tricarbonyl methyl 1 3 5 7 cyclooctatetraene ruthenium Ru CHMe CO and tricarbonyl ethyl 1 3 5 7 cyclooctatetraene ruthenium Ru CHEt CO are described as a compound capable of producing a metallic ruthenium thin film under the conditions using a reducing gas as the reaction gas. However the metallic ruthenium thin films produced using these compounds have a high resistivity of 93 152 and 125 cm respectively and can be hardly a practical material.

In Non Patent Document 8 1 3 5 6 cyclooctadienyl 2 3 4 5 tetramethylpyrrolyl ruthenium Ru 1 3 5 6 CH NCMe is described as a compound having a structure similar to that of the ruthenium complex 2 of the present invention. However the compound described in this document is limited to a complex having a 1 3 5 6 cyclooctadienyl ligand. In addition the synthesis method described in the document is based on a reaction of di chloro 1 5 cyclooctadiene ruthenium Ru CH Cl with 2 3 4 5 tetramethylpyrrolyl lithium and is different from the production method of the present invention. Furthermore the document is absolutely silent as to using this complex as a material for the production of a ruthenium containing thin film.

In Non Patent Document 9 6 exo methylcyclohexadienyl 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ruthenium is described as a compound having a structure similar to that of the ruthenium complex 3 of the present invention but the compound described in this document is limited to a complex having an 1 2 3 4 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. Furthermore the document is absolutely silent as to using this complex as a material for the production of a ruthenium containing thin film.

An object of the present invention is to provide a production method capable of producing a ruthenium containing thin film both under the conditions using an oxidizing gas as the reaction gas and under the conditions using a reducing gas as the reaction gas a ruthenium complex useful as a material for the production method and a method for producing the ruthenium complex.

In view of a high yield of the cationic tris nitrile complex 4 diethyl ether tetrahydrofuran acetone and methanol are preferred as the organic solvent.

In production method 2 the reaction temperature and the reaction time are not particularly limited and general conditions employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal complex may be used.

The method for obtaining the benzene derivative 14 includes the methods described for example in Tetrahedron Vol. 68 page 6535 2012 other than the purchase of a commercial product.

In view of a high yield of the cationic arene complex 10 1 mol or more of the benzene derivative is preferably used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative. The preferable amount of the protonic acid used varies depending on the kind of the protonic acid. For example in the case where the protonic acid is a monobasic acid in view of a high yield 1 mol or more of the protonic acid is preferably used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative and in the case of a dibasic acid 0.5 mol or more of the protonic acid is preferably used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative. In the case where a mixture of a fluoro complex anion containing salt and a strong acid is used as the protonic acid 1 mol or more of the fluoro complex anion containing salt and from 0.5 to 2.0 mol of the strong acid are appropriately used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative whereby the cationic arene complex 10 can be efficiently obtained.

For the reason that the yield of the cationic arene complex 10 is high production method 7 is preferably performed in an inert gas. Specific examples of the inert gas include helium neon argon krypton xenon and nitrogen gas with argon or nitrogen gas being preferred.

Of these organic solvents one kind may be used alone or a plurality of kinds may be mixed in an arbitrary ratio and used. In view of a high yield of the cationic arene complex 10 as the organic solvent diethyl ether tetrahydrofuran acetone methanol and acetonitrile are preferred.

In production method 7 the reaction temperature and the reaction time are not particularly limited and general conditions employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal complex may be used. As a specific example a reaction temperature appropriately selected from a temperature range of 80 C. to 150 C. and a reaction time appropriately selected from the range of 10 minutes to 120 hours are employed whereby the cationic arene complex 10 can be efficiently produced.

The purification method specifically includes filtration extraction centrifugation decantation crystallization etc.

The production method of a ruthenium containing thin film characterized by using a ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a is described in detail below.

The method for producing a ruthenium containing thin film of the present invention is a method of vaporizing a ruthenium complex represented by formula 1 2 or 3a and decomposing the ruthenium complex on a substrate and includes normal technical means employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal containing thin film. Specific examples thereof include a vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction such as CVD method and ALD method and a solution method such as dip coating method spin coating method and inkjet method. In the description of the present invention the vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction encompasses technical means usually employed by one skilled in the art for example a CVD method such as thermal CVD method plasma CVD method and optical CVD method and an ALD method. In the case of producing a ruthenium containing thin film by a vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction for the reason that a thin film is likely to be uniformly formed even on a substrate surface having a three dimensioned structure a chemical vapor deposition method is preferred and a CVD method or an ALD method is more preferred. The CVD method is more preferred in that the deposition rate is high and the ALD method is more preferred in that the step coverage is good. For example in the case of producing a ruthenium containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method the ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a is vaporized and supplied to a reaction chamber and the ruthenium complex 1 is decomposed on a substrate provided in the reaction chamber whereby a ruthenium containing thin film can be produced on the substrate. The method for decomposing the ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a include normal technical means employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal containing thin film. Specifically examples thereof include a method of reacting the ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a with a reaction gas and a method of causing heat plasma light etc. to act on the ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a . By appropriately selecting and using such a decomposition method a ruthenium containing thin film can be produced. It is also possible to use a plurality of decomposition methods in combination. The method for supplying the ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a to a reaction chamber includes for example bubbling and a liquid vaporization supply system but is not particularly limited.

The carrier gas and diluent gas when producing a ruthenium containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method are preferably a rare gas such as helium neon argon krypton and xenon or a nitrogen gas and among others a nitrogen gas helium neon or argon is preferred for the economical reason. The flow rate of the carrier gas and diluent gas is appropriately adjusted according to the capacity of the reaction chamber and the like. For example in the case where the capacity of the reaction chamber is from 1 to 10 L the flow rate of the carrier gas is not particularly limited and is preferably from 1 to 10 000 sccm for the economical reason. Here sccm is a unit representing the flow rate of a gas and in terms of an ideal gas 1 sccm indicates that the gas is moving at a speed of 2.68 mmol h.

The reaction gas when producing a ruthenium containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method includes for example a reducing gas such as ammonia hydrogen monosilane and hydrazine and an oxidizing gas such as oxygen ozone water vapor hydrogen peroxide laughter gas hydrogen chloride nitric acid gas formic acid and acetic acid. From the standpoint that the restriction on the specification of a deposition apparatus is little and handling is easy ammonia hydrogen oxygen ozone and water vapor are preferred. In the case of producing a ruthenium containing thin film under the conditions using as the reaction gas a reducing gas but not an oxidizing gas ammonia is preferred in that the deposition rate of the ruthenium containing thin film is high. The flow rate of the reaction gas is appropriately adjusted according to the reactivity of the material and the volume of the reaction chamber. For example when the volume of the reaction chamber is from 1 to 10 L the flow rate of the reaction gas is not particularly limited and is preferably from 1 to 10 000 sccm for the economical reason.

The substrate temperature when producing a ruthenium containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method is appropriately selected according to use or non use of heat plasma light etc. the kind of the reaction gas or the like. For example in the case of using ammonia as the reaction gas without using light or plasma in combination the substrate temperature is not particularly limited and is preferably from 200 to 1 000 C. for the economical reason. In view of a high deposition rate the substrate temperature is preferably from 300 to 750 C. more preferably from 350 to 700 C. In addition by appropriately using light plasma ozone hydrogen peroxide etc. the ruthenium containing thin film can be produced in a temperature region of 200 C. or less.

As the ruthenium containing thin film obtained by the production method of the present invention for example in the case of the ruthenium complex alone a metallic ruthenium thin film a ruthenium oxide thin film a ruthenium nitride thin film a ruthenium oxynitride thin film etc. are obtained and in the case of using the ruthenium complex in combination with other metallic materials a ruthenium containing composite thin film is obtained. For example when the ruthenium complex is used in combination with a strontium material an SrRuOthin film is obtained. The strontium material includes for example strontium bis dipivaloylmethanate diethoxystrontium strontium bis 1 1 1 5 5 5 hexafluoro 2 4 pentanedionate . In addition when producing a ruthenium containing composite thin oxide by a CVD method or an ALD method the ruthenium complex 1 2 or 3a and other metallic materials may be supplied separately to the reaction chamber or may be mixed and then supplied.

The ruthenium complex 1a may be formed into a ruthenium containing thin film similarly to the ruthenium complex 1 .

By using the ruthenium containing thin film of the present invention as a constituent member a high performance semiconductor device enhanced in the memory capacity or responsiveness can be produced. Examples of the semiconductor device includes a semiconductor memory device such as DRAM FeRAM and ReRAM and a field effect transistor. Examples of the constituent member thereof include a capacitor electrode a gate electrode and copper wiring liner.

The measurement conditions were acceleration voltage 5 kV observation magnitude 100 000 times and sample pretreatment cutting of sample resin embedding ion milling processing of cross section.

A ruthenium containing thin film was produced by the thermal CVD method using the ruthenium complex 1 obtained in Example 9. The apparatus used for the thin film production is sketched in . The deposition conditions are as follows.

Material container temperature 64 C. vapor pressure of material 5.3 Pa total pressure in material container 6.7 kPa substrate temperature 400 C. flow rate of carrier gas 30 sccm material feed rate 0.024 sccm flow rate of ammonia 50 sccm flow rate of diluent gas 20 sccm hole substrate SiO Si hole diameter 400 nm hole depth 800 nm and deposition time 5 hours. Argon was used as the carrier gas.

The produced thin film was confirmed by X ray fluorescence analysis as a result a characteristic X ray based on ruthenium was detected. The film thickness was computed from the intensity of X ray detected and found to be 7 nm. The electrical properties of the ruthenium containing thin film produced were measured by the four probe method and the resistivity was found to be 712 cm. When the cross section of the film was observed by FE SEM the film thickness was the same between the hole opening and the hole bottom FIG. . It is understood from Evaluation Examples 1 and 2 that the ruthenium complex of the present invention can produce a uniform film on an uneven surface at a low temperature of 400 C. or less even without using an oxidizing gas.

While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
