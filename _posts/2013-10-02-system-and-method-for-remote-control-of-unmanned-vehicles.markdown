This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 709 091. The contents of that application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The use of autonomous or unmanned vehicles is growing. Unmanned vehicles may be suitable for a variety of industries including construction manufacturing and military. While there are many advantages associated with the use of autonomous vehicles there are also several issues.

On such issue is safety. For example how do we ensure that unmanned vehicles can be stopped should they become unresponsive due to a software malfunction or when a remote operator becomes incapacitated or otherwise loses control of the vehicle Another issue is interoperability. Currently there exist many proprietary systems for unmanned vehicles making it difficult to design systems or applications that will work across a variety of vehicle systems and types.

An open architecture control system is provided that may be used for remote and semi autonomous operation of commercial off the shelf COTS and custom robotic systems platforms and vehicles to enable safer neutralization of explosive hazards and other services. In order to effectively deal with rapidly evolving threats and highly variable operational environments the control system is built using an open architecture and includes a high level of interoperability. The control system interfaces with a large range of robotic systems and vehicles autonomy software packages perception systems and manipulation peripherals to enable prosecution of complex missions effectively. Because the control system is open and does not constrain the end user to a single robotics system mobile platform or peripheral hardware and software the control system may be used to assist with a multitude of missions beyond explosive hazard detection and clearance.

In an implementation a method may include receiving a current location of an operator at an instrument control system of an unmanned vehicle determining a leading distance of the unmanned vehicle by the instrument control system determining a current location of the unmanned vehicle by the instrument control system determining if a difference between the current location of the operator and the current location of the unmanned vehicle is less than the leading distance and if so increasing the speed of the unmanned vehicle by the instrument control system.

In some implementations the method may further include determining if a difference between the current location of the operator and the current location of the unmanned vehicle is greater than the leading distance and if so decreasing the speed of the unmanned vehicle by the instrument control system.

In some implementations the system may further include that the first signal is a heartbeat signal and the software based failsafe may determine not to halt the machinery associated with the e stop based on the heartbeat signal. The first signal may be a stop signal and the software based failsafe may determine to halt the machinery associated with the e stop based on the stop signal. The system may further include that the e stop controller is further adapted to determine whether to halt the machinery associated with the e stop and if so sever the wireless connection between the first radio and the second radio. Severing the wireless connection may include turning off the first radio. Determining whether to halt the machinery associated with the e stop may include determining that a second signal has not been received from the e stop for more than a threshold amount of time. The second signal may be a heartbeat signal.

In some implementations the system may further include a plurality of e stops and e stop controllers wherein the plurality of e stops and e stop controllers form a mesh network.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The OIP may be designed to allow for easy integration with respect to one or more components through the API. Examples of such components are illustrated in and include autonomy software component perception component unmanned system component and manipulation components . Other components may be supported.

As will be described further below the OIP may further include one or more built in or base features. One example of such a feature is the ability to interface and control a variety of vehicles. The OIP may support a variety of vehicle control interfaces including Drive by wire for example. Other vehicle control interfaces may be supported. The vehicle control commands and protocols used for a variety of vehicle types may be abstracted by the API into a single vehicle control library of functions allowing users and programmers to create a single custom software component that may be used to control a variety of vehicle types using the API. The OIP may similarly provide a single library of functions that may be used to control and interact with a variety of sensors and peripheral devices.

Another example of an integrated feature is safety features. The safety features may be integrated into the OIP and kept separate from the other components of the OIP such that one or more of the autonomy software components unmanned system components perception components and manipulation components can be changed by users without compromising the safety of the system as a whole. Further such built in safety features allow users to create their own components for the OIP using the API without having to consider how to implement safety features or worrying about interfering with existing safety features.

Any unmanned system developed using the OIP as the integration hub may achieve the following advantages when compared with existing systems 

Flexibility The flexible API provided by the OIP allows for a wide variety of components to be easily added or removed from any unmanned system that uses the OIP . For example users may add or remove components from the unmanned system as threats mission needs technologies or budgets change. The open system of the OIP ensures that the user can use a range of sensors and or software components from a wide range of providers in their unmanned system not just those provided by the original manufacturer of the unmanned system.

Safety By separating the safety features from the computation engine any unmanned system built using the OIP is assured a high level of safety. Furthermore an open system built on OIP may allow the components to be changed or modified without affecting the safety features of the system.

Speed Any unmanned vehicle built using the OIP includes locked down protocols for low level critical commands and safety supervision. Because these crucial elements of the system remain unchanged all other elements of the system can be changed much faster than if the core elements had to be redesigned and integrated.

Cost Any customer or partner using the OIP may be able to avoid substantial development costs for the base hardware and software that enables unmanned system integration. By relying on the OIP for this core a user would benefit from significant development and testing already completed for the OIP .

Innovation Threats tasks technologies and budgets change all the time in the world of unmanned systems and increased innovation is required to confront such complexity. By utilizing an open system the OIP the user customer partner and stakeholders can rely on a wealth of easily integrated existing technology to help solve problems and reduce complexity much faster cheaper and with higher quality than with closed systems.

The OCU on the other hand may provide one or more customizable user interfaces through which one or more users may control the vehicle through the VICS . The user interfaces may also be used to view data provided by the VICS or from the peripheral devices associated with the VICS . Other components and or subsystems may be supported. The peripheral device devices may include but are not limited to cameras lights weapons and other sensors.

Together the OCU and the VICS may be used to provide control over an unmanned vehicle and may allow one or more operators of the unmanned vehicle to view and share data provided by one or more of the peripheral devices or from the vehicle itself.

In some implementations the VICS may include a Vehicle Systems Controller VSC . The VSC may be adapted to non destructably interface with a variety of vehicles using a variety of interfaces and or control systems such as Drive by wire J1939 Direct drive electric motors typically found in small robots and Hydraulic or mechanical controls. Other systems or interfaces may be supported. The VSC may receive a variety of diagnostic and status information from the vehicle including but not limited to speed temperature oil pressure fuel level tire pressure or any other information supplied by a vehicle in its normal operational state. The VSC may also include one or more integrated sensors such as an accelerometer a GPS or other location detection means a magnetometer a thermometer and a barometer for example. Other sensors may also be supported. The VCS may be implemented using a general purpose computing device such as the computing system described with respect to . An exemplary VCS is described further with respect to .

The VSC may provide such information to one or more users associated with the OCU through a wireless communication means that may be integrated into the VSC i.e. Bluetooth Wi Fi etc. . Alternatively or additionally the VSC may provide such information to one or more smart phones tablets or any other devices that are able to receive data via a wireless interface.

For example an owner of a fleet of construction vehicles may use the OCU or a smart phone associated with the owner to query a VSC connected to each of the vehicles in the fleet. Each VSC may receive the query and may provide the status information associated with its associated vehicle to the OCU . The owner may then use the status information assisted with each vehicle to determine which vehicles may require servicing.

The VSC may also control the operation of the vehicle through the one or more interfaces. For example the VSC may control the throttle brakes transmission lights locks or any other systems of a vehicle that may be controlled electronically through an interface. In some implementations the VSC may control the operation of the vehicle based on one or more signals received directly from the OCU . In other implementations the VSC may control the operation of the vehicle based on one or more signals received directly from an Instrument Control System ICS of the VICS .

In some implementations the ICS may include electrical and computer networking components and may interface with and provide power to a variety of components including lights sensors and cameras i.e. the peripheral devices . The supported computer networking components may include Ethernet powered or unpowered USB Bluetooth eSATA or any other type of networking or connecting means. The ICS may receive power from a vehicle that the ICS is mounted to or may include its own power source such as a battery or one or more solar panels. In implementations where the ICS receives power from the vehicle the ICS may include a fuse or other means to limit the amount of current that is drawn from the vehicle. The ICS may be attached to a vehicle through a roof mount. Other vehicle locations or attachment means may be supported.

The ICS may further include a locating means . The locating means may determine the location of the ICS and therefore the location of the vehicle that the ICS is attached to. Any one of a variety of technologies for determining locations such as GPS and cellular triangulation may be used.

The ICS may a wireless interface . The wireless interface may include one or more radios and may be capable of receiving one or more control signals from the OCU . The ICS may further be capable of transmitting data from one or more of the peripheral devices that are connected to the ICS through the one or more radios of the wireless interface . The transmitted data may include output from the VSC e.g. information from and about the vehicle including speed oil pressure and other diagnostic information signals from one or more of the peripheral devices connected to the ICS e.g. video audio temperature and other sensor data and location information determined by the locating means . In some implementations both the control signals from the OCU and the data signals from the ICS may be received and provided by the same radio and or frequencies of the wireless interface . Alternatively different radios and or frequencies may be used for control signals and data signals. The ICS may be implemented by a general purpose computing device such as the computing system described with respect to .

The ICS may further include one or more emergency stops e stops . When the ICS receives a signal from the e stop the ICS may immediately disable the vehicle by sending the appropriate signal s to the VSC . For example in one implementation the e stop may be highly visible button that is located inside and or outside the vehicle. When the button is pushed the ICS may signal the VSC to immediately stop the vehicle by applying the brakes and or disengaging the throttle for example. The particular steps or actions that occur upon engaging an e stop may be set by a user or administrator. The e stops may be both wired and wireless. In addition in some implementations the e stop signal may also be received directly by the VSC providing additional safety protection and isolation from the various components of the ICS . The e stops may be integrated into the OIP may be integrated into a third party control and automation system or may function as a stand alone system as will be described further bellow.

In some implementations each e stop may be wirelessly controlled by one or more e stop controllers . When a user or operator of the e stop controller determines that the vehicle or other stationary and non stationary machinery such as factory equipment or farm equipment should be stopped the user may use the e stop controller to send a stop signal to the e stop corresponding to the vehicle. The e stop may then receive the stop signal and may instruct the ICS and or VSC to deactivate the vehicle.

In some implementations each e stop associated with a vehicle or VICS may have its own associated e stop controller . Alternatively one e stop controller may be associated with a variety of e stops within a selected range of the e stop controller or are otherwise paired with the e stop controller . For example a fleet of unmanned vehicles may be used on a construction site. Each vehicle may have a VICS with an associated e stop . One or more foremen associated with the construction site may receive an e stop controller a wireless dongle for example that is associated with or paired with the e stops of all the vehicles used on the construction site. If a foreman believes that an accident has occurred or that the safety of a worker is being compromised the foreman may activate the e stop controller which will cause each associated e stop to disengage its associated vehicle.

In another implementation a user associated with an e stop controller may select the particular e stop that it would like to send a stop signal to. For example the e stop controller may have a display that includes a list of the e stops and or the vehicles or machinery associated with each e stop . A supervisor could use the display of the e stop controller to choose a specific vehicle or machinery that is behaving in an unsafe manner or may be malfunctioning and may activate the e stop associated with that vehicle or machinery only. Such remote e stop controller functionality could be distributed to multiple individuals with safety responsibility forming a distributed network of e stops and e stop controllers . Any individual in this network could choose any machine within the network that they would like to stop using the e stop controller and activate the e stop for that vehicle specifically to disengage it. Both the e stop and e stop controller may be implemented using a general purpose computing device such as the computing system illustrated with respect to .

Additional safety features may be integrated into the VSC . For example in some implementations the VSC may receive what is referred to as heartbeat signal from the ICS that indicates that the IC is receiving signals from OCU . If the heartbeat signal is not received by the VSC from the ICS the VSC may immediately shut down or disengage the vehicle or alternatively may gradually slow the vehicle. By providing the safety functionality within the VSC rather than the ICS the safety of the vehicle is not compromised by the particular sensors or peripheral devices that are connected to the ICS.

The ICS may further include a Shared Control Module SCM . The SCM may be a computing device such as the computing system and may provide the API functionality described herein. The ICS may allow one or more customized control modules to interface with the ICS and the one or more peripheral devices that are connected to the ICS including the VSC . Thus for example a user may interact with the sensors connected to the ICS using the API provided by the SCM . The SCM may then translate the various function calls of the API into the particular format or protocols expected by each peripheral device . Similarly a user may create an application that controls the vehicle using the API without knowing the particular functions or protocols used by the vehicle. The SCM may then translate the function calls of the API according to various functions and or protocols that are expected by the vehicle. Thus the SCM provides a layer of abstraction of the vehicle and peripheral device interfaces that allows a single application to work with a wide variety of vehicle and peripheral device types.

The OCU may include a hand held controller HHC . The HHC may be a controller that provides control data or instructions to the ICS and or directly the VSC . In some implementations the HHC may include one or more analogue control sticks and or buttons that may be used to control the steering braking throttle and other functionality of the vehicle. The HHC may further control other operations of the vehicle including locks lights and horn for example. In some implementations the HHC may also control the operation of one or more sensors or other peripheral devices of the ICS . The HHC may include a GPS or other location determination means and may provide the location of the HHC along with any control data to the ICS VSC. The HHC may be ergonomic waterproof and rugged. An example schematic of the HHC is illustrated in . Note that all wireless communication described herein between the OCU and the VICS may be encrypted or otherwise protected.

In addition to the HHC in some implementations the OCU may further include one or more Remote Viewing Stations RVS . The RVS may be a rugged portable system allowing one or more users to monitor the ICS and or VCS remotely. The RVS may include a power source such as a battery and may allow for the charging one or more devices including the HHC . The RVS is intended to be easily carried by an operator or may be stored in a vehicle including the unmanned vehicle until needed. The RVS may be implemented using a general purpose computing device such as the computing system illustrated with respect to .

The RVS may further include a wireless interface . The wireless interface may include one or more radios and or antennas and may be used to receive data such as location information speed etc. from the ICS and or VSC and may make the received data available to one or more devices such as smart phones tablets laptops etc. In some implementations the RVS may use the wireless interface to create a protected Wi Fi network that operators may connect to in order to view sensor data on their devices . In some implementations the operators may use their personal devices to control the vehicle or to control the operation of one or more sensors or peripheral devices of the ICS and or VSC . The RVS may pass on any commands or instructions received by the RVS to the ICS or VSC depending on the implementation.

The RVS may further include one or more safety features. For example the RVS may include an e stop controller .

The vehicle includes a vehicle system that is connected to the VCS of the VICS . The vehicle system may be a drive by wire system and may include an interface such as a 50 pin signal connector through which the VCS may provide commands to the vehicle and may receive information from the vehicle such as speed oil pressure fuel level engine temperature etc. The VCS may provide commands to the vehicle systems to activate various controls associated with the vehicle including lights throttle and brakes for example.

The VCS may receive operating instructions from the HHC and may provide the instructions to the vehicle systems . Alternatively or additionally the VCS may receive instructions from one or more devices associated with the RVS . For example an operator of the HHC may use a stick or control pad associated with the HHC to cause the vehicle to turn left. The HHC may then provide a corresponding command wirelessly to the VCS . The VCS may generate a command that may cause the vehicle system to turn left and may provide it to the vehicle systems . The vehicle may then turn left.

The VSC may provide the status information from the vehicle systems to the ICS . As shown the ICS may be attached to the roof or exterior of the vehicle to maximize the wireless range of the ICS . The ICS may then provide the status information to the RVS where the status information may be displayed or made available by the RVS .

In addition the ICS may determine a location of the vehicle and may receive data from one or more peripheral devices attached to the ICS such as a camera. The location peripheral device data and VCS data may be provided to the RVS where the data may be viewed by an operator of the RVS and or one or more devices .

For example the RVS may receive the current speed and location of the vehicle from the VSC along with video from a video camera peripheral device mounted on the top of the vehicle . An operator of the RVS may view a map that indicates the location of the vehicle along with the video received from the peripheral device . In addition the locations of other vehicles may also be displayed on the map and the operator may use the RVS or other connected device to select the vehicle whose video data the operator desires to view.

The VICS also includes an e stop . The e stop may be placed on the outside of the vehicle so that an operator may manually activate the button or switch associated with the e stop to halt the vehicle . When activated the e stop may send a signal to one or both of the ICS and VSC to cause the vehicle to be immediately stopped.

In addition the OCU includes a corresponding e stop controller that can be used to halt the vehicle . The e stop controller may be a standalone device or may be integrated into some of all of the HHC and the RVS . An operator may activate the e stop controller and the controller may provide a stop signal that is received directly by the e stop or indirectly by either the VCS or the ICS . In response to receiving the stop signal the vehicle may halt as if the corresponding switch on the e stop had been activated.

Depending on the implementation e stop controller and the e stop may include additional safety and or failsafe features. For example the e stop may monitor the state of the wireless connection between them. Should the e stop detect that the connection has been severed the e stop may immediately halt the operation of the vehicle as if the e stop controller had issued a stop command. Should the wireless connection be restored the e stop may reactivate the vehicle . The wireless connection based failsafe may be implemented in hardware for example

As another level of failsafe the e stop may periodically receive a heartbeat signal from the e stop controller . Should the e stop not receive the heart beat signal from the e stop controller within a defined time interval the e stop may deactivate the vehicle .

In addition the e stop may also send a heartbeat signal to the e stop controller . Should the e stop controller not receive the signal the controller may send a stop signal and then may deactivate the wireless connection between the e stop controller and the e stop . Should the e stop not receive or understand the stop signal because of a software malfunction the hardware implemented failsafe will cause the e stop to deactivate the vehicle . Alternatively the e stop controller may deactivate the wireless connection without sending the stop signal which will similarly result in the e stop deactivating the vehicle .

The vehicle interface may allow the VCS to send data to and receive data from the vehicle systems . The data that the VCS sends to the vehicle systems may be control data such as instructions to apply brakes increase or decrease speed steering instructions and instructions to turn on one or more lights. The received data may include status data such as information about an amount of remaining fuel and other diagnostic information about the vehicle. In some implementations the vehicle interface may be a 50 pin connector. However other types of wired or wireless interfaces may be used.

The ICS interface may allow the VCS to send data to and receive data from the ICS . As described previously in some implementations the ICS may be externally mounted to the vehicle and may include one or more peripheral devices such as cameras or other sensors. In addition the ICS may receive control commands or instructions from one or more of the HHC or the RVS and may also provide information to the RVS and or HHC regarding the status of the associated vehicle and data from the peripheral devices . Accordingly the ICS interface may allow the ICS to pass any received control commands to the VCS as well as the VCS to provide any requested status information received from the vehicle systems to the ICS . In some implementations the ICS may be a 24 pin signal connector. However other types of wired or wireless interfaces may be used.

The wireless interface may receive and or transmit data to one or more of the RVS and the HHC controller . The received data may include control instructions from the HHC controller and or the RVS . The transmitted data may include status information from the vehicle systems sensor information and location information for example. The wireless interface may include one or more antennas and may support a variety of standards protocols and frequencies such as Wifi cellular Bluetooth 1.3 Ghz 2.4 Ghz 5.8 Ghz and 900 Mhz. In some implementations the control signals may be received using a different frequency and or antennae than is used to send status information.

The processing means may execute software that manages and routes data to and from the various components of the VCS . For example the processing means may receive control instructions from one or more of the ICS interface and or wireless interface and may pass the control instructions to the vehicle systems via the vehicle interface . Similarly the processing means may provide status data received from the vehicle systems via the vehicle interface to one or more of the wireless interface and the ICS interface . When routing data to and from the various components of the VCS the processing means may transform or format the data into whatever formats are expected or supported by the receiving components. The processing means may include a processor and memory.

The processing means may further interface with an e stop . The e stop may generate a stop signal that is received by the processing means . Upon receipt of the stop signal the processing means may instruct the vehicle systems via the vehicle interface to immediately halt the vehicle. Alternatively or additionally the e stop may generate a heartbeat signal that is received by the processing means . In the event that the heartbeat signal ceases either because the e stop has been activated or malfunctioned the processing means may instruct the vehicle systems via the vehicle interface to immediately halt the vehicle.

The processing means may further receive power through the fuse and may distribute the power to the various components of the VCS via a bus. The fuse may receive power from a vehicle power source associated with the vehicle. The power may be received via a 4 pin power connector however other connectors or connector types may be used. The fuse may limit the amount of power that the VCS may draw from the vehicle at any time thereby preventing the VCS from inhibiting the amount of power that is available to the vehicle. In some implementations the power from the fuse may be further distributed to the ICS via the ICS interface.

While not shown the VCS may include additional components or sensors such as an accelerometer a GPS or other location determination means. In addition the VCS may include a battery or other power source that is independent of the vehicle power source .

The wireless interface may receive and or transmit data to one or more of the ICS and the VCS . As described above the HHC may be used by an operator to control a vehicle via one or more of the ICS and the VSC . The received data may include status information from the vehicle systems location information associated with the vehicle vehicle sensor data and peripheral device data for example. The transmitted data may include control data and other instructions generated by the operator of the HHC . The wireless interface may include one or more antennas and may support a variety of standards protocols and frequencies such as Wifi cellular Bluetooth 2.4 Ghz 5.8 Ghz and 900 Mhz. In some implementations the control signals may be sent using a different frequency and or antennae than is used to receive status information or peripheral device data.

The HHC may include user controls . The user controls may include a variety of input means such as buttons and joysticks. The input means may be digital analogue or some combination of both. The input means may be mapped to variety of vehicle systems and controls such as throttle brakes and steering. In addition one or more of the input means may be mapped to one or more peripheral devices such as lights camera or weapons systems. The particular mapping of the user controls to the vehicle systems and or peripheral devices may be customized by an operator or administrator for example.

The HHC may further include a display . The display may be used to display data received by the HHC from the ICS and or the VSC . For example the VSC may provide the HHC with information about the vehicle such as speed temperature and location. The HHC may display the information to an operator on the display . Alternatively or additionally the HHC may receive video data from a peripheral device of the ICS and may display the video data to the operator on the display . The display may include a variety of display types including LCD and OLED. Other types of displays may be used.

The HHC may include a variety of sensors . The sensors may include a variety of sensor types including a location determination means such as a GPS an accelerometer a gyroscope thermometer impedance sensor camera fingerprint reader and a light sensor. Other types of sensors may be used. The data from the sensors may be used to implement various safety and security related features.

For example the sensors may be used to determine if an operator is currently holding the HHC . For example a sudden large acceleration detected by an accelerometer may indicate that the HHC has been dropped. Similarly because operators do not typically stand completely still there is an expected amount of background movement or acceleration that is associated with being held still by an operator. If no acceleration is detected or the detected acceleration is otherwise outside of this expected amount then the user may have either placed the HHC down or may otherwise be impaired. If any of the above conditions are detected then the HHC may be deactivated or the HHC may send the ICS or VSC a signal to deactivate the vehicle.

In another example a gyroscope sensor or magnetometer of the HHC may detect the orientation of the HHC and may deactivate the HHC if the orientation is outside of an acceptable range. For example if the HHC is in an orientation that implies that the operator is lying down upside down or in any other unacceptable operating position the HHC may be deactivated. The ICS and or VSC may be similarly also be deactivated as a result of the HHC deactivation. The camera light sensor and or impedance sensor may similarly be used to determine if the HHC is being held by a user.

With respect to security the camera fingerprint reader and impedance sensor alone or in combination may be used to authenticate an operator of the HHC . If an operator is not an authorized operator or otherwise cannot be authenticated the HHC may be disabled along with the associated vehicle.

The processing means may execute software that manages and routes data to and from the various components of the HHC as well as perform any processing related to the display sensors and user controls . For example the processing means may receive indications of one or more button actuations from the user controls may determine corresponding commands and or instructions. These instructions may be then provide to the wireless interface for transmission to the ICS and or VSC . Similarly the processing means may receive location or video data from the ICS and may format or process the received data into a format that is suitable for display on the display . The processing means may further implement the various safety and authentication features described above.

The processing means may further interface with an e stop controller . The e stop controller may be mapped to a particular button or switch of the user controls and when actuated may cause a stop signal to be sent to the processing means . Upon receipt of the stop signal the processing means may send a corresponding stop signal or instruction via the wireless interface to an associated e stop of the controlled vehicle. Depending on the implementation the e stop controller may include its own processing means and wireless interface so that the other operations of the HHC do not impede or interfere with the operation of the e stop controller .

The e stop may include a wireless interface . The wireless interface may include at least one antenna or radio and may be used to receive data from an e stop controller . A variety of communication standards protocols and frequencies such as Wifi cellular Bluetooth 1.3 Ghz 2.4 Ghz 5.8 Ghz and 900 Mhz may be supported by the wireless interface . In some implementations the e stop may periodically send a heartbeat signal to the e stop controller indicating that the e stop is operating correctly.

To prevent malfunction of the e stop the e stop may include a two stage failsafe system. The system may include the hardware failsafe and the software failsafe . The hardware failsafe may determine whether there is an active connection with the e stop controller and the e stop . If at any time the wireless connection between the e stop controller and the e stop fails or is interrupted the hardware failsafe may trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery.

The software failsafe may monitor the received signal for one or more of a heartbeat signal and a stop signal from the e stop controller . If the stop signal is received from the software failsafe may trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery. The heartbeat signal may signify that the e stop controller is operating correctly thus if the heartbeat signal ceases to be received from the e stop controller the software failsafe may similarly trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery.

As may be appreciated the hardware failsafe may allow the e stop controller to stop the associated vehicle or machinery even where the software failsafe has failed. For example the e stop controller may stop receiving the heartbeat signal from the e stop . Because the heartbeat signal is not being received there may be a software malfunction of the software failsafe that is preventing the heartbeat signal from being generated. However because there is a software error even if the e stop controller were to send a stop signal to the software failsafe there is a risk that the software failsafe may not respond correctly. Accordingly rather than or in addition to sending the stop signal the e stop controller may deactivate the wireless connection between the e stop controller and the e stop . The deactivation of the wireless connection will be detected by the hardware failsafe and may cause the hardware failsafe to trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery. Because the hardware failsafe is implemented using hardware rather than software the hardware failsafe is not affected by software malfunctions.

The processing means may execute software that manages and routes data to and from the various components of the e stop as well as perform any processing related to the software failsafe .

The locating means may determine a current location of the e stop . The locating means may be implemented using a variety of location determination technologies including GPS. The processing means may use the determined location to perform some additional safety functionality. For example the e stop controller may periodically transmit its location to the e stop . The processing means may compare the location of the e stop controller with the location of the e stop and may determine if they exceed a minimum separation distance. And if so the processing means may trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery. Alternatively the e stop may provide its location to the e stop controller and the e stop controller may determine if the maximum distance has been exceeded.

The e stop may further include the power supply . The power supply may be a battery or may be power received from the associated vehicle or machinery for example. Any type of battery may be used. In some implementations the e stop may trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery should the remaining battery fall below a threshold.

The e stop may further include a manual input . The manual input may be a button switch or other input means. When actuated the manual input may trigger the stop signal to halt the vehicle or machinery. The manual input may be implemented using hardware to prevent malfunction in the event of a software failure.

As shown together the e stops and e stop controllers may form a mesh wireless network. When an e stop controller desires to send a signal such as a stop signal to particular e stop the controller may send it to any available e stop which may then forward the signal to the specified e stop . For example a user of the e stop controller may wish to stop the machinery associated with the e stop Depending on the implementation the user may select the e stop from a list of e stops on a display associated with the e stop controller or may actuate an input of the e stop controller that has been mapped to the e stop After selecting the e stop the stop signal may be sent to the e stop because that is the closest e stop to the e stop controller in the mesh network. The e stop may then forward the signal to the e stop which may then halt or stop its associated machinery or vehicle. Any system method or technique for mesh networking may be used.

In some implementations each e stop controllers may be paired with one or more of the e stops and may only halt the machinery or vehicle associated with an e stop that is paired with. Alternatively one or more of the e stop controllers may stop any of the e stops that are available. The e stop controllers may be manually paired with a particular e stop by a user or administrator. Alternatively the e stop controllers may automatically be paired with the e stops that they are closest to based on location data associated with the e stop controllers and the e stops .

In another implementation a master e stop controller may be provided. The master e stop controller may override the stop signal sent by the other e stop controllers and may therefore restart a halted vehicle or machinery. The master e stop controller may also be able to stop any available e stop on the network. The master e stop controller may automatically pair with a closest available mesh network. For example a foreman may oversee several factories or construction sites. When the foreman visits a site or floor his or her controller may discover the network of e stops at the site or floor and may immediately be able to halt any of the machines associated with the e stops

In another implementation the e stop controllers may be classified as either primary or secondary e stop controller . Each e stop may determine based on location information if it is within a minimum distance of any secondary e stop controller . If not the e stop may halt its associated machinery. Whereas the primary controller may not be subject to such distance requirements.

For example workers on a factory floor may be each assigned a secondary e stop controller while a foreman on the floor is assigned a primary e stop controller . Each of the floor workers is tasked with overseeing a particular piece of machinery therefore the e stops may determine that at least one secondary e stop controller is within a monitoring distance of the machinery. On the other hand the foreman may desire to be able to stop the operation of a piece of machinery while on the factory floor but it is not crucial that he or she always be on the floor or within a particular distance of the e stops .

At a current location of an operator may be determined. The operator may be operating the HHC and the current location may be determined by a GPS or other locating means associated with the HHC . The operator of the HHC may be following the vehicle that is being controlled by the HHC . For example the operator may be in a different vehicle or may be walking.

At a leading distance between the operator and the unmanned vehicle may be determined. The leading distance may be the desired distance that may be maintained between the unmanned vehicle and the operator. The leading distance may be randomly determined or selected to confuse possible threats or may be a fixed distance.

At a current location of the vehicle is determined. The current location may be determined by the locating means associated with either the ICS or the VSC .

At a determination is made as to whether the distance between the current location of the operator and the unmanned vehicle is less than or greater than the leading distance. If the difference is less than the leading distance then the VCS or the ICS may increase the speed of the vehicle at . If the difference is greater than the leading distance then the VCS or the ICS may decrease the speed of the vehicle at .

The inherent flexibility of the OIP means that the possibilities for applications are quite numerous. Its ability to be adapted to control many vehicles of varying sizes and different operational environments enables the use of a single platform to develop a wide variety of solutions without needing to support a multitude of systems with redundant development efforts. Examples of such applications follow.

The SCM may provide a unique windowed approach to share control of a vehicle between an operator and an autonomous sensor based algorithm. A window may be a period of time that the HHC is permitted to control the vehicle and may define a set of allowable controls for the HHC and or upper or lower bounds on the controls. Outside of the window the SCM may autonomously control the vehicle. While the operator is using the HHC to drive the vehicle the SCM may use sensor data and autonomy algorithms to define windows of allowable control commands to the VSC . For example the operator may instruct the vehicle to drive at a high speed using the HHC while the autonomy algorithm has determined that danger lies ahead. In response to the danger determination the SCM may create a window that provides an upper limit for the speed of the vehicle to the VSC to ensure that speed is reduced and a safe speed is used. The VSC may use the defined windows from the SCM to manipulate the vehicle commands from the HHC before ultimately driving the vehicle. If the danger still lies ahead the SCM may bring the vehicle to a stop or slowly start to steer the vehicle in a safe direction. If the SCM determines that full autonomy is needed to complete a task it may reduce the allowable window to a single point thus taking the HHC out of the loop completely.

Another example is known as safe takeover. As described above the OIP allows for a variety unmanned vehicles to be operated remotely by a user through the HHC even in situations where the user may not have a clear line of sight of the unmanned vehicle. Accordingly a user or administrator may use the OIP to enforce a safety procedure that may be used to verify that the vehicle may be safely operated by the HHC before the OIP allows the HHC to control the vehicle i.e. takeover .

In one implementation the OIP may force the user to actuate one or buttons or switches on the vehicle before the VSC or ICS will allow the HHC to control the vehicle. The buttons or switches may be located at different locations on the vehicle to ensure that the user has verified that no lives or property will be damaged by the vehicle. The same takeover sequence may be used for each takeover or may be randomized. The takeover sequence may be displayed to the user on the display of the HHC . Such a safety procedure may be useful on a construction site or other work environment. The takeover sequence may be customizable by a user or administrator or may be disabled depending on the implementation.

In some implementations multiple HHCs may be used to provide training for HHC operators. For example one HHC may be the Instructor controller and another HHC may be a trainee controller. The VSC or ICS may receive commands from either the instructor or the trainee controller but when instructions are received from both controllers or if there is a conflict between instructions that are received from the controllers the instructions that are received from the instructor controller are followed.

In another implementation an instructor may view a video feed from an unmanned vehicle on a personal device through the RVS . The unmanned vehicle may be controlled by a trainee using the HHC . The instructor may use the personal device to provide instructions and or critiques to the trainee that may be displayed to the trainee on the display of the HHC or on a video feed that the trainee is otherwise viewing. The instructor may use the personal device to disable the unmanned vehicle or to otherwise take control of the vehicle away from the trainee if necessary.

In another implementation the ICS may enforce a minimum distance between an unmanned vehicle and other users to ensure the safety of the users. For example the ICS may determine the distance between the unmanned vehicle and the HHC via GPS and may disable the unmanned vehicle if the distance is less than a threshold distance. In another example workers who operate close to unmanned vehicles may wear wireless sensors. If the ICS determines that such a wireless sensor is within the threshold distance the ICS may disable the vehicle until the worker with the wireless sensor moves outside of the threshold distance.

Integrating high precision distance sensors into the ICS allows the control of tools with extreme accuracy even with significant standoff distances. Positioning a sensor on the manipulator arm of a robot gives the operator precise distance feedback between the arm and the object of interest. This simple feedback provides a sense of depth not available on a simple video screen increasing the precision achievable while also reducing the cognitive workload on the operator.
