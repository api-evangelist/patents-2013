A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The field of the invention relates to apparatus systems and methods which provide wagering games to players. More particularly it relates to apparatus systems and methods which provide for concurrent or simultaneous play of a plurality of different wagering games at a display and for establishing protocols or rules for the presentation and play sequence of the games.

Electronic gaming machines have been known for some time. Prior to computer or state machine controlled machines mechanical gaming machines typically referred to as slot machines were known. With the development of electronics and computers the old mechanical machines have been replaced and now typically exist only as antiques.

Computer controlled gaming machines include stepper driven reel type slot machines as well as machines which present the game at a video display. Traditional CRT displays have now been replaced with flat and curved LED displays. Pertinent to the present invention the video displayed games typically present only a single game for play or in some machines several instances of the same game for concurrent or simultaneous play. For example it is known to have an electronic Keno game providing the player with multiple Keno cards for playing the same game draw. It has also been known to concurrently play multiple hands of video Poker as disclosed in Moody U.S. Pat. No. 6 007 066 titled Electronic Video Poker Games . Schultz U.S. Pat. App. 2011 0287824 filed Jun. 9 2010 and titled SLOT MACHINE GAME FOR TWO PLAYERS also discloses a game for two players presenting side by side games. Of course it has been known for a single player to play different adjacent slot machines.

A drawback of prior gaming machines is that a single player cannot select two or more different games to play concurrently simultaneously at their gaming machine. By different what is meant is that the games have one or more of different play mechanics including but not limited to pay table base game award structure pay line structure number and arrangement theme scatter symbol awards symbol graphics number of reels different arrangements of rows r and columns c of the game display matrix bonus trigger conditions bonus play and award structure. It would be advantageous if a player could select from an inventory of games two or more different games or several instances of a favorite game along with another favorite game to play simultaneously or concurrently. By simultaneous or concurrent play what is meant is that the games are presented together and outcomes are displayed to occur at the same time or serially substantially one after the other in for example a choreographed presentation.

In view of the foregoing it would be advantageous to provide an apparatus method and system which can provide for concurrent play at a single device such as a gaming machine of multiple different games. This approach would satisfy the player s desire to play one or more instances of different games at a single device and provide multiple chances to win awards without tying up one or more adjacent machines and would provide benefit to the game provider of increased play and where the gaming is pay to play P2P provide a vehicle to increase the amounts wagered. It would be advantageous to choreograph the presentation of a plurality of games in a manner pleasing to the player.

The current physical button offerings as well as the OLED button panel require specialized set up and configurations to support the types of bet line configurations offered to our customers.

All existing implementations suffer from a major flaw in that they are limited to what games may be concurrently wagered upon. Specifically when using fixed label buttons or equivalent individual buttons with OLED displays it is essential that each game being concurrently wagered upon have exactly the same configuration of line and bet structure. Accordingly even though each game may be different they share an identical number of pay lines and also the same progression of pay lines. In addition the bet progression for each game must also match. In practice this limitation means that the offered games are quite similar mathematically as the number of pay lines is one of the main drivers of volatility.

There is a continuing need to address these limitations and enable the deployment of arbitrary arrangements of games. The current limitations of being limited to a small subset of games that are dependent upon the first game chosen are detrimental to player choice and player excitement in a gaming environment.

For example the table gaming system may include virtual game layouts for games which typically involve wagering for instance poker roulette craps baccarat Let It Ride Pai Gow Poker and the like. Also for example the table gaming system may include virtual game layouts for games which typically do not involve wagering for instance chess checkers Monopoly Scrabble Trivial Pursuit Battle Ship Risk Life Candyland and Chutes And Ladders. It is noted that many games commonly associated with wagering may be played without wagering or with pretend money or chips. Likewise wagers may be placed in or on many games that are not commonly associated with wagering such as board games. One of the advantages of some of the embodiments described herein is the ability to rapidly change a table gaming system between various games to accommodate the desires of the patrons or casino.

The table gaming system has a number of player positions collectively referenced as and optionally a dealer position .

The table gaming system may include one or more secondary displays in addition to the principal display s . The playing surface of the table gaming system may include a single surface computing display or device or multiple surface computing displays or devices in close proximity to each other. Each player may have a respective portion of a zone of a single surface display or may have their own respective surface display.

In certain games the player positions are typically associated with a primary wagering area commonly referred to as a betting circle. The virtual primary wagering area on the table gaming system may be visually identified by betting circle demarcations collectively displayed on or below a playing surface of the table gaming system . A player collectively may place a bet or wager on the outcome of the game being played or an event in the game being played by locating one or more physical chips collectively or other items of value in the respective betting circle demarcations from the player s respective chip reserves collectively . Additionally or alternatively a player may place a primary wager by entering appropriate information via a respective user interface collectively . Information collectively about the wager may be displayed for example within or proximate the betting circle demarcations . For example information may be displayed indicating a total amount wagered and or information may indicate that a player has yet to place a wager. The virtual game layout may also include information indicative of a minimum and or maximum range for the primary wager.

For example in certain games player positions may include a virtual insurance bet area which allows the player to place an insurance bet or similar wager on the occurrence of particular event e.g. when the dealer has an Ace showing . The insurance bet area on the table gaming system may be visually identified by insurance bet area demarcations collectively displayed on or below the playing surface of the table gaming system . A player may place an insurance bet by locating one or more physical chips or other items of value in the respective insurance bet demarcations . Additionally or alternatively a player may place an insurance bet by entering appropriate information via a respective user interface 

Also for example in certain games the player positions may optionally include a virtual bonus wagering area commonly referred to as a bonus betting circle. The bonus wagering area on the table gaming system may be visually identified by bonus wagering area demarcations collectively displayed on or below the playing surface of the table gaming system . A player may place a bonus bet or bonus wager by locating one or more physical chips or other items of value in the respective bonus betting circle demarcations . Additionally or alternatively a player may place a bonus wager by entering appropriate information via a respective user interface 

A bonus wager or bet may entitle a player to participate in a bonus. The bonus wager may be in addition to a conventional or primary wager on the outcome of the game being played at the gaming table under the standard rules of the game and entitles a player to participate in an award of a bonus pool. In some embodiments placement of the conventional wager will entitle a player to participate in the bonus pool.

The bonus may take any of a variety of forms including a jackpot progressive jackpot or other type of bonus. For example if a player has placed a wager the computing subsystem or some other computing system may increase the bonus pool by an appropriate amount. The amount may be for example a fixed amount or a percentage of the wager. In some embodiments the entire bonus wager may be placed into the bonus pool. In other embodiments a portion of the bonus wager may be placed in the bonus pool. In other embodiments a portion of the conventional or primary wager may be placed in the bonus pool. The bonus pool may include contributions from a single gaming table more than one gaming table a single pit multiple pits a single property or multiple properties. The bonus pool may additionally or alternatively include contributions from one or more game operators casinos or property owners as a promotional prize.

The outcome of the bonus may be based on any of a variety of events for example an event related to the player s own hand or the dealer s hand an event occurring at the particular table gaming system and an event occurring at another gaming table an event occurring at one or more specific properties a randomly generated event or value e.g. outcome of random number generator and or a passage of a set or a random amount of time. Likewise the size or composition of the bonus may be based on any of a variety of factors for example total amount of bonus wagers by a player by players at a table by players at a property by players across multiple properties a total amount of primary wagers an amount of time or number of wagers over a period of time a set contribution amount by one or more properties an outcome of a random number generator and the like. The bonus pool may take the form of money or equivalent e.g. chips prizes. Also as noted above the bonus pool may additionally or alternatively include goods and or services.

Player specific bonus related information may be displayed on or below the playing surface of the gaming table at one or more player positions . For example player specific bonus related information may indicate that in increase in a primary wager is necessary to earn or to be entitled to participate in the bonus.

In some embodiments the table gaming system may allow a player to view or otherwise receive information about the rules of various games for example the game associated with a currently displayed virtual game layout . The table gaming system may for example include a user selectable icon or operable key selection or operation of which produces a display of information about the rules of the game for the current virtual layout . In some embodiments the display may include a narrative or prose explanation of the rules of the games. In some embodiments the display may include a video showing the game being played. The video may be presented in its own isolated area. Alternatively the video may incorporate one or more of the demarcations of the currently displayed virtual layout . For example the video may illustrate the placement of certain wagers by displaying images of virtual chips in respective demarcated wager or bet areas or circles. Also for example the video may illustrate various playing card combinations displaying images of virtual playing cards at various player positions . Such may be more informative and more entertaining than a display of a narrative or prose version of the rules.

In some embodiments the sensor subsystem of the table gaming system may be capable of reading information from media collectively for example identity media and or financial media. In such embodiments the table gaming system may have a specific area in which the media is located. Information read from the media may allow the collection tracking and or analysis of a variety of player specific information such as player worth any may allow automation of the determination of complimentary benefits commonly known as comps that are issued to reward players . The information may also allow customization of player positions for example allow the display of messages tailored to specific players .

The table gaming system may also include various system components including game monitoring units e.g. Bally MC300 magnetic or smart card reader s pin pads iVIEW player tracking displays speakers amplifiers audio mixers biometric input devices printers and other input output devices. In one embodiment the sensor subsystem may scan a fingerprint or handprint of a patron such as a player for use in identifying the player or in authorizing a financial transaction.

In many games for example Blackjack a dealer deals physical playing cards to the players and in some games the dealer may deal physical playing cards collectively to the dealer s own self. The dealer may deal physical playing cards from a handheld deck or from a card shoe . The card shoe may for example take the form of a playing card handling system for example an automatic shuffling machine. The dealer may collect playing cards from the players and the dealer s own self after each hand is played out or after all hands have been played out. The dealer may place the collected playing cards in a discard shoe or receptacle . In some embodiments the card shoe and discard shoe or receptacle are part of a single device that randomizes the playing cards .

In many games the dealer uses a chip tray for storing wagers commonly represented by chips or other physical objects collected from losing players and for paying out winnings to winning players .

The table gaming system may include a dealer interface that provides information to the dealer and or allows the dealer to input information make selections control various aspects of the game view information about specific players and or request assistance. The dealer interface may include one or more dealer selectable icons and or dealer operable keys.

The virtual game layout of the player position includes betting circle demarcation . Primary wagers or bets may be made by placing an appropriate number of physical chips within the betting circle demarcation . As discussed in detail below the sensor subsystem is configured to detect the number and or value of the physical chips located in the betting circle demarcation .

A primary player may store or locate their bank of physical chips in a variety of locations at the player position or the virtual game layout may include chip storage area demarcation not shown . In some embodiments the sensor subsystem is configured to detect the number and or value of the physical chips in the player s bank.

In some embodiments promotional or bonus amounts may be provided to individual players for placing wagers. Such may be a form of comping or other award or reward to a player. Such may for example be based on amount wagered time spent wagering assessed skill level and or previous wagering and the like. In some embodiments the amount may not be converted directly into currency but rather must be wagered or forfeited. In embodiments employing promotional amounts i.e. amounts restricted to replay on the gaming device the virtual game layout of the player position may include a virtual promotional amount for example in the form of virtual chip icons having a cumulative value equal to that which has been assigned or allocated to the specific player. The virtual chip icons may be placed as a wager for example in response to player selections via a player user interface .

The player user interface may include one or more player selectable icons which may be displayed by the display subsystem on or below the playing surface of a gaming table. For example the player user interface may include player selectable icons that allow the player to increment or decrement a wagered amount on a primary wager. Also for example the user interface may include player selectable icons that allow the player to place an insurance wager i.e. buy insurance and or player selectable icons to place a wager as a back betting or secondary player on another player or hand on same or different table. The player user interface may include one or more player selectable icons that allow the player to have a physical or virtual card dealt or drawn.

In some embodiments the user interface may include a number of player selectable physical keys not shown in the FIG. in place of or in addition to the various player selectable icons. Alternatively or additionally the virtual chips icons may form part of the player user interface . For example a player may place a wager by selecting one or more of the virtual chip icons and or by selecting a desired wagering or betting area or circle . For instance a player may place a wager by touching a virtual chip icon to select the virtual amount represented by that virtual chip icon and dragging the virtual chip icon for example with a finger to the desired wagering or betting area or circle to select the desired wagering or betting area or circle .

In some embodiments the virtual game layout may display an indication of a total of the currently wagered amount as well as an indication of the amount wagered using physical chips and an indication of the amount wagered in promotional chips or amounts represented by the virtual chip icons . Such may for example be displayed within the betting circle demarcation . The virtual game layout may display an indication of the total wager in promotional chips or amount proximate the icons .

In some embodiments the virtual chip icons may be convertible into lower or higher value denominations. For example a defined selection mechanism may allow a player to vary the number denomination of the virtual chip icons . For instance tapping twice on a virtual chip icon may produce two virtual chip icons each with half the value of the selected tapped virtual chip icon .

The virtual chip icons may advantageously be displayed proximate the location of the physical chips allowing a player to assess their entire bank. In embodiments without a defined player bank area the virtual chip icons may be displayed proximate a location at which the player s bank is determined to reside. Thus the virtual layout of the player position may be customized in response to the player s placement of their chips .

The virtual game layout of the player position may also include an area or location to place primary player associated physical media for instance identity media e.g. loyalty program cards drivers licenses passports company identification badges and or financial media e.g. credit cards debit cards prepaid cards cellular phones smartcards . The primary player associated physical media identifies the primary player and or an account that belongs to or is otherwise associated with the primary player. The virtual game layout may or may not include demarcations of the primary player media placement area or location. As discussed in detail below the sensor subsystem is configured to read information from the primary player media located in the media placement area or location or located in other areas on the playing surface or otherwise proximate the table gaming system . For example an RFID interrogation system may employ antenna in or around the table gaming system to detect primary player media which carries one or more RFID transponders.

Information read from primary player physical media may allow the primary player to establish credit for example withdrawing funds from an account or from a prepaid card or charging to an account. The virtual game layout may display an indication of a total amount of credit e.g. player s account that the primary player has established. The indication may also reflect amounts that are automatically debited upon each wager from the credited amount e.g. player s account .

The virtual game layout of the player position may also include an area or location to display player specific information or allow player specific requests to be made. For example virtual game layout may display a player identifier such as a name an indication of a current total of comp points that have been awarded to the player a countdown an indication of a total account balance and an indication of a player specific progressive value. Player selectable icons may be provided for a variety of player requests. For example a player selectable icon to request service or beverage a player selectable icon for bonus games and or a player selectable icon to execute a funds transfer. The virtual game layout may include a menu of food beverages or other items of services.

As noted previously the virtual game layout may include a player selectable icon to allow a player to receive information about one or more games for example including the rules video demonstrating the game and or suggestions on game play.

The virtual game layout of the player position may also include an area or location to place back betting or secondary player associated physical media collectively for example identity media and or financial media. The back betting or secondary player associated physical media identifies the a back betting or secondary player that is wagering on the play of a primary player or a primary player s hand and or an account that belongs to or is otherwise associated with the back betting or secondary player. The virtual game layout may or may not include demarcations identifying the back betting or secondary player media placement area or location. As discussed in detail below the sensor subsystem is configured to read information from the media located in the back betting or secondary player media placement area or location. In some embodiments the sensor subsystem may read information from the physical media located elsewhere on the table surface or even proximate the player position . In such embodiments precautions should be taken to assure that information read is actually intended to be a wager placement. One approach to assuring such is limiting a range of the sensor subsystem . Additionally or alternatively the system may determine a position of the physical media and associate the determined position with a closest one of the player positions. The position of the physical media may be determined in a variety of ways for example in absolute or relative coordinates and or in Cartesian or polar coordinates.

In some embodiments the playing card media takes the form of an active media for example a form of electronic or e paper smart paper organic light emitting diodes and or ink code which allows the formation and erasure of markings via electrical magnetic or electromagnetic radiation. Smart paper is a product developed by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center of Palo Alto Calif. The smart paper consists of a flexible polymer containing millions of small balls and electronic circuitry. Each ball has a portion of a first color and a portion of a second color each portion having an opposite charge from the other portion. Applying a charge causes the balls to rotate within the polymer structure to display either the first or the second color. Charges can be selectively applied to form different ones or groups of the balls to form the respective markings on the playing cards. The markings remain visible until another charge is applied. Alternatively the playing card handling systems can be adapted to employ color changing inks such as thermo chromatic inks e.g. liquid crystal leucodyes which change color in response to temperature fluctuations and photo chromatic inks that respond to variations in UV light. Such materials may be employed to provide special or bonus markings on the physical game related pieces. Visual indicia on physical game related pieces e.g. playing cards dice and the like may be selectively activated. For example indicia e.g. human readable markings machine readable markings standard symbols such as rank and suit symbols or pips non standard symbols bonus marking and the like may not be visible until activated by a suitable stimulus. The stimulus may take a variety of forms for example light or electromagnetic energy of certain wavelength s electrical current and or voltage heat force or stress and or chemicals.

One or more threads or processes may be executed to save the state of the game periodically to continue in response to an event or randomly. The computer readable memory may be static or dynamic may be spinning media e.g. hard disk floppy disk optical disk or solid state media e.g. RAM Flash and the like.

At the computing subsystem determines whether an interruption has occurred. The interruption may have been a loss of power a suspension of play by the dealer or other casino personnel or the occurrence of an event occurring at or proximate the gaming table system. The computing subsystem may for example check a flag or detect an application of power after an interruption of power.

On return from an interruption the computing system restores the state of the game at . Restoring the state of the game may for example include displaying a visual identification of a position for the physical game related pieces on a virtual game layout by the display subsystem. Restoring the state of the game may for example include displaying one or more virtual game related pieces. Restoring the state of the game may for example include logically associating one or more game related pieces with one or more players in game logic that defines a particular game. Restoring the state of the game may for example include restoring balances credits or debits in one or more accounts associated with one or more players. The game may then continue as if the game had not been interrupted.

The various embodiments may be provided in table top bar top slant top and or upright embodiments including various forms associated with conventional and video slot machines. The playing surfaces should provide an environmental seal for example a hermetic seal to protect the various components located therein. Thus the components are protected against drink spills and or smoke.

The gaming systems described herein may be used in a wide variety of different fields but will typically be used in a casino table game area environment or alternative in poker club environments. In alternate embodiments this technology can be used in bars arcades restaurants clubs bingo halls keno halls sports book betting or other non traditional gaming locations. In certain embodiments this technology can be used at a user s home for supporting card dice or other amusement entertainment games on the surface computing device. For example a coffee table that is a surface computing device would be an ideal home table gaming platform. Players may use real i.e. physical playing cards or other play pieces on the surface computing device and as long as the pieces can be machine read e.g. carry an optically recognizable bar code or pattern or wireless transponder then the traditional game can be enhanced with a video or virtual game layout but with actual physical game related pieces. The game of chess for example would be an ideal game to play at home on the surface computing coffee table. Each player could move physical chess pieces around the virtual game layout projected on or under a playing surface. The virtual game layout may dynamically change based upon events occurring in the game. For instance a powerful visual effect may be displayed underneath the affected related game for example when a piece captures another piece.

Secondary bonuses or goals for players can be visually or virtually represented on the playing surface. The player may receive enhanced scoring if the player achieves such goals. Scoring for one or more players may be visually or virtually represented on the playing of the surface computing device. Board style or home games may be enhanced by the use of virtual game layouts and object sensing of the surface computing device versus the static layout of traditional cardboard type boards. Game related pieces may come with machine readable symbols transponders or other markings. For example game related pieces may bear optical bar code symbols pre affixed pre printed stamped or etched on a bottom of the game related piece. Alternatively a kit may be purchased separately to affix bar code symbols to the bottom of the game related pieces. The assignment of bar code symbols to game related pieces may be performed using the playing surface of a surface computing device. For example an image of each chess piece would be displayed on the playing surface and the player would put the actual playing piece onto the playing surface over or next to the image. The bar code symbol may be read and assigned by a software game application. From that point forward play with the game related piece can be tracked and analyzed. In some embodiments the game related pieces may be pre associated in the game software provided by the game manufacturer.

The game software may include logic to produce visual and or audio effects at the optimal time once certain moves of the real i.e. physical playing pieces are made or other events in the game occur. The virtual game layout may be displayed with the locations of the game related pieces marked to allow the game to be reset should the physical game related pieces accidentally or intentionally be knocked off the playing surface. The game related pieces may be identified by player name or color or other identifying marks that allow each player to know their own game related pieces if multiple players use similar looking game related pieces. Thus a player would not only know that a Bishop belongs at an identified position of the virtual game layout but also know to which player the Bishop belongs. Each player may be given the opportunity to enter their name or other key identifier to mark all of their game related pieces on the virtual game layout. One advantage of the virtual game layout is the ability to dynamically change the appearance between each round or game for example to add new depth to games. This keeps an ever changing experience for the player keeping the game experience fresh. Consequently traditional board games can be enhanced using the virtual game layout and sensing of physical aspects of game related pieces.

A management system for example the Bally Gaming download and remote configuration management system may allow scheduled downloads and reconfiguration of the playing surface of a table gaming or arcade casino style gaming system from one or more servers for example as taught in U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60 716 713 filed Dec. 9 2005 and U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. Nos. 11 530 450 and 11 530 452 both filed Aug. 9 2006. The system may allow a casino operator to manage groups of table gaming or arcade casino style gaming systems reducing the effort required to download or configure large numbers of table gaming or arcade casino style gaming systems. For example new software may be downloaded to groups of table gaming or arcade casino style gaming systems from a central location and the table gaming or arcade casino style gaming systems may be configured from the central location. Accordingly this operational efficiency reduces maintenance costs and minimizes table gaming or arcade casino style gaming system downtime due to maintenance or table gaming or arcade casino style gaming system set up. Standardized classes may be employed such as Gaming Standards Association GSA download and configuration classes. For example the G2S Player class would allow multiple players on the same surface computer table game device identifier to be bound to the same device session.

The teachings herein are applicable to a variety of games. For instance games that are not commonly associated with wagering for example board games including chess checkers Monopoly Scrabble Trivial Pursuit Battle Ship Risk Life Candyland Backgammon Yahtzee Axis Allies Pictionary Dungeons Dragons Clue Hangman Operation Sorry Uno Parchessi and Chutes And Ladders Also for instance games that are commonly associated with wagering. for example roulette craps and other dice games and bingo as well as many card games played with playing cards for instance blackjack baccarat various types of poker including Texas Hold em Caribbean Stud Poker Three Card Poker Pai Gow poker Big Six Spanish 21 Casino War 357 Poker Hearts Let It Ride and also Macau style card games and tile based games.

These table and or upright or arcade casino style gaming systems may be linked together in a local area network LAN wide area network internet or wirelessly to provide for group play or competitive gaming spanning different gaming systems or tables. For example people playing chess can be in different cities or locations and be able to see each other s pieces move on their respective display. Each player would move their real physical game related piece e.g. chess piece on the virtual game layout and the same move would be visually represented by a virtual game related piece at the remote gaming device e.g. surface computing display remotely located from one where the move was made .

The teachings herein may be suitable for traditional games that use one or more dice. Physical dice may produce a random number which the gaming system may use to automatically move the virtual game related pieces e.g. forward or to advance the game in another manner and or which may be used to determine whether a prize is awarded e.g. Baccarat . It is noted that dice used with more or less than six sides in a game many employ one or more die. Home games often use a spinner manually spun by a player to produce a random outcome to advance the game in some manner. The random outcome of a spinner is an effective means to create ever varying game outcomes from one game to the next. In an alternate embodiment a spinner that is manually spun has included a structure or instructions that allow an orientation of a pointer to be determined or ascertained by the sensor subsystem of the gaming system. For example a barcode or optical pattern may be affixed to a portion of the spinner e.g. bottom or the entire spinner may be optically magnetically or inductively detectable by the sensor subsystem. In some embodiments the spinner e.g. pointer or the background i.e. selections may be a visual or virtual representation of the playing surface. Wherever the physical spinner would stop spinning it would point to some portion of the virtual background or selections to denote an advancement or other game relevant data. Thus the virtual game layout may change from move to move round to round or game to game and can be player centric i.e. customized for each player . Typically the spinner is mounted on a piece of cardboard which bears a fixed printed pattern. The gaming system allows the pattern or selections to change and or may provide enhanced visual effects such as highlighting to create an exciting visual and ever changing experience for the players. A physical spinner or pointer and a virtual representation of selections underneath the spinner may allow for new table gaming experiences. Games employing a physical spinner to randomize play are popular. That popularity may be enhanced by dynamically changing selections which the spinner may point over most traditional board games. The spinner may for example be mounted to the playing surface with a suction cup.

The virtual game layout of the playing surface allows new virtual bonus games or virtual game related pieces to be awarded to players in addition to the real physical cards dealt by a dealer. These virtual bonus cards awarded or won may be represented by appropriate visual indicators displayed on or below the playing surface by the display subsystem.

For example a player may be given a virtual bonus card and if the player busts i.e. goes over 21 in blackjack based on the physical playing cards the virtual playing card will replace one of the physical playing cards that provide the optimal result for the player. Optionally a player can choose the physical playing card to be replaced. Thus a player is given a chance to recover from a bust. Once the virtual playing card is revealed and used the visual representation of the virtual playing card is removed for future games. Alternatively the virtual playing card may be valid for a series of games or alternatively may be valid in perpetuity. A player may be given the opportunity to choose when to use the virtual bonus card or not.

In other embodiments one or more of a player s physical playing cards may be visually enhanced with appropriate visual effects displayed on or below the playing surface around or proximate the location of the physical playing card on the playing surface. This may denote if a certain hand is achieved with a combination of playing card s for example if the player is entitled to a bonus prize. A non limiting example is a progressive award. In some embodiments bonus playing cards or a bonus playing card counter may be stored in a player account for use at any time by the player. In some embodiments bonus playing cards may have a time in which the bonus playing card must be used before the bonus playing card expires.

The specific virtual bonus playing cards could be determined from an outcome of a random number generator. Thus a player may have two of the same playing cards at any one time. One virtual visual representation rendered by a display subsystem and another physical playing card. In other embodiments the random number generator or software may preclude certain virtual playing cards to be given to a player if a corresponding physical play is already in play or will be coming into play shortly in embodiments where the system knows the order of the cards in the shoe.

In one embodiment a joker or other specially marked card may be dealt to the player from the dealers shoe and can be later used in this game or other games to exchange for a new free playing card to be dealt at the time of the player s choosing. This would typically occur when the player wishes to use a new play to improve their hand. Alternately a virtual bonus card may be given to the player with a representation visually rendered on or below the playing surface. Such a virtual bonus card could be used in a manner similar to the physical playing card.

Virtual playing cards visually represented on or below the playing surface may be dealt or rendered face down. Covering the playing surface proximate the visual representation of the virtual playing card with the player s hand causes the display subsystem to temporarily display the face of the playing card. In some embodiments the face of the virtual playing card may be displayed while the playing surface is covered by a player s actual hand. Touching the playing surface proximate a corner of the representation of the virtual playing card causes the display subsystem to display a portion of the face of the virtual playing card in a similar fashion to bending an edge of a physical playing card. This way other players would not be able to see the face of the virtual playing card. Another touch on the playing surface or removing a finger from the display screen or onscreen button proximate the corner of the representation of the virtual playing card may cover the face of the playing card back up again.

Bonus games may be provided via the display subsystem. For example if a player is to be awarded a bonus for any reason the section or portion of the playing surface in front of that player may include a visual representation of the bonus game displayed. The bonus game may be completely virtual being visually rendered by the display subsystem for example based on an output of a random number generator of the game system. In some embodiments the bonus game may use both physical and virtual playing cards. The bonus game may even be a completely different genre of game title for example a video slot machine.

In some embodiments a winning event on a hand of one player may trigger a group bonus game. For example virtual bonus games may be displayed in front of each player at the table or the entire playing surface may switch to a bonus mode or round of play. In this case if the outcome of the bonus round is good all players would share in the bonus award. In alternate embodiments the winning player in the group play bonus would win the main prize while the other players may win consolation prizes. Consolation prizes may be of fixed size or a percentage of the main prize award.

Bonus games won may be visually indicated by visual indicators on the playing surface. In some embodiments players may be awarded bonus promotional chips or credits or virtual credits that must be used in play on the table game or other gaming device where awarded. Such promotional chips or credits cannot be cashed out with the cashier. A bonusing server could award these bonus promotional chips or credits to a specific player or seat at the table either randomly or based on some predetermined logic. The display subsystem may visually represent bonus promotional chips or credits with appropriate visual indicators e.g. circular with value markings on or below the playing surface proximate the player s own physical chips. These bonus promotional chips or credits may be awarded to either identified or non identified players. Unused bonus promotional chips may be cleared by the dealer or sent back to the players account for later use barring any expiration rules.

Some embodiments may provide a player one or more free bonus dice throws in dice based games. Timing of the free bonus dice throws may be determined by the table game system the casino host or the player. The display subsystem may represent the free bonus dice roles with appropriate visual indicators displaying on or below the playing surface. These free bonus dice rolls may be used by the player to replace any bad previous roll. These free bonus dice rolls may allow a player to throw physical dice on the playing surface or alternatively to throw virtual dice on the playing surface. For example the player may activate a switch which causes the computing subsystem to produce one or more random values representative of the possible outcome of a dice throw. Also for example the display system may visually represent e.g. animation a roll of virtual dice across the surface display in a manner that replicates the way physical dice roll across a surface of a gaming table. The display subsystem may produce a visual representation that mimics a physical dice throw e.g. animation or a dice shaped icon with an outcome that is determined based on the random value s . These free bonus dice rolls may be saved in a player account for later use on a different table or in a different game on a different time or day. Unused free bonus dice rolls may have an expiration time limit so if not used by a certain date time the free bonus dice rolls may expire.

At certain times of the day the display subsystem may provide different content on the playing surface. For example the display subsystem may display sporting events advertisements casino marketing media or access to the casino Web portal. Also for example the display subsystem may display an interface that serves as customer kiosks for the patrons to use serves as electronic game machines EGMS to provide traditional video poker video slots or other pay to play or free play gaming for the patrons. The display subsystem may display a user interface that allows patrons to manage player accounts review and order food or cocktails shop for merchandise or services or redeem prizes.

In certain markets like Macau players referred to herein as secondary players often place back bets on live table games played by others referred to herein as primary players. Various embodiments discussed herein may help to automate back betting. For example a secondary player or back better can simply place a piece of media e.g. identity card such as a loyalty program card or a driver s license or financial media such as credit debit or prepaid card or a cellular phone or PDA down on the playing surface table proximate a player s position on which the secondary player wishes to wager. The sensor subsystem reads information from the piece of media. The location of the media indicates one which the primary player or the secondary player is placing a wager or bet on. The computing subsystem of the gaming system may identify the secondary player or back better from the read information and may use funds from one of the secondary player s accounts to fund the back betting. For example an identity or identify information of the back better may be pre associated with a player account with or without prior wagering of funds. This may occur even though the secondary player is not actually sitting at the table or playing directly but rather the secondary player is placing a wager or bet on a primary player or outcome of a primary player s hand. The computing subsystem may automatically apply winnings to the account of the secondary player or back better. Alternatively the display subsystem may display virtual chips in the amount of the winnings or a credit meter may be incremented based upon the winnings for this back better.

In some embodiments the gaming table or gaming system may automatically re price itself at various times of day or be controlled by a Download Configuration server a dealer or pit boss. Additionally or alternatively the exchange rate of player account credits to game credits or game chips may be modified from time to time.

In alternate embodiments the secondary player or back better may enter or place secondary wagers or back bets via a wireless communication device. The communication device may allow the entry of account information to identify a source of funds for example by keying swiping a magnetic stripe on a card or wireless interrogation of a transponder carried by the card. Additionally or alternatively the wireless communications device may be associated with an account which may serve as a source of funds. For example wireless communication devices are typically associated with a service account e.g. a service provider account . Such a service provider account may serve as the source of funds. The wireless communication device may provide a user selectable icon that allows the user to identify the service provider account as the source of funds or to identify some other account. For example the wireless communication device may store information for two or more accounts from which the user may choose from to fund the wagering.

In some embodiments the wireless communication device may wirelessly and electronically bind to a specific gaming system or table or table seat or station. For example this may be based on proximity of the wireless communication device to a gaming system such as a table or arcade casino style gaming system. The electronic binding may be established through one or more proximity sensors or radios e.g. transmitter receiver or transceiver which may form part of the sensor subsystem of the gaming system or may form a separate wireless device subsystem. The proximity sensors or radio may wirelessly detect and or communicate with a transponder or a radio e.g. transmitter receiver or transceiver of the wireless communication device. Alternatively the proximity sensors or radio may wirelessly detect or wirelessly communicate with a transponder or radio carried by media e.g. a loyalty program or club card credit debit or prepaid card . Such communication may employ Ultra Wide Band UWB frequencies which may be particularly advantageous where proximity sensing is desired. Otherwise the communication may employ Bluetooth IRDA Wi Fi or other wireless protocols. Some entries or selections made by a player via the wireless communication device may be displayed by the display subsystem. For example the placement of wagers may be displayed via suitable information and or icons on the surface of the gaming table.

Since the dealt physical playing cards are recognized by the sensor subsystem the wireless communication device may display a representation of the actual hand of the primary player to secondary player or back better using the wireless communication device. This allows the secondary player or back better to follow the play even when the secondary player s or back better s view of the game is blocked. A user interface may be provided at the gaming system for example as user selectable icons displayed on or below the playing surface that allows the secondary player or back better to select a table to bet on a player to bet on and to set an amount of the wager or bet. Additionally or alternatively a user interface may be provided on the wireless communication device or on some other peripheral device to allow the secondary player or back better to make such selections. A secondary player or back better may for example choose to match the bet by the primary player or may bet a percentage or any multiple of the bets of the primary player. In alternate embodiments a primary player who is playing one game may also desire to place a side wager or secondary wager on the play of another player. The other player may be playing in the same game e.g. at the same table or at another game e.g. at another table . For example a back better may be provided with a bonus game or bonusing as if the back better was actually sitting at the gaming table or gaming device.

Physical media may be read by the sensor subsystem of the gaming system. The display subsystem may render visual representations of virtual media for example in front of a secondary player or back better who is wagering on the play of the primary player. Visual or virtual representation of the outcomes of the wagers may be presented or otherwise rendered at both a position associated with the primary player and a position or device associated with the secondary or back betting player.

Some embodiments may implement a virtual craps table gaming system. For example the sensor subsystem may determine the orientation and or location of physical dice thrown by a player on the playing surface. For instance the sensor subsystem may read the spot patterns or machine readable symbols printed on the faces of the dice. Such spots or machine readable symbols may indicate which face is up. Thus the sensor subsystem includes a scanner or imager positioned under the playing surface the machine readable symbol read off a face lying flat on the playing surface should indicate that the opposed face of the die is facing up. Thus diametrically opposed faces of the die may be marked with the reverse machine readable symbols from the actual value of the face.

The sensor subsystem may detect the location of the dice as the dice moves across the playing surface. The display subsystem may produce an enhanced visual indication of the location of the dice. For example the display subsystem may illuminate or highlight the area of the playing surface surrounding the dice. Additionally or alternatively the display subsystem may produce a visual indication indicative of the faces of the dice that are face up on the playing surface. This may assist players who are located at a far end of a table to easily see the dice value. The sensor subsystem may allow thrown dice to be tracked and visual representations of such to be presented to the players.

Secondary game offers to players may occur where players bet on dice rolls based upon historical play. For example there has not been a six rolled in the last 20 rolls the casino may offer a progressive or other prize for an additional wager or as a bonus when the next six is rolled. The table gaming system or associated system may detect such historical situations calculate the odds cause the display of historical data and or monitor the progressive bonus automatically.

In some embodiments the dice may have an RFID transponder that uniquely associates the dice with the casino property or table. RFID interrogators may be placed under within or around the gaming table or playing surface to ensure compliance. The virtual layout of the craps table may be easily modified before during or just after play to create ever changing playfields.

A player may be identified at the table gaming system in any one or more of a variety of ways. For example the sensor subsystem may read information from a piece of media e.g. identity or financial media placed on the playing surface by a player. The sensor subsystem may employ an optical device such as a scanner or imager or may employ a wireless device such as a wireless RFID or EAS type interrogator. Also for example a biometric reader may be located at each player position. The biometric reader may take a variety of forms for instance a fingerprint reader iris scan microphone and voice recognition software may be used or hand vein pattern detection. In alternate embodiments a patron s written signature may be digitized and verified against a signature database. For example a player may sign on a surface computer display with finger or stylus . Biometric analysis may be performed at the gaming system e.g. table or arcade style gaming systems or may be performed by a remotely located remote system computer system.

Also for example a player s identity and proximity may be detected by the sensor subsystem or other subsystem of the gaming system. For instance a transponder carried by a piece of media or a wirelessly communication device which is carried by or otherwise associated with a player may be wireless detected via wireless interrogation. The piece of media may take any of a variety of forms for instance a loyalty program card driver s license credit debit or prepaid card. Proximity data acquired by the gaming system may for example include a location in the casino e.g. x y and z coordinates or GPS data . The gaming system or some other system may associate the proximity data with a player identifier. Based on at least one part of the location coordinates the system may create a logical relationship between the player identifier and a particular gaming system a table identifier seat identifier and or player position identifier.

As another example a standalone card reader e.g. magnetic or smart card reader that is distinct from the sensor subsystem may be provided at each player s position for the player to insert or swipe their media e.g. loyalty program or patron card driver s license credit debit or prepaid card .

As a further example a dealer or a pit boss may manually assign the player to the specific table seat at a management user interface of the gaming system. The management user interface may include user selectable icons displayed on the playing surface or on a separate display or input device such as the Bally Table View product. This assignment is usually performed by entering the player s patron card number into the user interface or swiping the club card at the dealer s or pit boss s terminal. The dealer or pit boss typically unassigns the player when the player leaves the table. Such closes the bonusing and session account for the player at the particular table gaming or arcade style gaming system.

The game related pieces may be marked in a variety of ways. For example game related pieces may have one or more machine readable symbols for instance bar code symbols stacked code symbols area or matrix code symbols or other machine readable indicia. The machine readable symbols may take any form or geometric shape or pattern that is defined by the particular machine readable symbology. The machine readable symbols may be visible to the players or may be invisible to the players for instance formed using an invisible ink e.g. infrared reflective printed on or affixed to some manner to the game related piece. The machine readable symbol may encode a casino identifier and or game piece identifier. Where the game related pieces are playing cards the game piece identifier may for example include a rank identifier indicative of a rank e.g. Heart Spade Club Diamond a suit identifier indicative of a rank e.g. 2 Ace and or a deck identifier indicative of a specific deck to which the playing card belongs. In some embodiments the machine readable symbol may encode a unique game piece identifier which is mapped via a database to particular information regarding the game related piece. Thus a ranks suit and deck may be determined from a unique playing card identifier encoded in a machine readable symbol carried by a playing card. While such an approach may slow the performance of a gaming system the approach reduces the amount of information which must be encoded and hence the area occupied by the machine readable symbol. Where the game related piece is a die the spots on the die may be machine read for example by the sensor subsystem. Additional visible or non visible markings may also be used or used in lieu of the spots on the die for example to encode a unique identifier for the die. The unique identifier may be logically related to other information using a database.

Also for example game related pieces may include one or more wireless transponders which encode information regarding the game related pieces. Transponders may for example take the form of RFID transponders with one or more identifiers stored in memory. Transponders may include one or more EAS type transponders with information encoded in form or shape of the backscatter antenna structure. The encoded information may take the form of one or more identifiers such as described with respect to machine readable symbols.

Also for example game related pieces may include one or more magnetic stripes or distributions of magnetic or ferromagnetic particles which encode information regarding the game related pieces. The encoded information may take the form of one or more identifiers such as described with respect to machine readable symbols.

Players may wish to transfer funds into an account associated with a credit meter or display of virtual chips on the playing surface. Such a transfer may be performed in a variety of ways.

A player may hand a dealer or a pit boss cash or a cash voucher. In such a situation the dealer or pit boss may assign the funds to a specific seat at the table where the player is sitting. The assignment may be made via a dealer management interface which may be displayed on or below the playing surface or may be a secondary display such as Bally s Table view or a separate device.

A player may place physical casino chips on a playing surface. The sensor subsystem may read the chips and the display subsystem may display a representation indicative of total quantity and or amount or value of the physical chips in response. As described previously the sensor subsystem may employ cameras or CCDs under above or surrounding the playing surface or may employ other sensors for instance wireless interrogators. The dealer or player can convert the physical chips into virtual chips via an approval process. The dealer collects the physical chips in response since the value of such has been credited to an account of the player or virtual credit meter.

A player may identify him or herself at the gaming system by placing a piece of media e.g. loyalty program or patron club card driver s license credit debit or prepaid card on the playing surface. A sensor subsystem may read the media and a CMP CMS system may identify the player from the read information. The display subsystem may display indicia representing cash and or point balances of one or more accounts associated with the player. The player may employ a user interface to transfer funds from their account for example to a credit meter of the gaming system or as virtual chips. The transfer may require entry and approval of a personal identification number PIN biometric data and or password. The user interface may include one or more user selectable icons displayed on or below the playing surface or some separate device such as a PIN pad keypad or keyboard for example located at each seat. Transfers may employ appropriate security protocols and encryption for example AFT or WAT transfer protocols of SAS or the GSA G2S class respectively.

A player may initiate a cash systems credit card transfer on the playing surface using the patron s loyalty program or club card. The display subsystem or another system e.g. Bally Gaming s iVIEW display may display a list of credit cards pre associated by the player with the player s loyalty program or club account. The player may select a specific debit credit card account and the amount of transfer. The player may be required to enter a PIN and or password to approve the transaction. The funds may automatically be transferred into the account associated with the player s loyalty program or club card. A second transaction may then transfer funds to the credit meter and or virtual chips associated with the player from the account associated with the player s loyalty program or club card. The second transaction may occur with or without further player interaction.

A player may initiate a funds transfer by placing a piece of financial media on the playing surface for example a credit card debit card or prepaid card. The sensor subsystem reads information from the financial media. For example the sensor subsystem may optically read one or more machine readable symbols on the financial media. The machine readable symbol may be stamped into the financial media during manufacture for example by a bank or other entity that issues the financial media. The machine readable symbol may be applied to the financial media during or after manufacture for example as a label. The machine readable symbol allows the financial media and or player to be uniquely identified. Alternatively the sensor subsystem may be a wireless interrogate or a transponder carried by the financial media. Alternatively the sensor subsystem may magnetically or inductively read information from a magnetic strip or other material carried by the financial media. The transponder or magnetic strip or other material may encode a unique identifier. The display subsystem may visually present an ATM type interface to the player for example positioned next to piece of financial media on the playing surface. The interface table may allow the player to enter an amount of funds to transfer and optionally a PIN and or password to authorize the transaction. A debit credit transfer from an account associated with the player e.g. bank credit debit or prepaid card account to the credit meter or virtual chip meter is completed.

Some embodiments may employ a bill or currency acceptor or validators for the entire table or one per player position. Once a credit cash or promotional credit voucher is inserted into the WBA bill ticket validator the appropriate funds are credited to an account associated with the player or to a credit meter that is associated with the player at the table or arcade style gaming system. If only a single bill ticket validator is present at the gaming system then the credit value is shown to the dealer or pit boss who can direct the credit to the appropriate player s credit meter or account. The display subsystem may provide an interface on or under the playing surface that allows the funds to be credited to the credit meter or the account of a specific player. Funds could be credited with or without identifying the player by name.

Some embodiments may allow wireless transfer of funds from a personal computing device and or wireless communication device capable of performing funds transfer for example from an eWallet inside the device or from a remote financial institution or other points or cash funds account. Personal computing and or wireless communication devices may take a variety of forms for example a cell phone iPhone personal digital assistant PDA laptop computer BLACKBERRY TREO and other such devices. The device may establish wireless communication with the table or arcade style gaming system or with a casino patron account. Funds may be debited from or credited to the device or a remote financial account. The communication protocol may take a variety of forms for example Bluetooth or Wi Fi but other standard networking protocols are envisioned as long as the protocols support security via authentication and or encryption of the transmissions and transactions.

Some embodiments may allow players to transfer funds from the server based e.g. CMP CMS patron accounts to machine credit meters or virtual token meters of specific table or arcade style gaming systems. Such transfers may for example occur automatically at the commencement of each game play. The transfer may for example employ the GSA WAT class protocol. Alternatively in an entirely server based gaming system where all credits are maintained on the server there would not be a funds transfer from the server to the table game meters. The funds would be decremented from the player account automatically at commencement of play in the amount of the wager. Reports of these transactions may be automatically generated and made electronically available to the player and or authorized casino personnel.

In some embodiments the table or arcade style gaming system and or associated systems may enforce responsible gaming practices for players and casinos. For example if a player has played a certain amount of time a certain amount of wagers or has a certain amount of losses or combinations of these further play on the virtual game layout may be blocked for the particular player. The system may produce an alert e.g. visual aural such that a dealer is notified of the player crossing certain predetermined thresholds and further bets or currency conversions are disallowed. The player session may be suspended and the remaining player funds can be printed out of a printer on a cash voucher handed to the player in the form of chips or cash sent to the player account or any combination of these acts may occur. Once the responsible gaming triggers or events have expired then the player may resume play on the table or arcade style gaming system and or at other gaming devices throughout the casino or spanning casino properties. To enforce responsible gaming a player may be required to identify oneself prior to play otherwise play may be prevented by the dealer the system or both.

Detection of bets or wagers may take a variety of forms. For example a player may manually increment a bet meter by selecting various user selectable icons which may for example be displayed on or below the playing surface at the player position by a display subsystem. The displays subsystem may update a representation of a bet meter associated with the player position to indicate an increase while updating a representation of a credit meter or virtual token meter to indicate a consequent reduction.

Also for example a player may place one or more casino chips into a demarcated wagering area such as a bet circle that forms part of the virtual game layout displayed on or below the playing surface by the display subsystem. The sensor subsystem may detect a number and or amount or value of the chips. For instance the chips may be optically coded and the sensor subsystem may read a chip identifier chip value and or casino identifier. Bally Technologies currently employs a series of color transitions about the peripheral edge of the chip to optically identify the value of a chip and the issuing casino. Such patterns are distinguishable to readers optical scanners and imagers . These chip identifiers may be associated to a value via a database such as a lookup table. Alternatively or additionally the chips may have wireless transponders such as RFID transponders or EAS type transponders which may be wireless interrogated via interrogation devices of the sensor subsystem. The interrogation devices may read a unique identifier chip value and or casino identifier from each chip. Again the identifiers may be associated to a value via a database. The interrogation devices may determine a sum total of the chips in each demarcated area.

As another example a player may employ a combination of the virtual chips or credit meter betting and or detection of physical chips. The total value of credits bet with the credit meter and with physical chips may be combined to a total credit bet or wager for the game play.

If the appropriate minimum maximum bets conditions are not met by a player or players the table or arcade style gaming system may indicate such visually aurally for example causing the display subsystem to display an indication of the discrepancy and or a message that encourages players to provide sufficient funds to begin play. If the sensor subsystem is not able to read the physical chips located in the demarcated wagering area or bet circle the gaming system may produce a suitable indication for example a visual indication that notifies one or more participants that the physical chips need to be spread out to get an accurate reading.

Under certain conditions a player may be provided an opportunity to buy insurance for a hand or to double down a bet. At this time the player may have to apply more funds into the active game. Any of the above approaches may be used.

Some non limiting examples of suitable machine readable symbologies may include EAN 13 EAN 8 UPC A UPC E Code 11 Interleaved 2 of 5 Industrial 2 of 5 Standard 2 of 5 Codabar Plessey MSI PostNet Code 39 Code 93 Code 39i Code 128 LOGMARS PDF417 DataMatrix Maxicode QR Code ISSN SISAC and the like. As described above symbols formed of symbol characters selected from an appropriate symbology may be applied to game related pieces such as playing cards chips dice tokens tiles markers spinners and or pieces of media such as loyalty program or patron club cards credit cards debit cards and or prepaid cards.

In some embodiments the sensor subsystem employs optical recognitions e.g. scanning or imaging which may for example be used to read a machine readable symbol using infrared IR visible light or other wavelengths of electromagnetic energy. Processing of the read symbols may employ conventional machine readable processing techniques for example edge pattern detection algorithms. In some embodiments machine readable symbol processing logic may be used to identify or determine a unique identifier from a pattern. The identifier may be associated with other information via a database or lookup table. Consequently a gaming system may employ a unique identifier to obtain additional information. For example a database may associate unique identifiers with the values of respective physical chips carrying the identifiers. Also for example a player identifier e.g. ID 123456789 or Bryan Kelly Platinum level player may be read from a piece of media such as a loyalty program or patron club card. As a further example the sensor subsystem may read a card identifier from a playing card. A database may relate the card identifier to a playing card rank and or suit as well as a casino identifier. The display subsystem may produce an appropriate visual display on the virtual gaming layout indicative of a characteristic or identity of a physical object game related pieces pieces of media and the like . The display subsystem may also produce visual cues around or near the physical objects to indicate to the players and or dealer that the physical object has been properly detected or read by the sensor subsystem. Any fault or non reading condition can be timely addressed by the appropriate personnel or player.

The table and or arcade style gaming system may allow certain patron club levels or player types to receive enhanced and or modified games extra features and or options. For example a high level player e.g. gold members may receive different bonus cards or more bonus cards than other levels e.g. silver members . Each player type or level may receive different bonus games and or bonus features unique to the particular level. These extra features may be targeted to one or more players at the table and typically are designed so as not to affect play of the other players in the game. However in some embodiments bonus features may affect other players even adversely affecting other players. Also the table gaming or arcade casino style gaming system may be configured to reward specific actions by a player or events for example providing a bonus to the player upon occurrence of the action or event. Such may for instance include providing a bonus game bonus playing card bonus dice throw and or bonus spin upon a significant loss or loss rate by the player in a primary game. The bonus game bonus playing card bonus dice throw and or bonus spin may be displayed by the display subsystem. Such a bonus game bonus playing card bonus dice throw and or bonus spin may combine with the primary game in progress or be separate or distinct from the primary game. Examples of bonuses include a progressive win one or more bonus games one or more bonus playing cards one or more bonus dice rolls one or more insurance markers additional game related pieces or free play to be used at the time of the players choosing.

Bonuses may be awarded on occurrence of a variety of events. For example a bonus may be awarded when a player wagers a defined amount or defined cumulative amount either on one bet or over a period of time. A bonus may be awarded when a player loses a defined amount on one bet or over a period of time. A bonus may be awarded when a player plays for a defined period of time wagers at a defined rate e.g. amount per time and or if a total value of a player to the casino exceeds one or more thresholds. The display subsystem may display a list of bonuses and or activities that earn bonuses on or below the playing surface. The list of bonuses may be customized to each player. The display may include user selectable icons which a player may activate to select between various offered bonuses. For example bonuses may include services an additional chance to win the primary game a bonus game a physical prize or a right to participate in some compelling event that enhances the total player experience. Awarding of bonuses may be related to the table seat player identifier player club level casino identifier a jurisdictional identifier table identifier group of tables and or combinations thereof. These player preferences may be stored in the player account for automatic retrieval at the next table gaming session time allowing the gaming system to offer a player their preferred games or other bonuses.

Table games inherently provide a good environment for implementing group play e.g. cooperative play between two or more players . The various table gaming system embodiments previously discussed facilitate group play allowing players to for example exchange game related pieces e.g. playing cards chips tokens markers tiles and spinners since the table gaming system can track which players have which game related pieces. Such may facilitate team play. For example two or more players may be able to join together with their physical game related pieces and compete with other players or teams of players located at the same gaming table or spanning multiple gaming tables. The display subsystem s may display visual representations of the physical game related pieces and or virtual game related pieces to each team. The display may show either the team s own game related pieces the other teams game related pieces or both. The combination of the virtual game layout and physical game related pieces enables players at different seats or locations to play completely different games from each other. For example there may be a common dealer dealing the playing cards to the players but each player can play by different rules. The computing subsystem may track by player which game pay tables and or rules apply.

Alternatively or additionally some games require a minimum number of players may be required to start a table game for example two players in addition to the dealer to begin play. If there are not enough players at a first gaming table to start the game the gaming system may allow players at other gaming tables to join in the game at the first gaming table. Some embodiments may provide a virtual player for example placing wagers with virtual chips and playing out virtual hands. This may allow a game to proceed where there would not otherwise be a sufficient number of players and or may enhance the entertainment experience for physical players. Such may be particularly suitable for games where players are not in competition with one another but rather compete against the dealer or house since the decisions of the virtual player will be unlikely to adversely affect the physical player. Such may also be applied to games where players compete against one another for example by using a random number generator to determine the actions e.g. hit or stay change wager and the like that the virtual player will take.

This may even span casino properties. Such an approach may for example allow a large poker tournament to be conducted without requiring players to travel to a common site. The players could for example play from multiple local sites hosting the competition play and play against players at remote sites via networked table gaming systems such as those previously described. Some players may play using virtual playing cards while others may play using physical playing cards and still others may play using a combination of virtual and physical playing cards. In some embodiments the display system s may display all of the other player s visible cards and wagers to each player. Such may enhance to player experience as if all players were physically present at the same gaming table. The display subsystem s may display visual representations of the physical playing cards dealt to or held by the dealer or other game related pieces throughout the casino and or spanning multiple casino. The grouping of players from different gaming tables may be done by a dealer or pit boss. Alternatively a group play server may automatically assign players to appropriate gaming tables as necessary to fill the gaming tables. Alternately a player may be presented with a list of remote gaming tables having openings and may select a gaming table to join or a player may create one s own virtual table to invite others to play at.

At the end of a hand of play the dealer may distribute the appropriate funds to the player for example in the form of physical chips or electronic credits for instance to a player account table credit meter or virtual chips associated with the player. The sensing subsystem can read physical chips awarded to the player and compare the award against a known pay table for the game and the amount of the player s wager to ensure that the payout was correct. The gaming system may provide an indication visual aural if the payout is incorrect. The notification may be to the player the dealer pit boss or other casino personnel. In some embodiments the computing subsystem or some other system may automatically determine and award the appropriate payout with or without dealer interaction. The appropriate payout may be determined using a known pay table stored electronically and the amount of the player s wager. The appropriate payout may be automatically added to the credit meter virtual chips or directly placed into a player account associated with the player. The display subsystem may display the proper payout to the player and or dealer on or below the playing surface. This display may be sufficiently large such that one or more surveillance cameras can capture the displayed values for later use if needed. The display subsystem may provide visual prompt to the player inquiring whether the player would like their wager and or winnings to ride on the outcome of a next game or hand e.g. double or nothing . Some embodiments may employ credit meters virtual chips and player accounts in lieu of physical chips advantageously relieving the dealer from having to calculate payouts or manual handle physical chips. Such may also advantageously eliminate the need to service tables to replenish the table bank.

Using a surface computing approach may provide numerous advantages over traditional touch screens. For example a surface computing system is capable of handling multi touch interaction recognizing dozens and dozens of touches simultaneously including fingers hands gestures and objects placed on the playing surface. Surface computing recognizes many points of contact simultaneously not just from one finger as with a typical touch screen but up to dozens and dozens of items at once. Additionally users can actually grab digital information with their hands and interact with content through touch and gesture without the use of a mouse or keyboard. Users can place physical objects on the surface to trigger different types of digital responses including the transfer of digital content. The surface computing environment facilitates interaction between virtual or animated objects and physical objects. Also the surface computing interface rarely or never needs recalibration as compared to traditional touch screens. Further the horizontal form factor associated with surface computing makes it easy for several people to gather around a surface computer together providing a collaborative face to face experience. Further the surface computing device can be designed to be easily cleaned and provide a water tight surface.

Employing a virtual or video representation of a game layout allows casino owners to dynamically reprogram or assign which table games are available on the floor at any one time. For example if there are too many black jack tables some may be quick and easily reconfigured into another type of game for example baccarat. This allows for optimal configuration of the table game floor to maximize revenue. For example in the middle of the week a casino can open the table games up to traditional video slot stations without requiring a dealer at the table. Surface computing table games allow the casino to dynamically re apportion their floor mix from table games to traditional video games at the time of their choosing to maximize revenue.

In some embodiments the playing surface a portion thereof the playfield the game related or play pieces may be varied or changed. Some non limiting examples of possible changes include rotation moved or scaled. Such changes may be applied for example by a player a dealer or the gaming system itself to create a more optimal viewing and entertainment presentation. User hand gestures or button presses may allow the surface or portion of the surface to move around. This is optimal for a turns based game experience where each player takes turns in succession to another. Once a person s turn is over then the entire virtual surface re orientates itself to the next player whose turn it is.

Software may be updated over a network or other communications channel eliminating the inconvenience of manually changing software. Changing game software buttons and displays may all be accomplished via software downloaded to the table or arcade style gaming system.

All game functions may occur on the playing surface interface. Media such as a loyalty program card a player s card or even an identity card or financial card may allow table ratings slot ratings promotional activity electronic funds transfer EFT transfers as well as traditional player tracking and accounting functions. Such media may be automatically read when placed in the playing surface of a gaming table. Such media may for example include machine readable symbols and or transponders such as RFID or EAS circuits. In some embodiments appropriately equipped digital music players and or cell phones may be located on the playing surface to hold EFT transfers or other player data.

The various previously described embodiments bring a truly interactive experience to the player for example offering the player help with various games basic rules and or strategies. A dealer can be a real person or electronic. The type of game being played at the gaming table can be easily changed to suit the player s demand. Thus game offerings may be modified for example during peak times without changing the table configuration. With machine readable chips and playing cards e.g. machine readable symbols RFID or EAS type transponders cheating and dealer or player error will be detectable with the surface table gaming system automatically recognizing which playing cards are in play and which chips have been wagered. Players may be able to buy in chips by locating a credit debit or prepaid card or other media on the playing surface.

Table gaming systems could be used to open new areas of a resort to gaming beyond the traditional gaming floors or rooms. For example the table gaming system may be used as a restaurant table. A player would be able to play while waiting for food and or play while dining. Such may allow a group in the restaurant to play at a four top and have cocktails appetizers lunch or dinner while playing a game either together or separately based on the table configuration.

Table gaming systems may be set up in hotel rooms or poolside. Menu and ordering functions may provide quicker more accurate service to patrons. Orders for room service may be printed or electronically logged based on the selections made from a table gaming system location in a patron s room. Patrons would also be able to play games while in their rooms away from the traditional gaming floors. Thus gaming could be expanded throughout a resort if the jurisdiction allows gaming beyond the traditional gaming areas.

The table gaming systems may also allow menus to be displayed and orders for food and beverages placed in traditional gaming floor or rooms enhancing the gaming atmosphere. The table gaming systems may allow expansion of game types for example bring board type games to the more traditional casino or resort experience.

The table gaming systems may dramatically change the look of the casino floor. Gaming may be provided in rectangular bars and or carousels that are serviced by servers based on orders submitted by the players through the table surface interface while the players continue to play. Long table tops may better accommodate patrons. Patrons may even have their own access to the news and other information via connections to the Internet or World Wide Web from the table surface interface. Some embodiments provide a fully paperless solution where cards and media are read from the playing surface and accounts are also debited and credited though the table surface interface.

Additionally or alternatively displays may be carried or otherwise associated with one or more communication devices for example handheld wireless communication devices such as personal digital assistants PDAs BLACKBERRY or TREO type devices and or cellular phones. The computing subsystem can cause display of virtual game layouts including gaming related information regarding the game as well as other information.

The above description of illustrated embodiments including what is described in the Abstract is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise forms disclosed. Although specific embodiments and examples are described herein for illustrative purposes various equivalent modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the teachings as will be recognized by those skilled in the relevant art. The teachings provided herein can be applied to other playing card distributing systems not necessarily the exemplary playing card handling systems generally described above.

For example in some embodiments the playing cards used are standard playing cards from one or more standard decks of fifty two 52 playing cards. The standard playing cards have a uniform back and the faces each bear a respective combination of a first primary symbol and a second primary symbol. The first primary symbol is selected from a standard set of playing card rank symbols comprising 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K and A and the second primary symbol is selected from a standard set of playing card suit symbols comprising diamond solid and the like. One or more of the primary symbols may identify a value of the playing card under the rules of a specific card game. For example in black jack or twenty one the ranks 2 10 are worth 2 10 points respectively the ranks J K are each worth 10 points and the rank A is worth 10 or 1 point at the player s option. In other embodiments the playing cards may have other symbols graphics backings and the like and may even be modified within the playing card handling system to add enhance or alter the value or significance of the playing card. In one embodiment the playing cards are dual sided playing cards as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 902 436 which published on Jun. 2 2005.

Some of the methods discussed above employ the generation of random numbers or values and some of the structures discussed above refer to random number generators RNGs . While referred to herein and in the claims as being a random number or value and or RNG such terms encompass numbers and values as well as generators that are not truly random in the mathematical sense such as those sometimes referred to as being pseudo random. In some embodiments the random number generator may take the form of a discrete analog or digital component. In other embodiments the RNG may take the form of a controller such as a microcontroller microprocessor digital signal processor application specific integrated circuit or field programmable gate array executing suitable instructions to provide an RNG function.

In some embodiments the RNG randomly determines or selects one or more chances from a domain of chances. In some embodiments the domain may be fixed while other embodiments may vary the domain. For example the domain may be varied to match the number of chances provided to the players or to adjust a probability of winning or payout. In some embodiments parameters for a RNG function may be selected or varied to achieve a desired set of odds or payout. In some embodiments the particular RNG function may be selected to achieve a desired set of odds or payout.

In one embodiment of a gesture enhanced input device a video based button deck is created for use in games on the Alpha II gaming platform including stepper based games video based games card based games e.g. black jack poker and the like and ticket based games e.g. keno bingo and the like . In various embodiments the display of the gesture enhanced input device is offered as an upgrade or a standard feature. A video based selection display of the gesture enhanced input device provides simplified set up and configuration as well as new game play offerings not supported by another panel. In one embodiment the gesture enhanced input device actually moves the virtual buttons to a player s present location on the touch enabled deck. In this regard the gesture enhanced input device is customizable to an individual player s needs includes button size shape location speed of play and the like. In one embodiment a gesture enhanced input device is configured to resize a virtual button deck to compensate for the height arm length hand size finger size and finger length of a player. In one such embodiment of the gesture enhanced input device aspects of the virtual button deck are resized based upon player performance of the game being played. The importance of the player e.g. gold club member and the like may also be used as criteria for resizing button deck characteristics and or adding or deleting various button deck functions or attributes.

In another aspect of the gesture enhanced input device the deck provides an expanded set of options to support advanced types of player input known as gestures. These gestures are generally defined as any input more than a single touch e.g. touching and sliding to spin a top box wheel turn a help pay table page and the like . The system for gesture support is easily extensible by game designer to adapt to new functionality.

Referring now to components of the gesture enhanced input device in one specific non limiting embodiment the deck is a hybrid design with the main portion of the panel including a touch screen capable LCD with a resolution of 1280 by 238 pixels. Preferably a two inch round physical button for SPIN REPEAT BET is mounted to the right of the panel in this non limiting embodiment. In this embodiment the physical button is included to provide tactile movement and button feel that players are accustomed to a physical button in order to aide in acceptance of this gesture enhanced input device in the field. In other embodiments only a touch screen capable LCD or other touch screen device is utilized without any type of physical button on the panel. The video screen functionality of the gesture enhanced input device enables a player to select a wager amount and lines played using touch screen capabilities rather than physical buttons.

With respect to game level control in one aspect of a preferred embodiment the gesture enhanced input device provides support for different button states depending upon player input. In one embodiment the button states include available inactive mouse finger over and selected. The available button state demonstrates that sufficient credits are available to allow this button selection. The inactive button state demonstrates that sufficient credits are not available to allow this selection. Referring now to the Mouse finger over button state if a patron touches and slides from one button to the next this activates the button selection but does not commit to the selection. If patrons slide over an inactive button a prompt appears explaining the button activation. Such instructions may include 1 If over an Inactive selection Add more credits to activate or 2 If over an Ante Bet Activates the bonus bet option. With respect to the selected button state a player must touch and release the button to select a wager. If a player is performing a mouse finger over action a second touch selects the option.

In still another aspect of the gesture enhanced input device a sound effect package is synced with button usage. In this regard the sound design incorporates both a mechanical button sound together with a chord based tonal range e.g. C major where lower frequency tones are used for lower bet amounts and higher tones for higher amounts .

Additionally one embodiment of the gesture enhanced input device provides support for an Aloha Bet which is otherwise known as ALL IN or Bet All Credits with respect to reel games. In such an embodiment this option wagers as many credits as possible based upon the available credits in the machine when selected. Preferably this bet initially attempts to cover all lines at one credit. If sufficient credits are not available or if there are remaining credits the bet is increased by one credit per line evenly across all lines in line order until Max Bet is reached. If there are not sufficient credits to cover all available lines evenly the bet is distributed in pay line order until all available credits are exhausted or Max Bet is reached. At this point the reels are spun. Any residual credits are converted to a ticket and printed prior to spinning the reels.

Referring now to the customization functionality provided by the gesture enhanced input device in one embodiment dynamic fonts are utilized with buttons that are provided. In this regard multi language support is provided by the gesture enhanced input device to support current languages and character sets as well as for ease of localization. In another embodiment the gesture enhanced input device supports various panel configurations for human interface customizations. Additional buttons and functionality may be added as needed.

Referring now to a touch screen input button deck to provide a basic understanding of a player input device is illustrated. The button deck is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. Referring now to a traditional style deck is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. This configuration mimics the functionality of a traditional button panel. Referring now to an Ante bet deck is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. This configuration is designed to enable Ante bet wagering. Referring now to a Bonus Play Gestures and new game play deck is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. The performance of the panel should be substantially identical to the mechanical buttons. In this regard button performance should be instantaneous with no delay between input and action.

Another aspect of a gesture enhanced input device comprises a multi touch screen display virtual button deck that includes a touch screen display in the place of game buttons with a haptic feedback response that registers when a selection has been made. The multi touch embodiment includes a similar display but employs a touch screen that has multi touch capabilities to enhance game play control. In one embodiment shown in the display is mounted so that the touch screen is flush with the game deck. Any function and or operation that are desired by the game requirements may be software coded to be provided by the multi touch display. Additionally the button configuration may be changed on the fly such as in the middle of a game in response to a player action a computer program action an operator action or combinations thereof.

Referring now to a representation of a dice bubble is drawn on the virtual button deck display. A dice bubble when built physically rather than virtually consists of a transparent plastic hemisphere attached to a sprung metal plate. The dice bubble contains one or more dice and when a user presses down on the plastic hemisphere it causes the dice to bounce around and randomly land on a new result. A dice bubble is commonly used in board games as a means of players throwing dice without worrying about losing dice.

In this embodiment a representation of a dice bubble is rendered on the virtual button deck and a player interacts with it by pressing a touch screen which overlays the dice bubble. Preferably the touch screen is enabled with haptic technology and touching the touch screen results in a brief vibration of the touch screen. This vibration is calibrated to match a sound that is recorded by a real dice bubble. It is expected that this recording is also played back in conjunction with the haptic vibration to further reinforce the realistic feel of a virtual dice bubble.

Preferably the dice bubble action button is used to replace the Spin button that is normally found on a virtual button deck. Otherwise stated as shown in pressing the dice action button would cause the virtual dice within the graphical image of the dice bubble to bounce around and would also simultaneously cause a new conventional game cycle to commence on the main screen of the gaming machine.

Optimally the dice bounces around for less time than the length of a game cycle. This enables a player to first focus on the result being shown on the virtual dice button and then on the results being shown on the main gaming machine display. shows one possible virtual dice game outcome as a sequence of graphical images. The left most image is shown to the player prior to the game commencing and then after the virtual dice bounces around the middle image is shown for a brief period until the rest of the game completes on the main screen. Once the game cycle has finished for a brief period of time the right most image a sad face is shown on the virtual dice button.

An advantage can be seen in in that the images to be shown on the virtual dice result are not restricted to a small set such as numbering 1 6 . Rather they may show any arbitrary image. It can also be seen that the number of possible virtual outcomes may be higher than 6 which would be the limit of a physical dice cube . Certain outcomes may be biased using well known techniques such as those disclosed by Telnaes in the early 1980s. shows a winning result for a player. The result image is of 2X which means that whatever wins the player has won on the concurrent main game the result to be paid is doubled. shows a process that may be used to produce this result. Specifically shows a diagram of a Multiply Action Button process.

In at the point a player presses the Action Button the game result is computed so that the reels in a video slot game may spin to the resulting positions and it is determined if the win multiplier action is enabled. The multiplier action may be enabled by a number of means such as 1 A player may place an extra ante bet to enable the action button features. Such ante bets may result in periodic multipliers occurring paid for by the ante bet. 2 The casino management system may choose to enable the action button feature for a particular player or players based upon past play a current bonus level or other criteria. 3 The action button multiplier may be enabled by the methods disclosed in the previous Player Centric in Game Bonusing disclosure. 4 The presence of the action button multiplier feature may be built into the underlying game mathematics with a resultant drop in amounts to be paid in the base payable.

If the action button is enabled the game result is checked to see if a win occurred. If a win did not occur there is no point in multiplying a zero win so the spin action button automatically shows a loss result this may be presented to a player as Better luck next time or Try Again as in .

If a win did occur a multiplication factor M is computed by use of a random number generator. Typically this would be configured to bias towards low multipliers again using methods such as Telnaes. If the result is that M 1 then the Try Again result is shown but if M 1 then the corresponding multiplier is shown on the action button. In any case the game result is then presented as normal with any multiplier affecting the amount paid.

The player makes a flicking gesture and the display reacts as in which shows a Flick to Spin Game Animation. The effect to the player represents a card being slid from the deck and turned over. Once turned over the bonus result is shown if the player has lost the player would be informed as in . shows a diagram of a Flick to Spin Action Button Lose Result. If the player has won the player would be informed as in and awarded a suitable prize. shows a diagram of a Flick to Spin Action Button Win Result. The matching condition may be the same rank of cards two aces the same suit of cards two spades or the same card two aces of spades . Since the probability of these types of matches differs different levels of prizes may be awarded. Once the bonus game has completed the cards are removed from the virtual button deck display and again replaced with the original Flick to Spin virtual button. 

Preferably the fortune teller virtual action button would use methods described previously in the Responsible Reinforcement of Superstitious Behavior disclosure. In the event of a win being determined at the beginning of a game cycle the fortune teller action button would predict this win as in to build anticipation to the player of the coming win. It can be seen that a number of messages could be placed in the virtual action button at this time larger wins could be predicted by messages such as It looks VERY promising Since a fortune teller may not be 100 accurate the prediction may be somewhat less than perfect. This may be achieved by using a random number generator set to give the correct prediction some amount of the time e.g. 75 . When the RNG determines that an incorrect prediction is to be made the message displayed would be chosen such that even in the result of a loss the virtual action button may display a Success is predicted message. Conversely a big win may be heralded with an incorrect prediction of I m not optimistic a message that may not ever be shown with a losing result. The presence of such a message followed by the winning result may add humor and entertainment to the game experience at a time when a player is enjoying a large win.

An embodiment of the gesture enhanced input device uses of the virtual button deck to deliver previously impossible concepts uses of haptic technology to deliver a realistic feel for a dice bubble provides greater entertainment and complexity for a player and provides leverage Player Centric In Game Bonusing and Responsible Superstition methods. This embodiment relies upon the virtual button deck preferably with haptic technology as developed by a number of companies such as Samsung.

The chances may take a variety of forms. The chances may take the form of virtual chances such as in the form of electronic or other data that represent or are otherwise indicative of a value e.g. integer or serial number or identity e.g. alpha numeric string . The virtual chances may be provided or allocated to a player from a domain of virtual chances. Provision or allocation may take place in a computer readable memory or other storage element for example as relationships in a database or other data structure. The domain of virtual chances may be fixed or generated on the fly.

As disclosed above a gesture enhanced input device may comprise a Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System that may include a touch screen display with a haptic feedback response that registers when a selection has been made. In some embodiments the Multi Game Action Button Deck or virtual deck in a Concurrent Gaming System enables a player to individually select and play one or more games from a plurality of presented or displayed games. The plurality of presented or displayed games may be the same or different based on for example credit denomination minimum bet maximum bet bet progression themes titles game cycle frame rate number of pay lines pay line progression or the like.

In some embodiments a gaming machine may present or display two three four or more games to the player. Each game may be the same or one or more games may be different. In an embodiment involving four games two games may be MAYAN TREASURES titled video slot games and two games may be LIGHTNING SEVENS titled video slot games. One MAYAN TREASURES game may have a credit denomination of 0.01 whereas the other MAYAN TREASURES game may have a credit denomination of 1.00. The two LIGHTNING SEVENS themed games may be the same in every respect i.e. two instances of the same game are available to the player . Among the plurality of presented or displayed games a player may individually select which game s to play among the displayed plurality.

In another embodiment two games may be MAYAN TREASURES titled video slot games one game may be a LIGHTNING SEVENS titled video slot game and another game may be a TOTAL BLAST titled video slot game. In this example the two MAYAN TREASURES games may be the same in every respect. For embodiment the credit denomination the number of pay lines the pay line progression and bet progression may be the same. The LIGHTNING SEVENS game may have a different number of pay lines pay line progression and bet progression from the MAYAN TREASURES games and the TOTAL BLAST game. The TOTAL BLAST game may have a different number of pay lines pay line progression and bet progression from the MAYAN TREASURES games and the LIGHTNING SEVENS game.

Among the plurality of displayed games one or more games may be downloaded to or otherwise temporarily or permanently reside on the gaming machine presenting the plurality of games and executed on a processor local to the gaming machine. One or more games may be streamed to the gaming machine over a network and executed on a processor remote to the gaming machine e.g. a server . Commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 273 555 teaches methods and systems that relate to streaming and compressing data which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The gaming machine may include a display manager to manage displaying the plurality of games on one or more displays of the gaming machine. Commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 350 938 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 241 123 and Ser. No. 12 350 939 teach a display manager that may be used by the gaming machines disclosed herein and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments the gaming system may include one or more display managers. For example a game server running one or more games may include a display manager such that the game data transmitted to the gaming machine has already been processed by the display manager. In another example a game server and one or more gaming machines connected to the game server over a network may include a display manager. In yet another example a game server one or more gaming machines and or a network component such as a router may include a display manager.

Referring now to one embodiment of a Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System is shown. In this embodiment a gaming machine having a first display a second display and a third display a virtual deck is shown. Continuing in this embodiment four primary games G1 G2 G3 and G4 are displayed individually selectable and concurrently playable by the player. Games G1 G4 may be the same or different. The gaming machine may include a display manager to manage displaying primary games G1 G4 on the first second and third displays such as the display manager disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 350 938 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 241 123 and Ser. No. 12 350 939. The orientation of the first and second displays may vary depending on the embodiment. For example the first display may be position above the second display in some embodiments whereas the first and second displays may be positioned side by side in other embodiments. In yet other embodiments a single display may be used to display the four games or more than two displays may be used.

In the embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System that is shown the first display presents primary games G1 and G2 having three display components having graphical data corresponding thereto and the second display presents primary games G3 and G4 also having three display components having graphical data corresponding thereto. The first display component for each game may include graphical data such as game play graphics e.g. slots cards dice or the like associated with the game. As depicted in the first display component for each game includes video slot reels since primary games G1 G4 are video slot games. The second display component for each game may include graphical data such as game information. Game information may include instructions regarding how to play the corresponding game and other game related information e.g. pay line configurations bet progression symbol combinations or the like . As depicted in the second display component for each game may include the game title corresponding to the first display component. The third display or virtual deck component for each game may include graphical data for the virtual deck e.g. virtual wager buttons primary game graphics secondary game graphics or the like . illustrate four examples of graphical data that may be presented on the virtual deck .

In other embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System the graphical data corresponding to the first and second display components may depend on the state of the game. For example the second display component may also include game play graphics for primary games G1 G4 or secondary games associated therewith. In yet other embodiments one or more games G1 G4 may have less than or more than two display components that are not the virtual deck having graphical data corresponding thereto that are managed or otherwise processed by a display manager.

As disclosed herein one or more games may be streamed to a gaming machine or a plurality of gaming machines over a network such as the internet an intranet or the like. illustrates a gaming system that streams a plurality of games to gaming machine according to one embodiment. The game system includes a server that is in communication with the gaming machine and or other client device over a communication network having a bandwidth. The gaming machine and or other client device which is bound to receive graphical data from the server may include a network interface a decompression module for each display and or each compressed data stream video memory a video encoder for each display and displays and . As disclosed above display is a virtual deck.

The server may include software executable on one or more processors one or more graphics processors video memory associated with the one or more graphics processors one or more compression modules and a network interface. In other embodiments the server streams a plurality of games to a plurality of gaming machines connected to a network.

The software may include software for one or more games. As shown in the software includes gaming software for games G1 G4 e.g. an executable for each game . In some embodiments a processor graphics processor video memory and compression module may be dedicated for each instance of gaming software. In other embodiments one or more of the following may be dedicated for each instance of gaming software a processor graphics processor video memory and compression. For example in some embodiments a single processor may execute each instance of gaming software but transmit graphical data to one or more graphics processors reserved for each of the games i.e. four graphics processors one for each game . Other embodiments may have different configurations of these and other components.

The one or more graphics processors receive graphical data generated as a result of the software being executed on the one or more processors. Upon receiving graphical data at least one graphics processor renders the data into a frame of a particular format and may store the rendered frame in video memory. At least one compression module may then receive the frame for compression and compresses i.e. encode the frame. Once the frame is compressed the compressed frame may be sent to the network interface for transmission via a transport protocol over the communication network to the gaming machine and or other client device .

In some embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System one or more system components may be added or removed to the embodiment described with reference to . For example in some embodiments some or all of the graphical data generated at the server may not be compressed by a compression module prior to transmission to the gaming machine . Therefore the server may not include one or more compression modules. Otherwise stated some or all of the graphical data may not be compressed after being rendered by a graphics processor.

In the embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System that is shown the gaming machine includes a display manager e.g. stream compositor . In other embodiments the server may include one or more display managers instead of the gaming machine e.g. one for each gaming machine . In yet other embodiments a network component such as a router may include a display manager instead of the server or gaming machine. In yet further embodiments the server gaming machine a network component or combinations thereof may include a display manager.

The display manager conducts display management processing on graphical data which may include rescaling e.g. resizing and repositioning e.g. changing display area coordinates the graphical data while maintaining the aspect ratio of the graphical data. For example the display management processing may assemble or composite two or more streams of graphical data into a single stream of graphical data. Otherwise stated the display management processing may take two frames of data and convert them into a single frame of data. In addition the display manager may receive touch data i.e. touch signals from one or more of the displays and and route the touch data and conduct coordinate transformations if necessary to the processor executing the game that the touch data is associated with for further processing.

If the server transmits compressed graphical data the gaming machine may first decompress the compressed graphical data so that uncompressed graphical data is input into the display manager for display management processing. In such an embodiment the display manager rescales and or repositions uncompressed graphical data.

To save valuable system resources the server may include the display manager instead of the gaming machine. In such embodiments uncompressed graphical data is processed by the display manager prior to the server transmitting it to the gaming machine . The graphical data output by the display manager e.g. assembled or composited game content from a plurality of games into one or more frames may or may not be compressed prior to transmission to the gaming machine. Conducting display management processing at the server decreases the amount of data being transmitted over the network whether the graphical data is compressed or uncompressed. Conducting display management processing at the server also decreases the amount of data being compressed at the server and decompressed at the gaming machine if the graphical data is compressed prior to transmission over a network . In addition the hardware in each gaming machine may be reduced. More specifically rather than each gaming machine in the system having a display manager the server functions as the display manager for each gaming machine.

Various embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System disclosed herein are examples and illustrate the system resources saved by including the display manager at the server side. In these embodiments a gaming machine receives streamed game content for two different games. The streamed content may include a main display component and a virtual deck component. In a first embodiment the gaming machine includes the display manager. In a second embodiment the server includes the display manager. In yet another embodiment the display manager is a separate component that is located between the server and the gaming machine.

Rather than decompressing each of the four streamed components two for each game in this example the display manager first assembles or composites the streams by for example rescaling and repositioning them. After the display management processing is complete the display management processor may output two streams. The first stream may include the main display component of both games rescaled and repositioned such that the main display component for each game takes up one half this may be different based on the original size and aspect ratio of the graphical data of the available display area and are juxtaposed or adjacent on the main display. The second stream may include the virtual deck component of both games rescaled and repositioned such that the virtual deck component for each game takes up one half this may be different based on the original size and aspect ratio of the graphical data of the available display area and are juxtaposed or adjacent on the virtual deck .

The two streams output by the display manager may be decompressed by the gaming machine. In such an embodiment the processing resources have effectively been reduced by 50 because only two streams need to be decompressed as opposed to four streams.

One aspect of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System enables players to customize their concurrent gaming experience making variations of bets to one or more games to suit their current betting strategy without the limitation of requiring the same number of pay lines and progression of pay lines throughout the games being concurrently played. Another aspect of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System enables concurrent play of less than all of the games displayed at once which is not typically possible with previous implementations . Additionally the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System enables different levels of bets for each game to be played. In still another aspect the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System enables a player to set the total number of credits to be played during a session and the ratio for each game e.g. each of four games a 25 one game at 70 and the another three games at 10 each and the like .

Continuing some embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System enable gesturing on the deck by the player to select games or other gaming parameters e.g. a player may cross out a game that he does not want to play by drawing an X across the game with his finger or the player may make swiping motions to select the games to be played and the like . In some embodiments the multiple games are synchronized with each other and in other embodiments the games are not synchronized with each other. In this regard the multiple games may be initiated at the same time in some embodiments and the multiple games may be initiated at different times in other embodiments.

Referring to the embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System shown in execution of the software for games G1 G4 generates separate streams of graphical data for each of the displays i.e. the first display the second display and the virtual deck . Without the display manager the gaming machine may receive four different streams of graphical data calling for the same graphical real estate e.g. the entire display . Accordingly the display manager manages the graphical real estate so that more than one game can be presented to the user at the same time using one or more of the displays.

The display manager may receive graphical data streams and that are respectively associated with the first second and third display components of game G1. Without the display manager graphical data streams and may for example be destined to be displayed on the entire first display the entire second display and the entire virtual deck respectively. The display manager may also receive graphical data streams and that are respectively associated with the first second and third display components of game G2. Without the display manager graphical data streams and may for example be destined to be displayed on the entire first display the entire second display and the entire virtual deck respectively. The display manager also receives graphical data streams and that are respectively associated with the first second and third display components of game G3. Without the display manager graphical data streams and may for example be destined to be displayed on the entire first display the entire second display and the entire virtual deck respectively. The display manager also receives graphical data streams and that are respectively associated with the first second and third display components of game G4. Without the display manager graphical data streams and may for example be destined to be displayed on the entire first display the entire second display and the entire virtual deck respectively.

In some embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System may illustrate examples of graphical data associated with graphical data streams and presented on the virtual deck . In one embodiment games G1 and G3 may be different independent instances of the same primary game. The server may execute the software for games G1 and G3 that results in the server outputting graphical data streams and . shows an example of the graphical data stream or as it would be presented on the virtual deck if the gaming machine only presented game G1 or G3. Since games G1 and G3 are the same game in this embodiment the same figure is used to illustrate two different streams of graphical data.

The server may execute the software for game G2 which results in the server outputting graphical data stream . shows an example of the graphical data stream as it would be presented on the virtual deck if the gaming machine only presented game G2. The server may execute the software for game G4 which results in the server outputting graphical data stream . shows an example of the graphical data stream as it would be presented on the virtual deck if the gaming machine only presented game G3. are examples of selectable pay line and selectable bet configurations on the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System.

Other embodiments may generate different graphical data. For example shows an alternative graphical configuration for game G4 that may be presented on the virtual deck if the gaming machine only presented game G4. More specifically illustrates an example of a max pay line and selectable bet configuration that requires the player of game G4 to play all play lines but enables the player to select his or her bet i.e. credits per pay line .

In this embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System games G1 and G3 may have 25 pay lines with the same pay line progression 1 5 10 20 or 25 lines minimum bet maximum bet and bet progression 1 2 3 5 or 10 credits per line . Game G2 may have 30 pay lines with a pay line progression of 1 5 10 20 or 30 lines and a bet progression of 1 2 3 5 or 10 credits per line. Game G4 may have 40 pay lines with a pay line progression of 1 5 10 20 or 40 lines and a bet progression of 1 2 3 4 or 5 credits per line. In this embodiment games G1 and G3 have a maximum bet of 250 credits 25 lines 10 credits per line game G2 has a maximum bet of 300 credits 30 lines 10 credits per line and game G4 has a maximum bet of 200 credits 40 lines 5 credits per line . In other embodiments one or more games may be the same or different based on for example credit denomination minimum bet maximum bet bet progression themes titles game cycle frame rate number of pay lines pay line progression or the like.

Referring back to the display manager may for example rescale and reposition one or more of the graphical data streams while maintaining the aspect ratio of each graphical data stream. In some embodiments the aspect ratio of one or more graphical data streams may not be maintained. In the embodiment shown the display manager has rescaled and repositioned graphical data streams and into a single graphical data stream that is transmitted to the first display . Accordingly instead of games G1 and G2 calling for the same graphical real estate on the first and second displays the display manager has resized and repositioned both games such that the first and second display components for each game take up one fourth this may be different based on the original size and aspect ratio of the graphical data of the available display area and are juxtaposed or adjacent on the first display. The display manager has also rescaled and repositioned graphical data streams and into a single graphical data stream that is transmitted to the second display .

Accordingly instead of games G3 and G4 calling for the same graphical real estate on the first and second displays the display manager has resized and repositioned both games such that the first and second display components for each game take up one fourth this may be different based on the original size and aspect ratio of the graphical data of the available display area and are juxtaposed or adjacent on the second display. The display manager has also rescaled and repositioned graphical data streams and into a single graphical data stream that is transmitted to the virtual deck . Accordingly instead of games G1 G4 calling for the same graphical real estate on the virtual deck the display manager has resized and repositioned the third display components of games G1 G4 such that the third display components for each game take up one fourth this may be different based on the original size and aspect ratio of the graphical data of the available display area and are juxtaposed or adjacent on the virtual deck .

In other embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System the display manager may rescale and or reposition one or more graphical data streams differently than disclosed herein. For example the display manager may assemble or composite one or more streams of graphical data such that a single display presents one two three four or more display components from one or more games. In one embodiment the display manager may assemble or composite graphical data streams and into a single graphical data stream that is transmitted to the first display e.g. top display . Games G2 G3 and G4 may be vertically displayed such that game G2 is displayed on the left game G3 is displayed in the middle and game G4 is displayed on the right. The display manager may also assemble or composite graphical data streams and into a single graphical data stream that is transmitted to the second display e.g. main display .

Each individual Action Button is composed of the four bets that are found in the corresponding button shown in . Accordingly pressing the left most Action Button in causes a bet of 40 lines 1 credit to be placed on the Total Blast game. Similarly pressing the left most Action Button in also causes a bet of 40 lines 1 credit to be placed on the Total Blast game bets of 25 lines 1 credit to be placed on both instances of the Mayan Treasures game and bets 30 lines 1 credit to be played on the Lightning Sevens game.

In this scenario the total bet would therefore be 40 25 25 30 120 credits which is shown on the Action Button for player reference. In another embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System the contents of the Action Button which in the examples shown includes all information relevant to a bet are replaced with a total value such as Bet 120 credits. In this embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System there would preferably be a touch screen button available that would enable the player to toggle between a more information screen that shows all data and a less information screen that shows just the betting information e.g. Bet 120 credits. Continuing the progression of bets per line is reflected across the five buttons e.g. the Mayan Treasure game and the Lightning Sevens game have a progression of 1 2 3 5 10 per line while the Total Blast game has a progression of 1 2 3 4 5 per line. When a player changes one or more of the games to be played the values on the Multi Game Action Button Deck reflect this change. Accordingly the Multi Game Action Button Deck allows any combination of any number of line bet combinations to be played concurrently.

If a player touches the center of the Action Button which is shown within the black bars in with the numbers 1 2 3 4 all 4 games would be immediately wagered upon. The result of this action is shown in . If instead the player were to touch the middle of the Action Button but towards the left hand side then only games 1 and 3 would be wagered upon. The result of this action is shown in . Finally if the player were to touch the bottom left corner of the Action Button only game 3 would be wagered upon. The result of this action is shown in .

In one embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System these rules are used across all five of the Action Buttons giving the player possible ways to wager at any one time. Since games may run asynchronously it is possible for a player to start one game and then while that game is playing start another game. While a game is in progress that specific game instance may not be restarted again by pressing the Action Button or a touch area that would normally commence the game.

Additionally the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System does not require the same number of Multi Game Action Buttons as compared to the original Action Buttons shown in . shows a method of assigning original action button bet per line values to Multi Action Buttons. This method includes the following steps 1 assigning the maximum bet so if only one Multi Action Button is available it takes the maximum bet of each of the concurrent games 2 assigning the minimum bet 3 assigning a midpoint bet and 4 recursively assigning any buttons remaining i.e. the midpoint between the midpoint and the maximum is assigned to an action button followed by the midpoint between the midpoint and the minimum. If more than five buttons were employed further recursion would be used. .

In an alternative embodiment once the player initially touches the 2 per line icon all of the Action Buttons become inactive for wagering purposes and a subsequent touch of an Action Button causes the 2 per line to be applied to wherever the touch occurs.

These embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System disclosed herein have a customization ability that enables a player to quickly configure their preferred betting strategy giving them maximum flexibility but without requiring complex interaction during normal play. In some embodiments this betting strategy configuration state may be saved in a player tracking system or other system along with the current active games when a player ends their session so that the betting strategy configuration may be retrieved when the player returns for subsequent game play.

Continuing shows an alternative embodiment of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System in which each of the virtual button deck streams taken from from the concurrently played games are rendered in the same arrangement as the games are displayed in the cabinet. In this embodiment only one extra button e.g. Spin is used. This is the only button that causes a wager to be made in this embodiment. Notably this Spin button may also be segmented as shown in to enable players to play less than all four games at once. In the example shown in all four concurrent games are the Total Blast game however any of the game themes are eligible to be played. To modify a bet a player must touch the smaller play x credits button which does not cause the game to spin as yet but does cause the relevant bet amount in the corresponding segment of the Spin button to be updated. In addition the text underneath the Spin button is updated to reflect the new total amount of bet that would be wagered once the Spin button is pressed.

Preferred embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System employ two approaches to address this issue. In a first process employed by the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System is shown that determines the game cycle length of each game to be played. This game cycle length information may be static i.e. the game cycle length does not vary with respect to the game result or this game cycle length information may be determined at each spin time if game cycle time was variable i.e. the game cycle length varies with respect to the game result . An example of such a variable game cycle length would be if anticipatory reels are used where the 4and 5reels spin longer if a certain combination of symbols has been hit on reels 1 3.

In this process employed by the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System starting time offsets are created for each game to be simultaneously played by subtracting each game cycle time from the largest cycle time in the array i.e. the starting time offset for one entry will always be zero . Accordingly the process iteratively starts each game waiting until each offset time has been met. The effect of this process from a player s perspective would be one game starting followed by other games starting until all of the games are active. In this scenario all of the games finish at the exact same time.

Referring now to an alternative is shown to the process of . In the process employed by the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System relies on the concurrent gaming system being able to manipulate the frame rate of display of each game. In some embodiments of the concurrent game system this functionality is implemented at a low level without affecting game logic or existing approved binaries of games.

Continuing in each game cycle time is again determined however each game is started at the same time. In these embodiments games with shorter cycles are slowed down such that all concurrent game cycle times become the same length. Alternatively all game cycle times may be adjusted to the shortest length of time by speeding up the frame rates of games with slower game cycles to match the fastest game cycle time.

When the embodiments of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System shown in and are implemented the Multi Game Action Button Deck enables the setting of limiting factors on starting time offsets as well as frame rate increases or decreases e.g. such as in the instances where game cycle times become much larger . An example of such a larger game cycle time would be when a dynamic game cycle adjustment is used and a particular game has a free game scenario. In this embodiment it would not be preferable to slow down the other games or start the other games later by significant amounts.

In some preferred implementations of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System arbitrary concurrent games can be played not limited to a particular line bet configuration. Additionally in some embodiment the number of concurrent games to be played is not fixed. In another aspect the logical arrangement of Action Buttons reflects the game arrangement on display s . In other embodiments players may play less than all of the concurrent games at one time. In still other embodiments players may start games asynchronously. In yet other embodiments players may customize the Action Buttons to their particular betting strategy. Finally in some embodiments games may finish concurrently after being started at staggered starting times or different frame rates. The current preferred implementation uses a standard Alpha 2 cabinet with a virtual button deck and streaming technology such as H.264 video encoding to deliver game content from virtual machine instances running on a server.

Some preferred implementations of the Multi Game Action Button Deck in a Concurrent Gaming System include the following elements 1 Touch screen buttons to initiate wagering on multiple games at once 2 Buttons segmented in same arrangement as concurrent games are displayed 3 Multiple touch areas of buttons control different combinations of games 4 User configuration of buttons via drag and drop and 5 Alignment of different game cycle times so that game cycle end times coincide.

EGM processor board executes a game program that causes the gaming device to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming terminal cabinet .

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle button such as a SPIN RESET button or a touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays such as the primary game display as shown in . In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming device for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally EGM processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the outcome to an award schedule. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering and play of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset EGM processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on the primary game display and or any secondary display s .

App. 2009 0149253 entitled Video Switcher and Touch Router Method for a Gaming Machine filed Jan. 8 2009 and incorporated by reference. Instead of providing the PTM display the switcher and router device provides for the content normally display at the PTM display to be displayed at one or more of the primary or secondary displays .

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming terminal processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of an operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating board server layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard EGM processing board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional game application API as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in manager and cash out manager call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like game event log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. Random number generator manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM manager thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

With reference to an embodiment of the present invention is described. According to this embodiment a graphical user interface GUI is presented to the player at the primary game display . The GUI may be summoned by the player as described below and or may be presented when the player starts their gaming session at the gaming device as by establishing credits e.g. inserting money or inserting their loyalty card into the card reader . One or more processors such as EGM Processor Board controls the GUI to occupy designated real estate at the primary game display which may be the entire display screen or portion thereof. The GUI offers a player a selection of Poker games or slots as by touch screen displayed buttons and respectively. For purposes of the following description is shall be assumed that the player selected to play concurrent slot reel spinning video games. The GUI shows in this exemplary embodiment five regions arranged in a column and row pattern as shown. This display format informs the player that they can select up to five games to play concurrently. It should be understood that more or fewer concurrent games can be selected. Further this display format indicates to the player the placement of the game instances at the primary game display and secondary display which will follow from their selection. As described below where the player elects to select less than five games the display format will change to allocate display real estate appropriately.

Each region may be controlled to display information such as icons game titles miniature game displays to inform the player of the games available for selection from a game data storage library. As described above this library may be in a memory device at the gaming device or at a remote server. According to the present invention the library stores data corresponding to X games where X 1 and where at least two of the games X are different. By different what is meant is that the games have one or more of different play mechanics including but not limited to pay table base game award structure pay line structure number and arrangement theme scatter symbol awards symbol graphics number of reels different arrangements of rows r and columns c of the game display matrix bonus trigger conditions and bonus play and award structure. For example a game Xmay have a certain game theme as demonstrated by for example its title and certain game graphics for game symbols or secondary feature game presentation and award structure. Another game Xmay have the same play mechanics as X a clone but be a different game by having a different theme and graphics. A game may be as described above different for a variety of reasons. Different does not include an instance of the same game. Preferably all of the games available for play from the library are of the same denomination such as be all being 1 denomination games. It should be understood that mixed denomination games could be included. As shown in X is represented by four games and each has an icon display in each region . It should be understood that X could be greater that four.

In the event the player selects a single game to play at the gaming device the game data from the library is accessed and the game is display as suggested by . With reference to the primary game display shows the game matrix of four rows r of symbols on five reels defining columns c presenting the 4 5 game matrix . Also displayed is a banner below the game matrix to display to the player among other information a credit meter showing the total credits available to the player for wagering a bet meter showing the amount of the most recent wager and a win meter showing the amount won on the previous spin play. Adjacent to the banner is a denomination icon an information touch screen button where the player may call up various game information screens a speaker icon where the payer may control the sound volume and a game selection icon the function of which is hereinafter described.

According to the present invention the player may select to concurrently play N games where N 1 at the gaming device . By concurrent what is meant is that all selected games are displayed at the primary game display all are wagered upon and enabled for play or indicated as disabled and all are started for play by a common play prompt. Each selected game derives a separate outcome winning losing or bonus outcome no one game N outcome is dependent upon a game outcome from another game N and each game s win is allocated to at least a common credit meter. Concurrent and simultaneous play is used herein interchangeably. It should be understood as described herein the concurrent games may start and finish at different times however each is prompted for play by a common prompt at the gaming device and the play of the games of the set N is not complete until the play of all games is completed.

Turning to the function of the apparatus method and system according to an embodiment of the invention is shown. At the controlling processor such as EGM Processor Board and or cloud service and or game engine server hereinafter separately and or collectively referred to the processor controls the primary game display to display the GUI . In so doing the processor may access the game library which may be a data storage device at the gaming device or remotely accessible though an appropriate communication network. The game library stores data corresponding to X games where X 1 and where at least two games of X are different. The player at selects the games of the set N they wish to play concurrently at least two of the games of N are different. The player may for example select to play four concurrent games where two games are the same game X one game is a different game Xand the fourth game is yet another different game X. That is the player may select to play multiple instances of the same game X but at least two games of the set N are different. At the processor determines the primary game real estate available and arranges the display of the selected game instances at the primary game display . shows examples of this real estate allocation. In many applications the available display real estate is the entire primary game display less some border areas for the display for example of the banner . Where primary game real estate has a portion used for system delivered content as described in U.S. Pub. App. 2009 0149253 entitled Video Switcher and Touch Router Method for a Gaming Machine filed Jan. 8 2009 and incorporated by reference the remainder of the real estate is available for presentations of the concurrent games. At the player selects the games for the set N. In the event the player selects at five games N 5 the processor controls the primary game display to allocate the real estate to the games as shown. Game Nis assigned area game Nis assigned area game Nis assigned to area game Nis assigned to area and game Nis assigned to area . While the display pattern may have equal areas assigned at the primary game display in a preferred embodiment the areas are somewhat larger and may reflect the position as chosen by player preferences or may be assigned based upon the order of game selection for promotional reasons such as newer games get a greater presence based upon the game provider or sponsor paying for preferential allocation or based upon other rules or protocols adopted and implemented through the processor. In an embodiment the player may switch the positions of the displays by touching and dragging the desired game display to the desired position. If the player selects at to play four concurrent games the game instances N Nmay be allocated equal space in the available display real estate and areas are sized accordingly. If the player selects at to play three concurrent games the game instances N Nmay be allocated display real estate in a pattern as suggested. Again where one game instance is assigned greater display real estate the basis may be as described above. Finally if the player selects at to play two concurrent games the game instances N1 N2 may be allocated equal space in the available display real estate and areas are sized accordingly. If the player elects to play a single game at that game instance is displayed.

Returning to at the processor enables the selected games for play. Enablement may be by way of delivering or providing access to the software to control the games of the set N or it may be delivering Apps to a remote play device such as a cellular device arranging the selected games in RAM or tagging or sending cookies or tags for remote play of the selected games. In this regard it should be understood that the apparatus systems and methods of the present invention can be provided for play for value e.g. casino or remote pay to play and or can be provided for entertainment or promotional play

At the player makes a wager to enable the selected games for play. In the event the player does not have sufficient credits to enable all of the selected games at one or more of the selected games is disabled at . For example the player may have selected and played five concurrent games and their credit meter level has dropped so that only three games may be played. The processor would disable two games based upon player selection or predetermined rules protocols such as the last game selected is the first to be disabled. The processor to indicate disablement may either remove the disabled games from the display and size the remaining games to the primary game display in a pattern as described above or may grey out the disabled games or control the display to otherwise denote the disabled games as indeed disabled. If indeed the player has sufficient credits to enable all selected games of the set N a wager is made and allocated as hereinafter described and at the player prompts play by activating a play button or pulling a handle. Game play is prompted and all concurrent games are played to produce winning or losing outcomes. As described above some if not all of the games of the set N may have bonus features triggered by events such as certain symbols being selected or displayed a random event such as a mystery trigger or other game play related or system enabled event. These secondary games may entitle the player to select from hidden prizes have free spins awarded to spin a separate wheel to engage in the play of a feature or the like. The various embodiments of the present invention are not limited by the type or nature of the secondary bonus feature game. If one or more of the games of the set N achieve a bonus trigger at at each bonus game is played to its conclusion. At all awards for the base game and any bonus games are awarded to the player.

Turning to there are shown patterns for assignment of games of the selected set N to the available real estate at the primary display as was described with reference to .

In an embodiment where multiple games are displayed at the primary and or secondary game displays each game instance displayed may have its own banner modified to show the bet meter and win meter for that game only. At a location on the display such as the bottom border of the primary game display there is another banner which displays the credits available to the player for wagering the aggregate wager for all displayed games in play and the aggregate win from all displayed games in play at its credit meter bet meter and win meter .

Turning to a further feature of the present invention is shown. Inasmuch as multiple games are displayed in the selected set N protocol or rules are defined for their collective presentation of outcomes to the player. In one embodiment for games deployed in cultures where people read from left to right the rules may be established to start and finish games based upon this cultural trait. In Asian countries the rules may be reversed. When games are selected for the set N and they are reel spinning type games the processor is configured to determine for each game their game cycle times e.g. the time period between the start of game outcome presentation to the end of the presentation. For example each game have be configured such that the reels start spinning with the leftmost reel starting first then the second reel third reel and so forth. These rules may include rules including anticipation reel features which may delay the stopping of one or more reels to build suspense and anticipation where for example an award requires the right most reel to display a certain symbol the stopping of the rightmost reel may be delayed to build anticipation for the player. The reels may stop according to the same sequence. illustrate the starting and stopping sequences. shows the starting sequence with the game in area starting first then the game in area and so forth until the game in area is the last to start. Within the games the reel start spin sequences are shown in . Game 1 in area starts its leftmost reel spinning first then substantially contemporaneous with the start of Game 1 s second reel the leftmost reel of Game 2 starts spinning. Thus it should be understood that from left to right and from top to bottom the starting and stopping of the reels follows rules for a choreographed starting and stopping of the games in a fashion which is easy and convenient for the player to follow. The starting and stopping of the games could also be player or operator defined as desired.

To highlight the game instances of the set N each game may have a different color border or skin. The color may be defined by the game or the area to which the game is assigned. That is where the player selects a game for the set N and the game is located in area that game may be assigned a border color background color or skin of the color red. Games of N assigned to other areas would be assigned other colors. In an embodiment where two game instances of N are the same game they may be assigned the same border color thus overriding a color assignment based upon the area to which the game is assigned. Where there is an award in a game the border may be highlighted or flashed or the game instance may be enlarged or the other game instances faded for a period of time to show the player the winning combinations for each game. This win display protocol may serially display the wins for the games according to for example the sequence of .

Using the GUI or the touch screen button panel the player may change the positions of the game instances in the primary game display . The displays which follow or correspond to the positioning of the games as described above would follow the repositioning of the game instances by the player.

With reference to embodiments of the present invention provide for selection placement wagering upon starting play and playing the games N using at either the touch screen primary game display or touch screen panel and drag and drop and or gesture control. For example at the primary game display the player may touch a game for selection to the set N by touching the game icon and dragging it to the desired area of the display relative positions of the games can be changed in a similar manner. Gestures such as multi touch can also be used.
