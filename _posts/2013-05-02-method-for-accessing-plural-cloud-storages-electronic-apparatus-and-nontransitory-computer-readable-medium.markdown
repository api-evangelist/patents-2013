Taking portable electronic devices for example in order to maintain high portability most of the portable electronic devices are regulated by limited sizes limited weights and limited electricity capacities. Therefore portable electronic devices may not be able to equip a hard drive memory with a large storage volume.

An aspect of the present application is to provide a method for accessing plural cloud storages. The method is suitable in a data processing system capable of executing plural application programs for accessing plural cloud storages. The method includes steps of providing a unified interface on the data processing system the unified interface being configured for offering a unified interface format instruction to plural application programs to access each of the cloud storages linking the unified interface with a plurality of configuration plug ins each of the configuration plug ins comprises at least one distinct instruction for accessing a particular cloud storage and converting a request with the unified interface format instruction from one of the application programs to one of the at least one distinct instruction according to the configuration plug ins for accessing a destination cloud storage of the cloud storages.

Another aspect of the present application is to provide an electronic apparatus which includes a plurality of application programs and a unified interface. The application programs are embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution on the electronic apparatus. The unified interface is embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution on the electronic apparatus in conjunction with the application programs. The unified interface is configured for offering a unified interface format instruction. The unified interface format instruction is utilized by the application programs to access each of the cloud storages. The unified interface is linked with a plurality of configuration plug ins. Each of the configuration plug ins comprising at least one distinct instruction for accessing one particular cloud storage.

In order to solve the issue of shorting storage on the electronic devices some cloud storages accessible over Internet are developed to provide extra storage space for electronic devices especially for portable devices. In addition the cloud storages may also provide high portability and synchronization function between different devices. Therefore the cloud storages are popular in recent days. There are various providers providing all kinds of cloud storages.

Each provider of the cloud storages develops different regulations specifications on instructions such as but not limited to Representational State Transfer application programming interface REST API for accessing their own cloud storage. If application programs want to support many cloud storages individual instructions corresponding to all cloud storages must be implemented in each one of the application programs. If a new cloud storage is launched all application programs must be updated again to support the new cloud storage. In this case it is hard to maintain all application programs.

Therefore this disclosure provides a unified interface for providing a unified interface format instruction for accessing all kinds of cloud storages by applications.

Reference is made to . is a flowchart illustrating a method for accessing plural cloud storages according to an embodiment of the disclosure. is a schematic diagram illustrating an electronic apparatus and cloud storages according to an embodiment of the disclosure. In this embodiment the electronic apparatus can be a mobile phone a smart phone a tablet a laptop a personal computer a mobile communication device or an equivalent communication device.

The method for accessing plural cloud storages is suitable in a data processing system capable of executing plural application programs. In this embodiment the data processing system can be the electronic apparatus shown in . However the disclosure is not limited hereto and the method for accessing plural cloud storages can be implemented in another equivalent data processing system.

As shown in of this embodiment the electronic apparatus include plural application programs e.g. application programs APP APP APP . . . and APPn a unified interface and plural configuration plug ins e.g. configuration plug ins and .

For example the electronic apparatus may include a communicative module a storage module and a processing module not shown in figures . The communicative module can be configured for establishing a communicative connection to the communicative network and the cloud storages e.g. the cloud storages in of this embodiment over the communicative network shown in . The storage module can be configured for storing the configuration plug ins e.g. the configuration plug ins in of this embodiment . The processing module can be configured for executing the application programs APP APP APP . . . and APPn and the unified interface shown in .

In the embodiment shown in the application programs APP APPn can be embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution on the electronic apparatus e.g. on an application layer of the electronic apparatus . In the embodiment each of the application programs APP APPn can be application software installed onto the electronic apparatus . For example the application programs can be used in photo editing text editing web browsing email social networking system backup file sharing on line album and or similar purposes. The application programs APP APPn can be programs installed by users over network via an installation disk or any equivalent manner.

Each application program APP APPn may include a function to interact or be integrated with different cloud storages. In other words the program APP APPn has a function involving accessing at least one of cloud storages and . As shown in the cloud storages and can be storage servers owned by different cloud storage providers. For example the cloud storage providers may include Dropbox SkyDrive GoogleDrive Baidu cloud Vdisk Box.net etc.

As shown in step S of the method is executed for providing a unified interface on a data processing system e.g. the electronic apparatus . The unified interface is configured for accessing each of the cloud storages and over a communicative network . The unified interface can be embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution on the electronic apparatus e.g. on an operation system layer or a system framework layer such as Google Android framework layer of the electronic apparatus in conjunction with the application programs APP APPn. The unified interface is configured for handling a request from one of the application programs APP APPn to access a destination cloud storage of the cloud storages and

In this embodiment the unified interface is linked with configuration plug ins and corresponding to the cloud storages and respectively. Each of the configuration plug ins includes distinct instructions e.g. REST APIs for accessing each of the cloud storages respectively. For example the configuration plug in contains the distinct instructions for accessing the cloud storage the configuration plug in contains the distinct instructions for accessing the cloud storage etc. In practices the same operation of loading sections 1 to 10 can be triggered by different instructions on different cloud storages. For example the instruction in the cloud storage can be described as LOAD 1 10 the instruction in the cloud storage can be described as Read sect 0001 1010 the instruction in the cloud storage can be described as LOAD s 1 10 etc.

The unified interface provides a unified interface format instruction to the application programs APP APPn. The request from one of the application programs includes an instruction in the unified interface format instruction and an assignment of the destination cloud storage.

In this embodiment steps and are executed while the unified interface is handling the request from one of the application programs APP APPn to access the destination cloud storage.

After step S step S of the method is executed for receiving the request from one of the application programs APP APPn by the unified interface . The request includes an instruction portion in the unified interface format instruction provided by the unified interface and an assignment portion corresponding to the destination cloud storage e.g. the assignment portion can be a specific identification code representing specific one of the cloud storages .

Afterward step S of the method is executed for converting the instruction portion complying with the unified interface format instruction of the request into the distinct instruction for accessing the destination cloud storage according to the configuration plug ins by the unified interface .

For example if the destination cloud storage is assigned to be the cloud storage the instruction portion complying with the unified interface format instruction of the request can be converted into the distinct instruction according to the configuration plug in by the unified interface .

Then the electronic apparatus may send out the converted instruction to the cloud storage for accessing contents on the cloud storage

The following paragraph is an example based the aforementioned example of loading instructions for demonstrating how to convert the unified interface format instruction into the distinct instruction. In one embodiment of present invention all the application programs APP APPn are only required to execute unified interface format instruction REMOTE STORAGE LOAD Target ID 1 10 provided by the unified interface . The first parameter Target ID of the unified instruction is the assignment portion which indicates which remote cloud storage applications is requested by user. The second parameter of the unified instruction indicates the beginning of the loading section. The third parameter of the unified instruction indicates the end of loading section. If the assignment portion i.e. Target ID corresponds to the cloud storage it means that the cloud storage is assigned to be the destination cloud storage. In this case the unified interface converts the unified instruction REMOTE STORAGE LOAD 1 10 to the distinct instruction Read sect 0001 1010 by referencing plug in so as to access to cloud storage with the distinct instruction Read sect 0001 1010 . Therefore the distinct instructions on all cloud storages are not required to be implemented within each application program APP APPn on the electronic apparatus . What each application program APP APPn needs to know is the assignment portions e.g. the identification codes for assignment of all destination cloud storages. In one embodiment of this invention each application program APP APPn could query all available configuration plug ins corresponding to all available cloud storages installed on the electronic devices and then specify one particular assignment i.e. one particular identification code of the destination cloud storage in order to access the destination cloud storage. Each application program APP APPn may easily access to all cloud storages by sending an instruction in unified format and an assignment of the destination cloud storage to the unified interface and the unified interface will complete the rest of accessing operations.

Reference is also made to which is a schematic diagram illustrating the electronic apparatus the cloud storages and a new cloud storage according to an embodiment of the disclosure.

Furthermore when there is a new cloud storage added among other cloud storages and the new cloud storage is available over the communicative network . A new configuration plug in shown in corresponding to the new cloud storage can be updated to the electronic apparatus over the communicative network e.g. Internet . The new configuration plug in is further linked with the unified interface such that the unified interface of the electronic apparatus may further supports another cloud storage i.e. the new cloud storage . In one embodiment of this invention the new configuration plug in linked with the unified interface could be done by registering the identification ID e.g. a name or a unique number associating with a particular cloud storage all supported access APIs e.g. REST APIs of new cloud storage to unified interface while the new configuration plug in is installing.

In this case the application programs APP APPn are not required to update software program individually for supporting the new cloud storage . By updating one new configuration plug in to the unified interface all the application programs APP APPn can easily utilizes the services from the new cloud storage . For example as aforementioned each application program APP APPn could query names or identifications of all available cloud storage. The same software code of the application programs APP APPn is able to detect new available cloud storage and corresponding configuration plug in and then instantly accessing to new added cloud storage.

The following paragraph describes one embodiment of present disclosure in the case of removing the supporting of the new cloud storage . However the disclosure is not limited to remove the new cloud storage . In another embodiment other existed cloud storages can be removed in the same way. In present case the electronic apparatus provides a user interface for user to un install remove the new configuration plug in . While the un installing process of the new configuration plug in the electronic apparatus unregisters the identification code and removes all supported access APIs e.g. REST APIs corresponding to the new cloud storage from the unified interface . Therefore the application programs APP APPn are not required to update software program individually as well.

Based on aforesaid embodiments the distinct instructions on all cloud storages are not required to be implemented within each application program on the electronic apparatus. Each application program may easily access to all cloud storages by sending an instruction in unified format and an assignment of the destination cloud storage to the unified interface and the unified interface will complete the rest of accessing operations. In addition the electronic apparatus is easier to maintain. When there is an update related to the cloud storages the updating procedure can be done by adding a new plug in or removing an existed plug in to the unified interface instead of amending all the application programs in order to support a new cloud storage or un support an existed cloud storage.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present application without departing from the scope or spirit of the application. In view of the foregoing it is intended that the present application cover modifications and variations of this application provided they fall within the scope of the following claims.
