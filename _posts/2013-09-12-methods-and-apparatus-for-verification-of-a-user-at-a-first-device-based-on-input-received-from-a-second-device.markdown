title: Methods and apparatus for verification of a user at a first device based on input received from a second device
abstract: In one embodiment, a verification platform is adapted for communication with at least first and second devices. The verification platform receives a verification request from the first device, and determines if the first device has a registered association with the second device. If the first device has the registered association, the verification platform sends a notification to the second device regarding the verification request, receives verification input from the second device responsive to the notification, and grants or denies the verification request based at least in part on the verification input received from the second device. The verification request may be generated in conjunction with an attempted launch of a designated application on the first device, with user access to the application being controlled responsive to the granting or denying of the verification request. The first and second devices may comprise mobile telephones, computers or other types of devices.

The present application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61 699 961 and 61 699 966 filed Sep. 12 2012 which are incorporated by reference herein.

The field relates generally to user verification and more particularly to techniques for verifying the identity of a user of an electronic device.

In many verification systems users are required to enter static passwords in order to prove their respective identities so as to gain access to a protected resource. Different applications accounts or other types of protected resources associated with a given user may each require entry of distinct alphanumeric password thereby necessitating that the user remember multiple such passwords in order to access the corresponding resources. This is not only unduly burdensome for the user but can also undermine security in that the user will often write down the passwords or otherwise make them vulnerable to inadvertent disclosure.

It is also known to utilize interaction between multiple electronic devices in order to verify the identity of a given user. In verification systems of this type the devices are typically configured to temporarily pair with one another utilizing peer to peer communications based on short range protocols such as Bluetooth. However such communications require that the devices be in close proximity to one another. Also the communications are usually not highly secure and therefore can be vulnerable to hacking.

Illustrative embodiments of the present invention provide improved techniques for verification of user identity. Such arrangements exhibit significantly enhanced security relative to conventional arrangements while also avoiding the need for a user to remember multiple alphanumeric passwords. For example in some embodiments a motion based verification system utilizes two electronic devices with communication between the two devices being established through a server of a verification platform such that the two devices are never directly paired or otherwise directly in communication with one another. The motion based verification in a given such embodiment eliminates the need for the user to remember multiple passwords as user identity for a primary device can be verified by moving a secondary device in a predetermined pattern. Moreover there is no requirement that the two devices be in close proximity to one another and security of the communications is enhanced leading to reduced vulnerability to hacking.

In one embodiment a verification platform is adapted for communication with at least first and second devices. The verification platform receives a verification request from the first device and determines if the first device has a registered association with the second device. If the first device has the registered association the verification platform sends a notification to the second device regarding the verification request receives verification input from the second device responsive to the notification and grants or denies the verification request based at least in part on the verification input received from the second device.

The verification request may be generated in conjunction with an attempted launch of a designated application on the first device with user access to the designated application on the first device being controlled responsive to the granting or denying of the verification request.

The first and second devices may comprise mobile telephones computers or other types of devices in any combination.

All illustrations of the drawings are for the purpose of describing exemplary embodiments of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.

Illustrative embodiments of the present invention will be described herein with reference to exemplary systems and associated verification platforms user devices and other processing devices. It is to be appreciated however that the invention is not restricted to use with the particular illustrative system and device configurations shown. Accordingly the term communication system as used herein is intended to be broadly construed so as to encompass for example systems in which a single user device communicates with another processing device associated with a verification platform systems in which at least two user devices each communicate with another processing device associated with a verification platform and other types of systems.

A number of embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the flow diagrams of and the communication system diagram of . A given such embodiment implements motion based verification of user identity using a verification service that is supported by a verification platform. The verification service interacts with a motion verification application installed on first and second user devices also referred to herein as primary and secondary devices. Such devices may be considered examples of what are more generally referred to herein as simply first and second devices.

The verification service is implemented using a verification platform that illustratively includes a verification platform application programming interface API and a verification platform server. The verification platform API supports communication with verification agents implemented on respective ones of the primary and secondary devices. The motion verification application on each user device illustratively includes a login screen an application selection screen and a verification selection screen but numerous alternative screen arrangements or other types of user interfaces can be used in other embodiments.

Although primary and secondary user devices are used for identity verification in some embodiments other embodiments can use other types and arrangements of processing devices. For example certain of the described arrangements can be adapted in a straightforward manner for use with a single user device rather than primary and secondary user devices as in the illustrative embodiments. Also other embodiments can be adapted to utilize three or more user devices to perform identity verification.

The primary and secondary user devices communicate with one another via the verification platform. Accordingly the user verification techniques described in conjunction with the illustrative embodiments of do not require that the two devices be in close proximity to one another as in the above noted conventional pairing arrangements using Bluetooth or other short range protocols. The use of the verification platform as an intermediary between the primary and secondary devices also allows for enhanced communication security thereby reducing vulnerability to hacking.

The embodiments of may be viewed as more particular examples of arrangements in which the verification platform receives a verification request from the primary device and determines if the primary device has a registered association with the secondary device. If the primary device has the registered association with the secondary device the verification platform sends a notification to the secondary device regarding the verification request receives verification input from the secondary device responsive to the notification and grants or denies the verification request based at least in part on the verification input received from the secondary device.

As will be described the notification request in one or more of the motion based verification embodiments directs that the secondary device be moved in a predetermined pattern and the verification input comprises information characterizing movement of the secondary device responsive to the notification. The predetermined pattern may be established by the verification platform possibly based at least in part on particular selected types of motion identified by user input.

The verification request may be generated for example in conjunction with an attempted launch of a designated application on the primary device and user access to the designated application on the primary device may be controlled responsive to the granting or denying of the verification request. The designated application on the primary device is also referred to herein as a secure application as its access from the primary device is conditioned on satisfactory completion of motion based verification.

As a more particular example when a secure application is launched on a primary device that is also running the motion verification application the primary device verification agent intercepts the launch of the application from the primary device. The primary device verification agent then searches to see if the secure application requires motion based verification to launch. If the secure application requires motion based verification then the verification platform server searches for a registered secondary device. The verification platform server then notifies the secondary device verification agent of the request for motion based verification. The user then moves the secondary device in the predetermined pattern. Sensors in the secondary device record the motion. The secondary device verification agent then encrypts the input motion data and sends it to the verification platform API. The verification platform API then relays the information to the verification platform server.

The verification platform server compares the input motion to the predetermined pattern. If the motions match then the verification platform server informs the verification platform API which in turn sends an encrypted message to the primary device verification agent to allow the secure application to be launched. If the motions do not match then the verification platform server informs the verification platform API which in turn instructs the primary device verification agent to deny the secure application from being launched.

Accordingly in some embodiments granting of the verification request requires that both the primary device and the secondary device be enrolled in the verification service supported by the verification platform. Such enrollment may also be referred to herein as involving enrollment of a corresponding user in the verification service.

An exemplary enrollment process for the secondary device is shown in . This process includes steps through .

In step the motion verification application is installed on the secondary device by a user. Once the motion verification application has been installed the user registers an email address with the verification service and goes through an email verification process as indicated in step . When the email address has been verified the motion verification application is launched in step . The motion verification application then searches in step for any other enrolled devices. At least one other enrolled device is required in this embodiment to serve as the primary device.

If another enrolled device is discovered then the user is prompted via the verification selection screen as indicated at step to select the desired motion pattern as well as to give a name to the secondary device. Additional or alternative selection functions can be provided by the verification selection screen or other interfaces in other embodiments.

If another enrolled device cannot be found then the user is prompted in step to enroll another device to serve as a primary device. This involves installing the motion verification application on the other device as indicated in step .

The secondary device in this embodiment is also referred to as a token generator because it generates verification input in the form of information characterizing motion of the second device responsive to a notification. Such motion information may be viewed as a type of security token that is provided by the secondary device to the verification platform for use in motion based verification.

In other embodiments alternative enrollment processes may be used. For example the identification of a secondary device to be used as a token generator and the particular motion pattern to be used in motion based verification used can be managed through a web based administrative interface. These and other provisioning functions may therefore be performed by a user or a system administrator.

In a manner similar to the enrollment of the secondary device the primary device may be enrolled using the exemplary process illustrated in . This process for enrollment of the primary device includes steps through .

In step the motion verification application is installed on the primary device by a user. It is assumed without limitation that this user is the same user that installed the motion verification application on the secondary device. Thus both the primary and secondary devices may be associated with the same user. For example the primary device may be a mobile telephone of a given user and the secondary device may be a laptop tablet or desktop computer of that same user or vice versa.

As a more particular example a parent could install the motion verification application on his or her cell phone and home computer. The computer functions as the primary device and the cell phone functions as the secondary device used for verification. If a child is home while the parent is at work and the child wants to access content on the computer that is restricted by the motion verification application then a request for verification is sent to the parent s cell phone. The parent can then choose to perform the predetermined motion on his or her cell phone from the workplace if he or she wishes to grant the child access to the computer application at home. Of course numerous alternative arrangements of two or more devices for implementing motion based verification may be used.

Returning to the primary device enrollment process of once the motion verification application is installed in step the user is prompted in step to enter an email address for verification. The entered email address should be the same email address previously used to enroll the secondary device. When the email address has been verified the motion verification application is launched in step . The motion verification application then presents the verification selection screen in step which allows the user to select another device to function as a token generator device for the primary device as indicated in step . In this embodiment the user would select the secondary device that was previously enrolled.

Also the verification selection screen in step allows the user to specify one or more fallback methods for token generation in the event that motion based verification using the secondary device as token generator is unsuccessful. Examples of such fallback methods will be described in more detail below in conjunction with .

The user may in other embodiments specify multiple fallback methods and a particular sequence in which those fallback methods should be executed. The specification of one or more fallback methods may be viewed as an example of an arrangement in which one or more additional processes are specified for obtaining verification input from a user with at least a given one of these additional processes being executed if an initial process for obtaining verification input is unsuccessful.

After the selections in step the primary device is enrolled in the verification service. Accordingly the user associated with the primary and secondary device is considered enrolled as indicated in step .

Although the secondary device is enrolled before the primary device in the foregoing description this is by way of example only and these and other devices can be enrolled in any order. Also it is possible in other embodiments to enroll multiple primary devices and or multiple secondary devices.

An exemplary process of interaction between the verification service primary device and secondary device is illustrated in . The process includes steps through and assumes that there is a secure application on the primary device that can only be accessed after successful completion of motion based verification. In step the secure application is selected for launch by a user of the primary device. The verification platform receives a corresponding verification request from the primary device and determines that the primary device has a registered association with the secondary device as a result of the enrollment processes of . The server of the verification platform pushes a request for verification input to the secondary device in step . This verification request is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a notification responsive to which the secondary device provides verification input. A determination is made in step as to whether or not the push was successful.

If the push was not successful a determination is made in step as to whether or not the user has specified at least one fallback method. If the user has specified a fallback method the specified method is utilized for user verification in step . A more detailed example involving multiple distinct fallback methods is given below in conjunction with . If the user has not specified a fallback method the access attempt fails and the user is presented with the login screen as indicated in step .

If the push was successful a login request message is sent to the secondary device in step . The user then selects the message in step and logs in to the motion verification application on the secondary device. Once the user logs in to the motion verification application on the secondary device the verification request is displayed in step . If the user accepts the request and moves the secondary device in the predetermined pattern in step then an approval token is sent back to the primary device through the server in step . The secure application is then launched on the primary device as indicated in step . A negative result in step or step will result in execution of step to determine if a fallback method has been specified.

Referring now to the above noted example involving multiple fallback methods is shown. This example assumes that there are four different available fallback methods namely a call a short message service SMS link SMS passcodes or another type of verification request although additional or alternative methods in any combination may be made available for use in a given embodiment. The user can select one or more of these fallback methods via the verification selection screen in the manner previously described in conjunction with step of . The SMS passcodes are also referred to herein as SMS token codes.

The various fallback methods utilized in the example all involve directing a communication to a specified phone number that is different than the phone number of either of the primary and secondary devices assuming for purposes of this example that at least one of those devices comprises a mobile telephone. The illustrated process includes steps through as shown.

In step a determination is made as to which of the available fallback methods has been selected by the user. The first second third and fourth fallback methods are shown in respective steps and .

In step a call is placed to the specified other phone number and the user is prompted to press one or more specific phone keys as indicated in step .

In step an SMS link is sent to the specified other phone number and the user clicks on or otherwise selects the SMS link in step .

In step SMS token codes are sent to the specified other phone number and the user manually enters the received SMS token codes into the primary device in step .

In step another type of verification request is sent to the specified other phone number and the user performs the corresponding verification action in step .

Upon successful completion of the specified fallback method the secure application is launched on the primary device as indicated in step .

As indicated above numerous alternative combinations of fallback methods could be used. Examples of other types of fallback methods that may be applied in embodiments of the invention include but are not limited to voice verification face verification location verification and third party verification.

It is also possible that a given fallback method can make use of local verification via Bluetooth or other short range protocol.

Another view of an exemplary communication process between the verification service primary device and secondary device in an illustrative embodiment is shown in the flow diagram of . It is assumed in this embodiment that the verification service is supported by a verification platform that includes a verification platform API and a verification platform server. The verification platform API is adapted for communication with verification agents implemented on respective ones of the primary and secondary devices. The verification platform API is assumed to be coupled to the verification platform server so as to support communications between these platform components. The process illustrated in includes steps through as shown.

In step a user attempts to access an application on the primary device that requires motion based verification of the type described previously. As noted above such an application on the primary device is also referred to herein as a secure application. The primary device verification agent then encrypts a corresponding verification request and invokes the verification platform API in step . The verification platform API then invokes a verification platform server session in step to determine if a secondary device is registered. This is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as determining if a first device has a registered association with a second device. The term registered association as used herein is intended to be broadly construed so as to encompass other types of arrangements in which an association is established between first and second devices for verification purposes.

If a secondary device is found in step the verification platform server informs the verification platform API in step and the verification platform API sends an event notification to the secondary device verification agent in step . The motion verification application on the secondary device is provided with verification request notification in step . This illustratively involves displaying the verification request on the secondary device via the motion verification application although other types of notifications regarding a given verification request may be used.

In response to such notification the secondary device is moved in a predetermined pattern in step and the secondary device verification agent then encrypts the corresponding motion information and invokes the verification platform API in step . The verification platform API in step invokes a verification platform server session to determine the validity of the verification input comprising the motion information.

The verification platform server in step informs the verification platform API of the verification result. The verification result is illustratively in the form of grant or denial of the initial verification request received from the primary device in conjunction with the attempted launch of the secure application on that device. The verification result is assumed to be provided in this embodiment in association with an identifier of the corresponding primary device. The verification platform API then sends an event notification to the primary device verification agent as indicated in step .

The primary device verification agent in step then either authorizes or denies the launch of the secure application on the primary device in accordance with the verification result which is assumed to indicate grant or denial of the verification request. Thus if the motion based verification is successful the secure application can be accessed by the user. Otherwise the user cannot access the secure application.

It is to be appreciated that processing operations and other system functionality such as that described in conjunction with can be implemented at least in part in the form of one or more software programs stored in memory and executed by a processor of a processing device such as a computer or server. As will be described below a memory or other storage device having such program code embodied therein is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a processor readable storage medium. 

Also the particular processing operations and other system functionality described in conjunction with the flowcharts of are presented by way of illustrative example only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. Alternative embodiments can use other types of processing operations for motion based verification or other types of verification of user identity implemented using one or more user devices and a verification platform. For example the ordering of the process steps may be varied in other embodiments or certain steps may be performed concurrently with one another rather than serially.

An exemplary communication system in an illustrative embodiment of the invention is shown in . In this embodiment a communication system comprises a primary device a secondary device and a verification platform arranged between the primary and secondary devices. The verification platform communicates with the primary and secondary devices and via respective communication channels and . In the present embodiment there is no pairing or other direct communication required between the primary and secondary devices. The primary device is illustratively shown as comprising one of a mobile telephone A or a laptop computer B. Similarly the secondary device is illustratively shown as comprising one of a mobile telephone A or a laptop computer B. As mentioned previously a wide variety of other types of electronic devices may be used in other embodiments.

The primary device and the secondary device are both configured to run the motion verification application.

The verification platform is configured to include a verification platform API and a verification platform server as noted above but may comprise additional or alternative components in other embodiments.

In the embodiment a verification request is sent from the primary device and processed by the verification platform to determine an appropriate notification to send to the secondary device . The secondary device is used as the motion verification device to allow access to the primary device or an application on the primary device via the verification platform. As previously described in conjunction with verification agents run on the respective primary and secondary devices and information is sent from a given such verification agent to the verification platform API in encrypted form.

Communications between the verification agents and the verification platform API may utilize one or more of JavaScript Object Notation syntax REpresentational State Transfer REST based client server architecture and mutual client server certificate based encryption and authentication.

As a more particular example of communications of the latter type a motion verification application acting as a client provides a certificate to the verification platform server and the server provides its certificate to the client. Both certificates are verified using a certificate authority which has signed both the client and server certificates. The information is transmitted between the client and server over a Secure Socket Layer SSL using 128 bit or 256 bit Advanced Encryption Standard AES cipher encryption. The cipher encryption strength may be selected at least in part as a function of parameters such as device operating system type and transport capabilities as well as other factors influencing the ability of a given device to support the desired encryption level.

It should be understood that the above noted communication types are only examples and numerous other communications may be used in other embodiments. Additional details regarding the above noted AES techniques as well as examples of other cryptographic techniques suitable for use in providing secure communications in embodiments of the invention can be found in A.

Also included in the processing device is network interface circuitry which is used to interface the processing device with the network and other system components and may comprise one or more conventional transceivers.

The other processing devices of the processing platform are assumed to be configured in a manner similar to that shown for processing device in the figure.

Again the particular processing platform shown in the figure is presented by way of example only and communication system may include additional or alternative processing platforms as well as numerous distinct processing platforms in any combination with each such platform comprising one or more computers servers storage devices or other processing devices.

It should therefore be understood that in other embodiments different arrangements of additional or alternative elements may be used. At least a subset of these elements may be collectively implemented on a common processing platform or each such element may be implemented on a separate processing platform.

Also numerous other arrangements of computers servers storage devices or other components are possible in the communication system . Such components can communicate with other elements of the communication system over any type of network or other communication media.

As indicated previously components of a communication system as disclosed herein can be implemented at least in part in the form of one or more software programs stored in memory and executed by a processor of a processing device such as one of the processing devices . As noted above a memory or other storage device having such program code embodied therein is an example of what is more generally referred to herein as a processor readable storage medium.

A given such article of manufacture may comprise for example a storage device such as a storage disk a storage array or an integrated circuit containing memory. The term article of manufacture as used herein should be understood to exclude transitory propagating signals.

It should again be emphasized that the above described embodiments of the invention are presented for purposes of illustration only. Many variations and other alternative embodiments may be used. For example the particular types and arrangements of user devices verification platforms and applications used in a given embodiment can be varied as can the particular types of messaging or other communications exchanged between system components. Moreover the various assumptions made above in the course of describing the illustrative embodiments should also be viewed as exemplary rather than as requirements or limitations of the invention. Numerous other alternative embodiments within the scope of the appended claims will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
