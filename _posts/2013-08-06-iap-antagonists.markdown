The invention relates generally to compounds that modulate the activity of inhibitors of apoptosis IAPs pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds and methods of treating proliferative disorders and disorders of dysregulated apoptosis such as cancer utilizing the compounds of the invention.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically and biochemically regulated mechanism that plays an important role in development and homeostasis in invertebrates as well as vertebrates.

Aberrancies in apoptosis that lead to premature cell death have been linked to a variety of developmental disorders. Deficiencies in apoptosis that result in the lack of cell death have been linked to cancer and chronic viral infections.

Caspases are cysteine containing aspartate specific proteases that play a key role in effecting apoptosis. Once activated from their inactive zymogen form by proteolytic processing caspases digest vital cell proteins from within the cell. Since caspases are such strong proteases tight control of this family of proteins is necessary to prevent premature cell death. In addition to proteolytic processing caspases are also regulated by a family of molecules known as Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins IAPs . IAPs are naturally occurring intra cellular proteins that suppress caspase dependent apoptosis. SMAC an intracellular protein also known as DIABLO functions to modulate the activity of IAPs. In normal healthy cells SMAC and IAPs function together to maintain healthy cells. However in certain disease states e.g. cancers and other proliferative disorders the activities of IAPs are not adequately modulated and therefore prevent apoptosis and cause or exacerbate abnormal proliferation and survival.

IAP antagonists also known as SMAC mimetics are synthetic molecules that mimic the structure and IAP modulating activity of the four N terminal amino acids of SMAC AVPI . When administered to a subject suffering proliferative disorders the compounds antagonize IAP activities causing an increase in apoptosis among abnormally proliferating cells.

IAPs are found in all organisms ranging from to human and are known to be overexpressed in many human cancers. IAPs comprise one to three Baculovirus IAP repeat BIR domains. The BIR domain is a zinc binding domain of about 70 residues comprising 4 alpha helices and 3 beta strands with cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ion. The BIR 2 and 3 domains contain a conserved inhibitor of apoptosis binding motif IBM capable of binding caspases and inhibiting their proteolytic activity.

As an example human X chromosome linked IAP XIAP inhibits the executioner caspases 3 and 7 as well as the Apaf 1 cytochrome C mediated activation of the initiator caspase 9. Caspases 3 and 7 are inhibited by the BIR2 domain of XIAP while the BIR3 domain of XIAP is responsible for the inhibition of caspase 9 activation. XIAP is expressed ubiquitously in most adult and fetal tissues. Overexpression of XIAP in tumor cells has been demonstrated to confer protection of the tumor cells against a variety of pro apoptotic stimuli and promotes resistance to chemotherapy. Consistent with this a strong correlation between XIAP protein levels and survival has been demonstrated for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

Other BIR2 3 containing IAP family members while capable of binding caspases do not directly inhibit their proteloytic activity. Rather they inhibit apoptosis by affecting signaling activities of key proteins in cell survival pathways. Like XIAP these IAPs possess a carboxyl terminal RING finger domain capable of conjugating ubiquitin to specific protein substrates. As an example cellular IAPs 1 and 2 cIAP1 2 ubiquitinate RIPK a signaling intermediate of tumor necrosis death receptor TNF DR activation. Ubiquitinated RIPK is unable to activate caspase 8 in the context of DR activation by TNF family DR ligands. On the contrary the long ubiquitin chains attached to RIPK provide a scaffold by which cell components of the NFkB cell survival signaling cascade can attach and become activated.

In normal cells undergoing apoptosis the IAP mediated inhibition is removed by the mitochondrial protein SMAC second mitochondrial activator of caspases also known as DIABLO . SMAC is synthesized as a precursor molecule of 239 amino acids the N terminal 55 residues serving as the mitochondria targeting sequence that is removed after import. The mature form of SMAC resides in the inter membrane space of mitochondria. At the time of apoptosis induction SMAC is released from mitochondria into the cytosol where together with cytochrome c it binds to XIAP and eliminates its inhibitory effect on caspases. SMAC also binds cIAP1 2 and inhibits their ability to ubiquitinate RIPK. SMAC interacts with essentially all IAPs that have been examined to date and thus appears to be a master regulator of apoptosis in mammals.

Down regulation of XIAP expression by antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to death induced by a wide range of pro apoptotic agents both in vitro and in vivo. SMAC DIABLO derived peptides have also been demonstrated to sensitize a number of different tumor induced select cell lines to undergo apoptosis as single agents while other cell lines require an additional stimulus such as DR agonists or co treatment with pro apoptotic drugs. Because IAP inhibition appears to be a viable mechanism for promoting apoptosis and treating diseases and conditions that are sensitive to apoptosis there is a continuing need to develop compounds that can inhibit IAP.

In addition to apoptosis defects found in tumors defects in the ability to eliminate self reactive cells of the immune system due to apoptosis resistance are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.

In particular it is contemplated that compounds of the invention may be useful in combination with current Standards of Care as well as any that evolve over the foreseeable future. Specific dosages and dosing regimens would be based on physicians evolving knowledge and the general skill in the art.

The combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner that is wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time as well as administration of these therapeutic agents or at least two of the therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished for example by administering to the subject a single dosage form having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple single dosage forms for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including but not limited to oral routes intravenous routes intramuscular routes and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively for example all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non drug therapies e.g. surgery or radiation treatment. Where the combination therapy further comprises a non drug treatment the non drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non drug treatment is achieved. For example in appropriate cases the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents perhaps by days or even weeks.

The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of Formula I formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers additives and or diluents and optionally one or more additional therapeutic agents described above. As described in detail below the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form including those adapted for the following 1 oral administration for example drenches aqueous or nonaqueous solutions or suspensions tablets e.g. those targeted for buccal sublingual and systemic absorption boluses powders granules pastes for application to the tongue 2 parenteral administration for example by subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous or epidural injection as for example a sterile solution or suspension or sustained release formulation 3 topical application for example as a cream ointment or a controlled release patch or spray applied to the skin 4 intravaginally or intrarectally for example as a pessary cream or foam 5 sublingually 6 ocularly 7 transdermally or 8 nasally.

The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally out of one hundred percent this amount will range from about 0.1 percent to about ninety nine percent of active ingredient preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.

In certain embodiments a formulation of the present invention comprises an excipient selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins celluloses liposomes micelle forming agents e.g. bile acids and polymeric carriers e.g. polyesters and polyanhydrides and a compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments an aforementioned formulation renders orally bioavailable a compound of the present invention.

Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and optionally one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

A tablet may be made by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder for example gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose lubricant inert diluent preservative disintegrant for example sodium starch glycolate or cross linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

The tablets and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention such as dragees capsules pills and granules may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using for example hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile other polymer matrices liposomes and or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release e.g. freeze dried. They may be sterilized by for example filtration through a bacteria retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient s only or preferentially in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract optionally in a delayed manner.

Besides inert diluents the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents sweetening flavoring coloring perfuming and preservative agents.

Suspensions in addition to the active compounds may contain suspending agents as for example ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters microcrystalline cellulose aluminum metahydroxide bentonite agar agar and tragacanth and mixtures thereof.

Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising for example cocoa butter polyethylene glycol a suppository wax or a salicylate and which is solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.

Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders sprays ointments pastes creams lotions gels solutions patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and with any preservatives buffers or propellants which may be required.

Powders and sprays can contain in addition to a compound of this invention excipients such as lactose talc silicic acid aluminum hydroxide calcium silicates and polyamide powder or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons such as butane and propane.

Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.

Ophthalmic formulations eye ointments powders solutions and the like are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.

Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non aqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use which may contain sugars alcohols antioxidants buffers bacteriostats solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.

Examples of suitable aqueous and non aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like into the compositions. In addition prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of a drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsuled matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.

When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals to humans and animals they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing for example 0.1 to 99 more preferably 10 to 30 of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Regardless of the route of administration selected the compounds of the present invention which may be used in a suitable hydrated form and or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition and mode of administration without being toxic to the patient.

The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed or the ester salt or amide thereof the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed the rate and extent of absorption the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed the age sex weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated and like factors well known in the medical arts.

A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.

In general a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally oral intravenous intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient will range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.

If desired the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two three four five six or more sub doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day optionally in unit dosage forms. In certain aspects of the invention dosing is one administration per day.

While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation composition .
