This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 762 025 filed Apr. 16 2010.

It has been clear for several decades that elevated blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease CHD and many studies have shown that the risk of CHD events can be reduced by lipid lowering therapy. Prior to 1987 the lipid lowering armamentarium was limited essentially to diet modification to a low saturated fat and cholesterol diet the bile acid sequestrants cholestyramine and colestipol nicotinic acid niacin the fibrates and probucol. Unfortunately all of these treatments have limited efficacy or tolerability or both. With the introduction of lovastatin MEVACOR see U.S. Pat. No. 4 231 938 the first inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to become available for prescription in 1987 physicians for the first time were able to obtain comparatively large reductions in plasma cholesterol with very few adverse effects.

The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known are statins are divided into two groups fermentation derived and synthetic. In addition to the natural product lovastatin there have been several semi synthetic and totally synthetic HMG CoA reductase inhibitors approved for prescription use including simvastatin ZOCOR see U.S. Pat. No. 4 444 784 pravastatin sodium salt PRAVACHOL see U.S. Pat. No. 4 346 227 fluvastatin sodium salt LESCOL see U.S. Pat. No. 5 354 772 atorvastatin calcium salt LIPITOR see U.S. Pat. No. 5 273 995 and cerivastatin sodium salt BAYCOL see U.S. Pat. No. 5 177 080 . Still other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are known to be in development for example pitavastatin also referred to as NK 104 see PCT international publication number WO 97 23200 and rosuvastatin also known as ZD 4522 CRESTOR see U.S. Pat. No. 5 260 440 and Drugs of the Future 1999 24 5 pp. 511 513 . The structural formulas of these and additional HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are described at page 87 of M. Yalpani Cholesterol Lowering Drugs Chemistry Industry pp. 85 89 5 Feb. 1996 . The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors described above belong to a structural class of compounds which contain a moiety which can exist as either a 3 hydroxy lactone ring or as the corresponding ring opened dihydroxy open acid and are often referred to as statins. 

U.S. Pat. No. 5 356 896 describes a pharmaceutical dosage form comprising an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor compound e.g. fluvastatin sodium which is stabilized against pH related degradation by an alkaline stabilizing medium capable of imparting a pH of at least 8 to an aqueous solution or dispersion of the composition. The 896 patent states that the drug substance and the alkaline medium must be brought into intimate contacting association preferably with an aqueous or other solvent based preparative process whereby the drug substance and alkaline medium are blended together in the presence of minor amounts of e.g. water to provide particles containing the drug and alkaline substance in intimate admixture. The resulting particles are dried and then are blended with filler and remaining excipients which were set aside to comprise an external phase of said particles to result in a composition suitable for encapsulation tableting or the like.

In another embodiment described in the 896 patent a solvent based process is utilized to assist subsequent drying in a fluidized bed whereby the drug substance and alkaline medium are wet granulated by known techniques i.e. blended in the moistened state together with an amount of the filler material and the resulting granules after drying are combined with any remaining filler and other set asides e.g. binder lubricant and can therefore be tableted encapsulated or otherwise shaped into a dosage form.

The 896 patent states that to achieve extended shelf life of the compositions it is important that the particles prepared by trituration or wet granulation or other aqueous based process be substantially completely dried i.e. to a weight loss on drying L.O.D. of not greater than 3 and preferably not greater than 2 . The 896 patent also describes conventionally performed drying by tray drying or in a fluidized bed preferably the latter with drying typically performed at about 50.degree C. inlet temperature and below 50 RH. The 896 patent additionally describes an alternative preparative procedure to the above described trituration or wet granulation techniques wherein the drug substance and the alkaline stabilizing medium can be co lyophilized i.e. freeze dried from aqueous solution as a step in situ of the drug manufacturing process.

Most statins are relatively insoluble and are considered by those skilled in the art to be unstable in solution and therefore this class of drugs is manufactured in solid form. However there are those patients who can not ingest digest or otherwise take medications orally and there is a need for the administration of medications intravenously. There are clinical indications that statins through anti inflammatory and possibly other mechanisms can reduce the incidence of heart attacks strokes as well as other inflammatory mediated conditions.

The daily dose of active ingredient can administered as a single dose. The dosage regimen and administration frequency for treating the mentioned diseases with the compound of the invention and or with the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention will be selected in accordance with a variety of factors including for example age body weight sex and medical condition of the patient as well as severity of the disease pharmacological considerations half life of the drug and eventual concomitant therapy with other drugs. In some instances dosage levels below or above the aforesaid range and or more frequent may be adequate and this logically will be within the judgment of the physician and will depend on the disease state.

Where the active ingredient is atorvastatin the total daily dose may be in amounts preferably from 10 to 80 mg but may be lower or higher as required. The preferable starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily though if needed large LDL C reduction may start at 40 mg once daily. The pediatric starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 mg once daily with a maximum does of 20 mg once daily. For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors other than atorvastatin it is within the understanding of one of skill in the art to calculate conversion dosing based on the preferable dosing for atorvastatin. In addition conversion tables for such calculation are readily available for many of the known statins.

The compounds of the invention may be administered orally parenterally rectally or topically by inhalation or aerosol in formulations eventually containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers adjuvants and vehicles as desired.

All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients reaction conditions and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term about. Accordingly unless indicated to the contrary the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.

In certain embodiments the invention is directed to a method of reducing the risk of MI stroke revascularization procedures angina in patients without CHD but with multiple risk factors reducing the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD but with multiple risk factors reducing the risk of non fatal MI fatal and non fatal stroke revascularization procedures hospitalization for CHF and angina in patients with CHD reducing elevated total cholesterol LDL cholesterol apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels in patients with primary hyperlipidemia heterozygous familial and nonfamilial and mixed dyslipidemia reducing elevated triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia reducing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia reducing elevated total C LDL C and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy mixed dyslipidaemia and heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia as an adjunct to other lipid lowering treatments e.g. LDL apheresis or if such treatments are unavailable.

Particularly the non statin pharmaceutical drugs for use in the practice of this invention are any of the PPAR receptor agonists including those that are selective for one PPAR receptor sub type as well as those that are active for two or more receptor sub types. More particularly the non statin pharmaceutical drugs are PPAR alpha agonists such as the fibric acid derivatives PPAR gamma agonists and dual PPAR alpha gamma agonists i.e. those having dual activity for both the alpha and the gamma receptor sub types.

When a statin and a non statin are referred to as competitively binding to an enzyme or enzyme isoform i.e. isozyme it means both the statin and the non statin bind to the same enzyme or isozyme. An adverse pharmacokinetic drug interaction is intended to mean an in vivo interaction between a statin and a co administered non statin pharmaceutical drug in a mammal particularly a human which raises the plasma level of active open acid statin above the level it would be at if the statin was administered alone i.e. absent the co administered non statin.

The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention. They are not to be construed to limit the claims in any manner whatsoever.

Examples 1 3 compare solubilization methods to evaluate the affect of pH buffer strength and different mixing methods. In Example 1 samples were made in 100 mM sodium phosphate dibasic NaHPO at pH 5.5 6.5 7.5 and 8.5. The samples were only vortexed. In Example 2 samples were made in 100 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 5.5 6.5 7.5 and 8.5 and then both vortexed and sonicated. In Example 3 samples were made in either 25 or 50 mM NaHPOat either pH 7.5 or 8.5.

10 mg of atorvastatin calcium trihydrate AS Ca was added to approximately 0.9 mls of a solution containing 0.8 mls of 34.7 hydroxy propyl cyclodextrin HP CD and 0.1 ml of 1 M Na2HPO4 in ultrapure water and then vortexed at top speed for 5 minutes. The pH of the samples were then adjusted to pH 5.5 6.5 7.5 or 8.5 with 0.85 o phosphoric acid or 0.1 M NaOH. Each sample was vortexed and then ultra pure water was added to q.s. to 1.0 mls after which the sample was filtered through a 0.45 m nylon filter and analyzed by HPLC see Table 1 .

The formulations of Example 2 were prepared in the same manner as those of Example 1 except that after vortexing the formulations of Example 2 were additionally sonicated. The samples were analyzed by HPLC See Table 1 .

10 mg of AS Ca was added to approximately 0.9 mls of a solution containing 0.8 mls of 34.7 HP CD and either 0.025 or 0.050 ml of 1 M NaHPOin ultrapure water and then vortexed for 5 min. The pH of the samples was adjusted to either 7.5 or 8.5 using 0.1 M NaOH and then ultrapure water was added q.s. to 1 mL after which the samples were vortexed for 5 min filtered and then analyzed by HPLC See Table 1 .

The solubility of AS Ca in formulations using different methods of pH adjustment are compared in Examples 4 and 5 to evaluate complexation efficiency. In Example 4 the pH was adjusted to 9 using NaOH and then phosphoric acid was added to reduce the pH back to pH 7.0 8.5. In Example 5 the pH was adjusted to a pH between 7.0 8.5 with either 0.85 o phosphoric acid or 0.1 M NaOH.

Mixtures of 20 mg ml of AS Ca were prepared by adding 20 mg AS Ca to approximately 0.8 mL mixture of 27.78 HP CD 50 mM NaHPO and ultrapure water and then phosphoric acid and or NaOH were added to q.s. to 1 ml. The mixture of 20 mg ml AS Ca was then vortexed for 5 min and sonicated for 15 minutes.

The pH of the samples were adjusted to pH 9.0 using 0.1 M NaOH after which the pH was further adjusted to pH 7.0 7.5 8.0 or 8.5 with 0.85 o phosphoric acid. Each sample was vortexed q.s. to 1.0 mls with ultra pure water filtered and then analyzed by HPLC.

Mixtures of 20 mg ml of AS Ca was prepared by adding 20 mg AS Ca to approximately 0.8 ml mixture of 27.78 HP CD 50 mM Na2HPO4 and ultrapure water and then phosphoric acid and or NaOH were added to q.s. to 1 ml. The mixture of 20 mg ml AS Ca was then vortexed for 5 min and sonicated for 15 minutes.

The pH of the samples were adjusted to pH 7.0 7.5 8.0 or 8.5 with either 0.85 o phosphoric acid or 0.1 M NaOH. Each sample was vortexed q.s. to 1.0 mls with ultra pure water filtered and then analyzed by HPLC.

The relationship between AS Ca and HP CD was examined by evaluating the complexation efficiency of different concentrations of HP CD. A stock solution of HP CD was first prepared at 34.7 and serially diluted to 0.5375 HP CD.

Samples were prepared by adding 20 mg of AS Ca to 0.8 mls of HP CD dilutions final concentration in 1 ml from 27.78 to 0.5375 HP CD and 0.05 ml of 1 M NaHPO. Each sample was adjusted to pH 9.0 with 0.1 M NaOH and then the samples were vortexed for 5 minutes and then sonicated for 15 minutes. The pH was then adjusted to either 7.5 or 8.5 with 0.85 o phosphoric acid. The samples were vortexed and sonicated again then filtered and analyzed by HPLC see Table 3 .

Results The solubility of AS Ca increased linearly with HP CD concentration. Linear regression analysis showed that the minimum amount of HP CD needed to solubilize AS Ca at 10 mg ml was 14.4 at pH 7.5 and 13.5 at pH 8.5. See .

Forced degradation and preliminary stability studies showed that AS Ca solubilized with HP CD did not exhibit good stability. Therefore lyophilization was evaluated using a manifold freeze dryer to determine whether stability could be improved by this method.

100 mg of AS Ca was added to approximately 9 mls of a solution containing 5.333 ml of 37.5 HP CD and 0.5 ml of 1 M NaHPO. The sample was vortexed for 5 minutes and then sonicated for 15 minutes. The pH was then adjusted to 9.0 using 0.1M NaOH after which the sample was again vortexed and sonicated.

Next the pH of the sample was adjusted to pH 8.5 using 0.85 o phosphoric acid followed by vortexing and sonication. The sample was q.s. to 10 mls with NaOH and 1 phosphoric acid to a pH of 8.47 filtered and then analyzed by HPLC. The final formulation contained 10 mg ml AS Ca2 20 HP CD 50 mM NaHPO q.s. with 0.1 M NaOH and 1 phosphoric acid at a pH of 8.47.

Results AS Ca solubilized with HP CD was lyophilized and then placed on stability at 40 C. for 1 month alongside a control solution of the same mixture. Lyophilized AS Ca degraded 3.5 and AS Ca in solution degraded 15.5 . Therefore the sample was not stable in solution or when lyophilized using a manifold freeze dryer.

Atorvastatin was prepared as described in example 6 except it was prepared at 20 mg mL in 30 HP CD in 100 mM sodium phosphate adjusted to a final pH of 8.5. The sample was then diluted 1 1 into an 8 sucrose solution and transferred to 5 mL vials. The vials were capped with lyophilization stoppers.

The samples were frozen at 40 C. on a shelf freezer followed by a 60 min hold. After the freezing step the condenser was adjusted to 85 C. and held at that temperature throughout the run. The pressure was approximately 20 mtorr. The shelf temperature was then adjusted to 20 C. 10 C. and 0 C. and held for 180 min at each temperature while maintaining vacuum. Next the temperature was ramped to 10 C. and then to 20 C. 240 minutes for each step . The temperature was then adjusted to 40 C. and held until the vacuum was released and vials removed and visually inspected.

Results When AS Ca was solubilized with HP CD and then lyophilized using a shelf freeze dryer no degradation less than 0.1 was observed after storage for 1 month at 40 C. Although not wishing to be bound by this theory the enhanced stability is likely due to rapid removal of water and low residual moisture levels obtained by conditions of the lyophilization cycle.

In Examples 9 and 10 Sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin SBE CD was evaluated as a possible alternative to HP CD by means of AS Ca complexation with SBE CD. The effect of sodium phosphate salt versus ultrapure water on the solubilization of AS Ca with SBE CD at different pH was also evaluated.

In Example 9 AS Ca complexation with SBE CD was in sodium phosphate buffers with different pH values. 20 mg ml of AS Ca was added into 27.78 SBE CD in 50 100 mM of either NaHPO pH 2.13 samples or NaHPO pH 7.07 8.75 and 11.75 samples . Each sample was then vortexed and sonicated after which the pH was adjusted to 2.13 and 7.07 using 0.85 o phosphoric acid or 8.75 and 11.50 with 0.1 M NaOH. The samples were then vortexed sonicated q.s. to 1.0 ml with ultrapure water and then filtered and analyzed by HPLC see Table 4 below .

Results The solubility of AS Ca was roughly 10 fold lower when complexed with SBE CD than when complexed with HP CD.

In Example 10 the AS Ca complexation with SBE CD was in ultrapure water to investigate the impact of phosphate buffer salt on the ability of SBE CD to complex AS Ca. Based on the solubility findings of Example 8 the formulation was tried at neutral and basic pH.

Neutral pH 20 mg ml AS Ca was added to 27.78 SBE CD in ultrapure water. The sample was vortexed and sonicated after which the pH determined to be 7.09. The sample was then q.s. to 1.0 ml with ultrapure water filtered and analyzed by HPLC. See Table 5 

Basic pH 20 mg ml AS Ca was added to 27.78 SBE CD in approximately 0.8 mL ultrapure water. The sample was processed as described above except the pH was adjusted to 11.0 using 0.1 M NaOH and q.s. to 1.0 mL.

Results Phosphate buffer does not appear to have a significant effect on the solubility of atorvastatin combined with SBE CD.

Additional AS Ca formulations were prepared using other cyclodextrins including cyclodextrin and hydroxyl propyl cyclodextrin. The solubility was found to be less than that achieved with SBE CD or HP CD.

In Example 12 the AS Ca was solubilized with a co solvent to evaluate co solvent aqueous solubility as a function of pH. The pH dependence on propylene glycol and ethanol co solvent formulations was in particular examined.

10 mg of AS Ca was added to approximately 0.9 mls of solution containing 4.0 mls of propylene glycol and 1.0 ml of ethanol in ultrapure water. The sample was vortexed and sonicated as described above then adjusted to pH 9.0 with 0.1 M NaOH. The samples were vortexed and sonicated again and then the pH was adjusted to pH 7.0 7.5 8.0 or 8.5 with 0.85 o phosphoric acid or left at pH 9.0. The samples were vortexed sonicated the sample was q.s. to 1.0 ml with ultrapure water filtered and then analyzed by HPLC. See Table 6 

Results There was no difference in solubility when pH was varied from 7.0 to 9.0. However when the samples were diluted 1 1 into water the samples adjusted to pH 7.5 and 8.0 precipitated. Therefore a pH 8.0 is preferable when the product is to be diluted in aqueous vehicles.

Example 13 examines the amount of solvent needed to solubilize AS Ca by evaluating co solvent aqueous solubility as a function of co solvent proportions.

10 mg of atorvastatin calcium was added to approximately 0.9 mls of solution containing the following solvent ratios in ultrapure water 

The samples were each vortexed for 5 min and then sonicated for 15 minutes. The samples were first adjusted to pH 9.00 with 0.1 M NaOH vortexed and then sonicated. The pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 8.50 with 0.85 o phosphoric acid and the samples were again vortexed and sonicated. The samples were q.s. to 1.0 ml with ultrapure water filtered and then analyzed by HPLC see Table 7 .

Results The best solubility was achieved with 40 propylene glycol v v and 10 ethanol v v . Forced degradation studies showed that anything less than 40 propylene glycol and 10 ethanol resulted in atorvastatin precipitation when diluted with normal saline.

Forced degradation studies also showed significant degradation with co solvent aqueous vehicles. Therefore non aqueous co solvents were examined.

10 mg of AS Ca was added to a 1.0 ml of propylene glycol and ethanol 4 1 . The samples were vortexed and then the pH of the sample was adjusted to pH 11.0 with 0.1 M NaOH. The samples were then filtered and analyzed by HPLC.

Results The sample was completely soluble 9.34 mg ml . When the solution was diluted 1 3 in saline it precipitated.

Forced degradation analysis showed that AS Ca was relatively stable at high pH. Therefore the pH was adjusted with L Arginine L Arg NaOH or sodium phosphate buffer either sodium phosphate tribasic NaPO or NaHPO .

20 mg of AS Ca was added to approximately 0.8 mL ml of the solutions 1 5 below followed by vortexing and sonication. The pH of the samples was adjusted to a basic pH followed by q.s. to a volume of 1 mL with ultrapure water vortexing sonication filtering and HPLC analysis.

Solution 1 20 mg of AS Ca was added to water containing 16.54 mM L Arg 1 1 Atorvastatin L Arg molar ratio . The pH was adjusted to 10.98 with 10 L Arg. The resulting AS Ca concentration was 0.46 mg ml.

Solution 2 20 mg of AS Ca was added to water and the pH was adjusted to 11.68 with 0.1 M NaOH. The resulting AS Ca concentration was 0.222 mg ml.

Solution 3 20 mg AS Ca was added to water containing 0.1 M NaPO. The measured pH was 11.75. The resulting AS Ca concentration was 0.46 mg ml.

Solution 4 20 mg AS Ca was added to water containing 0.1 M NaPOand 16.54 mM L Arg. The measured pH was pH 10.79. The resulting AS Ca concentration was 3.17 mg ml.

Solution 5 20 mg AS Ca was added to water containing 0.1 M NaHPOand 16.54 mM L Arg. The measured pH was 10.79. The resulting AS Ca concentration was 3.43 mg ml.

Results The solubility of AS Ca in basic solutions with no HP CD varied from 0.2 to 3.5 mg mL. Using 16.54 mM L Arg with either 0.1 M NaPOor NaHPOresulted in AS Ca concentrations of 3 mg mL. Therefore using a combination of L Arg with either NaPOor NaHPOalso provides adequate solubility for preparation of AS Ca in solutions.

Atorvastatin free acid solubility AS was examined as an alternative to the calcium trihydrate version.

The solubility of AS with complexation was evaluated by examining the solubility of AS Ca in 27.78 of either HP CD or SBE CD in 50 mM NaHPOadjusted to pH 10.35 and 10.65 using 0.1 M NaOH respectively. The same methods of solubilization were used as example 4.

In Example 17 solubilization of AS with a co solvent was evaluated by testing whether AS could be dissolved in a non aqueous co solvent at high pH and then diluted into saline without precipitation. Previous data example 13 showed that the AS Ca would precipitate when prepared in non aqueous co solvents and then diluted into saline.

20 mg AS 20 mg was added to approximately 0.9 mls of propylene glycol and ethanol 4 1 ratio co solvent. The measured pH was 6.64. The pH was adjusted to pH 11.0 with 0.1 M NaOH q.s. to a volume of 1 mL with ultrapure water. The sample was then vortexed filtered after which it was analyzed by HPLC.

Results The sample degraded rapidly approximately 50 in 2 hours . The peak area was conserved between atorvastatin and its degradation peaks. The AS concentration was estimated to be about 20 mg ml.

In Example 18 AS solubility in either 100 propylene glycol or 100 ethanol similar to the propylene glycol ethanol 4 1 solvent using the same methods of solubilization described above. Atorvastatin free acid was completely soluble in either 100 propylene glycol or 100 ethanol similar to the propylene glycol ethanol 4 1 solvent. Both solutions precipitated when diluted 1 1 with saline and were found to be unstable.

In Example 19 the solubility of AS was examined by adjusting to a high pH with L Arginine L Arg NaOH or sodium phosphate buffer either NaPO or NaHPO .

20 mg of AS was added to approximately 0.8 ml of the solutions below followed by vortexing and sonication. The pH of the samples was adjusted to a basic pH followed by q.s. to a volume of 1 mL with ultrapure water. The sample was then vortexed sonicated filtered and HPLC analysis was conducted.

Sample 1 20 mg AS was added to a solution of 16.54 mM L Arg. The measured pH was 10.35 which was then adjusted to 10.71 with L Arg. The resulting AS Ca concentration was 1.91 mg ml.

Sample 2 20 mg AS was added to ultrapure water and the pH was adjusted to 11.15 with 0.1 M NaOH. The resulting AS concentration was 0.06 mg ml.

Sample 3 20 mg AS was added to 16.54 mM L Arg and 0.1M Na3PO4. The measured pH was 11.42. The resulting AS concentration was 0.44 mg ml

Sample 4 20 mg AS was added to 0.05 M NaPO. The measured pH was 11.55. The resulting AS concentration was 

Non aqueous formulations composed of propylene glycol ethanol 4 1 at pH 11.0 were examined to decrease the observed degradation. However that formulation precipitated when diluted 1 1 into normal saline. To improve stability preliminary lyophilized formulations of AS Ca with HP CD were examined. Initial stability of this formulation showed improved stability over leaving the sample in solution.
