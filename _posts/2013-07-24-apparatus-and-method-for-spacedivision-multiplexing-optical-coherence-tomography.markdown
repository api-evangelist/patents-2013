The present application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 734 168 filed Dec. 6 2012 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 819 251 filed May 3 2013 the contents of which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

This invention was made with government support under R00 EB010071 awarded by National Institutes of Health NIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering NIBIB . The government has certain rights in the invention.

Optical coherence tomography OCT is an emerging optical imaging technique that enables micron scale cross sectional and three dimensional 3D imaging of biological tissues in situ and in real time. OCT functions as a type of optical biopsy imaging tissue microstructure with resolutions approaching that of standard histopathology but without the need to remove and process tissue specimens. Accordingly OCT captures and digitizes visual images of tangible objects such as biological tissue. The penetration depth of OCT is usually 1 2 mm in biological tissues. OCT has been used for a wide range of clinical and biomedical applications particularly in humans and animals including ophthalmology cardiovascular imaging endoscopy imaging cancer imaging dental applications and research imaging applications.

Current commercial ophthalmic OCT systems operate at 20 70 kHz. Each 3D scan covering 512 512 A lines takes 3 10 seconds. Commercial cardiovascular and endoscopic OCT imaging systems operate at 100 kHz 200 kHz A line rate in order to cover a large imaging field. Higher imaging speed at over 1 MHz A line rate as a goal is ultimately desirable for faster imaging and less motion artifacts. However currently there is no commercially available wavelength tunable laser or high speed line scan camera that operates at that speed. Imaging speeds for OCT characterized as number of A scans per second is limited by the line rate of line scan cameras for spectral domain OCT SD OCT or by the laser sweep rate for swept source OCT SS OCT .

An optical coherence tomography OCT system is provided herein which improves imaging speed over the foregoing systems. In one exemplary embodiment the system may be a space division multiplexing SDM optical coherence tomography SDM OCT system. In various embodiments the SDM OCT system may utilize a wavelength tunable light source such as a swept source laser or a broadband light source. The SDM OCT systems disclosed herein may map signals from spatially distributed sampling beams into different frequency bands using optical time delays.

An OCT system according to the present disclosure may be configured to take advantage of the long coherence length property of newly available light sources such as without limitation wavelength tunable lasers e.g. vertical cavity surface emitting laser VCSEL to improve imaging depth range. The OCT system may further utilize parallel detection of spatially distributed optical beams to achieve an order of magnitude improvement of effective A line rate. Advantageously this offers several fold improvement in imaging speed of OCT while maintaining resolution and sensitivity. In one embodiment this may be achieved utilizing a single detection channel to obtain sample images thereby enabling a simple less complex and less expensive OCT system to be provided with an effective imaging speed scalable to using a plurality of light sampling beams. In addition to dramatically improved imaging speed the OCT system also preserves image resolution and enables synchronized simultaneous imaging at multiple different sample locations using multiple beams which opens up opportunities for numerous biomedical applications.

In one embodiment an OCT system according to the present disclosure may utilize a wavelength tunable light such as a swept source laser OCT SS OCT configuration as the basis for the light source and detection methodology. In SS OCT light from the source is divided into a sample arm first optical path and a reference arm second optical path of an interferometer arrangement. The light source is generally a coherent and broad wavelength tunable range light which is shined or scanned on an object or sample of interest. Scattered light reflected back from the object or sample by variations in the index of refraction within the sample is recoupled in the sample arm and then combined with the light that has traveled a fixed optical path length along the reference arm thereby generating an interference signal comprising an interferogram. The resulting interferogram is captured and measured through the detection arm of the interferometer by a sensor device. Fourier transformation is performed using a computer processor to analyze the optical frequency of the interferogram which relates to imaging depths of sampling light reflections returned from the sample. Reflections from different sampling depths produces interference patterns with different frequencies. Resolving the reflections via Fourier transformation processing produces a depth reflectivity profile A scan of the sample. Scanning the sampling light beam in a first direction across the sample further produces two dimensional 2D images B scans . Scanning the sampling beam in a second direction allows creation of three dimensional 3D images of the sample.

The inventor has discovered that OCT imaging speed can be greatly improved with space division multiplexing while maintaining imaging resolution and sensitivity. One unique feature of an optical coherence tomography OCT system according to the present disclosure is to split the imaging beam on the sample arm in order to illuminate multiple physical locations on the sample simultaneously. In some embodiments a single sample arm may be used. Each beam is optically delayed by the system so that when images are formed signals from different physical locations are detected in different frequency bands i.e. imaging depth . Advantageously this allows parallel detection of signals from multiple imaging points and therefore improves OCT imaging speed dramatically and preserves system resolution and sensitivity. Accordingly embodiments of the present invention include space division multiplexing OCT SDM OCT . A further advantage of a SDM OCT system according to the present disclosure is that the system requires minimal modification to the current OCT system designs while achieving significant improvement in system performance. A further benefit of the SDM OCT system is that the system may utilize commercially available light sources.

In one embodiment light source may be a wavelength tunable long coherence light source to provide optimal imaging depth range. In one embodiment without limitation the coherence length may be greater than 5 mm to achieve proper imaging range for the SDM OCT system. A commercially available vertical cavity surface emitting laser VCSEL diode such as for example without limitation Thorlabs Inc. SL1310V1 with a center wavelength of 1310 nm may be used as the light source for SDM OCT system . Other suitable center wavelengths may be used. In one embodiment the VCSEL laser may have a sweep rate of 100 kHz a tuning range of 100 nm and a coherence length of over 50 mm. The output of the laser from light source may be 37 mW. VCSEL diodes are essentially semiconductor based devices that emit light perpendicular to the chip surface. It will be appreciated that other suitable light source specifications for VCSEL diodes and or other types of light sources may be used. For example a Fourier domain mode lock FDML laser or a MEMS tunable laser such as from Axsun Technologies Inc. Santec Corporation Exalos Inc. or Insight Photonics Inc. etc. may be used.

The light beam output from the light source is optically coupled to the first optical coupler for dividing or splitting the single input light into two output light beams. An optical coupler aka splitter is generally a passive optical fiber device operable to couple and distribute light from one or more input fibers to one or more output fibers. Accordingly optical energy input is split into multiple output signals retaining essentially the same properties as the input light. Suitable optical couplers include optical fiber couplers available from AC Photonics Inc. Thorlabs Inc. or other suppliers.

In one embodiment without limitation coupler is configured to produce a 95 5 optical split where 5 of the light is diverted to a Mach Zehnder interferometer MZI while the remaining 95 of the light is used for the OCT imaging setup. MZIs are well known to those skilled in the art without further elaboration. The MZI signal acquired is used for phase calibration of the OCT signal in one embodiment. In other possible embodiments the MZI signal may be omitted if an optical clock signal is used instead to clock the acquisition of the OCT signal see e.g. without MZI . The invention is not limited to either arrangement. If an optical clock is used it will be understood that the first optical coupler may be omitted.

With respect to the optical couplers or splitters described herein e.g. etc. it will be appreciated that any suitable optical division or splitting of input light beams identified as a percentage of the incident beam e.g. 5 95 10 90 etc. may be used depending on the intended application and system parameters. Accordingly the invention is expressly not limited to those light division or split percentages disclosed herein which represent merely some of many possible designs that might be used for the couplers. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the determination of the optical split ratio depends on how much light is intended to be directed into each of the sample and reference arms. It is desirable to have as much power as possible on sample while keep the power on sample to be within a safe limit. In the meantime sufficient power is needed on the reference arm to get shot noise limited sensitivity.

With continuing reference to the sampling beam for the OCT imaging setup then is transmitted to the second optical coupler . In one embodiment a 90 10 optical splitter may be used where 10 of the input light is directed to the reference arm R reference channel and 90 of the light is directed to the sample arm S detection channel . In the sample arm S the input light beam goes through an optical circulator . In one embodiment an optical circulator is a three port fiber optic device used to separate optical signals which travel in opposite direction in an optical fiber. Light which enters one of the ports including reflected light traveling in an opposite direction than the incident light exits the next port. In the present exemplary configuration light for the sample arm S from coupler enters port 1 of optical circulator and exits port 2.

The light sampling beam for sample arm S leaving port 2 of optical circulator is then received and split by optical splitter . Splitter which in one embodiment may be an optical fiber splitting device may divide the sampling beam into at least two or more sampling beams at the output from the device. In one exemplary embodiment without limitation the sample arm light beam may be split by a 1 8 optical splitter and transmitted into eight different optical fibers forming an optical fiber array for sampling see e.g. . Each optical fiber in the sampling fiber array represents a sample location S1 S2 S3 . . . Sn on the sample or specimen where n sample location number. In it should be noted that only four of the eight optical fibers are shown for simplicity and clarity.

In some embodiments a planar lightwave circuit PLC splitter such as those available from PLC Connections Inc. or others may be used. The optical splitter functions to both transmit the optical signal via the fiber array to the sample and to collect and combine the individual reflected sample return signals from the plurality of different sample locations as further described herein. Advantageously this configuration according to the present disclosure permits a single detection channel sample arm S to be used in lieu of multiple detection channels which are at greater expense complexity and physical bulk for an OCT system equipment package.

The above example uses an optical splitter fiber optical delay and a fiber array to realize the optical splitting and delaying function. The same function can be realized in one embodiment with a custom planar lightwave circuit PLC splitter design as shown in . Here the splitter may be fabricated with the same amount optical power split into each channel and different optical delays built into the lightwave circuit. This device can be directly put on the sample arm S to illuminate the sample simultaneously with spatially separated beams.

It should be noted that an optical splitter may be used that divides or splits the incident sampling light into more or less than eight output optical fibers depending on the intended sampling application number of sample locations desired and other factors. Accordingly the invention is not limited to any particular number of sampling optical fibers in the sampling fiber array or number of sampling locations S1 . . . Sn . Numerous variations and configurations are possible.

It should be noted that the optical light paths and optical coupling between components shown in the figures and described herein may be made by any suitable means including for example without limitation optical cables or fibers relays open space transmission e.g. air or other medium without physical contact between components other light transmitting technologies presently available or to be developed and any combination thereof. Accordingly the invention is not limited to any particular optical coupling means and numerous variations are possible. In one embodiment optical fibers may be used for optically coupling components together other than light transmission between lenses mirrors and or the object or sample of interest.

With continuing reference to OCT system further includes an optical delay element for producing a time delay in the sampling optical fibers . The combination of the optical splitter and optical delay element provides the space division multiplexing aspect of the present embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment without limitation the optical delay element for producing the optical delay may comprise using multiple optical fibers which each have different lengths diagrammatically illustrated by the one or more coils or loops of each fiber in . The shorter optical fibers will return a reflected optical signal from the sample to optical splitter in less time than the longer fibers thereby producing an optical time delay. Accordingly in one embodiment each fiber may have a different length to produce an optical delay.

In one illustrative example without limitation the length difference between each optical fibers may be about 2.5 mm. In one non limiting example for illustration the length of the shortest and longest fibers in an exemplary fiber array may be about 50 mm and about 67 mm respectively. Single mode fibers are used for OCT applications. It bears noting that the core of the optical fiber needs to be able to support single mode light transmission. For example for 1310 nm the fiber core diameter is 9 um and for 800 nm it is about 6 um. The diameter of the fibers also depends on the index of refraction difference of the fibers. The cladding and outer diameter of the fiber can also vary.

It should be noted that other suitable fiber lengths and diameters may be used. Accordingly numerous variations and configurations are possible.

In one embodiment optical fibers may be used which are formed a flexible and transparent fiber made of glass ie. silica or plastic and transmits light between each end of the fiber. In one example the fibers may be Corning Inc. SMF28 fibers.

The optical fibers in fiber array may be arranged in any suitable pattern. In one example shown in without limitation the optical fibers may be arranged in a one dimensional linear array with a suitable vertical spacing Y between fibers. A representative spacing Y of about 0.3 mm between fibers may be used in one non limiting embodiment however smaller or larger spacing may alternatively be used in various embodiments. The vertical spacing Y between fibers may be uniform or different in the array. It should further be noted that patterns and arrangements of optical fibers other than linear may also be used see e.g. further described herein .

It will be appreciated that other methods and devices may be used to produce the optical delay other than optical delay element having different length optical fibers which represents but one non limiting exemplary embodiment. For example an alternative optical delay element is shown in and further described herein. Numerous other variations and types of optical delay elements are possible which does not limit the invention.

With continuing reference to sampling light from each of the different optical fibers are transmitted through collimator for focusing onto multiple different spots or sampling locations S1 . . . Sn on the sample. The sample can be scanned simultaneously by light from all optical fiber using a scanning device such as without limitation a galvanometer scanner . The galvanometer scanner may be a mirrored device which includes a galvo motor with an angled vibrating oscillating e.g. up and down mirror driven by the motor shaft. Sampling light beams from each optical fiber are independently transmitted and scanned across a surface of the sample by galvanometer scanner thereby producing discrete and independent illuminated sampling spots or locations S1 . . . Sn each corresponding to one of the optical fibers. In one representative example without limitation each spot may have about 3 mW power on sample and the light intensity fluctuation among all the spots may be less 1 dB. The galvanometer scanner may project the sampling beams onto the sample in any suitable pattern to capture the desired image information. Other variations and types of scanning devices may be used. In some non limiting examples the galvanometer scanner may be Cambridge Technologies Model 6215H or Thorlabs GVS102.

In one embodiment the sampling beams transmitted by galvanometer scanner may be focused onto the sample through a scanning objective lens . A 5 objective lens e.g. Mitutoyo 5 NIR or other may be used in certain embodiments however other suitable lenses and powers may be used depending on the given OCT scanning application. It should be noted that the objective lens does not need to be located right after the galvanometer scanner . Relay optics may also be inserted in the sample arm to focus the beam in some embodiments.

A plurality of back reflected light signals emitted from the sample at the sampling locations S1 . . . Sn by each of the incident light sampling beams transmitted from the fiber array travel in a reverse direction along the first optical light path and are reflected by the galvanometer scanner through objective lens . The reflected light signals containing image information from the sample are collected by each optical fiber of the fiber array and relayed back to optical splitter reference . Each optical fiber therefore is operable to transmit an individual sampling beam and receive back in return an individual respective reflected light or signal from the sample.

In one embodiment the reflected light signals from the sample traveling back along the first optical light path in sample arm S may then be combined via the optical splitter into a single reflected light signal detection signal . This single reflected light detection signal from the sample arm S is then combined with a reflected light reference signal returned from reference mirror from the second optical light path reference arm R via optical circulator by optical coupler to create an interference signal which is detected with a sensor such as in one non limiting example a broadband balanced detector photodetector e.g. Thorlabs Inc. PDB480CAC 1.6 GHz bandwidth . In one embodiment without limitation a 50 50 coupler may be used which combines the reflected detection and reference signals in equal proportions or percentages. Other suitable percentages may be used. The balanced detector operates to generate an interferogram from the interference signal. The MZI optical path may also include a balanced detector in some non limiting embodiments wherein a MZI may be for phase calibration of the OCT signal as described herein.

Interference signals from both the OCT system and MZI may be digitally acquired simultaneously using an appropriately configured high speed data acquisition DAQ card . In one illustrative embodiment without limitation high speed DAQ card may be an Alazar Tech ATS9360 card operating at 1.2 GS s or another suitably configured DAQ card. The acquired signal data from DAQ card may then be streamed continuously to the memory of an appropriately configured computer or memory accessible to another suitable processor based device or PLC programmable logic controller through a suitably configured port. The signal data may be stored on the memory for further processing display export etc.

The computer as described herein is representative of any appropriate computer or server device with central processing unit CPU microprocessor micro controller or computational data processing device or circuit configured for executing computer program instructions e.g. code and processing the acquired signal data from DAQ card . This may include for example without limitation desktop computers personal computers laptops notebooks tablets and other processor based devices having suitable processing power and speed. Computer may include all the usual appurtenances associated with such a device including without limitation the properly programmed processor a memory device s a power supply a video card visual display device or screen e.g. graphical user interface firmware software user input devices e.g. a keyboard mouse touch screen etc. wired and or wireless output devices wired and or wireless communication devices e.g. Ethernet Wi Fi Bluetooth etc. for transmitting captured sampling images. Accordingly the invention is not limited by any particular type of processor based device.

The memory may be any suitable non transitory computer readable medium such as without limitation any suitable volatile or non volatile memory including random access memory RAM and various types thereof read only memory ROM and various types thereof USB flash memory and magnetic or optical data storage devices e.g. internal external hard disks floppy discs magnetic tape CD ROM DVD ROM optical disk ZIP drive Blu ray disk and others which may be written to and or read by a processor operably connected to the medium.

It will further be appreciated that various aspects of the present embodiment may be implemented in software hardware firmware or combinations thereof. The computer programs described herein are not limited to any particular embodiment and may be implemented in an operating system application program foreground or background process driver or any combination thereof executing on a single computer or server processor or multiple computer or server processors

With continuing reference to still images and or moving video images of the sample captured and recorded by the present OCT system and the DAQ card may be rendered on a suitable visual display by computer for observation by a system user. In healthcare related applications of the OCT system in some possible embodiments the user may be a health care provider technician or other professional. The sample images displayed on the visual display are representative of the actual sample or specimen e.g. human or other animal tissue in some embodiments being analyzed by the OCT system and useful as a diagnostic tool.

Typically when light is split from 1 fiber to N fibers using a splitter the intensity for each of the output fiber is about 1 N of the input intensity. This allows even distribution of the light through all the output fibers. When reflected light is returned from the sample and passes through the splitter again only about 1 N of the returned light is combined in the input fiber. This insertion loss is proportional to how many channels the splitter splits the light. In order to minimize the insertion loss for the returned beam an alternative embodiment of an OCT system is presented in .

Here referring to a low insertion loss OCT system may include optical circulators and thereby providing an optical circulator for each of the optical fibers . In one embodiment circulators may be disposed in system after i.e. down path from the optical splitter . The optical circulators may be disposed after the optical delay element and further in some embodiments before the collimator .

In this non limiting example four optical fibers are shown to form the fiber array for clarity of illustration however any suitable number of fibers may be used in the array. In some embodiments without limitation eight or more optical fibers may be used as appropriate.

Returned reflected light collected by the scanner from the sample will travel back through the circulators in a manner already described herein instead of and bypassing the splitter . The returned light from circulators is transmitted to and will interfere with reference light from the reference arm R in four optical couplers which in one non limiting embodiment may be 50 50 couplers . Each fiber and circulator may therefore have an associated coupler in one non limiting embodiment as shown however other variations are possible. The optical couplers each combine the reference light with reflected light from one of the plurality of optical fibers receiving reflected light from the sample to produce an interference signal.

A plurality of outputs signals each transmitted from one of the couplers may then be combined and detected by a sensor such as a balanced detector photodetector . In one embodiment a single balanced detector may be provided. The insertion loss for the returned reflected light is then minimized using this approach resulting in higher detection sensitivity. The optical circulators can also be replaced in other embodiments by optical splitters instead to reduce cost but at the expense of optical loss associated with splitters. However either circulators or splitters may be used.

In the OCT system of it should further be noted that a single optical coupler may be used downfield of the light source . In this embodiment the coupler may divert 80 percent of the light to the sampling arm S detection channel and 20 percent of the light to the reference arm R reference channel . Other suitable beam splitting arrangements may be used. Light for the reference arm R is transmitted to optical circulator from splitter entering port 1 and leaving port 2 collimator and finally reference mirror in a similar manner to OCT system see . The reflected reference light from mirror travels back through circulator and is output from port 3 to a reference optical splitter . Optical splitter then splits the single reflected reference light beam into four reference beams reference channels output to optical fibers in a functionally similar manner to splitter . These optical fibers are coupled to and provide the reference signals to each of the four optical couplers to interfere with light from the sample arm S circulators in the manner already described above. In one embodiment without limitation splitter may be a planar lightwave circuit PLC splitter. Other suitable splitter however may be used.

Other components in may be structurally and functionally similar to these same components which appear in and have been described elsewhere herein.

The number of columns and rows in the N N fiber array may be varied as needed. For Doppler OCT one can use phase difference between A scans from the same beam A scans between different source pairs in the same row or A scans between beams from different rows each with its own Doppler sensitivity range. The combination of all these will provide a large dynamic range for Doppler measurements.

Doppler OCT may be used to generate angiogram and quantitatively measure blood flow information of the image sample. Doppler OCT is based on the Doppler effects where scattering particles e.g. red blood cells moving towards or away from the light source generate Doppler phase shifts that are proportional to the flow speed that is projected along the direction of the light illumination.

It should be noted that the optical fiber length difference between each sampling light beam does not need to be the same or uniform. In many situations the sample or specimen surface is not flat e.g. human retina anterior segment of the eye tooth blood vessels etc. . The fiber length difference can be arranged according to each specific application to allow maximum flexibility of the system design and best use of the imaging range.

The fiber array may be used in most of the applications although it is not necessary to put all the fibers in a single array. Fibers may be used in different arrays or use individual fibers to image different samples or different locations of the sample simultaneously.

Another advantage of an OCT system according to the present disclosure is to make truly synchronized measurements from different illumination locations. This is helpful if a user wants to study the dynamic relationship of different locations on a single sample or synchronized behavior from different samples e.g. heart dynamics neuron activities etc. .

It should be noted that a balanced detector may be used to achieve maximum sensitivity for swept source OCT although a single detector or non balanced detector can also be used. Accordingly the present invention is not limited to the use of balanced detectors alone.

Although the method described here is based on swept source OCT the same approach can be used for spectral domain OCT. In that case the light source will be replaced with the broadband light source with long coherence length at each individual wavelength. The detector may be replaced with a spectrometer comprising a collimating lens a grating a focusing lens and a digital line scan camera or a 2D camera with high pixel count. All other components in the system may remain the same.

The performance of a space division multiplexing swept source OCT system according to the present disclosure was tested and validated on a static specimen or sample. shows actual images obtained from an imaging test using a prototype system constructed according to the OCT system of . The sample imaged in the test was a roll of Scotch tape where different layers e.g. at different depths of the tape can be clearly seen from the images obtained at different spots on the roll of tape. In this application eight 8 optical fibers each producing a sampling beam were used in the sampling arm S of the test setup thereby obtaining discrete images at eight different locations in the tape roll sample from the beams labeled 1 to 8. The light source and other appurtenances used for the test were as described herein for OCT system and shown in .

The entire imaging range e.g. depth of the OCT system was about 26.5 mm in tissue 35 mm in air in this test see Image a at left in . Scotch tape images from the roll seen at different depths correspond to images obtained from the eight different imaging locations. Zoomed in images of each of the eight sample locations S1 . . . S8 in the tape roll are shown on the right in demonstrating relatively uniform image intensity from the different sampling beams. Even at the deepest imaging depth S8 individual layers of the tape as shown at right can still be clearly identified. This suggests that axial image resolution is preserved across the entire imaging range of depths. Furthermore the imaging results using a calibrated reflecting mirror in the sample arm show that an axial resolution of 8.3 um in tissue and an over 95 dB sensitivity can be obtained using the prototype OCT imaging system. Since the VCSEL laser is operated at 100 kHz light source simultaneous imaging with the 1 8 fiber array achieves an 800 kHz effective A scan rate combining all eight beams. It should be noted that the results were obtained using a single detection channel albeit with eight sampling beams.

Although the present prototype OCT system demonstrates a factor of 8 in improvement of imaging speed further improvement of imaging speed can be achieved by using a fiber array with more fibers. The ultimate limit for the imaging speed is no longer the sweep rate of the light source. Instead the imaging speed can be scaled up with the improvement of the coherence length of the light source the bandwidth of the detector the speed of the data acquisition the number of fiber channels and the optical path length difference between each fiber.

An in vivo test of the OCT system of was performed to the capture of moving images of the beating heart of a fruit fly larva. A commercial VCSEL tunable laser SL1310V1 Thorlabs Inc. with a center wavelength of 1310 nm was used for the OCT system. The laser had a swept rate of 100 000 Hz a tuning range of 100 nm and a coherence length of over 50 mm. The output power was 37 mW. A 95 5 optical coupler AC Photonics Inc. was connected to the laser output and 5 of the light was directed to a Mach Zender interferometer MZI which has an optical path length difference of 60 mm in air for the two arms R reference and S sample . The remaining 95 of the light was used for OCT imaging.

A 90 10 optical coupler provided 10 of the light to the reference arm R and 90 of the light to the sample arm S. Input light to the sample arm S was split into 8 fibers using a planar lightwave circuit PLC splitter e.g. PLC Connections Inc. or similar . Output optical fibers from the PLC splitter were custom arranged in a one dimensional 1D array 1 8 with a length different of 2.5 mm between each fiber. Spacing was about 300 um between each fiber in the 1D array and about 370 um after the spots were projected on samples. The surface of the fiber array was angle polished at 8 degrees to minimize light reflection. Light from different fibers were focused onto different spots on the sample which were synchronously scanned by a pair of galvanometers Cambridge Technology Inc. . Each spot had about 2 mW power on sample. Light intensity variation among all the spots was less than 1 dB. Optical circulators AC Photonics Inc. were utilized on both the sample and reference arms S R to route reflected signal from both arms to interfere at a 50 50 coupler . Broadband balanced detectors 1.6 GHz PDB480CAC Thorlabs Inc. were used to detect interference signals from both the OCT system and the MZI. Outputs of the balanced detectors were digitally acquired simultaneously using a high speed data acquisition card ATS9360 Alazar Tech at 1.2 GS s. Data from both channels 8320 points for each channel per sweep was streamed to the computer memory continuously through the PCIe port. The entire imaging range of the prototype system was about 35 mm in air or 26.5 mm in tissue . A 5 objective lens Mitutoyo 5 NIR was utilized to provide about 11 um transverse resolutions. The axial resolution was measured to be about 11 um in air or about 8.3 um in tissue throughout the depth range see measured point spread function from different depths . A 94.6 dB sensitivity was measured using a calibrated reflector 43.4 dB and a roll off of 

To obtain 3D imaging of the larva 400 80 A scans covering 1.1 mm 0.4 mm was acquired in 0.37 seconds s . The MZI signal acquired simultaneously with the OCT signal was utilized for phase calibration for each laser sweep. Eight images from the 8 beams were segmented from different depth ranges and digitally combined to form a volumetric dataset consisting of 400 605 A scans covering the entire larva 1.1 mm 3.0 mm range . To obtain M mode imaging from the larva heart 400 B scans with each containing 400 A scans over 250 um range around the heart tube were acquired for about 2 seconds. The frame rate for the B scan was 217 frames per second. Images from different heart segments were digitally combined. Functional information of the heart was analyzed following established methods. Matlab Mathwork Inc. was used to process the data and ImageJ NIH and Amira VSG Inc. were used to generate videos and render images for presentation.

Results of the in vivo 3D SDM OCT imaging of a larva is demonstrated in . The entire 3D dataset 400 605 A scans showing entire larva in a merged 3D image assembled using images from all 8 beams was obtained in less than 0.37 seconds. The actual size of the larva was 1 mm wide by 3 mm long. shows cross sectional and en face images of the larva. The heart tube H and the trachea structures T are clearly observed.

To demonstrate synchronized imaging capability M mode B scan imaging was performed over three segments of another larva heart roughly corresponding to the A7 A6 and A5 segments. A frame rate of 217 frames per second was obtained at all segments simultaneously. Representative cross sectional synchronized still images showing all three segments of the beating heart tube is shown in . A video demonstrating the synchronized beating of the heart tube segments was obtained from which the still images have been extracted. Segment 1 beats first Segment 2 follows and Segment 3 then follows Segment 2.

The functions of the larva heart were further quantified by the in vivo testing. In addition to functional information such as heart rate 372 beats per minute end systolic 36 m for A7 32 m for A6 and 11 m for A5 and diastolic dimensions 60 m for A7 74 m for A6 and 58 m for A5 and fractional shortening 42 for A7 56 for A6 and 80 for A5 also observed was a delay between the dilation and contraction in segment A6 compared to A7 14 ms and segment A5 compared to A6 69 ms shown in . This delay suggested the contraction of the heart tube was initialized in the A7 segment posterior and propagated toward the A5 segment anterior . This finding is consistent with previous literature on larvae heart development.

In summary an 8 improvement in imaging speed was demonstrated by the experimental tests. Further speed improvement is straightforward. In fact the effective A scan rate is scalable to the number of spots shine on the sample simultaneously while only a single detection channel is required. For optical coherence microscopy OCM applications where the imaging penetration depth is limited to less than a few hundred microns 16 channels or more can be used. Optical delay between each channel needs to be shortened accordingly in order to fit images from all channels into the detection range using current hardware.

Fundamentally the spatial multiplexing technique would have resolution and sensitivity advantages compared to the approach of increasing laser sweep rate. Since the laser sweep range was preserved axial resolution for OCT was not compromised as the effective A scan rate was increased. Meanwhile the dwell time at each imaging spot was maintained at a relatively low laser sweep rate. More data sampling points were also recorded within the dwell time for the SDM OCT system . Imaging speed improvement was achieved by performing parallel detection utilizing multiple sampling beams. This is in contrast to increasing the laser sweep rate where the dwell time and the number of sampling point for each sweep is reduced. In OCT system the PLC splitter has an about 10 dB insertion loss. This is not an issue in the forward direction as the input light is evenly split into the 8 beams. However when combining the reflected light from the sample the 10 dB insertion loss resulted in reduction in sensitivity. As a result about a 95 dB sensitivity was achieved over the entire imaging range when only about 2 mW light was shined on the sample for each spot. This is about 11 dB lower compared to shot noise limited sensitivity. However alternative designs bypassing the PLC splitter in the return path see e.g. or using low loss optical combiners may be utilized to further improve imaging sensitivity.

With the space division multiplexing technique the bottleneck for further improving SS OCT imaging speed is no longer the sweep rate of tunable lasers. Instead high speed data acquisition and high throughput data transfer are greatly desired. The data acquisition card used in testing the prototype system according to the OCT system of supports a 12 bit 1.8 GS s sampling rate. However due to limited data throughput data could only be acquired from both the OCT and MZI channels simultaneously at 1.2 GS s. Further improvement in the speed of data acquisition and throughput the bandwidth of the detectors the coherence length of the light source and the number of fiber channels will advantageously scale the OCT imaging speed linearly without significant changes in system design. Since the input light from source is split into multiple beams a powerful light source is desirable.

In conclusion the testing successfully demonstrated a space division multiplexing technique for OCT which achieved significant improvement in imaging speed while preserved axial resolution. Although the space division multiplexing technique was demonstrated based on SS OCT the same approach can be applied to SD OCT. In that case a broadband light source with long coherence length for each wavelength and a spectrometer comprising a collimating lens a diffraction grating a focusing lens and a line scan camera or a 2D camera with high pixel count may be needed to provide deep imaging range.

In this embodiment shown in light on the sample arm S is collimated by collimator and then shined onto a microlens array . A commercially available microlens array may be used such as for example without limitation Edmund Optics Model 63 230. Each microlens of the array will focus a portion of the sampling light beam onto a small spot at the intermediate image plane. The microlens array splits divides the single incident sampling light beam into a plurality of light beams thereby obviating the need for an optical splitter such as splitter in . In addition it should be noted that the divided multiple sampling light beams output from microlens array may not be captured and transmitted by optical fibers but rather transmitted through space in a medium.

With continuing reference to an optical delay element comprising a plurality of adjoining optically transparent glass or plastic elements members each having a different thickness to create different optical delays for each sampling beam. The optical delay element may be disposed at the intermediate image plane in one embodiment or off the intermediate image plane in other embodiments as long as different beams do not overlap. Therefore beams focused at different locations on the sample are optically encoded in different frequency bands in the final detected signal. The amount of delay in frequency depends on the amount of optical delay introduced in the sample arm S by glass or plastic members. Note that although the optical delay element is placed at the intermediate imaging plane in this example it can be placed at other locations in the sample arm S for example between the collimator and the microlens array . Each of the sampling light beams from optical delay element are transmitted to a relay lens galvanometer scanner and objective scan lens onto the sample simultaneously at sample locations S1 . . . Sn.

Other components of OCT system may be similar in function and design to the corresponding components labeled the same in . In one possible configuration of OCT system without limitation optical coupler may be configured to divert 3 of the light from light source to the reference arm R and 97 of the light to the sampling arm S. Other suitable splits are possible.

In yet other possible embodiments optical delay element may be used in the OCT system of in lieu of optical delay element . In that case the light beams from each of the individual optical fibers output from splitter may be shined onto the optical delay element in manner similar to that shown in .
