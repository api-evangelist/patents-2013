Electronic communications may carry a wide variety of content for example electronic mail medical records financial transactions and other confidential information. The electronic communications may travel for some of the communication end to end path over unsecured communication links where the content may be subject to tampering or intrusion. A variety of security measures have been applied to provide increased security and to raise the level of difficulty for nefarious actors attempting to access the confidential information.

In an embodiment a method of wireless communication enabled by hardware assisted trust is disclosed. The method comprises receiving a trust zone request by an enhanced node B from an electronic device attached to a long term evolution LTE wireless network and forwarding the trust zone request from the enhanced node B to a home subscription server HSS wherein the enhanced node B forwards the trust zone request while executing in a trust zone of the enhanced node B wherein the trust zone provides hardware assisted trust. The method further comprises receiving a trust zone request acknowledgement by the enhanced node B from the home subscription server while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B forwarding the trust zone request acknowledgement by the enhanced node B to the electronic device wherein the enhanced node B forwards the trust zone acknowledgement while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B and receiving a trusted service request by the enhanced node B from the electronic device. The method further comprises forwarding the trusted service request by the enhanced node B to a policy control rules function PCRF server wherein the enhanced node B forwards the trusted service request while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B receiving a trusted service request acknowledgement by the enhanced node B from the policy control rules function server while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B and forwarding the trusted service request acknowledgement to the electronic device whereby the electronic device is provided a trusted bearer communication link.

The method further comprises forwarding the trusted service termination request by the enhanced node B while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B to at least one of a mobility management entity MME a home subscriber server HSS a packet gateway P GW and a policy charging rules function PCRF server receiving a trusted service termination acknowledgment by the enhanced node B while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B and forwarding the trusted service termination acknowledgment by the enhanced node B while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B whereby the trusted bearer communication link from the mobile communication device and the long term evolution wireless network is taken down.

In another embodiment a method of wireless communication enabled by hardware assisted trust is disclosed. The method comprises attaching a mobile communication device by a first enhanced node B to a first long term evolution LTE wireless network performing signaling on behalf of the mobile communication device to establish a trusted bearer communication link between the mobile communication device and the first long term evolution wireless network and transmitting a redirect request by the first enhanced node B to a mobility management entity MME . The method further comprises analyzing by the mobility management entity a signaling trust continuum in a second long term evolution wireless network and performing signaling on behalf of the mobile communication device to establish a trusted bearer communication link between the mobile communication device and the second long term evolution wireless network.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

In an embodiment a system for trusted signaling in a long term evolution LTE wireless communication network is taught. Signaling among network nodes may be performed to establish a bearer channel between a wireless communication device herein after referred to as a user equipment UE and other communication devices such as another user equipment or an application server. When a user equipment desires to execute a trusted network application over the communication network or to conduct other trusted communications over the communication network a trusted bearer path may desirably be created to promote a continuity of trust between the user equipment and a communication end point for example a trusted application server. As described in more detail below trusted computation and or trusted communication is based on hardware assisted security that reduces the ability of nefarious software or corrupt devices to write read or otherwise access trusted processing or trusted messages. For further details about creating a trusted bearer path see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 532 588 filed Jun. 25 2012 entitled End to end Trusted Communications Infrastructure by Leo Michael McRoberts et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

To provide trusted communications however the signaling that sets up the trusted bearer communication path may likewise desirably be conducted using a trusted signaling communication path. In an embodiment a user equipment that is attached to the LTE network may execute a trusted application that executes some instructions in a trust security zone of the processor of the user equipment. In some contexts herein a trusted security zone may be referred to as a trust zone and or as a trusted zone. While executing in the trust zone the trusted application may send a trust zone request to a home subscriber server HSS to receive a trust acknowledgement and one or more user parameters associated with the subject trusted application. The trust zone request may be received by an enhanced node B eNB or cell tower. The enhanced node B may handle the trust zone request by executing in a trust zone of the enhanced node B processor to send the trust zone request on to a mobility management entity MME or other signaling node in the LTE network. The mobility management entity may handle the trust zone request by executing in a trust zone of the mobility management entity processor to send the trust zone request on to the home subscriber server. The home subscriber server may handle the trust zone request by executing in a trust zone of the home subscriber server and sending a trust zone acknowledgment and optional use parameters back to the user equipment.

In an embodiment the home subscriber server confirms that the user equipment has rights to execute a trusted service request before generating and sending the trust zone acknowledgment. For example the home subscriber server may determine if the user equipment is subscribed to at least one trusted network application. For example the home subscriber server may determine if the subscriber associated with the user equipment is deemed a trust worthy subscriber for example whether the subscriber has a pending unresolved security or trust violation event history.

The user parameters may be parameters related to the trusted network application or other trusted communication that the user equipment is requesting. The user parameters may be credentials or tokens used to invoke methods or functions of an application programming interface API provided by a trusted network application server. The user parameters may identify data that the user equipment should provide to receive access to the requested trusted service or trusted communication. The user parameters may define a level of access to one or more trusted network applications to which the user equipment is allowed. The user parameters may define a biometric signature a format of a biometric signature and or an encoding method of a biometric signature.

After trust zone processing is established in the signaling path to which it is attached the user equipment may send a trusted service request from its trust zone to a policy and charging rules function PCRF node. It is understood that the trusted service request may be transported by a plurality of nodes in the long term evolution network each handling the trusted service request in a trust zone of their processor for example the enhanced node B the mobility management entity the home subscriber service and possibly other nodes. The policy and charging rules function node determines if the trusted service request meets the standards of a trusted communication and if the user equipment has rights to execute the requested trusted service. If the trusted service request is authorized the policy and charging rules function node sends a trusted service acknowledge and optional use parameters over the signaling path to the user equipment. Said in other words the policy and charging rules function confirms that a policy allows the user equipment to invoke the requested trusted service request before generating and sending the trusted service acknowledgment. Again the trusted service acknowledgement and optional use parameters are transported by nodes executing in a trust zone of their processors. In an embodiment the trusted service acknowledgement comprises trusted bearer communication link path information to support establishing and or setting up the trusted bearer path. The trusted bearer path or trusted bearer channel is then activated and the user equipment accesses the subject trusted services via the trusted bearer path.

When it has completed its access to the trusted service the user equipment may send a trust termination request to the policy and charging rules function node and the policy and charging rules function node may send a trust termination acknowledge back to the user equipment. The user equipment may then send an exit trust zone command to the enhanced node B while executing in the trust zone of the user equipment processor. After having sent the exit trust zone command the user equipment may exit trusted zone processing. The enhanced node B may then forward the exit trust zone command to the mobility management entity while executing in the trust zone of the enhanced node B processor. After having forwarded the exit trust zone command the enhanced node B may exit trust zone processing. The mobility management entity may then forward the exit trust zone command to the home subscriber service while executing in the trust zone of the mobility management entity processor. After having forwarded the exit trust zone command the mobility management entity may exit trust zone processing. The home subscriber service may then forward the exit trust zone command to the policy and charging rules function node while executing in the trust zone of the home subscriber service processor. After having forwarded the exit trust zone command the home subscriber service may exit trust zone processing. The policy and charging rules function node may forward the exit trust zone command to a packet gateway while executing in the trust zone of the policy and charging rules function node. After having forwarded the exit trust zone command the policy and charging rules function node may exit trust zone processing.

When it receives the exit trust zone command the packet gateway may first mediate the tearing down of the trusted bearer path and then exit trust zone processing. Alternatively other nodes in the trusted signaling path may control or mediate the tearing down of the trusted bearer path for example before they exit processing in their trust zone. At this point in time the trusted bearer path has been taken down. After the trusted bearer path has been taken down and after signaling returns to normal signaling a normal bearer channel may be activated or brought up.

In an embodiment the user equipment may have a need during a trusted communication session using a trusted bearer path to enter or obtain communication services from a foreign network here the term foreign network is used to indicate a wireless communication network other than the primary network to which the user equipment has subscribed service . The user equipment may send a redirect request from its trust zone to the mobility management entity. The mobility management entity may probe the signaling endpoint in the foreign network to determine if the foreign network can support a trusted signaling path and a trusted bearer path to provide the requested end to end trusted communication bearer path. If the foreign network can support these trust needs the trusted bearer channel is bridged into the foreign network where an end to end trusted bearer path is likewise provided to the user equipment.

A trusted security zone provides chipsets with a hardware root of trust a secure execution environment for applications and secure access to peripherals. A hardware root of trust means the chipset should only execute programs intended by the device manufacturer or vendor and resists software and physical attacks and therefore remains trusted to provide the intended level of security. The chipset architecture is designed to promote a programmable environment that allows the confidentiality and integrity of assets to be protected from specific attacks. Trusted security zone capabilities are becoming features in both wireless and fixed hardware architecture designs. Providing the trusted security zone in the main mobile device chipset and protecting the hardware root of trust removes the need for separate secure hardware to authenticate the device or user. To ensure the integrity of the applications requiring trusted data such as a mobile financial services application the trusted security zone also provides the secure execution environment where only trusted applications can operate safe from attacks. Security is further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while a trusted application is running in the secure execution environment. In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be conceptualized as hardware assisted security.

A complete trusted execution environment TEE may be implemented through the use of the trusted security zone hardware and software architecture. The trusted execution environment is an execution environment that is parallel to the execution environment of the main mobile device operating system. The trusted execution environment and or the trusted security zone may provide a base layer of functionality and or utilities for use of applications that may execute in the trusted security zone. For example in an embodiment trust records trust tokens and or trust symbols may be generated by the base layer of functionality and or utilities of the trusted execution environment and or trusted security zone for use in trusted end to end communication links to document a continuity of trust of the communications. Through standardization of application programming interfaces APIs the trusted execution environment becomes a place to which scalable deployment of secure services can be targeted. A device which has a chipset that has a trusted execution environment on it may exist in a trusted services environment where devices in the trusted services environment are trusted and protected against attacks. The trusted execution environment can be implemented on mobile phones and tablets as well as extending to other trusted devices such as personal computers servers sensors medical devices point of sale terminals industrial automation handheld terminals automotive etc.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning all of the hardware and software resources of the mobile device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. The secure partition may be implemented by a first physical processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second physical processor. Alternatively the secure partition may be implemented by a first virtual processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second virtual processor. Placing sensitive resources in the secure partition can protect against possible attacks on those resources. For example resources such as trusted software applications may run in the secure partition and have access to hardware peripherals such as a touchscreen or a secure location in memory. Less secure peripherals such as wireless radios may be disabled completely while the secure partition is being accessed while other peripherals may only be accessed from the secure partition. While the secure partition is being accessed through the trusted execution environment the main mobile operating system in the normal partition is suspended and applications in the normal partition are prevented from accessing the secure peripherals and data. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from breaking the trust of the device.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning the hardware and software resources to exist in a secure subsystem which is not accessible to components outside the secure subsystem. The trusted security zone is built into the processor architecture at the time of manufacture through hardware logic present in the trusted security zone which enables a perimeter boundary between the secure partition and the normal partition. The trusted security zone may only be manipulated by those with the proper credential and in an embodiment may not be added to the chip after it is manufactured. Software architecture to support the secure partition may be provided through a dedicated secure kernel running trusted applications. Trusted applications are independent secure applications which can be accessed by normal applications through an application programming interface in the trusted execution environment on a chipset that utilizes the trusted security zone.

In an embodiment the normal partition applications run on a first virtual processor and the secure partition applications run on a second virtual processor. Both virtual processors may run on a single physical processor executing in a time sliced fashion removing the need for a dedicated physical security processor. Time sliced execution comprises switching contexts between the two virtual processors to share processor resources based on tightly controlled mechanisms such as secure software instructions or hardware exceptions. The context of the currently running virtual processor is saved the context of the virtual processor being switched to is restored and processing is restarted in the restored virtual processor. Time sliced execution protects the trusted security zone by stopping the execution of the normal partition while the secure partition is executing.

The two virtual processors context switch via a processor mode called monitor mode when changing the currently running virtual processor. The mechanisms by which the processor can enter monitor mode from the normal partition are tightly controlled. The entry to monitor mode can be triggered by software executing a dedicated instruction the Secure Monitor Call SMC instruction or by a subset of the hardware exception mechanisms such as hardware interrupts which can be configured to cause the processor to switch into monitor mode. The software that executes within monitor mode then saves the context of the running virtual processor and switches to the secure virtual processor.

The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system that is not accessible to the device users. For security purposes the trusted security zone is not open to users for installing applications which means users do not have access to install applications in the trusted security zone. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from executing powerful instructions reserved to the trusted security zone and thus preserves the trust of the device. The security of the system is achieved at least in part by partitioning the hardware and software resources of the mobile phone so they exist in one of two partitions the secure partition for the security subsystem and the normal partition for everything else. Placing the trusted security zone in the secure partition and restricting access from the normal partition protects against software and basic hardware attacks. Hardware logic ensures that no secure partition resources can be accessed by the normal partition components or applications. A dedicated secure partition operating system runs in a virtual processor separate from the normal partition operating system that likewise executes in its own virtual processor. Users may install applications on the mobile device which may execute in the normal partition operating system described above. The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system for the secure partition that is installed by the mobile device manufacturer or vendor and users are not able to install new applications in or alter the contents of the trusted security zone.

In some contexts the long term evolution wireless network may be referred to as a fourth generation or a 4G wireless network. It is understood that the system may comprise any number of the devices and . The network comprises one or more public communication networks one or more private communication networks or a combination thereof.

While the mobility management entity the home subscriber service the policy and charging rules function and the packet gateway may normally be considered to form a part of the network they are shown outside of the cloud representing the network to promote ease of description of the teachings of the present disclosure. The enhanced node B the mobility management entity the home subscriber service the policy and charging rules function and the packet gateway may be implemented on computers.

The mobility management entity comprises a processor that comprises a normal portion and a trust zone portion . The home subscriber service comprises a processor that comprises a normal portion and a trust zone portion . The policy and charging rules function comprises a processor that comprises a normal portion and a trust zone portion . The packet gateway comprises a processor that comprises a normal portion and a trust zone portion . A variety of different trusted signaling scenarios may be executed in the process of setting up and tearing down the trusted bearer path. Some of these trusted signaling scenarios are discussed in detail below with reference to message sequence diagrams depicted in and .

Turning now to a further portion of the wireless communication system is illustrated. The UE is illustrated as communicating with a server computer via a trusted bearer . The server comprises a processor that comprises a normal portion and a trust zone portion . Under this circumstance the trust zone of the UE is communicating with the trust zone of the server via the network via the bearer path having continuity of trust.

The trusted communication may involve transport over the trusted bearer of sensitive confidential or financial information. For example the UE may be sending and or receiving sensitive health records medical reports or biometric data over the trusted bearer to the server . In an embodiment the server may be executing a trusted medical records application that stores the transmitted information in a data store and or retrieves medical records information from a data store. The UE may be embedded in a home medical apparatus such as a blood sugar level testing device used in a home by a diabetic patient under remote medical supervision. The UE may transmit current blood sugar level readings linked to an identity of the diabetic patient over the trusted bearer to the server . In an embodiment the home medical apparatus may prompt the user to provide a biometric signature that will be coupled to the sensor information to confirm the linkage of the sensed information with the user for example to prevent fraud or to provide identification assurance. The biometric signature may be an encoded finger print provided by a fingerprint scanner coupled to the home medical apparatus. The biometric signature may be an encoded retina scan provided by a retina scanner coupled to the home medical apparatus. The biometric signature may be related to some other biological parameter or profile of the subject user. It is contemplated that the system may be used to perform signaling to establish a trusted bearer path suitable for transporting or otherwise communicating a wide variety of sensitive information.

The UE conducts some communications using a trusted communication bearer for example a bearer path provided over a trusted end to end communication infrastructure. For more details on a trusted end to end communication infrastructure see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 532 588 filed Jun. 25 2012 entitled End to end Trusted Communications Infrastructure by Leo Michael McRoberts et al. which was incorporated by reference above. As taught herein trusted signaling may be employed to set up or to initiate the trusted bearer path. The trusted signaling may involve the UE the enhanced node B the mobility management entity the home subscriber service the policy and charging rules function and or the packet gateway executing at least some instructions for signaling in their trust zones and or .

Turning now to a message sequence is described. In an embodiment the message sequence may be performed when the UE initially attaches to a long term evolution network such as the network illustrated in and described with reference to . The UE sends an attach request to the mobility management entity via the enhanced node B . In response to receiving the attach request the mobility management entity conducts an authentication procedure with the home subscriber service . It is understood that the authentication procedure may entail one or more messages sent both to and from each of the mobility management entity and the home subscriber service . On completion of the authentication procedure the mobility management entity conducts an authentication and key agreement procedure with the UE via the enhanced node B . It is understood that the authentication and key agreement procedure may entail one or more messages sent both to and from each of the mobility management entity and the UE . At some later time the UE and the mobility management entity may conduct security mode handshaking that is not directly related to trusted signaling and may be pursuant to long term evolution wireless attachment procedures.

At some time the UE may wish to establish its potential for conducting trusted signaling and or trusted bearer communications. Said in another way at some indeterminate time but before initiating trusted signaling and or trusted bearer communications the UE may wish to register with one or more nodes in the long term evolution wireless network as a UE capable of engaging in trusted communications. The UE begins processing in its trust zone at label . The trust zone of the UE sends a trust zone request to the enhanced node B . The enhanced node B in response to receiving the trust zone request first begins processing in its trust zone at label and then the trust zone of the enhanced node B sends a trust zone request to the mobility management entity . The mobility management entity in response to receiving the trust zone request first begins processing in its trust zone at label and then the trust zone of the mobility management entity sends a trust zone request to the home subscriber service . The home subscriber service in response to receiving the trust zone request begins processing in its trust zone at label . The home subscriber service optionally determines use parameters and then sends a trust acknowledge message optionally containing the use parameters back to the trust zone of the UE via the trust zone of the mobility management entity and the trust zone of the enhanced node B .

Turning now to a message sequence is described. In an embodiment the message sequence may be performed when the UE desires to engage in trusted communication over a trusted bearer path. The message sequence represents exemplary signaling that the UE may engage in to request the long term evolution wireless network to provide a trusted bearer path. At label the UE attaches to the long term evolution wireless network by messaging with the policy and charging rules function via the enhanced node B the mobility management entity and the home subscriber service AuC function . At label the UE completes a packet service bearer activation procedure by messaging with the packet gateway via the enhanced node B the mobility management entity the home subscriber service AuC function and the policy and charging rules function . The processing associated with labels and may be conventional and promote conventional untrusted bearer communication via the long term evolution wireless network on the part of the UE .

At some time the UE may wish to communicate using a trusted bearer path. For example the UE may be embedded in a home medical apparatus and may desire to invoke a trusted network application executing on the server to transmit and or store medical sensor information in a data store coupled to the server . At label the UE begins processing in its trust zone at label . In a message sequence similar to that described above with respect to the UE requests the enhanced node B to execute in its trust zone the mobility management entity to execute in its trust zone the home subscriber service to execute in its trust zone the policy and charging rules function to execute in its trust zone and the packet gateway to execute in its trust zone . The condition where these several nodes are executing in their trust zones is indicated by the box containing the text processing in trust zone. It is understood that the messages and or procedures illustrated below this box containing the text processing in trust zone are conducted in the several trust zones of the subject network nodes and the UE . The UE sends a trusted service request to the policy and charging rules function via the enhanced node B the mobility management entity and the home subscriber service . The policy and charging rules function processes the trusted service request at label optionally determining use parameters. The policy and charging rules function then sends a trusted service acknowledgement message that optionally contains use parameters back to the UE via the home subscriber service the mobility management entity and the enhanced node B .

At label a trusted bearer channel is activated between the UE and the packet gateway . It is understood that the radio link between the UE and the enhanced node B may be the first segment of the trusted bearer path. The packet gateway may execute in its trust zone to connect the UE to a trusted end to end communication infrastructure. Said in another way the packet gateway may execute in its trust zone to connect the UE to a trusted bearer path and or to provide a bearer path providing a continuity of trust for example to connect the UE to the server via the trusted bearer path .

Turning now to a message sequence is described. In an embodiment the message sequence may be performed when the UE desires to discontinue trusted communication over the trusted bearer path and resume communication over a normal bearer path or over an untrusted bearer path. The UE may prefer to conduct normal communications over a normal bearer path or over an untrusted bearer path because the normal bearer path may provide higher throughput rates or because communicating over the normal bearer path may be associated with a more economical rating and or billing schedule.

The label represents a trusted bearer channel and or trusted bearer path is provided to the UE . The UE sends a trust termination request to the policy and charging rules function via the enhanced node B the mobility management entity and the home subscriber service . The policy and charging rules function sends a trust termination acknowledgement to the UE via the home subscriber service the mobility management entity and the enhanced node B .

In response to receiving the trust termination acknowledgement the UE first sends an exit trust zone request to the enhanced node B and then at label exits processing in its trust zone and begins processing in its normal portion . In response to receiving the exit trust zone request the enhanced node B first sends an exit trust zone request to the mobility management entity and then at label exits processing in its trust zone and begins processing in its normal portion . In response to receiving the exit trust zone request the mobility management entity first sends an exit trust zone request to the home subscriber service and then at label exits processing in its trust zone and begins processing in its normal portion . In response to receiving the exit trust zone request the home subscriber service first sends an exit trust zone request to the policy and charging rules function and then at label exits processing in its trust zone and begins processing in its normal portion . In response to receiving the exit trust zone request the policy and charging rules function first sends an exit trust zone request to the packet gateway and then at label exits processing in its trust zone and begins processing in its normal portion . In response to receiving the exit trust zone request the packet gateway first mediates tearing down the trusted bearer path and then at label exits processing in its trust zone and begins processing in its normal portion . Alternatively other nodes in the trusted signaling path may mediate and or control the tearing down of the trusted bearer path. The box containing the text processing in normal CPU represents all of the nodes and the UE processing in their normal portions.

At label the UE may send a normal connection request to the mobility management entity via the enhanced node B . At label the UE may send an untrusted service request to the policy and charging rules function via the enhanced node B the mobility management entity and the home subscriber service . At label the UE may communicate via a normal bearer channel via the enhanced node B and the packet gateway .

Turning now to a message sequence is described. In an embodiment the message sequence may be performed when the UE roams from a first service provider network into a second service provider network while the UE is engaged in trusted communication using a trusted bearer path provided by the first service provider network. The box containing the text processing in trust zone represents that the several nodes and the UE are processing in their respective trust zones. The label shows the UE engaged in communication over a trusted bearer channel via the enhanced node B and the packet gateway . At label in response to determining that the UE is to roam into a second service provider network either the UE or the enhanced node B sends a redirect request to the mobility management entity . The mobility management entity performs a probe or investigation of the trust zone processing capability of the second service provider network. The second service provider network sends a trust zone to trust zone interface trusted connection approval to the UE via the mobility management entity and the enhanced node B . At label the UE is illustrated communicating via a trusted bearer channel provided by the second service provider network.

While not illustrated in when the UE is communicating via a trusted bearer channel provided by the second service provider network the UE may be provided a radio communication link by an enhanced node B operated by the second service provider network that is different from the enhanced node B of the first service provider network. Likewise the UE may be coupled to the trusted bearer channel by a packet gateway operated by the second service provider network that is different from the packet gateway of the first service provider network. In some cases the packet gateway of the first service provider network may continue to be a part of the trusted bearer channel or trusted bearer path for example to connect to the server which may continue to connected to the trusted bearer path even while the UE has roamed into a foreign network or into the second service provider network.

It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the present disclosure contemplates a variety of alternative message sequences and flows based on the specific message sequences described above with reference to and . For example the flow of some messages may bypass some of the nodes described in the flow path from the UE to other signaling nodes. Additionally in some cases the time sequence of some messages may be different. For example in an embodiment a node may exit its trust zone first and then send an exit trust zone request to another node. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that while the descriptions above are directed to the context of trusted communications in a long term evolution wireless network that the descriptions may equally apply to other wireless communication networks. It is sometimes the case that new paradigms of communication that are first developed or invented for use in one communication system for example the trusted signaling in a long term evolution wireless network described herein may over time become a paradigm that is expropriated and used in later generation technologies.

For example the enhanced node B receives a trust zone request from the UE . At block the trust zone request is forwarded from the enhanced node B to a home subscription server HSS wherein the enhanced node B forwards the trust zone request while executing in a trust zone of the enhanced node B wherein the trust zone provides hardware assisted trust.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.
