The present invention relates to a device and method of fire suppression and more particularly to an initiator device and method thereof for an automatic stovetop fire suppressor.

Stovetop fires are a well known residential and commercial hazard. An unattended stovetop fire for example a grease fire can cause damage to nearby appliances and cabinets. Worse stovetop fires can lead to structural damage or injury. Because the propensity for stovetop fires is so pervasive an efficient means of automatic fire suppression is desired. Even if a stovetop fire is attended an automatic extinguishing method may be more effective safe and expedient compared to manual means.

A number of conventional automatic stovetop fire extinguishers which mount near a stovetop surface are available. These include U.S. Pat. No. 6 276 461 to Stager U.S. Pat. No. 6 105 677 to Stager U.S. Pat. No. 5 899 278 to Mikulec U.S. Pat. No. 7 472 758 to Stevens and Weintraub U.S. Pat. No. 7 610 966 to Weintraub et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 518 075 to Williams and U.S. Pat. No. 3 884 307 to Williams. The array of conventional fire suppression systems vary from activation by melting of a fusible pin Stager 461 to melting a solder fusible plug Stager 677 to burning of a fuse Williams 307 Stevens 758 or to activating via a glass bulb fuse mechanism Mikulec .

Conventional fire extinguishers STOVETOP FIRESTOP fire suppressors Williams Pyro Inc. Fort Worth Tex. USA which are particularly well suited to a stovetop environment include a container of an extinguishing or fire suppressing agent mounted to a vent hood above the stovetop and activated by a fuse. An example of such an extinguisher is shown in . is a partial cross sectional view of a conventional fire suppressor revealing the initiator within the container of the fire suppressor . Container has a top wall B and a side wall C while the bottom of the container is a lid which comprises a lip A. Shown exiting from the lid is fuse which feeds into an initiator in the fire suppressor . A fire on the stovetop ignites the fuse which in turn detonates an initiator . The igniter opens the bottom of the container thereby allowing the disbursement of the extinguishing agent onto the fire and the stovetop. The conventional fuse and initiator assembly is effective at automatically activating a fire suppressor under a stovetop fire condition. Still referring to A also shown on an outer side of lid is a terminal . A magnet and magnet housing provide a vent hood mount for the conventional stovetop fire suppressor.

A conventional initiator which may be found in a conventional fire suppressor such as that shown in is shown in greater detail in and is described below with reference to . The conventional fuse and initiator assembly is effective at activating a fire suppressor in the presence of a stovetop fire. Manufacture and assembly of a conventional fuse and initiator assembly is described below with reference to . As in many conventional manufacturing processes and as with many products it would be desirable to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing process of the initiator and to improve the initiator device if possible. It may also be desirable to have a fuse that is activated only by a flame and not by heat or electrical charge.

The present invention addresses some of the issues presented above by providing a new initiator cup in an automatic stovetop fire suppressor. Embodiments of the present invention may have any of the aspects below.

One aspect of the present invention is to provide an efficient flame activation apparatus for a stovetop fire suppressor.

Another aspect of the present invention is to improve the manufacturing efficiency of an initiator and to assemble a stovetop fire extinguisher

Another aspect of the present invention is to reduce the number of processing steps to manufacture an initiator and to assemble a stovetop fire extinguisher.

Another aspect of the present invention is to create an initiator with fewer parts than conventional initiators.

Another aspect of the present invention is to decrease assembly process time to create an initiator for a fire suppressor.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide improved fuse retention in an initiator for an automated stovetop fire extinguisher.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide improved fuse retention in an initiator for an automated stovetop fire suppressor using a rough fuse outer surface.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide improved fuse retention in an initiator for an automated stovetop fire suppressor using a smaller inner diameter of the fuse passage in the cup as compared to an outer diameter of the fuse.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is to mechanically seal the fire extinguishing container about the fuse.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is that the attaching mechanism securing the initiator cup to the container lid is integrated to the cup itself.

Those skilled in the art will further appreciate the above noted features and advantages of the invention together with other important aspects thereof upon reading the detailed description that follows in conjunction with the drawings.

The invention as defined by the claims may be better understood by reference to the following detailed description. The description is meant to be read with reference to the figures contained herein. This detailed description relates to examples of the claimed subject matter for illustrative purposes and is in no way meant to limit the scope of the invention. The specific aspects and embodiments discussed herein are illustrative of ways to make and use the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Briefly is a partial cross sectional view of a conventional fire suppressor revealing an initiator within the fire suppression container and shows a cross section of a conventional initiator with fuse in greater detail. Referring to a fire suppressor has a container which has a top wall B side wall C and a bottom lid . Housed within the container are extinguishing fire suppressing matter and an initiator . A fuse feeds into the initiator. Surrounding the fuse is a terminal . Turning to the initiator has a cup a cap and explosive or explosive substitute material housed in the cup . The cup a side wall and a center hole through its bottom wall . The cup bottom wall sits directly atop fiber washer . The fiber washer is not shown in . Referring again to the terminal comprises a lower shield end and a top rivet end . The terminal secures the cup to the lid . The cap is secured to the top of the side wall . When assembled the fuse extends out an outer side of the lid while the felt washer is sandwiched between the bottom wall of the cup and the inner side of the lid . The terminal extends from an inner side of the cup at its rivet end through the cup hole the washer and a lid hole which are all aligned along a device center . Fuse has a surface and a diameter and will be further described below relative to .

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the cup and cylindrical extension are integral and may be made using a thermoform process such as injection molding. During attachment of the initiator cup to the container lid the cylindrical extension may be formed A to a dimension larger than the diameter of the lid hole in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention as shown in . This process can provide a stable attachment of the cup to the lid . Further this thermoform process may seal the holes of the cup and container preventing fire suppressant powder from leaking from the container. In turn the fiber washer of the conventional initiator as shown in for example may be eliminated and is eliminated in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the terminal with its shield and rivet also shown in is omitted. This elimination of fiber washer and terminal reduces the parts needed to form an initiator.

The present invention provides a novel method of attaching an initiator cup to a fire suppressor container. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention incorporate a novel approach to securing the fuse to the initiator. The effective fuse retention in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention does not require the conventional application of lacquer to secure the fuse and seal the container described for example in relation to . The elimination of the need for lacquer and its application may further improve the manufacturing process by for example reducing costs manufacturing time and labor. The mechanical sealing of the container and securing of the fuse with the thermoforming of the cylindrical extension into attachment form may improve long term fuse retention in the initiator and the associated fire suppressor. The mechanical thermoform attachment may be more robust than the terminal and lacquer container closure and fuse attachment method.

In accordance with the present invention the fuse can be inserted into the cylindrical extension and the initiator fuse assembly can be thermoformed to firmly attach the cup to the lid and secure the fuse to the cup as shown in . Thermoforming the cylindrical extension will extrude plastic material around the fuse. Such method for may provide a more robust securing of the fuse to the initiator and may provide improved fuse retention over conventional methods. Further the plastic extrusion can contribute to tamper proofing the stovetop fire suppressor.

Embodiments of the present invention may include a fuse diameter larger than in internal cylindrical extension diameter. This may provide a twofold advantage yielding an increase in exposed area to a stovetop flame contributing to securing of the fuse to the cup. Use of a rough surfaced fuse in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may also yield a more robust attachment of the fuse to the initiator cup. For example an inadvertent tug on the fuse may have no effect on the activation integrity of the device due to an improved mechanical adhesion or grip of the cup on the fuse created by the rough or gritty fuse outer surface. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the fuse employed is lacking a metallic member. This non metallic fuse will provide flame activation while eliminating heat or electric charge activation of the fire suppressor.

While specific alternatives to steps of the invention have been described herein additional alternatives not specifically disclosed but known in the art are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. Thus it is understood that other applications of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the described embodiments and after consideration of the appended drawings.
