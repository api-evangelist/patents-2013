This invention relates to a method of managing messages associated with digital documents and in particular it relates to a method for managing messages based on rights management services for digital documents.

Many documents are now prepared produced assembled and disseminated in electronic digital file formats such as the Portable Document Format PDF . For example traditional hard copy publications may be replaced by one or more PDF documents which can be opened and displayed by PDF file reader applications such as Adobe s Acrobat Reader.

Likewise traditional multi media messages such as texts graphics images sound clips or video clips may be replaced by digital tags metadata or files which can also be handled by their corresponding reader player viewer applications that would allow a user to read view or listen to such multi media messages.

In addition many document provider publisher or printer services are now implementing or engaging rights management service RMS to manage access and use of digital right management DRM protected electronic documents.

For example when a customer or user purchases a PDF document the customer s identification and rights to open read or copy reproduce the pack document can be handled by an RMS which will allow the customer to access and use the document with the rights assigned to the customer e.g. open and read the document while restricting unauthorized uses by the customer e.g. print and copy .

After a customer obtains a digital document he or she can open the digital document by using a corresponding client program. For example if the digital document is a PDF file then the client program may be a PDF reader. Typically the client program will check to see whether the file is DRM protected. If the file is DRM protected then the client program will ask the customer to provide a user identification ID and password and check the user ID with an RMS system by accessing an RMS server via a computer network such as the Internet. The RMS system then verifies the user ID with a database maintained at the server to determine the customer s rights in connection with the digital document and inform the client program what rights are granted to the customer with regard to the digital document.

The above mentioned DRM authorization process provides a good opportunity to serve the customers with additional information or messages beyond just granting them the access to the digital documents. For example a message reminding completion deadline of academic course pack can be displayed along with the course pack document. Or a message serving advertisement of travel accommodations can be displayed along with the tourist guide document. Unfortunately current DRM and RMS systems do not enable this capability.

Therefore the present invention is directed to a new method of messaging administration based on DRM services.

An object of the present invention is to provide a new method for managing digital multi media messages based on DRM services offered by RMS providers.

The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims thereof as well as the appended drawings.

To achieve these and or other objects as embodied and broadly described one of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides a method for servicing messages with digital documents accessed and displayed by a client application including the steps of establishing a database of message queues each associated with one or more digital documents and containing one or more messages and upon authorizing a user s request for accessing and using a digital document providing a message queue associated with the digital document.

In a further aspect another one of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides a computer software program product that causes one or more data processing apparatus to perform the above described methods. The computer program product includes at least one computer usable non transitory medium e.g. a memory or storage device having computer readable codes embedded therein for controlling the one or more data processing apparatus the computer readable codes configured to cause the one or more data processing apparatus to execute the above described processes.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for messaging administration based on DRM services. RMS systems have been utilized to protect digital document files so that only authorized users can access and use the files. With the addition of messaging services customers are provided with additional information that may be associated with or related to the corresponding document files. By providing messaging services at the same time the DRM authorization is provided to the document files the effectiveness and efficiency of the messaging services can be improved.

Particularly the embodiments of the present invention provide a mechanism to utilize RMS or Learning Management Services LMS systems for managing the messages associating messages with their corresponding document files and also managing the access and use of the messages.

Referring to there is shown a schematic block diagram illustrating an exemplary arrangement in which various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. The exemplary environment includes a user terminal or a client program running on a user s terminal a document provider server connected to an electronic document repository an RMS server and a messaging service server connected to a document ID and message database all connected through a network which may include a computer network such as the Internet or other communication links.

A user may use a user computer or terminal or similar suitable devices such as a laptop computer a tablet computer an e reader or a smart phone etc. to gain online access to the computer network and interact with the document provider server the RMS server and the messaging service server etc. For example a user may purchase and download a PDF document the document provider server . When a user tries to open the PDF document from the user s computer by using a client program such as a PDF file reader the client program will contact the RMS server to obtain authorization for the user and then displays the content of the PDF document on the user s computer . When the RMS server provides authorization to the user messages associated with the PDF documents may also be accessed by the user s computer . This is handled by a client module which can be a plug in to the client program installed on the user s computer .

The document provider server may be operated by for example a document publisher printer a bookseller an educational institution an LMS provider etc. which generally provides online electronic documents books booklets publications and other materials in digital files. The document provider server may provide an integrated online service platform such as an online web store that allows users to search access upload or download and purchase electronic documents stored as digital files in its internal storage device and or in the document repository .

The RMS server may be operated by a DRM center a copyrights management center or other commercial establishments. The document provider server and the RMS server may be the same server or operated by a same entity. When an electronic document is purchased by a user in a digital file the RMS server may enable appropriate DRM protection to the document such that only the user who has purchased the document may have appropriate rights to access and view the document.

The messaging service server may be operated by a messaging service provider an advertising agency or other commercial establishments. The messaging service server provides and manages messages that are stored in a message database and associated with appropriate or corresponding documents.

Details of the interactions of the various parties shown in will be described in conjunction with the following disclosures and descriptions.

As shown in in an alternative arrangement the document provider server and the messaging servicer server may be the same server operated by a same entity such as a document publisher printer an educational institute or a commercial establishment. In this alternative arrangement the document repository and the message database may be maintained on a same memory or data storage device .

The computers terminals and servers shown in may be computers server computers or computer or server systems including webservers where the computer software programs applications or plug in modules implementing the various processes of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be installed and executed. These programs applications or plug ins also provide appropriate user interfaces US or graphic user interfaces GUI to allow users and administrators operators to interact with the computer servers to perform various steps of the process.

The physical locations or the commercial relationship among the various parts of the environment shown in are not important. For example the document provider server and or the RMS server may be located in a publishing house a printing service provider an educational institution an organization or a commercial establishment.

In this application the term server generally refers to any computer server server computer server instance computer or server system data processor controller data processing unit or apparatus or any suitable system apparatus or device and any computer software program or application that are installed or executed on such system apparatus or device that may be used to implement the methods or carry out the processes provided by the embodiments of the present invention. However in this application the term client specifically refers to a computer software program or application that is used by a user to open display read or otherwise use such as print and copy an electronic document. For example for PDF documents the client may be a PDF reader such as Adobe s Acrobat Reader. However it is understood that this invention covers other document or file types as well such as Microsoft Word Excel PowerPoint PPT etc. so the client may be any program that display read or otherwise use these various types of documents or files.

As mentioned earlier in one aspect an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is embodied a computer program product that causes a data processing apparatus to perform the exemplary embodiments of the methods of the present invention. The computer program product includes a computer usable non transitory medium e.g. memory or storage device having a computer readable program code embedded therein for controlling a data processing apparatus where the computer readable program code is configured to cause the data processing apparatus to execute the process of the present invention described herein.

Referring to there is shown a schematic block diagram illustrating an exemplary server whereupon various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. The server typically includes a user input device including for example a keyboard and a mouse. The input device may be connected to the server through a local input output I O port to enable an operator and or user to interact with the server . The local I O is also provided for local connections via direct links to other electronic devices such as a file storage a monitor and or a printer. The server typically also has a network I O port for connection to a computer network such as the Internet so that the server may remotely communicate with the other servers connected to the computer network.

The server typically has a data processor controller unit such as a central processor unit CPU that controls the functions and operations of the server . The data processor controller unit is connected to various memory devices such as a random access memory RAM device a read only memory ROM device and a storage device such as a hard disc drive or solid state memory. The storage device may be an internal memory device or an external memory device such as a file storage device.

The computer software program codes and instructions for implementing the various embodiments of the present invention may be installed or saved on one or more of these memory devices such as the ROM or storage device . When executed certain computer program codes and or instructions may be read out from the ROM or storage device and temporarily stored in the RAM for execution by the data processor controller unit which executes these computer programs codes and or instructions to perform the functions and carry out the operations to implement the process steps of the various embodiments of the present invention.

The server typically also includes a display device such as a video monitor or display screen which may be connected to the local I O . The input device and the display device together provide a user interface which allows a user to interact with the server to perform the steps of the process according to the various embodiments of the present invention. The input device and the display device may be integrated into one unit such as a touch screen display unit to provide a more easy and convenient UI for user interaction with the server .

It is understood that the server may be any suitable computer or computer system. Preferably for use for example by a document provider an RMS system or a messaging service provider the server is a commercial server. However for use by a member of the general public the server may be a desktop computer a laptop computer a notebook computer a netbook computer a tablet computer a hand held portable computer or electronic device a smart phone or any suitable data processing apparatus that has suitable data processing capabilities.

Referring to there is shown a block diagram illustrating an exemplary process in accordance with to one of the embodiments of the present invention. The description herein of the structures functions interfaces and other relevant features such as digital rights policies application programming interface API for rights management and policies etc. of existing DRM method and systems may at times incorporates references or otherwise uses certain information documents and materials from publicly and readily available and accessible open sources e.g. Rights Management URL http help.adobe.com en US livecycle 10.0 Overview WS92d06802c76abadb2c8525912ddcb9aad9 7ff8.html Programmatically applying policies a subsection of Rights Management URL http help.adobe.com en US livecycle 10.0 Overview WSb96e41f8a4ca47a9 4882aeb5131190eddba 8000.html LiveCycle ES Java API Reference URL http livedocs.adobe.com livecycle es sdkHelp programmer javadoc index.html etc.

As shown in the document provider server generally performs the tasks of providing digital documents and also creating user policies for accessing and using the documents. The document provider server then requests the RMS server to assign the user policies to the respective documents.

Upon the requests from the document provider server the RMS server will assign the user policies to the respective documents and create encrypted license keys to the documents. The RMS server then sends the license keys to the document provider server .

Upon receiving the license keys from the RMS the document provider will encrypt the documents with their respective license keys. The encrypted documents are saved in a document repository . Of course the encrypted documents may also be stored as URL addresses of interactive web pages or web services or stored locally at the RMS server .

The messaging service manages the messages. The messages may be a multi media form such as texts graphics images audio clip video clips mini player modules etc. For example the messages may be actual text messages or a message with dynamic contents which may change based on what document they will be associated with or which user they will reach. For example for a document that is a quiz the message may be an answer. For another example the message may have advertising contents that will be different depending on the geographic location of the users of the document. The messages may be provided as metadata or other embedded objects through suitable means such as the Java Script. The messages may also be placed in one or more layers of a PDF document.

The messages may be created or configured by the messaging server or provided by other third party sources. The messages may be stored in the message database or other suitable storage locations or devices. The messages are preferably organized in a way that is associated with the document IDs. In other words for each document to be accessed by users certain messages will be provided along with the documents.

These messages may be related to the contents of the document. For example if the document is a tour guide than the messages may be advertisement of travel accommodations. On the other hand the messages may be totally unrelated to the contents of the documents. For example the messages may be an announcement of a new publication. However whether related or not to the content of a document one or more messages will be associated with the ID of the document. As a result for each document ID there will be if there is any one or more messages associated therewith or assigned thereto. The messages associated with or assigned to each document ID form a message queue. So for the vast number of documents there will be a vast number of message queues to be provided together with their corresponding documents. Of course the message queues may also be associated with user IDs and or policy IDs.

A user may obtain a digital document from the document provider . When a user tries to open a DRM protected document by using a client program at e.g. the user s computer or terminal the client program will establish online access to the RMS server and request authorization for the user. The RMS server will check the user ID the document ID and related policies. If the authorization is granted the RMS server will send a decryption key for the document to the client program so the client program can decrypt the document for the user. When the RMS server receives the user s request for document authorization the RMS server will forward the document ID to the messaging server . The messaging server will look up the document ID and retrieve the message queue associated with or assigned to the document ID and send the message queue to the RMS server. A client plug in module to the client program will fetch the message queue to see whether there are indeed messages for the authorized document. If one or more messages indeed exist in the message queue then the client plug in will combine the messages with the document and renders both. As a result when the user reads the document from an onscreen display the messages will be shown or played accordingly.

As mentioned earlier this invention covers other document or file types as well such as Microsoft Word Excel PowerPoint PPT etc. so the client may be any program that display read or otherwise use these various types of documents or files. Likewise it is also understood that the client plug in can handle various types of documents or files to match the client . In other words this invention also covers client plugins for various documents of file types e.g. PDF Word Excel and PowerPoint etc. There will be special client plugins for each individual document or file type like PDF Word Excel and PowerPoint etc.

The client plugin can either show all the messages in a message queue at one time or decide to show them one by one based on user actions or preferences. For example advertisement related message may show next message from queue when a user navigates from one page to the next page or opens the document next time. Thus for each page the user may see a different advertisement. System administrator at the message server provider server who creates or assembles the message queues can specify how the client plugin will display the messages e.g. all at the same time or one at a time based on user actions. User action that will trigger the next message to be shown will be also stored for future references. This information will be stored in the message queue database

Referring to there are shown sample screen shots illustrating the dynamic arrangements of the embedded objects of the messaging administration according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention. As discussed earlier dynamic messages are used as embedded objects in an associated document. These objects will be hidden if there is no message or if user chooses to opt out i.e. not receiving the messages . When there are messages in the message queue then these embedded objects will display the messages or advertisements. For example illustrates an example where a document is displayed without any message either because there is no message or the user chooses not to receive any message illustrates another example where the document is displayed with one embedded message object and illustrates a further example where the document is displayed with one embedded text object and one embedded advertisement object.

As further seen in users may choose from the View Messaging menu to hide or show the messages. Users may also choose to completely opt out of messaging service. If a user selects the hide option then whenever there are additional messages then the icon on the left side will be highlighted indicating that there are unread messages. The user then can choose the show option or click on the icon on the left and the messages will be displayed. Once all the messages are read in the hide mode then left side icon will be greyed out. This icon will be greyed out all the time in the show or opt out mode.

As an alternative approach embedded objects and their associated messages can be displayed in one or more of the layers of a multi layer PDF document. This will provide one or more messaging and advertising layers that can be dynamically updated based on the message queue.

The RMS server may also be provided with a server plug in module that works from the RMS server side with the client plug in module at the user computer side. The server plug in may also have the functions of managing and configuring the messages and establishing and organizing the message queues.

The server plug in module will be installed on RMS server as an add on module. When a user tries to open the protected document on the user s computer the client program which may be a document viewer for example Adobe Acrobat will send the authorization request to the client plug in module . The client plug in module will send the authorization request to RMS server . The RMS server will do the authorization and send the authorization response to the service plug in module . If user is authorized then the server plug in module will communicate with messaging service provider server and get the message queue for the document. The server lug in module will send the authorization response and message queue information to client plug in module . If user is not authorized to open the document the server plug in module will not send the message queue information to client plug in module and it will only send the authorization response.

When user request for a DRM protected document is authorized then server plug in will send the message queue along with authorization response to the client side. On the client side the client plug in will combine the message with the document and display them together. Message can be a static information or dynamic content enabling user interactions with the message.

These plug in modules are software programming codes and instructions for carrying out the additional steps related to the access and use of message queues in the process of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention described herein. Server plug in is compatible and can work with the server applications on the RMS server and utilize existing features and functionalities of the server applications yet provide additional features and functionalities for managing and sending messages to the users. Client plug in is compatible and can work with the client program on the user compute and utilize existing features and functionalities of the client program yet provide additional features and functionalities for fetching rendering and displaying showing playing the messages to the users.

As mentioned earlier in conjunction with the document provider server and the messaging servicer server may be the same server operated by a same entity. With this alternative arrangement the tasks and steps handled by document provider server and messaging service server will be handled by server as shown in .

Alternatively the RMS server may be completely replaced with the messaging server and whenever a DRM protected document is opened the client plug in will go and fetch the messages from the messaging server and then show display play it along with the original document content. Of course the benefit of having a separate RMS server is that messages are completely protected from unauthorized access just like the document is protected from unauthorized access.

The present invention method has many advantages. It combines documents with message but allows the documents and messages be obtained from different source. For example the messages may be retrieved online from a remote source while the document may be retrieved from a local hard disk of the user s computer yet eventually both the document and the associated messages are combined and rendered together by the client plug in.

The present invention method enables document providers to leverage messaging capability along with DRM protection of the documents. It also allows document providers to separate messages from the actual documents. It further allows embedding objects that will be dynamically populated based on the information contained in the messages. In addition in case of PDF documents these messages and or advertisements can be displayed in one of the layers of multi layer PDF document providing user the option to hide the messages advertisements and only see them when the user chooses to do so.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the descriptions that follow and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims thereof as well as the appended drawings.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modification and variations can be made in the method and related apparatus of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations that come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
