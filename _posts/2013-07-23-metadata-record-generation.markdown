The present application is a continuation of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 12 899 971 filed Oct. 7 2010 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 250 227 filed Oct. 9 2009 both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

The invention relates to methods and apparatus for the automatic identification and selection of metadata from media craft tools.

The term craft tool as used herein is a computer implemented tool for audio and or visual editing and or broadcast purposes. Examples craft tools include for example editing software used to edit audio and or visual productions projects e.g. film editing programme editing. Other examples of craft tools include so called sequencers that are normally used for audio only productions. Other examples of craft tools include tools for broadcast automation that enable audio and video cues to be cued up and played according to a schedule or when triggered from a control panel.

The term project as used herein refers to an audio or audio visual production for example a particular cut of a film or an episode of a TV programme or a mix of a song or a production going to air. A project file within a craft tool is a central file in which all the information about a particular audio or audio visual production is stored and points at the media files that are used in the project.

The term sequence as used herein and as typically used in craft tool terminology refers a particular edit within a project. For example if the project is a given film then examples of sequences edits might be a pre watershed version the trailer version the director s cut etc.

The term metadata as used herein refers to any information of whatever form relating to a project or a sequence for a project. Examples of metadata include a project name a creator name names of media files used in the project technical information about the media files used in a project such as bit depth sample rate global positioning system GPS location exposure etc. timing data about where and how each media file is cut and edited into the programme process data settings information about how sections of audio or video have been processed e.g. visual effects free text or customized fields that an editor types in or imports into a project map and or GPS data audio levels data graphics data colour data rights data.

The term content is herein to refer to media held in a media file. A media file can contain content in the form of raw audio video footage image graphics etc. The content in the media files are loaded into the craft tool by an editor operating the craft tool in order to create a project.

An editor may have used music tracks in his production. The editor normally has a compliance obligation to make a list of all the music used with the times in and out and a list of all other associated fields which show the identities and ownership stakes of the interested parties in each piece of music composer publisher arranger etc. Such a list of music with all the associated metadata is commonly known as a cue sheet. It is a significant overhead for an editor to identify the piece of music used then to find out and attach the metadata for that music and then to organise the meta data into a cue sheet format.

Most craft tools can export a standard edit decision list EDL file which can then be automatically interrogated to find the filename of each music file used and the timing of when it was used in the production. Automated EDL to cue sheet software is available that uses filenames to lookup against a database of music titles and their associated metadata thereby avoiding the need for the editor to have to find that information.

However an approach using such automated EDL to cue sheet software relies on the file name of the music track as used by the editor in the project being exactly the same as the file name in the look up database. This is a problem since the editor may use an abbreviation or may not be aware of the name that is in a database. For example the editor might refer to a Madonna track as Madi1 whereas the database of metadata could use a totally different name.

Also before an editor can create an EDL file from a project the editor has to carry out a lot of time intensive and error prone organisation in the craft tool so that the EDL includes all the information that is relevant to a cue sheet. e.g. voiceover and other musical tracks must be weeded out and audio tracks must be arranged in a particular way for the EDL export functions to work 

An embodiment of the invention enables the automatic selection and extraction of metadata and media content from projects in a craft tool. An embodiment of the invention can provide for the automated extraction of such data for purposes of identification classification and management of such metadata and content using automated identification techniques including for example pattern recognition of content for example audio and visual content. An embodiment of the invention can facilitate the automatic tracking and centralised storage of metadata and content for compliance and other purposes and can enable querying of organised metadata stored in a central database. An embodiment of the invention enables metadata and media content to be extracted automatically from a project in a craft tool at a client system and to be forwarded to a host system for processing including for example the creation of a cue sheet including timings for media files from timing metadata in a project file to create the timings on the cue sheet.

The term data extraction module as used herein refers to an application that is provided for a craft tool. Different versions of the data extraction module can be configured to access the metadata and the content in a project created by an editor within a given craft tool. Each individual data extraction module version provides the same set of functionalities although the respective versions are adapted to the structure of the metadata and content for each craft tool and the platform on which the craft tool is implemented for example OS X Windows Linux etc.

The data extraction module can be configured as a standalone application i.e. to be run as stand alone program or may be more configured as a plug in integrated into the menu structure of a craft tool such that is can be triggered from within a menu in the craft tool.

An example embodiment of a system incorporating the data extraction module can employ pattern recognition to determine metadata for content from a project.

An embodiment of the invention does not depend solely on filenames and other metadata in a project in a craft tool but it is also operable automatically to analyse content in the project in order automatically to generate and or to verify metadata. In an example embodiment pattern recognition is used to analyse the content. In one example embodiment for instance pattern recognition is used to enable automatic cue sheet generation as follows 

A data extraction module is operable to identify content for example audio content in respective media files of a project and to generate a fingerprint of content of each media file. The data extraction module generates an export file that contains the fingerprints and metadata extracted from the project. The export file is then delivered to a host server. The host server is operable to compare fingerprint s in the export file to reference fingerprints held in a database of source tracks and associated metadata using conventional and or proprietary pattern recognition techniques to identify metadata corresponding to the extracted content from the project. The metadata identified by comparing the fingerprints can be compared to the metadata extracted from the project to verify the metadata extracted from the project and can be added to the metadata extracted from the project to form a cue sheet that can be imported into a cue sheet view for reporting to performing rights societies.

The present approach differs from conventional audio recognition systems than listen to a soundtrack of a completed programme typically when it is broadcast in which the audio recognition for music reporting is adapted to recognise music with layers of voiceover and special effects etc. on top of it. Limitations in the conventional techniques caused by the need to take account of such additional noise impacts on the efficiency and accuracy of such audio recognition systems and can prevent such systems being used to accurately identify timings of music excerpts with voiceovers fades etc. In contradistinction thereto as an embodiment of the invention acts on individual content media files in individual tracks within a project audio recognition can be made more efficient and accurate. Also combining audio recognition with metadata from the project relating to timings of the media content files within the tracks of the project enables more accurate determination of timings within the project. The advantages provided by an embodiment of the invention apply to all types of media not just audio.

An example embodiment is described in more detail by way of example only with reference to the drawings.

The system shown in includes a host system connected to a network for example the Internet. The host system can be implemented by one or more computer server systems. The host system is configured to access a reference database . The reference database can be integral to or separate from the host system . Where the reference database is separate from the host system the reference data base can be implemented by a computer database system and the host system can be configured to access the reference database directly or via the network . shows a plurality of client systems A and B. A client system can be implemented by one or more computer systems. The client systems A are connected to the network and the client system B is a stand alone system. A client system includes a craft tool and a data extraction module that is operable to identify content in respective media files of a project to generate a fingerprint of the content of each media file and to create a file to export to the host system . also shows a plurality of agency systems that are connected to network . An agency system can be implemented by one or more computer servers and can be operated by an organisation such as a performing right society. The host system is operable to receive and process files exported from the client systems . The processing includes comparing fingerprint s in the exported file to reference fingerprints held in a database of source tracks and associated metadata to identify metadata corresponding to the extracted content from the project and generating cue sheets for submission to one or more of the agency systems .

The client system also includes a data extraction module . The data extraction module can be implemented as a computer software product for example as an application separate from the craft tool or as a plug in for the craft tool . The data extraction module can include computer program code to be held in the memory and or storage in the client system . The computer program code of the data extraction module can be operable when executed on the one or more processors to carry out tasks defined by the data extraction program code. The data extraction module is configured to interact with the craft tool for accessing metadata and content held in files in a project defined by the craft tool taking into account the structure of the metadata and content for the craft tool and the platform on which the craft tool is implemented for example OS X Windows Linux etc.

The data extraction module provides a plurality of different functions represented schematically by a control module an analysis module a file module and a communication module . The control module is operable to control the operation of the data extraction module and to access metadata and content from the craft tool . In various embodiments the data extraction module can be operable to access the metadata and content from the craft tool either directly or via one or more layers of abstraction for example via an API provided by the craft tool . The control module analysis module file module and communication module can be implemented as computer software computer program code held in memory or storage in the client system that is operable to control the processor s of the client system to carry out the process described with reference to .

The file structure can be implemented using respective files for the items identified using an object based structure using a mark up language such as XML or in any other suitable manner. Indeed different craft tools implement a file structure in different ways.

The craft tool can also include a communications module that is configured to provide an interface for accessing the file structure . The communications module can be in the form of computer program code defining an application programming interface API .

As indicated the processing module rendering module and the communications module can be implemented as computer software held in the memory and or storage in the client system the computer software being operable to control the processor s of the client system. The file structure can be held in the memory and or storage in the client system.

The data extraction module can be initiated in step by an editor. If the data extraction module is configured as a plug in for the craft tool the data extraction module can be initiated using a menu item in the craft tool . Alternatively if it is implemented as a separate application then the application can be initiated. The data extraction module could alternatively be initiated automatically for example by reaching a given stage in operation of the craft tool. After initiation the operation of the data extraction module proceeds in an automatic manner.

The control module then processes the media items . In the present example as illustrated in the control module loops for each track and within each track extracts each media item .

If the control module identifies that the data item contains metadata then the file module adds the metadata to the project file created in step .

If the control module identifies that the data item contains content then the analysis module processes the content to produce a representation e.g. a fingerprint of the content and the file module adds the processed content to the file created in step . In one example the analysis module can be operable to create a Fourier transform of the content as a representation of the content and the Fourier transform is then stored as the representation of the content in the export file. In other examples other forms of processing can be employed for example the processing can be to directly generate metadata for the media item. Content extracted from the project can also be stored in the project file instead of or in addition to the processed content. If the content is associated with metadata in the project then the metadata can be associated with the content and or processed content in the project file.

Otherwise at step the communications module exports the project file. The communications module can be operable digitally to encrypt the project file before export. Conventional encryption technologies can be used to encrypt the project file such that confidential information contained therein is held confidential and to counter attempts potentially to corrupt the project file. The project file can be exported to the host system directly if the client system e.g. a client system A is connected to the network . Alternatively if the client system e.g. the client system B is not connected to the network then the export file can be transferred for example using a disk USB memory wired or wirelessly connection or otherwise to a client system A that that is connected to the network from which it can be transmitted to the host system via the network .

In step an exported file for a project or a sequence of a project referred to as a project file with reference to is received by the process module from a client system and can be stored in the memory or storage of the host system . The process module can be operable to decrypt a project file encrypted at the client system .

The process module interrogates the database using pattern recognition to determine if a match for the content representation for the item can be found.

If the process module finds a match then the metadata associated with the matched entry in the database can be compared to any metadata of the item being processed the current item .

If the process module finds that the current item in the project file does not contain any new metadata that is metadata not already present in the database then the process module uses the metadata associated with the matched item in the database for creating and or updating a cue sheet for the project.

If the process module finds metadata for the current item in the project file that is not found in the database then the process module adds the new metadata to the metadata possibly by creating an additional metadata or a history field associated with the matched item in the database . Then the process module uses the new metadata and any existing metadata for the matched item in the database for creating and or updating the cue sheet for the project.

If the process module at step did not find a match for the current item of the project file in the database then the process module adds the content representation and the content and any associated metadata from the current item to the database as a new database entry. The process module then uses the metadata from the current item of the project file for creating and or updating the cue sheet for the project

If after steps or the process module finds that there are more items in the project file the process returns to step for the next item. Otherwise the process completes in step and the cue sheet can be sent to the agency system .

In the above process where reference is made to identifying a match the match can relate to identifying the whole identity of content for example the identity of a particular recording or can be to identifying details within the content. For example pattern recognition could be used to identify the face of an actor in a movie and identify times within a movie that the actor appears. For example a fingerprint representation of the image of an actor could be stored in the reference database along with metadata identifying the actor. Similarly a fingerprint representation of the image of a product could be stored in the reference database along with metadata identifying the product. As another example a fingerprint representation of the voice of a musician could be stored in the reference database along with metadata identifying the musician. Other aspects of facets of a project or project sequence can also be captured by the techniques described above. For example information can be captured automatically that can identify moods e.g. colours types of music or sound effects expressions etc. and aspects that could lead to the identification of product placements e.g. themes topics of interest etc. . Also text could be identified corresponding to spoken words or images in the content scores could be generated for music etc. In this way an embodiment of the invention can be used to identify details within a content item. Using timing and or other metadata in the exported file from the client system the process module of the host system is then able not only to generate cue sheets for for example a performing rights society it can also be used for example to quantify royalties etc. opportunities for product placement and the like.

In summary therefore using an example embodiment of the invention a user launches a data extraction module application and browses through a data extraction module dialogue to target one or more project files created by a craft tool which holds essential information about the structure of a particular editing project. A project might contain multiple sequences i.e. different edits of the same film.

Different versions of a data extraction module can be provided as different craft tools have a different file structures for project files ranging from XML to flat files from open to proprietary format XMP binary audio video etc. Also different craft tools have different organisations for the way in which a project s associated media files and content are held so that respective versions of a data extraction module can target the different structures of metadata and media files for each craft tool.

An example of the data extraction module can be configured to enable a user to select to view listen to audition the media files and metadata and using the workflow of the data extraction module decide which parts of metadata to export and how to export them.

For example for making a music cue sheet the user may listen to audio files used in a project decide which ones contain music weed out voiceover and special effects tracks which are not musical and export one or more resulting export files to the host system. For an image example a user could drill down to a view all still images used in a production and export the image data in one or more export files to the host system. For a GPS example a user may wish to create a list of the GPS coordinates for all the video shot and used in the production.

In one example embodiment the data extraction module creates digital fingerprints of audio tracks in a project as described above and exports to the resulting files which are then exported then matched and turned into a cue sheet. In other examples other automated techniques can be included to recognise faces images voices moods product placement opportunities etc.

Also in the above description fingerprints representations of individual media files as providing in individual tracks are generated. However in addition fingerprints representative of multiple tracks can be generated and included in the exported files. Indeed a fingerprint of a complete project can be generated to represent the project for example in the form to be broadcast. Such a fingerprint of part of or an entire project or programme can then be used to identify instances when the project or programme is broadcast.

An embodiment of the invention enables information to be extracted at a granular and more specific level than possible via the interfaces provided in conventional craft tools.

An embodiment facilitates the translation organising and modifying of metadata and content to different standards for the purpose of delivering the information and content.
