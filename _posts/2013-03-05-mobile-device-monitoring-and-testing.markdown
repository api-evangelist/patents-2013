This disclosure generally relates to automated or interactive monitoring and testing of wireless communications based mobile devices hereinafter mobile devices and more particularly to local and remote capturing and stimulation of mobile device output.

Hardware manufactures or designers are releasing new mobile devices at a faster rate with higher complexity and with a wider variety of functionality across the mobile device offerings. Wireless communications service providers or carriers and data service providers e.g. cellular communications service providers or carriers typically provide a variety of mobile devices or services related to such mobile devices e.g. smart phones in a variety of locations conditions and environments. Such variety coupled with the increasing complexity and variety of mobile devices and the expanding input and output capabilities of such mobile devices may lead to unforeseen or even undesirable behavior. Enabling hardware manufacturers and or service providers collectively clients to locally or remotely monitor and interactively test mobile devices may provide those clients with opportunities to identify and reproduce such behavior for instance aberrant behavior.

As one example suppose that a client e.g. mobile device manufacturer or designer or wireless communications service provider has received multiple complaints from end users of particular mobile devices provided by the client. These complaints may be related to undesirable behavior in the form of audio interference produced by the mobile device when using a particular application on the mobile device. Such complaints may have been provided by end users of a variety of different mobile devices under a variety of circumstances such as by end users of multiple models of the device provider s mobile devices using one or more versions of a particular operating system. The undesirable behavior may be difficult to intentionally reproduce let alone do so in a manner that allows the client or other interested entity to determine a cause of the undesirable behavior. Capturing all output of one or more representative mobile devices while monitoring user input to the devices or even reproducing user reported actions to attempt to reproduce the undesirable behavior may be useful to a number of different entities to the mobile device manufacturer or designer to a wireless service provider of the end user to a provider of the application that is reportedly in use when the undesirable audio interference occurs to end users of the mobile device or other entity. Additionally the ability to remotely perform such monitored interactions with the mobile device may provide improved results by allowing those results to be obtained for multiple mobile devices in a variety of locations conditions and environments such as those that may resemble those in which the undesirable behavior was observed while allowing a client interested in such results to remain in a single preferred location.

As another example an application developer interested in releasing an application for use with a particular mobile device or multiple such mobile devices may find that testing the application on a large number of mobile devices in a thorough manner requires significant resources such as an investment in acquiring the multiple mobile devices and a substantial amount of human labor and time to interact with the application on each of those multiple mobile devices. Furthermore without being enabled to monitor and or capture each of the multiple input and output capabilities of each mobile device on which the application is being tested the developer may be unable to determine particular aspects of the mobile device and its operations with respect to the tested application. For such purposes and others it may be useful to provide a mobile device with a predefined sequence of input actions in order to examine the resulting output of that mobile device for example to ensure that such output matches the behavior desired and or expected by the application developer . In certain circumstances providing interactive user actions to a monitored mobile device either independently or in conjunction with one or more predefined sequences of input actions may allow an application developer or other interested entity to gain insight into mobile device behavior that would otherwise be more difficult to obtain.

New approaches are therefore desirable that automate various activities related to the monitoring of mobile devices while allowing for simultaneous local or remote operation and the use of predefined input sequences partially predefined input sequences and or interactive testing.

Various systems methods and algorithms are described herein to automate various activities related to the monitoring of mobile devices. In certain embodiments local or remote clients may interact with one or more mobile devices monitored according to the described systems and methods as well as defining and initiating the providing of various predefined input sequences to such mobile devices while simultaneously capturing the display output and other output of each monitored mobile device.

In at least some embodiments a Mobile Device Communications Interface MDCI is provided that may be communicatively coupled to a mobile device in order to enable in conjunction with a provided Communications Interface Controller CIC system the monitoring and capture of one or more output capabilities of the mobile device. In at least some embodiments the monitoring and capture of such output capabilities include capturing a display output of the mobile device at a resolution and frame rate equal to or greater than the resolution and frame rate provided by the mobile device display. The captured display output may be provided in some embodiments to a transcoding module included in the MDCI or the CIC system in order to transcode the captured video data to one of several high definition HD video formats. In this manner HD video output of the mobile device display may be stored in one or more storage devices included in or communicatively coupled to the CIC system and may in certain embodiments be provided to one or more client users of the CIC system. In at least some embodiments the CIC system is coupled directly to the MDCI which is in turn coupled to a monitored mobile device. In other embodiments the CIC system may be located remotely from the MDCI and monitored mobile device such as if the CIC system is communicatively coupled to the MDCI via one or more communication networks and or computing networks.

In addition to capturing one or more output capabilities of the monitored mobile device in at least some embodiments the CIC system may provide the mobile device with input actions via the MDCI using one or more input capabilities of the monitored mobile device. Such input actions may include one or more defined input sequences and or interactive input actions from a local or remote client of the CIC system and may in certain embodiments take the form of scripts that may include multiple defined input sequences as well as defined triggers or other statements to initiate such input sequences in various manners. In certain embodiments interactive input actions may be provided by a local or remote client of the CIC system using a Graphical User Interface GUI provided by the CIC system or entity operating the CIC system such as a Mobile Device Testing Service. In certain embodiments interactive input actions may be provided by a local or remote client of the CIC system via one or more programmatic interfaces provided by the CIC system or Mobile Device Testing Service such as by using an interactive command line interface. In at least some embodiments clients may also use a provided GUI of the CIC system to record or otherwise define one or more input sequences for the CIC system to provide to one or more monitored mobile devices. Similarly in an embodiment clients of the CIC system or associated Mobile Device Testing Service may use a provided programmatic interface of the CIC system such as an Application Programming Interface or API to create or otherwise define predefined input sequences for the CIC system to provide to one or more monitored mobile devices.

In certain embodiments the MDCI may be communicatively coupled to a monitored mobile device via multiple channels of the MDCI in a manner that enables the capture of and interaction with a plurality of input output I O and other capabilities of the monitored mobile device by the CIC system. For example in at least certain embodiments one or more audio inputs and outputs of the mobile device may be captured and or used to replicate or otherwise provide user audio input. Other input output capabilities of the monitored mobile device may be coupled to the CIC system via the MDCI as is described in greater detail elsewhere. Furthermore also as described in greater detail elsewhere herein the CIC system may provide a variety of input and output processing related to I O channels and other channels of the MDCI corresponding to I O and other capabilities of a monitored mobile device.

The headings and Abstract of the Disclosure provided herein are for convenience only and do not interpret the scope or meaning of the embodiments.

The MDCI is communicatively coupled to a Communications Interface Controller CIC via communication links . The depicted environment additionally includes a Web server provided by a Mobile Device Testing Service not shown that provides access for one or more client devices via various other servers and public and or private networks e.g. the Internet .

The monitored mobile device may be as a non exclusive list of examples a portable email device personal digital assistant cell phone smart phone satellite phone palmtop computing device laptop tablet computing device game console media player or other device with wireless communications capabilities and that includes or combines capabilities of any or all of these. In the illustrated embodiment MDCI and CIC are depicted separately.

In certain embodiments MDCI and CIC may be combined into a single Mobile Device Monitoring System which may additionally and optionally include one or more storage modules and a SIM card interface to communicatively interface with one or more subscriber identity modules or similar unique subscriber identity storage media generically SIM or SIMs . In at least one embodiment Mobile Device Monitoring System may include an MDCI and CIC while being communicatively coupled to either or both of an external SIM card interface and one or more external storage devices. In the depicted embodiment communication links include physical connections such that MDCI and CIC are located within a same geographical location in other embodiments the CIC may be located remotely from the MDCI such that communication links include one or more network connections. Furthermore in at least one embodiment the CIC may be communicatively coupled to multiple monitored mobile devices via a corresponding number of Mobile Device Communications Interfaces.

Communication links comprise a plurality of electrical interfaces designed to sense or induce particular electrical magnetic electromagnetic and or mechanical operations of the monitored mobile device . Such interfaces may include probes wires optical and or magnetic sensors actuators and transducers communicatively coupled to the mobile device. These may provide traces and connections to as non exclusive examples one or more video displays of the mobile device one or more other visual outputs of the device e.g. LED or other visual indicators one or more touch based interfaces of the mobile device e.g. a touchscreen display one or more buttons or other actuators located on the mobile device e.g. a keyboard keypad trackball etc. one or more audio outputs of the mobile device one or more audio inputs of the mobile device e.g. microphones one or more optical inputs of the mobile device e.g. one or more front or rear facing cameras one or more radio frequency interfaces and connections of the mobile device one or more power interfaces of the mobile device e.g. battery connection power connection etc. one or more SIM card interfaces of the mobile device and one or more data ports of the mobile device e.g. a USB micro USB mini USB PCI PCIe DisplayPort Thunderbolt Lightning or other standard or proprietary data port etc. In certain embodiments communication links further include additional circuit logic communicatively coupled to one or more of the electrical interfaces described above for translating signals passed via such electrical interfaces into data usable by the MDCI and or the CIC . Such translation may include converting an electrical voltage or current level to another electrical voltage or current level converting mechanical magnetic or optical signals into electrical signals or converting electrical signals into one or more mechanical magnetic or optical signals. In at least some embodiments communication links provide distinct channels for separate and simultaneous use by various components of the MDCI . For example separate channels of the MDCI may be provided via communication links for audio output data audio input data and display output data as well as one or more distinct other channels for various I O functionality.

In the depicted embodiment the MDCI includes an I O interface audio video A V capture interface and power interface . The I O interface includes a number of modules to effectuate interactions with the monitored mobile device via communication links . In particular I O interface includes a touch input decoder to receive decode and or provide signals that correspond to a touchscreen or other touch sensitive display of the monitored mobile device a SIM interface to send and receive signals associated with a SIM interface of the mobile device a control interface to send and receive signals associated with one or more actuator controls of the mobile device such as a physical keyboard power or volume actuator controls trackball or other physical actuator controls of the device a data port interface for providing or receiving data corresponding to a data port of the mobile device an audio input interface for providing audio data to the mobile device such as may correspond to a microphone input and general I O interface to provide other input actions and or receive other output of the mobile device. The power interface enables the CIC to provide and control electrical power to the monitored mobile device via MDCI . In at least some embodiments the power interface allows the CIC to send and receive control signals related to the electrical supply of the monitored mobile device such as an indication that the mobile device has been connected or disconnected from an external power supply an indication of a power level of a battery of the mobile device an indication that a battery of the mobile device has been inserted or removed or other indication related to power provided to the mobile device.

The A V capture interface includes an audio capture module for capturing audio output streams of the monitored mobile device such as may be produced by an internal or external speaker of the device and video capture module for capturing display information from the monitored mobile device. The video capture module includes a translator module a decoder module and an HD converter module . The translator module receives the electrical signals from a display of the monitored mobile device via communication links and translates the received signals to a decodable format. For example a primary display of the monitored mobile device may typically be driven based on low voltage differential signaling LVDS current mode logic CML single ended signaling or other known method. Translator module converts the electrical signals associated with such methods to a specific format for the purpose of passing the received data from such signals to decoder module . As an example in certain embodiments translator module may convert the LVDS electrical signals sent to the primary display of monitored mobile device into data compatible with a Mobile Display Digital Interface MDDI Mobile Industry Processor Interface MIPI Flatlink Displayport or other standard or proprietary interface. Decoder module receives this compatible data from translator module and decodes the received data to extract readable frame information. In at least some embodiments the decoder module extracts and buffers frame information at regular predetermined intervals such as may enable buffering a single complete frame of display data times per second 60 Hz . The buffered frame data is provided to HD converter module which then generates a full high definition video stream for output to the Communications Interface Controller . In at least the depicted embodiment the audio information captured by audio capture module is provided to HD converter module to be synchronized and included in the video stream provided to the CIC . In other embodiments such audio information may be provided to the CIC separately or in a user selectable manner determined by the CIC. In at least some embodiments the CIC may store some or all of the captured video provided by the A V capture interface of the MDCI in one or more storage devices communicatively coupled to the CIC such as storage in the environment depicted by .

In the depicted embodiment the CIC includes an input processing manager an output processing manager and transcoding module . The input processing manager receives a variety of input actions such as may be provided in certain embodiments via Web server or client devices and relays those received input actions to appropriate modules of the I O interface of MDCI via communication links . For example input processing manager may receive one or more input actions associated with a touch command for a touch based display of the monitored mobile device such as may be used in a Graphical User Interface provided by Web server to one or more clients as described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Responsive to receiving one or more indications of such input actions the input processing manager determines that the indicated input actions are intended for the touch based display of the monitored mobile device and provides information specific to such input actions to touch input decoder which in turn provides signals corresponding to those input actions to monitored mobile device via communication links . In this manner client actions performed using user selectable controls of a provided GUI or other interface may in at least some embodiments be provided to monitored mobile device as if a user of the monitored mobile device physically performed such input actions using the monitored mobile device directly. Furthermore since in at least some embodiments input processing manager utilizes channels of the MDCI that are distinct from those utilized by video capture module and since I O interface utilizes channels the MDCI that are distinct from those utilized by video capture module indications of input actions relayed to or received from the I O interface by input processing manager are provided while the NV capture interface concurrently captures video display data from the monitored mobile device .

In certain embodiments the input processing manager may additionally include one or more command processing engines not shown to provide various command processing functionality. For example as is described in greater detail elsewhere herein individual input actions or predefined input sequences may be provided to the CIC and in various embodiments may be provided in various manners including but not limited to one or more GUIs provided for use with the CIC one or more programmatic interfaces e.g. an API or other programmatic interface as may be provided by various libraries class interfaces and or network service protocols such as via Web services provided for use with the CIC XML or other markup based languages one or more interpreted languages e.g. Perl Python Ruby etc. one or more compiled languages e.g. C .NET Java etc. one or more scripting or macro languages etc. The input processing manager may provide support for any or all of these in order to allow greater client flexibility in creating or editing predefined input sequences or in providing input actions to one or more mobile devices in an interactive manner.

Output processing manager processes output from the monitored mobile device delivered from the MDCI via communication links . In the illustrated embodiment the output processing manager includes bitmap matching module Optical Character Recognition OCR module and video output module . The bitmap matching module may determine whether defined portions of display data such as one or more display interface controls etc. are included in the video data provided to the CIC by the NV capture interface . In this manner the bitmap matching module enables interactive or defined e.g. previously specified input actions to be based in part on the display of expected visual indications on a display of the mobile device. For example a portion of a defined input sequence may include an instruction to provide to the monitored mobile device a finger tap action at certain coordinates of a touch based display of the mobile device if an image of a particular touch control such as a user selectable Send control or other button image is displayed within an indicated range of those coordinates on the touch based display. In a similar manner OCR module may determine whether defined textual character sequences are included in the video data provided to the CIC by the A V capture interface such as to enable interactive or defined input actions to be based in part on the appearance of particular text on the display.

The video output module may in some embodiments provide video output data from the monitored mobile device to one or more local or remote client display devices. For example video output from the mobile device may be provided to a display screen associated with one or more client devices via one or more networks either directly or via Web server and or to one or more client terminals not shown otherwise communicatively coupled to CIC such as a local display device. In certain embodiments the CIC may optionally also include transcoding module which may be used by the CIC to transcode the high definition video output of A V capture interface to one or more other video formats according to specifications of a destination display device or user selectable criteria.

In the depicted embodiment the CIC is communicatively coupled to SIM card interface . The SIM card interface provides selectable multiplexing of multiple SIM cards for use with monitored mobile device . In certain embodiments the SIM card interface may comprise a single unit with a separate interface slot for each of the multiple SIM cards to be made available for clients to use with the monitored mobile device in other embodiments the SIM card interface communicatively coupled to the CIC is a network accessible SIM server. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the SIM card interface may include both local and networked SIM functionality. In certain situations and embodiments such as those in which a monitored mobile device communicatively coupled to the MDCI and CIC is capable of concurrently interfacing with multiple SIM cards the SIM card interface may be used to simultaneously provide SIM card information for multiple SIM cards to the monitored mobile device. While denominated as with the term SIM herein such designation is not intended to be limited to GSM implementations. Rather the term subscriber identity module and acronym SIM are intended to cover any media that stores identity information that uniquely identifies a wireless communications voice and or data services subscriber.

Web server may be provided by a Mobile Device Testing Service not shown associated with the Mobile Device Monitoring System and is communicatively coupled to the Mobile Device Monitoring System via networks and or a local connection. In the depicted embodiment the Web server provides for client use in interacting with the monitored mobile device a Graphical User Interface GUI a command line processor and an API . The provided GUI includes an input action recorder such as may be used to record a sequence of actions performed with user selectable controls not shown of the GUI. For example a client accessing the monitored mobile device via the provided GUI may be enabled using input action recorder to save a sequence of actions performed with such user selectable controls by associating the sequence of actions with a particular identifier subsequently the saved input sequence may be played or otherwise provided to monitored mobile device or one or more other monitored mobile devices such as may be communicatively coupled to one or more additional MDCI and or CIC units not shown that may be associated with Web server as part of testing those devices either by the client that originally saved the input sequence or by some other client or entity. In the depicted embodiment of the GUI includes a command line interface to allow client users of the Web server to enter individual commands or command sequences for example commands corresponding to various function calls of the API . The Web server additionally includes a command line processor to interpret the individual commands or command sequences entered by the client users using command line interface such that input actions corresponding to the interpreted commands or command sequences are provided to monitored mobile device via input processing manager of the CIC . In at least some embodiments either or both of the command line processor and API may be provided as part of the CIC rather than the Web server or may be provided in some other appropriate manner.

The environment of also includes one or more client devices such as may be used by one or more client users not shown of a Mobile Device Testing Service associated with Mobile Device Monitoring System . Client devices may include as non exclusive examples a computing system portable email device personal digital assistant cell phone smart phone satellite phone palmtop computing device laptop tablet computing device or other appropriate network accessible device. In certain embodiments at least some of the client devices may optionally include a GUI and or API such as may be provided by one or more applications executing on the relevant client device. For example in certain embodiments a Mobile Device Testing Service associated with the Mobile Device Monitoring System may provide one or more applications for execution on client devices to enable client users of those client devices to interact with monitored mobile device or other mobile devices monitored by the Mobile Device Testing Service. In other embodiments one or more client devices may interact with Web server via networks to access functionality provided by the Web server including functionality provided by GUI command line processor and or API .

In the illustrated example of the GUI interface includes particular display portions and user selectable controls that may be presented to an authorized user to enable the user to select and define various manners by which the CIC interacts with a monitored mobile device. In some embodiments the GUI interface may be provided to the authorized user via one or more client computing devices associated with the authorized user such as one of client computing systems of and or client devices of . In addition in some embodiments some or all of the GUI interface may further be available via one or more Web sites e.g. a Web site of associated with a Mobile Device Testing Service not shown and may be provided to the authorized user via a Web browser or other software once the authorized user has been identified as being authorized. The identification of a user as being authorized may occur in various manners such as based on concurrent or prior login activities based on information associated with the client computing device in use by the user e.g. identifying information about the device and or its location such as an IP address or a MAC address or identifying information previously stored on the device such as a browser cookie or other manner. Although in the description below the user of the GUI is described as a remote user it will be appreciated that in certain embodiments and situations one or more users of the GUI may interact with a monitored mobile device via the GUI or other interface provided locally such as if the user is located at a geographical location shared by the CIC system the monitored mobile device and or the Mobile Device Communications Interface communicatively coupled to both.

The GUI as depicted includes a main interface window and a command line interface window . In certain embodiments a user of the GUI may be presented with only a subset of the interface windows depicted in . In other embodiments other interface windows such as those described below with respect to or other interface windows not currently depicted may be presented to such a user depending upon the functionality desired by and or made available to that user. Additionally or alternatively the interface windows may be presented on a contextual basis depending on a context of current or previous user interactions. For example as described below the main interface window includes various user selectable controls for interacting with a monitored mobile device such as the monitored mobile device depicted in and one or more of those various user selectable controls may provide the user with an opportunity to further interact with the monitored mobile device using one or more distinct interface windows that are presented only after the user selects the relevant control within main interface window . In at least some embodiments additional interface windows may be presented to a user of the GUI that are not dependent upon the selection of controls within the main interface window . It will be appreciated that other types of user selectable controls may be provided in other manners in other embodiments including to enable or display types of interactions with a monitored mobile device or with other provided interfaces.

In the depicted embodiment the main interface window includes an illustrated device representing the mobile device currently being monitored and communicatively coupled to a Communications Interface Controller such as CIC of with which a user not shown is remotely interacting via the GUI a mobile device display device data display device controls touch mode control image video controls audio interaction controls and application controls .

The mobile device display may display in real time the video output of the corresponding display screen of the monitored mobile device represented by illustrated device . In the depiction of the mobile device display currently displays a status bar at or near the top of the mobile device display as well as various icons buttons and other visual indications of controls displayed by the monitored mobile device. In at least some embodiments the mobile device display is presented to a remote user in a manner and with parameters substantially identical to that with which the display output of the monitored mobile device is captured. For example as noted above the display output of the monitored mobile device may be in at least some embodiments captured at a resolution frame rate and color depth identical to that which is provided by the display of the monitored mobile device e.g. by video capture module of MDCI in . Depending on the capabilities of the computing device or other device on which the GUI is displayed to the remote user the mobile device display may be displayed to the remote user using the captured resolution frame rate and color depth. In other embodiments and situations the remote user may be interacting with GUI using a computing device or other device with capabilities that do not support such video parameters or may lack the network bandwidth needed to support video displayed using such parameters. In some such embodiments the captured video output data from the monitored mobile device may be automatically transcoded such as by transcoding module of CIC in for real time display to the remote user via the mobile device display . In other such embodiments a user may be presented with one or more configuration options related to the video parameters for use in displaying the display output of the monitored mobile device via the mobile device display .

In at least some embodiments the mobile device display may correspond to a touchscreen of the monitored mobile device and the remote user may interact with the monitored mobile device by interacting with the mobile device display . For example if the GUI is displayed to the remote user using a typical computing device that includes a mouse trackpad or other pointing device the remote user may interact with the mobile device display by moving a displayed cursor of the computing device with the pointing device and clicking on the mobile device display such as on one or more buttons or other user selectable controls of the monitored mobile device currently displayed by the mobile device display . In certain embodiments and situations if the GUI is displayed to the remote user using a computing device equipped with a touchscreen the remote user may interact with the monitored mobile device by interacting with the mobile device display in a manner substantially identical to that which would be utilized directly with the monitored mobile device.

It will be appreciated that the monitored mobile device corresponding to illustrated device may not include a touchscreen such as if the monitored mobile device includes a non touch enabled display screen and one or more physical buttons or similar actuators to support user interaction with the monitored mobile device. In at least some embodiments the main interface window may therefore display one or more user selectable controls corresponding to each of the one or more physical buttons or related actuators on the monitored mobile device either as part of mobile device display or elsewhere.

Device data is depicted within the main interface window and below the illustrated device . The device data includes information specific to the mobile device currently being monitored and corresponding to the illustrated device . In the depicted embodiment device data includes identifiers corresponding to the manufacturer of the monitored mobile device the model or name of the monitored mobile device the serial number S N of the monitored mobile device and the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity IMEI number of the monitored mobile device. In other embodiments other information related to the monitored mobile device may be displayed as part of device data and certain information depicted in the embodiment of may be altered or omitted. A non exclusive list of examples of the types of information that may be displayed as part of device data or elsewhere within the GUI include a name and or version number of an operating system of the monitored mobile device one or more IP addresses such as one or more public or private network addresses of the monitored mobile device a name or other information related to a current cellular service provider associated with the monitored mobile device information related to one or more users or service subscribers associated with the monitored mobile device a telephone number associated with the monitored mobile device a geographical location associated with the monitored mobile device available services and or levels of service signal strengths voltage current and or charge levels etc.

Device controls in the depicted embodiment include a power control such as may correspond to a power button or related actuator on the monitored mobile device a battery control enabling a remote user to simulate the act of removing and or inserting a battery into the monitored mobile device and which in some embodiments may additionally provide a visual indication of a current battery level of the monitored mobile device USB control which may in certain embodiments enable the installation of various software on the monitored mobile device the emulation of various tethering functionality related to operations of the monitored mobile device the use of the monitored mobile device as a storage device or combination of such functionality and SIM control which enables remote users of the GUI to select from multiple SIM cards to use with the monitored mobile device. In certain embodiments for example selecting SIM control may result in displaying an additional interface window not shown to the remote user allowing the user to manually select from multiple SIM cards made available via the CIC system for provision to the monitored mobile device as if that particular SIM card were locally inserted into the monitored mobile device. Additionally the SIM control may enable one or more remote users to emulate the removal of a SIM card previously coupled to the monitored mobile device such as if it is desirable to observe the behavior of the monitored mobile device while no SIM card is present.

Touch mode control enables a remote user to select one of several modes available for interacting with the mobile device display . In the depicted embodiment the modes available for user selection include Normal Swipe and Tap. In certain embodiments a Normal mode indicates that actions of the remote user such as interactions made via mouse trackpad touchscreen or other pointing device locally available to the remote user are treated as directly analogous to actions made to the corresponding touchscreen of the monitored mobile device. For example a selection or click with a mouse or other pointing device at particular coordinates of the mobile device display may result in a tap input action being provided to the monitored mobile device using the corresponding coordinates of a display of the monitored mobile device. Similarly a click and drag action using a pointing device of the remote user between two coordinate points on the mobile device display may result in a swipe input action between the corresponding coordinate points on the display of the monitored mobile device. In at least some embodiments the Swipe mode of touch mode control when selected provides an indication to the associated CIC system that all remote user interactions with mobile device display are to be provided to the monitored mobile device as swipe input actions. For example while Swipe mode is selected two successive selections of distinct coordinate points on the mobile device display may be interpreted as a swipe input action occurring between those distinct coordinate points rather than as successive tap input actions such as may be provided to the monitored mobile device if the Normal mode was selected by a user via touch mode control . Similarly in certain embodiments the Tap mode of touch mode control when selected provides an indication to the associated CIC system that all remote user interactions with mobile device display are to be provided to the monitored mobile device as tap input actions. In Tap mode for example a click and drag action using a pointing device of the remote user between two coordinate points on the mobile device display may be provided to the monitored mobile device as a single tap input action performed using the first of those two coordinate points. In other embodiments and situations other modes may be available to a remote user via the touch mode control . For example additional modes made available via touch mode control may enable a remote user to emulate multi digit operations of the monitored mobile device such as two finger pinch to zoom functionality three finger swipe functionality or other functionality of the monitored mobile device that typically involves the use of multiple digits in a simultaneous manner. Furthermore in certain embodiments and situations touch mode control may be disabled or omitted from the main interface window entirely such as if the monitored mobile device does not include a display screen with touch capabilities etc. .

In the embodiment depicted in image video interaction controls include video capture control and screen capture control . Video capture control enables a remote user to select a portion of the video output displayed by mobile device display for local capture and storage. In certain embodiments invoking video capture control begins local capture and storage of the output of the mobile device display invoking the video capture control again may end the local capturing and prompt the remote user for a filename and or location to use for storing a local copy of the captured video data. In at least some embodiments the video data stored in this manner may include the full resolution frame rate color depth and other video parameters of the display output of the monitored mobile device captured by the CIC system regardless of whether such output has been transcoding for real time display on the mobile device display . In other embodiments the stored video data may share the video parameters of the video data transcoded for display by mobile device display . In certain embodiments the remote user may select various parameters for the video data captured and stored via video capture control and may do so independently of such parameters for other video data such as the video data captured by the CIC system or if transcoded provided by the mobile device display . In certain embodiments audio output of the monitored mobile device is captured and stored along with any video data captured using the video capture control in other embodiments the remote user may provide one or more configuration settings to allow the CIC system or GUI to determine whether audio output will be stored with the captured video data.

In a manner similar to that described for video capture control screen capture control enables the remote user to locally store captured images corresponding to the display of mobile device display at the time the user invokes the screen capture control. In certain embodiments such captured images may retain the resolution and color depth captured by the CIC system from the monitored mobile device. In other embodiments if the mobile device display displays video transcoded for display on the remote user s computing device images captured by invoking the screen capture control may be stored using the resolution and color depth provided by the transcoded video data and in at least some embodiments the remote user may select various parameters such as resolution and color depth independently of such parameters as presented by the mobile device display.

Additionally in at least some embodiments the command line interface window enables various logging functionality related to output from the monitored mobile device either resulting from commands entered via the command line interface window or otherwise. For example in an embodiment the session log may display a record of commands entered via command entry line . In certain embodiments the session log may additionally display output from the monitored mobile device responsive to such entered commands or display additional text based output from the monitored mobile device. In certain embodiments the remote user may provide one or more configuration settings such as by invoking configuration control of the main interface window related to the amount of information to be displayed by the session log . For example the session log may be configured to display textual information related to all interactions made with the mobile device display or all user input actions provided to the monitored mobile device regardless of whether those input actions were provided as a result of interactions with the GUI or otherwise. In the example illustrated by the session log includes a timestamp indication of the time at which the current interactive session began followed by two commands entered via command entry line tap.coords 110 245 and swipe.coords 160 1083 160 425 and the timestamps and textual output respectively associated with each of those two entered commands 15 36 43.789 tap 110 245 and 15 37 02.546 swipe 160 1083 160 425 . Also in the depicted embodiment the window controls include Save and Close controls such as may be selected by the remote user to locally store the contents of the session log or close the command line interface window respectively.

The snapshot bar includes a series of thumbnail images corresponding to images captured of the primary display associated with the current monitored mobile device such as that displayed by mobile device display . Each thumbnail image is associated with a snapshot time index indicating a time index at which the associated screen image was captured such as in the illustrated embodiment relative to the time at which execution of a particular script was initiated . In certain embodiments the thumbnail images may be captured at automatic intervals responsive to particular actions or commands within the executing script responsive to particular output provided by the monitored mobile device manually triggered by the current user or some appropriate combination of any or all of these. In at least some embodiments the current user may select one or more of the thumbnail images for various purposes for example to begin execution of a script at a point that corresponds to the selected thumbnail image or to interact with portions of a script corresponding to one or more selected thumbnail images such as to save extract execute or delete such portions independently of those portions corresponding to thumbnail images that are not selected by the user.

The resource panel includes resource filter tabs and resource listing and provides a list of resources for use in creating scripts or input action sequences related to one or more monitored mobile devices. In certain embodiments such resources may include for example OCR or Image resource types such as may be used to respectively identify textual or image based display output with which a defined script may interact. For example a listed image resource may indicate one or more portions of display output that may be used as a trigger for various actions provided as part of the defined script such that when a portion of the mobile device display output matches the image resource e.g. when matched by the bitmap matching module of one or more input actions are initiated based on such output. Similarly a listed OCR resource may be used to trigger various defined script actions when textual data matching the OCR resource is detected as part of the mobile device display output e.g. by the OCR module of . In certain embodiments by selecting a particular resource listed within the resource listing a user may insert one or more textual commands for use within editing panel . As one example by positioning a selection cursor not shown within the editing panel and then selecting the calculator menu resource within the resource listing one or more commands may be inserted for use within the editing panel that when executed cause input actions to be provided to the current monitored mobile device that initiate the display of a menu within a calculator application on the monitored mobile device. Such commands may be edited by the user via the editing panel or included within a script without revision.

In the illustrated example of the Script panel mode selection tab is currently selected such that the editing panel is currently displayed. The editing panel includes the text of the current script loaded into memory by the user for editing and or execution. In at least some embodiments and as noted above with respect to command line interface window input actions that may be provided to the monitored mobile device via the main interface window may also be provided via one or more textual commands such as by using the command line interface window or the editing panel .

Specific Example of Operation Defining and Using an Input Action Sequence via a Provided Graphical Interface

As one specific example of operations enabled by the GUI elements of as provided by a Mobile Device Testing Service in conjunction with a Mobile Device Monitoring System such as the Mobile Device Monitoring System depicted in a remote user may define a sequence of user input actions to be provided to one or more monitored mobile devices at a later time. Such may for example be part of a testing program designed to determine the cause of one or more application crashes when a particular application program is used on various models of mobile devices. For instance suppose that the remote user has received multiple end user reports that a particular application XXYY routinely crashes on a particular model of mobile device if the mobile device receives audio input such as one or more voice commands while application XXYY is executing on the mobile device. For the sake of brevity with respect to the description of the operations below assume that a relevant model of mobile device having a primary touch enabled display that is currently powered off is being monitored by the Communications Interface Controller of the Mobile Device Monitoring System via a Mobile Device Communications Interface communicatively coupled to the monitored mobile device and that the remote user desiring to define the input action sequence has successfully accessed a Web server provided by the Mobile Device Testing Service that is displaying a graphical user interface substantially similar to the GUI depicted in .

The remote user interacts with the GUI using a client device associated with the remote user that includes a mouse type pointing device and sufficient bandwidth and display capabilities to display video output of the monitored mobile device according to the parameters of the primary display of the monitored mobile device in particular the associated client device has capabilities such that the full resolution frame rate and color depth of the monitored mobile device s primary display are provided to the remote user via GUI and mobile device display . However because the monitored mobile device is currently powered off the mobile device display currently provides no information.

In order to begin recording the input actions provided to the monitored mobile device the remote user first invokes the script manager control by using the client pointing device to select the script manager control initiating the display of script manager interface window as depicted in . The remote user then similarly invokes the script recording control initiating the recording of subsequent input actions performed via the main interface window . Optionally the remote user may also determine that the display output of the monitored mobile device should be locally captured and stored for testing purposes and may therefore additionally use the client pointing device to invoke the video capture control and thus initiate capturing real time video data corresponding to output of mobile device display . In at least some embodiments if the remote user does decide to invoke the video capture control that user action is recorded by the script manager to become the first input action in the input action sequence to be defined. In other embodiments as the act of initiating the local capture of the video data is not provided to the monitored mobile device the selection of the video capture control may not be recorded.

As a first interaction with the monitored mobile device via GUI the remote user uses the client pointing device to select power control . Invoking the power control initiates the sending of an indication to the input processing manager of the CIC system which in turn sends an indication to the power interface of the MDCI that the monitored mobile device is to be powered ON in a manner substantially identical to that which would be received by the monitored mobile device if a local user activated the power button on the monitored mobile device. Responsive to the signal provided by the power interface the monitored mobile device provides power and display signals to a primary display of the monitored mobile device. These signals are captured by the A V capture interface of the MDCI communicatively coupled to the monitored mobile device and the A V capture interface translates those captured signals to video data that it then provides to the output processing manager of the CIC system. In real time the CIC system provides this video data to the Mobile Device Testing Service s Web server which displays the captured video data to the remote user via GUI and mobile device display . In this manner the remote user turns the primary display of the monitored mobile device ON and views the display output of the monitored mobile device in real time as its display is activated.

The remote user notes that touch mode control indicates that the GUI is operating in Normal touch mode and therefore proceeds to navigate the mobile device display using the client pointing device in a manner similar to that with which the user would locally operate a touchscreen of the monitored mobile device with a finger or other digit. Each interaction of the remote user with mobile device display is recorded by the script manager and provided to the input processing manager of the CIC system and to the monitored mobile device via the touch input decoder of the MDCI s I O interface. Simultaneously video output data of the monitored mobile device is captured via a separate channel of the MDCI by the A V capture interface and provided to the GUI via the output processing manager of the CIC system for display to the remote user via mobile device display and in certain embodiments and situations textually via session log and or the playback output panel . In this manner the remote user may initiate the execution of one or more application programs on the monitored mobile device other than application XXYY such as to first test the providing of audio input to the monitored mobile device while executing applications other than that which was reported as routinely crashing. For example the remote user may use the local client pointing device to select or click an application icon associated with application ABC resulting in a corresponding tap input action being provided to the monitored mobile device and being recorded by the script manager to execute that application wait for a display screen associated with application ABC to be displayed on the mobile device display and then invoke audio playback control to provide audio input in the form of one or more verbal commands e.g. a voice initiated search function or other spoken command to the monitored mobile device while that device is executing application ABC. In a similar manner the remote user may choose to execute and provide audio input to one or more applications other than application XXYY or application ABC prior to executing and providing audio input to application XXYY for testing purposes.

A variety of other tests of the monitored mobile device may be performed by the remote user as part of the recorded input action sequence to be defined. For example the remote user may determine that the testing of future monitored mobile devices may be improved by utilizing multiple SIM cards during such testing such as may correspond to multiple cellular service providers and may therefore invoke SIM control while recording the input action sequence to simulate extracting and inserting one or more SIM cards from and to the monitored mobile device. Such input actions are recorded by the script manager and provided to the monitored mobile device via the input processing manager of the CIC system and the SIM interface of the MDCI. As another example the remote user may determine to utilize a command line interface of the GUI to provide one or more input actions to the monitored mobile device using text based commands and therefore invoke command line interface control to display command line interface window for that purpose. In at least some embodiments input actions recorded via the script manager may be textually displayed by the editing panel of as such input actions are interactively provided by the user via the main interface window

Once the remote user is satisfied that the input actions needed to perform tests on future monitored mobile devices have been performed and recorded he or she may again invoke the script recording control to stop recording input actions performed via the main interface window . In order to define the input action sequence corresponding to the input actions recorded during the current session the remote user selects the save script control allowing the user to enter an identifier such as a filename for the input action sequence and to persistently save the input action sequence as a script for future use. In order to provide the input action sequence to the current monitored mobile device the remote user may select the open script control to select the saved script file and Open the script containing the recorded input action sequence and invoke script playback control to begin playback of the recorded input action sequence.

In certain embodiments a single defined script or input action sequence may be simultaneously or concurrently provided to a plurality of monitored mobile devices in an automated manner using a corresponding plurality of mobile device communications interfaces that are communicatively coupled to one or more communications interface controllers. In this manner an input action sequence defined by a single remote user or other client of an associated Mobile Device Testing Service may be used to concurrently test dozens or hundreds of mobile devices under varied but controlled conditions and circumstances. In at least some embodiments the CIC system and or mobile device testing service may facilitate such use of defined scripts or input action sequences by allowing the user to import and or export scripts and associated resources using the script manager interface such as by invoking the import script control or export script control of or in some other manner .

The interface controller system manager interacts with the client computing systems and the other computing systems over the network using the network connection e.g. via the Internet and or the World Wide Web cell network telephone network etc. . In particular users of client computing systems may interact with the CIC system in order to perform various interactions with one or more of the monitored mobile devices e.g. providing one or more input actions or defined input sequences and observing the resulting output via mobile device interfaces such as by using application program e.g. a Web browser or custom application executed by CPU and in memory to use mobile device information e.g. information about one or more of the monitored mobile devices and their associated capabilities etc. of storage .

In addition the functionality provided by the discussed CIC system modules may in some embodiments be combined in fewer modules or distributed in additional modules.

Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that while various items are discussed or illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them can be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity.

The routine begins at block in which the routine receives an indication that a connection with a mobile device to be monitored has been made such as by communicatively coupling the mobile device to a Mobile Device Communications Interface e.g. MDCI in or MDCI in . The routine then proceeds to block to begin capturing output data from the monitored mobile device via the MDCI. Captured output data is provided to one or more client devices such as over one or more intermediate networks e.g. the Internet and may in some embodiments be stored using one or more storage devices communicatively coupled to the CIC system. In block the routine may optionally initiate an interactive testing mode of the CIC system such as to support one or more input actions that may be interactively provided by the client or clients to which captured output data is being provided. The routine then proceeds to block in which an indication is received of one or more input actions intended for the monitored mobile device and then to block to determine the type of indicated input action s received.

If it is determined in block that a defined input sequence has been received the routine proceeds to block to optionally initiate an input sequence testing mode of the CIC system. For example in certain embodiments the CIC system may determine to defer or even ignore interactive input actions that are received from one or more clients while operating in the input sequence testing mode. In other embodiments the CIC system may allow such interactive input actions while the received defined input sequence is still being provided to the monitored mobile device but only under certain conditions or using defined e.g. previously defined criteria for accepting such interactive input actions. As one example while operating in the input sequence testing mode the CIC system may prevent the monitored mobile device from receiving interactive input actions that are provided by a client using a GUI provided by the CIC system or associated computing device but allow the monitored mobile device to receive such interactive input actions when provided by a client using a command line interface.

After block the routine proceeds to block and provides one or more input actions included in the received input sequence to the monitored mobile device in accordance with the parameters and actions defined within the received input sequence. As one example the received defined input sequence may include multiple input actions to be provided to the monitored mobile device at determined e.g. previously determined times or at specified regular intervals regardless of the output received from the monitored mobile device. As another example one or more of the multiple input actions included in the received defined input sequence may be provided to the monitored mobile device only upon detection of particular expected output that is received from the monitored mobile device such as may be detected by bitmap matching module or OCR module in in response to one or more earlier input actions of the defined input sequence. In this manner an input sequence provided to the mobile device in an automated manner may emulate user interactions with the monitored mobile device. After the providing of the one or more input actions to the monitored mobile device the routine proceeds to block to determine if the entire received defined input sequence has been provided to the monitored mobile device. If not the routine returns to block to provide additional input actions included in the received input sequence to the monitored mobile device in accordance with the parameters and actions defined within the received input sequence. If it is determined that the received defined input sequence has been provided to the monitored mobile device the routine proceeds to block .

If it was determined in block that the received indication of one or more input actions for the monitored mobile device are the result of interactive user input such as via a GUI or command line interface provided by the CIC system or associated Mobile Device Testing Service the routine proceeds to block to determine if a defined input sequence is currently in progress that is whether the CIC system has earlier received an indication of a defined input sequence which has not yet been completely provided to the monitored mobile device. If a defined input sequence is currently in progress the routine proceeds to block to determine whether to abort the providing of that defined input sequence to the monitored mobile device. For example in certain embodiments and configurations the CIC system may have previously determined such as based on one or more configuration parameters provided by one or more users of the CIC system to assign interactive user input actions a higher priority than defined input sequences and may therefore determine in block that the defined input sequence currently in progress should be aborted.

If it is determined that the defined input sequence currently in progress should be aborted the routine proceeds to block and aborts the providing of the defined testing sequence to the monitored mobile device either permanently or in a manner that allows the CIC system to defer and or reschedule the providing of some or all of the input actions included in the defined input sequence to the monitored mobile device. The routine then proceeds to block to optionally initiate an interactive testing mode of the CIC system in a manner similar to that described above with respect to block . For example in certain embodiments and configurations the determination in block to cancel the existing defined input sequence may indicate that it is also appropriate to prevent the initiating of any additional defined input sequences either for a predefined period of time until particular configuration information is received from one or more users of the CIC system or until some other appropriate time. The routine then proceeds to block in which the received interactive user input action is provided to the monitored mobile device.

If it was determined in block not to cancel the defined input sequence the routine proceeds to block to optionally provide the received interactive input action to the monitored mobile device. As described above for example if in block it was determined to initiate an input sequence testing mode after receiving the defined input sequence currently being provided to the monitored mobile device the received interactive user input action may be ignored or deferred until the defined input sequence in progress has been completely provided to the monitored mobile device. In certain embodiments the CIC system may use one or more buffers to queue one or more interactive input actions deferred in this manner for providing those interactive input actions to the monitored mobile device at a later time. As another example the routine in block may determine to provide the received interactive user input action to the monitored mobile device as part of the defined input sequence is still being provided to the monitored mobile device either interleaved with input actions included in the defined input sequence concurrently with one or more input actions of the defined input sequence or in some other manner. After block the routine proceeds to block to determine whether the entire defined input sequence has been provided to the monitored mobile device.

If it was determined in block that the received defined input sequences been provided to the monitored mobile device or if the received interactive input action was provided to the monitored mobile device in block the routine proceeds to block to determine whether the capture of data from the monitored mobile device shall continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate or indication that the monitored mobile device has been or shall be uncoupled from the corresponding MDCI is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block to optionally initiate an interactive testing mode for the monitored mobile device and then to block to await additional input actions to be provided to the monitored mobile device. Otherwise the routine proceeds to block and ends.
