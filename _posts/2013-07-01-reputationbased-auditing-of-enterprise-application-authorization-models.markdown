Modern communications technologies provide numerous opportunities for individuals and organizations to communicate with others in electronic environments. Social networks for example allow individual organizations to communicate with groups of individuals and even the general public. Web sites and other electronic information resources often allow members of the public to provide their own content such as product reviews opinions on certain topics technical assistance photographs audio files video files and other types of content. In addition the diverse ways in which modern communication technologies operate provide opportunities to gain valuable intelligence that would not otherwise be as freely available. For instance social networks often allow users to mutually associate themselves with one another. This allows for example the collection of information not only about an individual but other individuals who have some sort of relationship with the individual. As such effective use of such communications have the potential to have significant positive effects for the conduct of one s business.

At the same time the ability to freely communicate using modern technologies has the potential to cause significant harmful effects on one s business. For instance the conduct of an individual in a public forum can shape others opinion of an organization associated with the individual. While this can be a positive effect in many instances unsavory and or unpopular behavior of the individual can negatively affect the organization. For instance if an employee of a company uses excessive amounts of profanity and provides negative opinions of his or her employer in public forums the company can suffer reputational harm thereby affecting the company s good will with the general public. As another example if the employee publicly posts information related to confidential dealings of the company the company can find itself addressing various legal issues such as securities laws violations. Thus while modern communications provide numerous opportunities for an organization such opportunities are not without significant risks.

Embodiments of the invention provide systems and methods for reputation based auditing of enterprise application authorized models. Reputation metrics can be used to gauge risk of individuals to an organization such as employees of a business. The reputation metrics may be calculated from both internal and external data sources including social network profiles of the individuals. Calculations of risk can be used to make determinations regarding the activities the individuals are authorized to engage in.

Stated another way managing authorization policies of an enterprise based on reputation auditing of employees of the enterprise can comprise obtaining information associated with an employee of the enterprise from each of a plurality of data sources. The plurality of data sources can include at least one data source internal to the enterprise and at least one data source external to the enterprise. Stored reputation information for the employee can be accessed the reputation information including one or more reputation metrics. The one or more reputation metrics can indicate an influence of the employee to a risk to the enterprise associated with the employee. The one or more reputation metrics for the employee can be updated based on the obtained information and a determination can be made as to whether to update one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee. The one or more authorization policies of the enterprise can be updated based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee. For example updating the one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee can comprise increasing an amount of activities in which the employee is allowed to engage when updating the one or more reputation metrics for the employee based on the obtained information results in an increase in the one or more reputation metrics. Additionally or alternatively updating the one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee can comprise decreasing an amount of activities in which the employee is allowed to engage when updating the one or more reputation metrics for the employee based on the obtained information results in a decrease in the one or more reputation metrics.

According to one embodiment determining whether to update one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee can comprise calculating a risk score for the employee using the stored one or more reputation metrics calculating a risk score for the employee using the updated one or more reputation metrics comparing the risk score calculated using the stored one or more reputation metrics and the risk score calculated using the updated one or more reputation metrics and determining to update the one or more authorization policies of the enterprise when said comparing indicates a change in the risk scores that exceeds a threshold amount. Additionally or alternatively determining whether to update one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee can comprise calculating a risk score for the employee using the stored one or more reputation metrics calculating a risk score for the employee using the updated one or more reputation metrics making a numerical estimate of a derivative of the risk score calculated using the stored one or more reputation metrics and the risk score calculated using the updated one or more reputation metrics and determining to update the one or more authorization policies of the enterprise when the numerical estimate of the derivative of the risk scores indicates a change in the risk scores that exceeds a threshold amount. According to yet another embodiment determining whether to update one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee can additionally or alternatively comprise generating a user interface including an indication of a change in risk associated with the employee based on updating the one or more reputation metrics for the employee presenting the user interface to a user receiving from the user through the user interface an indication of an update to the authorization policies of the enterprise and updating the one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the received indication. Additionally or alternatively determining whether to update one or more authorization policies of the enterprise based at least in part on the updated one or more reputation metrics for the employee can comprise accessing a credit score of the employee and calculating at least one of the one or more reputation metrics based on the credit score of the employee.

In the following description various embodiments of the present invention will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

The reputation data processing system may be operated by an organization or on behalf of the organization. As such external data sources may be computer systems serving as a source of data where the computer systems are operated by and or on behalf of entities different from the organization. Similarly internal data sources may be computer systems serving as sources of data where the computer systems are operated by and or on behalf of the organization. It should be noted that the various data sources internal and external may be hosted in various ways. For example one or more of the internal data sources may be hosted by the organization itself such as in a data center or other facility of the organization. One or more of the internal data sources may be hosted by third parties. For example one or more of the internal data sources may operate using facilities and hardware of a third party yet may be programmatically managed by or on behalf of the organization. The hosting of external data sources may also vary in these ways.

Turning to the external data sources example data sources include social network systems . A social networking system may be a publicly accessible computer system having users from the general public. The term computer system unless otherwise contradicted explicitly or by context is intended to encompass both single computer instances e.g. a single server and multiple computer system instances such as a network of computer system instances that collectively operate to achieve a result. Further a computer system may also encompass multiple computer system instances that span multiple geographic regions and or data center facilities. Returning to an example social networking system the users of the social networking system may have accounts and corresponding profiles with the social network systems and may engage in social networking activities. Example social networking activities include communicating electronically with other users of a social network system either privately or publicly expressing interest in content and or associating profiles with other profiles of the social network system which may be pursuant to mutual acceptance of the association by corresponding users. Specific examples of social networking systems include Facebook Twitter MySpace and others. Some specific examples of social networking activities in the Facebook social network system include friending other users posting content on another s wall liking content and or other users public or private messaging un friending other users sharing content and other activities. Example activities in the Twitter social network system include following other users being followed by other users tweeting re tweeting and the like.

Generally any suitable external data source may be used in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. For example as illustrated in various websites with user influenced content may also serve as external data sources for the reputation data processing system . A website with user influenced content may be any public information resource in which content is associated with users of the website. An example website may be an online forum in which users of the forum submit messages for other users to see. Another example of a suitable website is an electronic marketplace in which users of the electronic marketplace are able to electronically provide feedback for other users of the electronic marketplace. For example one user may purchase a product or otherwise have knowledge of the product and may provide an electronic review of the product for other users to see in connection with their purchasing decisions.

As with external data sources internal data sources may comprise one or more computer systems serving as an internal source of data for the reputation data processing system . Typically organizations utilize various computer systems in connection with management of their operations. An organization for example may utilize various computer systems for accounting human resources talent management customer relationship management internal social networking internal information sources e.g. internal websites and the like. shows some illustrative examples of suitable internal data sources in accordance with an embodiment. For example as shown in the internal data sources include a human resource management system which may be a computer system configured to perform various operations in connection with management of an organization s human resource needs.

The human resource management may for example maintain data about employees of the organization and may allow administrators to update add and or remove data for employees of the organization as the set of employees of the organization changes over time. Another example of a suitable internal data source is a defect and enhancement request tracking system . A defect and enhancement request tracking system may be a computer system which tracks various issues with products and or services of the organization. For example if the organization is a software company the defect and enhancement request tracking system may enable employees to submit information identifying issues with the software otherwise known as bugs. The defect and enhancement request tracking system may also enable employees to submit information regarding bugs of internal computer systems used by the organization and not necessarily sold to others. For example an employee may notice a broken link on an internal web page of the organization and as a result may submit a ticket which may then be processed by another employee of the organization who may update the internal website accordingly.

As illustrated in the internal data sources also include an internal social network system . The internal social network system may not be publicly accessible. That is the universe of users of the internal social network system may be limited such as to employees of the organization certain employees of the organization and or individuals and or computer systems to which the organization has provided authorization. As an example the internal social network system may be accessible to employees of the organization and certain vendors of the organization such as attorneys working in law firms for the organization. It should be noted and understood that while referred to here as an internal social network system this system may or may not be hosted internally. That is it may actually be a hosted outside the company but have a limited universe of employees i.e. accessible by internal people.

Also as illustrated in the internal data sources include a talent management system . A talent management system may be a computer system configured to enable employees of the organization to perform various operations in connection with ensuring that the organization has appropriate personnel. For example an employee of the organization may utilize the talent management system to track individuals who are engaged in the hiring process of the organization and or to locate candidates for open positions. The talent management system may maintain resumes may perform automated processing of received resumes and the like. Example talent management systems include those offered under the brand name Taleo. It should be noted and understood that this system might be hosted elsewhere but would considered internal in the sense that only internal people have access to this system.

As noted above numerous variations of the environment are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example while shows various illustrative examples of external data sources and internal data sources numerous embodiments of the present disclosure may have more or fewer data sources than those explicitly illustrated.

Turning to the reputation data processing system in an embodiment the system includes multiple components. For example as illustrated in the reputation data processing system includes a connector framework . The connector framework of the reputation data processing system may be a component e.g. separate computer system instance s or programming module configured to enable the reputation data processing system to obtain data from the external data sources and internal data sources . The connector framework may for example operate according to programming logic that enables the connector framework to obtain data from numerous different data sources and combine the data in a manner suitable for processing by the reputation data processing system such as described below.

For example many of the external data sources and or internal data sources may provide data that is organized in different ways. The connector framework may include programming logic to extract data and store data from multiple sources in a common manner such as in accordance with a common data storage schema. The connector framework may obtain data from the various data sources in numerous ways. For example in an embodiment the connector framework is configured to obtain data from the various data sources according to application programming interfaces APIs of the various systems. For example a social network system may include an API for obtaining data available in the API. The connector framework may include programming logic for making API calls in a manner acceptable to the social network system. Different social network systems may have different APIs and the connector framework may be configured appropriately to obtain data from the different sources.

The connector framework may also be configured to obtain data in other ways. For example data posted on web pages may be obtained by downloading web pages or other documents of the data source. For instance a website may correspond to a domain name. The connector framework may enable the reputation data processing system to obtain a web page or other document by using the URL. The connector framework may analyze and receive documents and store data accordingly. The connector framework may also utilize various screen scraping techniques and generally any technique in which data from a data source may be obtained.

As noted above the connector framework in an embodiment enables the reputation data processing system to obtain data from various different sources and store the data according to a common schema or generally in a manner suitable for use by the reputation data processing system. In an embodiment as illustrated in the data received through the connector framework is stored by the reputation data processing system into a reputation database . The reputation database may be any data storage mechanism that enables the reputation data processing system to operate in accordance with the various embodiments described herein.

The reputation database may for example be a relational database comprising a computer system that utilizes storage to store data in multiple tables where the tables associate some of the data with other data. For example a table may associate an identifier of an employee with data collected about the employee such as data regarding the employee s activity in a social network and or other electronic environment. According to some embodiments much of the collected data can be stored in a triple store aka a graph database and the remainder in a relational database. In such a mixed model data can be stored based on how it will be analyzed later i.e. it can be stored where future analysis will be most efficient. Once data is obtained from multiple sources and stored in the reputation database a reasoner of the reputation data processing system may process data accessed from the reputation database . The reasoner accordingly may be a component of the reputation data processing system that is configured to analyze data from the reputation database in accordance with the various embodiments described herein.

The reasoner may for example analyze data from the reputation database in order to determine an individual influence based on the data that was obtained about the individual. Similarly the reasoner may be used to decide which data is stored persistently in the reputation database . For example the connector framework in an embodiment may obtain more data than is necessary and or desirable for use in accordance with the various embodiments. The reasoner may accordingly analyze data to determine whether to discard the data or store the data in the reputation database .

In an embodiment the environment includes a reputation management user interface which enables users of the reputation data processing system to engage in various activities such as by defining data analysis for the data processing system to perform specifying data sources and which data is to be obtained from the specified data sources specifying parameters for maintaining data e.g. how much data to store for each user how to determine which data to keep and which to discard and the like viewing presentations of data and results of analysis of the data by the reputation data processing system generating white label applications for data sources and other activities. In an embodiment the reputation management user interface is an application operating on a computer system instance separate from the reputation data processing system obtaining data for presentations and or the presentations themselves from the reputation data processing system . The reputation management user interface may be an application constructed using application development framework ADF tools such as those available from Oracle Corporation. However the reputation management user interface may be any suitable application and in some embodiments the reputation management user interface is presented in a web browser presenting presentations obtained from a web server of the reputation data processing system e.g. in the form of HTML pages . Also while illustrated separately from the reputation data processing system the reputation management user interface may be a component of the reputation data processing system . For example if the reputation data processing system is operated as a server or cluster of servers the reputation management user interface may be a module of the reputation data processing system implemented by the server and or one or more of the servers of the cluster.

The reputation management user interface may also be separate from the reputation data processing system . For instance the reputation management user interface may be implemented by a server different from a server or cluster of servers that implements the reputation data processing system . Similarly the reputation management user interface may be implemented as multiple components implemented themselves on different hardware devices. For example the reputation management user interface may be implemented collectively by a server and a client application executing on a hardware device of a user of the reputation management user interface . In an embodiment the reputation management user interface enables users to view presentations of data and results of analysis of the data.

In an embodiment the presentations presented by the reputation management user interface include graphics and or text which provide intuitive views of data in the reputation database and or results of analysis of that data. In an embodiment a user of the reputation management user interface provides user input that is transmitted to the reputation data processing system . The reasoner may then process data from the reputation database in accordance with the user input. Results of processing by the reasoner may be provided to the reputation management user interface for presentation to the user. Similarly input by the user may be transmitted to the reputation data processing system which may submit a query to the reputation database to obtain data stored by the reputation database which is then provided either directly or in a processed form to the reputation management user interface for presentation to the user.

User input into the reputation management user interface may also cause results from the reasoner and data from the reputation database to be provided for presentation to the user. Plus in general in an embodiment the representation management user interface enables users to direct operation of the reputation data processing system in accordance with its programmed capabilities. Additional capabilities may include for example obtaining data from a data source in response to user input provided to the reputation management user interface .

In various embodiments the reputation management user interface includes one or more additional features. For example in an embodiment the reputation management user interface includes reusable ADF and or API components that allow others to build additional applications that make use of data and analysis through the reputation data processing system . Reputation metrics and other values calculated by the reputation data processing system may be used for instance to serve other purposes in addition to those described explicitly herein. For instance reusable ADF components of the user interface may be used to build a custom application for a marketing department to enable users in the marketing department to hone their skills and view how their activities serve their reputations and the reputations of the organization as well as how their activities may cause undue risk to the organization.

As another example in some embodiments the reputation management user interface includes functionality to generate white label applications for one or more social networking systems and or other system. A white label application built for a social network system may for example be installed by a user as a condition for receiving one or more rewards or other recognition. An example of such rewards may be a restaurant or retailer discounts. In such cases if an employee shares more information they may in some embodiments receive larger discounts discounts at a larger set of retailers or unlock extra coupon codes. Once installed the white label application may give the organization access to information maintained by the social network system in a non public manner. For example using Facebook as an example use of the white label application may give the organization access to information that is not accessible to the general public but to a more limited group of Facebook users such as those identified as friends of the user that installed the white label application. In an embodiment the white label application allows the user to specify various privacy settings that determine how much and which types of information are shared with the organization. In some embodiments the white label application is a wrapper for a benefit management application such that benefits to the employee may vary according to the amount of information shared by the employee. In this manner the employee can choose the level of benefits and information sharing that he or she is most comfortable with.

The employees of the organization may access the user accessed system using various devices. Example devices include personal computer systems mobile devices such as smart phones tablet computing devices and generally any device configured to communicate with the user accessed system . As shown in a reputation data processing system such as the reputation data processing system described above in connection with obtains data from the user accessed system . For example the reputation data processing system may submit an API call to the user accessed system which may provide a response accordingly with data specified by the API call.

For example the reputation data processing system in an embodiment may submit an API call to obtain data about an employee specified in the API call. The API call may for example specify a user name utilized by the employee when accessing the user accessed system . Accordingly the reputation data processing system in an embodiment may maintain data that associates internal identifiers of employees with corresponding user names of the user accessed system . It should be noted however that the reputation data processing system and the user accessed system may utilize the same identifier for a single employee. For example the user accessed system may be an internal system of the organization and a single identifier may be used by the reputation data processing system and the user accessed system .

As noted above the reputation data processing system may obtain data from the user accessed system in other ways such as by requesting a web page of the user accessed system and processing data from the web page accordingly. In another example the reputation data processing system may request data in batches. For example the organization may maintain an account with the user accessed system . The reputation data processing system may then for example submit an API call requesting current data for the account such as data for all employees of the organization having an account with the user accessed system . Generally the reputation data processing system may obtain data from the user accessed system in any suitable manner including in manners not explicitly described herein. In addition the data processing system may determine which received data to store in a persistent manner.

Data that has been stored and or processed by the reputation data processing system may be accessed by users of the organization and or users acting on behalf of the organization. Such users may be users interested in compliance of the organization reputation of the organization and hiring for the organization and or generally any users who utilize the reputation data processing system as part of their activities. Users may access the reputation data processing system through a browser or other application configured to submit requests for presentations of data to the reputation data processing system which may then provide appropriate responses to the users.

The process in an embodiment includes obtaining new information about an employee. For example additional information may be obtained from an external and or an internal data source such as in the manner described above. The new information may be for instance one or more Facebook posts one or more tweets in the Twitter social network one or more posts on LinkedIn a credit score information about criminal proceedings e.g. an arrest record from an electronic service an updated background check record from a background check service and or other information posted by or about the employee. Similarly stored information about the employee may be accessed that is data may have been accessed using the techniques described above and stored and new information may have been generated such as if the employee has been updating his or her social network accounts. The stored information may be for example information that is stored in a reputation database such as described above and or information from one or more internal data sources.

The obtained information and stored information about the employee may be used to update one or more reputation metrics for the employee. The reputation metrics may be values calculated based on the data that indicate something about the employee. The reputation metrics can indicate for example influence of the employee and or risk of the employee. Example reputation metrics relating to impact and or influence include generosity influence engagement activity impact and clout.

Generosity may be a reputation metric calculated based at least in part on a relative number of times the employee makes an effort to promote content of another. Examples of efforts to promote the content of another include sharing in a social network e.g. Facebook LinkedIn content posted by another re tweeting a tweet in the Twitter social network and otherwise taking action that promotes something of another. Generosity may be a relative value and therefore may be dependent on the actions of others. Generosity for an employee may be for instance calculated relative to other employees in a group such as the whole organization a department employees sharing one or more characteristics e.g. job title and or the like.

Influence in an embodiment is a reputation metric that indicates in a relative manner how often others promote the content of the employee. The influence value may be for example based on the number of tweets of the employee that are re tweeted in the Twitter social network the number of posts or other content of the employee that are shared in the Facebook social network and or other actions taken by others with respect to content associated with the employee. As with the generosity value and other values herein the value may be calculated relative to a defined universe of users which may or may not be limited to users of the organization.

Engagement in an embodiment is a reputation metric calculated based at least in part on actions taken by the employee that indicate engagement with others. Examples include commenting on content posted by others in various social networks clicks on articles posted by others to indicate having read the articles and or other actions determined to correspond to engagement by the employee.

Activity in an embodiment is a reputation metric that is calculated to be a relative value that is based at least in part on the number of times the employee posts content in one or more social networks relative to other users in some defined universe of users. The impact box may be for instance calculated based at least in part on the influence reputation metric and additionally based at least in part on the size of the employee s social network. For example the impact value may be based at least in part on the number of followers of the employee in the Twitter social network and at least in part on the number of times a follower re tweets tweets of the employee. Thus the impact value may be a relative value that increases both with increased social network size or increased activity of others in connection with content posted by the employee.

Clout in an embodiment is a reputation metric that is calculated using search engine metrics. In particular search histories of users in a defined universe of users may be obtained to determine the frequency at which content of the employee appears in search results responsive to search queries submitted by others. The appearance of such content in search response rankings may also be used. Thus the clout reputation metric in an embodiment corresponds to the clout of an employee as measured by the appearance of the employee s content in search responses. As with generosity and other metrics discussed above this value may be calculated relative to a defined group of employees. Further the search engines may be operated by third parties.

While the above example reputation metrics may be used in calculations of risk e.g. an employee with higher influence and or clout may cause more damage by a violation of an organizational policy other reputation metrics relate more directly to risk of an organization. Example reputation metrics are no profanity disparagement disclaimer use confidentiality respect reference respect and future offerings are provided. The no profanity reputation metric may be based at least in part on a profanity value that is calculated based at least in part on the number of posts of content by the employee and the number of those posts that contain a word considered to be profane. Unless otherwise clear from context post herein is to be understood generally as and includes activity such as tweets and other activity of making content available. Whether a word is profane may be determined for instance by searching the content of the employee for words on a list of profane words. The no profanity metric may be calculated as or may be at least based at least in part on the ratio of posts of the employee containing profanity to the total number of posts of the employee. As with other metrics posts may be calculated with respect to one or more social networks or other information sources.

The non disparagement reputation metric in an embodiment corresponds to a disparagement value. The disparagement value may be calculated similar to the no profanity value but instead of posts containing profanity being used posts containing disparaging words and or phrases are used. Determining whether a post contains disparaging words and or phrases may be performed using semantic analysis of the posts for instance by stemming words in the posts and searching for similar words in the same semantic topics. In other words determining whether the posts contain disparaging words and or phrases may be performed by determining whether the posts contain phrases that are semantically similar to known disparaging words and or phrases.

The use disclaimer reputation metric in an embodiment corresponds to a measure of activity relating to an employee s web log blog if the employee has a blog and or other electronic environment managed by the employee. An organization s social media policy may for example require bloggers that are also employees to make clear that the opinions expressed in the blog are not necessarily those of the organization. The employee may be required for example to include a predetermined disclaimer in each blog post and or in a terms and conditions or other portion of a web site. The use disclaimer reputation metric therefore in an embodiment may correspond to a value that is calculated based at least in part on the number of blog posts and the number of blog posts analyzed and calculated to lack the required disclaimer.

The respect confidentiality reputation metric in an embodiment as with other boxes corresponds to a measure of certain activity calculated to contain one or more issues. In this instance an issue is an instance of a post that either inadvertently or intentionally contains information that should be confidential. For example posts containing the name of a company in which the organization is in confidential merger discussions may be marked as issue posts. Similarly posts containing information about a future product release may be marked as issue posts. Determining whether a post contains confidential information may be performed by searching the posts for keywords of a list of keywords corresponding to confidential information. Such lists may be maintained by one or more individuals tasked with maintaining the organization s confidentiality. In addition steps to obscure the terms from an administrator e.g. user of the UI shown in may be taken. For example the administrator may be provided a list with dummy words and or phrases. A reputation data processing system may convert the dummy words phrases to actual words phrases outside of the view of the administrator. Other ways of obscuring confidential information may also be used. Activities that may be examined for issues may include posts articles tweets and or generally any information made available to an unauthorized audience e.g. the public and or even those without authorization within the same organization .

The respect references reputation metric in an embodiment is also a value calculated based at least in part on a total number of posts and a number of those posts determined to contain one or more issues. In this example a post may be considered to contain an issue if it lacks proper attribution and or respects brand names. For example a post may be considered to contain an issue by searching for a phrase of a predetermined minimum length and submitting the phrase to a search engine to determine whether the phrase is original. As another example a post may be considered to contain an issue if the post includes a trademark without use of the trademark symbol or .

The future offerings reputation metric may be similarly generated based at least in part on the number of posts and the number of posts determined to contain one or more particular issues. A post may be determined to contain an issue if the post contains information about a future product offering that is intended to remain confidential. The future offerings reputation may be calculated similar to the respect confidentiality box but generated also where the issues are limited to those dealing with future product offerings.

Returning to the process a determination may be made based at least in part on the reputation metrics whether or not to update policies are applicable to the employee. If it is determined to update the policies then the policies are updated in accordance with the updated reputation metrics. Similarly if it is determined not to update the policies then no additional action may be taken or action different from that which is illustrated in may be taken. Determination whether to update one or more policies may be performed by any suitable manner. For example one or more reputation metrics may be used to calculate a risk score. Changes to the risk score that exceed a threshold amount may result in positive determinations to update the policies. In addition a determination of whether to update policies may be made based at least in part on a numerical estimate of a derivative of one or more reputation metrics and or a score calculated based at least in part on one or more reputation metrics. For instance exceeding a threshold value of a derivative of a metric corresponding to risk may result in a positive determination to update one or more policies since the derivative exceeding the threshold value may indicate a sudden increase in risk.

According to one embodiment a mixed model approach can be used in determining whether to update policies or take other actions related to a reputation. In implementations under such a model the determination can be made using the internal reputation scores those calculated based on the sources described above externally calculated reputation scores provided by third party sources and or other types of scores like credit scores in combination so that a decision can be made about a user s level of access to program features and or data level access.

In addition while not illustrated as such additional actions may also be performed in connection with the process and or variations thereof. For example determining whether to update one or more policies and updating one or more policies may be performed as an automated process where policies are updated automatically upon detection of triggering events and or may be performed with additional user intervention. For example updated reputation metrics may be used to generate a presentation to a user on a user interface and or an electronic message to the user. The user may be for instance an administrator monitoring organizational reputation and or compliance of an organization. The presentation and or electronic message may indicate the change in risk. The user through a user interface may investigate the circumstances and reasons for the change in risk and may make a determination whether to update one or more policies. If the user determines to update one or more policies the user may provide user input through the interface that updates one or more policies accordingly. One or more electronic messages may then be sent to one or more computer systems that are configured to enforce policies. For example a message to a computer system may trigger the computer system to change a set of privileges of the employee for whom the increased risk was calculated. The computer system may for instance prohibit the employee from engaging in certain transactions that he or she was previously able to engage in.

Further updating policies may also be performed in a manner that increases the amount of activities in which employees are allowed to engage. For instance increases in reputation metrics and or scores that indicate positive i.e. beneficial changes may result in policies being updated to enable the employee to engage in a wider set of activities. For instance if changes indicate that the employee is more influential and low risk the employee may be allowed to engage in more public activity on behalf of the employee. Similarly employees whose risk decreases may be allowed to use the organization s computer systems to engage in more activities thereby enabling the employee to more effectively and freely serve the organization with less additional risk to the organization.

Other information may also be used to calculate the reputation metric such as described above. A determination may then be made whether or not to revoke permissions such as described above in connection with determinations to update one or more policies. The determination may be made based at least in part on the calculated one or more reputation metrics. If it is determined to revoke the permissions then appropriate action may be taken.

For example an electronic message may be sent to a specified individual of the organization to notify the individual of the change in reputation metrics. That individual may then reconfigure one or more computer systems of the organization to prohibit the employee from taking certain actions such as by prohibiting the employee from engaging in certain financial transactions. The appropriate action may also include automatically reconfiguring the one or more configured computer systems such as by transmitting an electronic message to the computer systems that indicates to the computer systems upon receipt of the electronic communication to update themselves. Generally any action which may be relevant to one or more individuals may be taken.
