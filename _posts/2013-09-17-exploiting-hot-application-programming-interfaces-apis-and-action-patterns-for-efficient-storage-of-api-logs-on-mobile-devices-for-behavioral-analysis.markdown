title: Exploiting hot application programming interfaces (APIs) and action patterns for efficient storage of API logs on mobile devices for behavioral analysis
abstract: Methods and devices for detecting suspicious or performance-degrading mobile device behaviors may include performing behavior monitoring and analysis operations to intelligently, dynamically, and/or adaptively determine the mobile device behaviors that are to be observed, the number of behaviors that are to be observed, and the level of detail or granularity at which the behaviors are to be observed. Such behavior monitoring and analysis operations may be performed continuously (or near continuously) in a mobile device without consuming an excessive amount of processing, memory, or energy resources of the mobile device by identifying hot application programming interfaces (APIs) and hot action patterns that are invoked or used most frequently by software applications of the mobile device and storing information regarding these hot APIs and hot action patterns separately and more efficiently.

Cellular and wireless communication technologies have seen explosive growth over the past several years. This growth has been fueled by better communications hardware larger networks and more reliable protocols. Wireless service providers are now able to offer their customers an ever expanding array of features and services and provide users with unprecedented levels of access to information resources and communications. To keep pace with these service enhancements mobile electronic devices e.g. cellular phones tablets laptops etc. have become more powerful and complex than ever. This complexity has created new opportunities for malicious software software conflicts hardware faults and other similar errors or phenomena to negatively impact a mobile device s long term and continued performance and power utilization levels. Accordingly identifying and correcting the conditions and or mobile device behaviors that may negatively impact the mobile device s long term and continued performance and power utilization levels is beneficial to consumers.

The various aspects will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.

The terms mobile computing device and mobile device are used interchangeably herein to refer to any one or all of cellular telephones smartphones personal or mobile multi media players personal data assistants PDA s laptop computers tablet computers smartbooks ultrabooks palm top computers wireless electronic mail receivers multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones wireless gaming controllers and similar personal electronic devices which include a memory a programmable processor for which performance is important and operate under battery power such that power conservation methods are of benefit. While the various aspects are particularly useful for mobile computing devices such as smartphones which have limited resources and run on battery power the aspects are generally useful in any electronic device that includes a processor and executes application programs.

The term performance degradation is used herein to refer to a wide variety of undesirable mobile device operations and characteristics such as longer processing times slower real time responsiveness lower battery life loss of private data malicious economic activity e.g. sending unauthorized premium SMS message denial of service DoS operations relating to commandeering the mobile device or utilizing the phone for spying or botnet activities etc.

Generally the performance and power efficiency of a mobile device degrade over time. Recently anti virus companies e.g. McAfee Symantec etc. have begun marketing mobile anti virus firewall and encryption products that aim to slow this degradation. However many of these solutions rely on the periodic execution of a computationally intensive scanning engine on the mobile device which may consume many of the mobile device s processing and battery resources slow or render the mobile device useless for extended periods of time and or otherwise degrade the user experience. In addition these solutions are typically limited to detecting known viruses and malware and do not address the multiple complex factors and or the interactions that often combine to contribute to a mobile device s degradation over time e.g. when the performance degradation is not caused by viruses or malware . For these and other reasons existing anti virus firewall and encryption products do not provide adequate solutions for identifying the numerous factors that may contribute to a mobile device s degradation over time for preventing mobile device degradation or for efficiently restoring an aging mobile device to its original condition.

Mobile devices are resource constrained systems that have relatively limited processing memory and energy resources. Modern mobile devices are also complex systems and there are a large variety of factors that may contribute to the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of the mobile device over time including poorly designed software applications malware viruses fragmented memory background processes etc. Due to the number variety and complexity of these factors it is often not feasible to evaluate all the various processes components behaviors or factors or combinations thereof that may degrade performance and or power utilization levels of the complex yet resource constrained systems of modern mobile devices. As such it is difficult for users operating systems and or application programs e.g. anti virus software etc. to accurately and efficiently identify the sources of such problems. Therefore mobile device users currently have few remedies for preventing the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of a mobile device over time or for restoring an aging mobile device to its original performance and power utilization levels.

The various aspects include mobile devices systems and methods for efficiently identifying preventing and or correcting the conditions and or mobile device behaviors that often degrade a mobile device s performance and or power utilization levels over time. By identifying hot application programming interfaces APIs and hot action patterns that are invoked or used most frequently by software applications of the mobile device and by storing information regarding the hot APIs and hot action patterns separately and or more efficiently the various aspects enable a mobile device to perform behavior monitoring and analysis operations continuously or near continuously without consuming an excessive amount of processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device.

In an aspect an observer process daemon module or sub system herein collectively referred to as a module of the mobile device may instrument or coordinate various APIs registers counters or other components herein collectively instrumented components at various levels of the mobile device system. The observer module may monitor mobile device behaviors over a period of time by collecting behavior information from the instrumented components to recognize mobile device behaviors that are inconsistent with normal operation patterns. For example the observer module may monitor library API calls system call APIs driver API calls and other instrumented components by reading information from log files e.g. API logs stored in a memory of the mobile device.

The mobile device may also include an analyzer module and the observer module may communicate e.g. via a memory write operation function call etc. the collected behavior information to the analyzer module. The analyzer module may receive and use the behavior information to perform analysis operations which may include performing executing and or applying data algorithms and or models to determine whether a mobile device behavior is benign or malicious performance degrading.

Generally each software application writes information to an API log during its execution in the mobile device. Since mobile devices are resource constrained systems one of the major challenges in performing behavioral monitoring and analysis in a mobile device is managing the log sizes within the limited memory resources e.g. RAM size that are available in the mobile device. For example in the Android and Linux kernels there are over 30 000 APIs. Many of these API s are called executed repeatedly during the execution of an application so the total number of API calls executions is typically very large. As such the observer module may be required to monitor a large number of APIs or API logs to collect enough behavior information to accurately identify or classify a mobile device behavior. Further due to the number and complexity of the API calls each API log may store large amounts of information including an identifier for each API that is invoked by a software application as well as time stamps function arguments function argument values caller names etc. for each time that API is called. Parsing through such large volumes of information to collect or retrieve behavior information may have a significant impact on the performance and power consumption characteristics of the mobile device. For all these reasons the size and efficiency of these logs may have a large impact on the performance of the observer module and on the performance and power consumption characteristics of the mobile device.

The various aspects include methods and mobile computing devices configured to perform the methods of reducing the size of the log files e.g. API logs that are generated and stored in a memory by software applications and using these reduced size log files to improve the performance of the mobile device when monitoring and classifying device behaviors of the mobile device.

In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to generate the API logs in a format structure that reduces the amount of memory resources consumed by the logs and or that allows the observer module to access and use the behavior information stored in these logs more efficiently.

As discussed above the observer module may be required to monitor a large number of API calls to collect all the information that is required by the analyzer module when classifying a mobile device behavior. Yet not all of the monitored APIs will be used evenly or with the same frequency by the software applications of the mobile device. Further there is often a large discrepancy in the usage of APIs by software applications of the mobile device. Some APIs are used called rarely while other APIs e.g. open close send etc. are used called often and repeatedly. As such storing and processing information for all the APIs in the same or similar manner may be an inefficient use of mobile device resources.

Aspect methods and mobile devices may be configured to identify those APIs that are used called and log the usage of those frequently used APIs rather than entries for each execution of such APIs in an efficient manner in API logs. APIs that are used most often frequently are referred to herein as hot APIs. 

In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to identify hot APIs i.e. the APIs that are used most frequently and store information regarding the usage of hot APIs in a hot API log. The observer module may read the API data from the hot API log to quickly and efficiently generate a behavior vector that includes enough information to allow the analyzer module to accurately classify a mobile device behavior as being malicious performance degrading or benign.

In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to generate the hot API logs so that values for generic fields that remain the same across invocations of the API are stored in one table while the values for specific fields that change with each most API invocations and thus are specific to each invocation are stored in a second separate table. For example the mobile device may generate a hot API log made up of a first table that stores values for the generic fields and a second table that stores values for the specific fields related to each API use call. In an aspect the specific fields may be stored in the second table along with hash keys linked to the first table i.e. the table that stores values for the generic fields . By organizing the API log in this manner the various aspects allow the observer module to generate behavior vectors more efficiently and to include the most relevant information so that the analyzer module may classify mobile device behaviors quicker while reducing the memory dedicated to API logs and reducing the amount of processing or power resources consumed by the mobile device executing the behavior analysis processes.

In addition to using certain APIs more frequently than others software applications often repeat certain sequences or patterns of API invocations. In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to identify frequently used sequences or patterns of API invocations and store the identified sequences patterns as a hot action pattern in an API log file. In various aspects the mobile device may be configured to store the hot action patterns as a vector a sequence a regular expression of APIs a state diagram or in any other concise structure or format that reduces the amount of memory consumed by the API logs. The hot action patterns may also be generated so that they parameterize a pattern definition store generic parameters that are the same across invocations of an API only once etc.

In an aspect the analyzer module may be configured to compare the hot action patterns to known statistics of API usage to quickly and efficiently classify a mobile device behavior as benign or malicious performance degrading.

In various aspects hot action patterns may be recognized and generated on the mobile device pre installed on the mobile device and or downloaded from or upgraded by any number or combination of public and private cloud services networks including third party vendors and application stores. For example the mobile device may be configured to receive hot action patterns from a network server and implement apply and or use the action patterns to identify and correct suspicious malicious or performance degrading mobile device behaviors. The mobile device may also be configured to send generated hot action patterns generated behavior vectors the results of the real time analysis operations and or other similar information to a network server or a server in a cloud service network. The network server may receive the hot action patterns and apply machine learning and or context modeling techniques to similar information provided by many mobile devices and consolidate or otherwise turn such crowd sourced information into hot action patterns that can be used or accessed by all mobile devices.

The various aspects may be implemented in a number of different mobile devices including mobile devices including a single processor multiprocessor systems and a system on chip SOC . is an architectural diagram illustrating an example system on chip SOC architecture that may be used in computing devices implementing the various aspects.

The SOC may further include an input output module not illustrated for communicating with resources external to the SOC such as a clock and a voltage regulator .

Radio level observations may further include monitoring network traffic usage statistics or profiles.

Sensor level observations may include monitoring a magnet sensor or other sensor to determine the usage and or external environment of the mobile device. For example the mobile device processor may be configured to determine whether the phone is in a holster e.g. via a magnet sensor configured to sense a magnet within the holster or in the user s pocket e.g. via the amount of light detected by a camera or light sensor . Detecting that the mobile device is in a holster may be relevant to recognizing suspicious behaviors for example because activities and functions related to active usage by a user e.g. taking photographs or videos sending messages conducting a voice call recording sounds etc. occurring while the mobile device is holstered could be signs of nefarious processes executing on the device e.g. to track or spy on the user .

Other examples of sensor level observations related to usage or external environments include detecting near field communications NFC collecting information from a credit card scanner barcode scanner or mobile tag reader detecting the presence of a USB power charging source detecting that a keyboard or auxiliary device has been coupled to the mobile device detecting that the mobile device has been coupled to a computing device e.g. via USB etc. determining whether an LED flash flashlight or light source has been modified or disabled e.g. maliciously disabling an emergency signaling app etc. detecting that a speaker or microphone has been turned on or powered detecting a charging or power event detecting that the mobile device is being used as a game controller etc. Sensor level observations may also include collecting information from medical or healthcare sensors or from scanning the user s body collecting information from an external sensor plugged into the USB audio jack collecting information from a tactile or haptic sensor e.g. via a vibrator interface etc. collecting information pertaining to the thermal state of the mobile device etc.

Again to observe such behaviors and component states the observer module may monitor API calls related to or used for accessing the various components sensors data files etc. store observed API calls uses in an API log identify frequently used called APIs as hot APIs and store identified hot APIs in a hot API log.

The behavior observer module may be configured to generate behavior vectors that include a concise definition of the observed behaviors. Each behavior vector may succinctly describe observed behavior of the mobile device software application or process in a value or vector data structure e.g. in the form of a string of numbers etc. . A behavior vector may also function as an identifier that enables the mobile device system to quickly recognize identify and or analyze mobile device behaviors. In an aspect the behavior observer module may generate a behavior vector that includes series of numbers each of which signifies a feature or a behavior of the mobile device. For example numbers included in the behavior vector may signify whether a camera of the mobile device is in use e.g. as zero or one how much network traffic has been transmitted from or generated by the mobile device e.g. 20 KB sec etc. how many internet messages have been communicated e.g. number of SMS messages etc. etc.

To reduce the number of factors monitored to a manageable level in an aspect the behavior observer module may be configured to perform coarse observations by monitoring observing an initial set of behaviors or factors that are a small subset of all factors that could contribute to the mobile device s degradation. In various aspects the behavior observer module may receive the initial set of behaviors and or factors from other mobile devices a network server or a component in a cloud service or network. In an aspect the initial set of behaviors factors may be specified in data behavior models received from the other mobile device network server or cloud service network. In an aspect the initial set of behaviors factors may be specified in a reduced feature model RFMs .

The behavior analyzer module may receive the observations behavior vectors and or collected behavior information from the behavior observer module compare the received information i.e. observations with contextual information received from the external context information module and identify subsystems processes and or applications associated with the received observations that are contributing to or are likely to contribute to the device s degradation over time or which may otherwise cause problems on the device.

In an aspect the behavior analyzer module may include intelligence for utilizing a limited set of information i.e. coarse observations to identify behaviors processes or programs that are contributing to or are likely to contribute to the device s degradation over time or which may otherwise cause problems on the device. For example the behavior analyzer module may be configured to analyze information e.g. in the form of observations collected from various modules e.g. the behavior observer module external context information module etc. learn the normal operational behaviors of the mobile device and generate one or more behavior vectors based the results of the comparisons. The behavior analyzer module may send the generated behavior vectors to an actuator module which may perform various operations to operations to heal cure isolate or otherwise fix the identified problem.

The behavior analyzer module may receive the behavior vectors and compare them to one or more behavior modules to determine whether a particular mobile device behavior software application or process is performance degrading malicious benign or suspicious. When it is determined that a behavior software application or process is malicious or performance degrading the behavior analyzer module may notify the actuator module which may perform various actions or operations to correct mobile device behaviors determined to be malicious or performance degrading and or perform operations to heal cure isolate or otherwise fix the identified problem.

When the behavior analyzer module determines that a behavior software application or process is suspicious the analyzer module may notify the behavior observer module which may adjust the adjust the granularity of its observations i.e. the level of detail at which mobile device behaviors are observed and or change the behaviors that are observed based on information received from the analyzer module e.g. results of the real time analysis operations generate or collect new or additional behavior information and send the new additional information to the behavior analyzer module for further analysis classification. Such feedback communications between the behavior observer module and the analyzer module enable the mobile device to recursively increase the granularity of the observations i.e. make finer or more detailed observations or change the features behaviors that are observed until a source of a suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior is identified until a processing or batter consumption threshold is reached or until the mobile device processor determines that the source of the suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior cannot be identified from further increases in observation granularity. Such feedback communication also enable the mobile device to adjust or modify the data behavior models locally in the mobile device without consuming an excessive amount of the mobile device s processing memory or energy resources.

Thus the analyzer module may be configured to receive the coarse observations from the observer module and identify subsystems processes and or applications associated with the received coarse observations that may potentially contribute to the mobile device s degradation. This may be achieved by for example the analyzer module comparing the received information with contextual information received from the external context information module .

The analyzer module may instruct the observer module to perform or enable deeper logging observations or final logging on the identified subsystems processes or applications. The observer module may perform deeper observations on the identified subsystems processes or applications. The observer module may send the results of the deeper observations to the analyzer module for further and deeper analysis. These operations may be repeated until the source of a problem is identified or until it is determined that the identified subsystems processes or applications are not likely to cause problems or degradation. The analyzer module may then send the results of the analysis to the actuation module which may receive the results and perform operations to heal cure isolate or otherwise fix the identified problem.

The observer module and the analyzer module may provide either individually or collectively real time behavior analysis of the computing system s behaviors to identify suspicious behavior from limited and coarse observations to dynamically determine behaviors to observe in greater detail and to dynamically determine the level of detail required for the observations. In this manner the observer module enables the computing system to efficiently identify and prevent problems from occurring on mobile devices without requiring a large amount of processor memory or battery resources on the device.

The observer module may provide the system with various observer modes to enable multi level logging e.g. fine grained and coarse grained logging . The observer module may provide the ability to automatically and dynamically switch between the different observer modes. The observer module may monitor and restrict process application that may exhaust system resources. The observer module may manage communications e.g. non secure to secure world overhead such that the overhead is minimal and flow control is maintained performed efficiently.

In an aspect the observer module may be configured to store the behavior information as observations in a space efficient and query service time efficient manner to reduce the performance impact on benign applications and the mobile device.

In the example illustrated in the mobile device includes a behavior analyzer module a logger module a log storage manager a log store and a behavior detection module . In an aspect the behavior detection module may included in the behavior observer module illustrated in

The logger module may be configured to generate log entries for each software application that executes in the mobile device . The log storage manager may format and store the log entries in a log store in memory of the mobile device . The behavior detection module may query the log storage manager for behavior information and in response receive behavior information and or API log entries. The behavior detection module may use the information received from the log storage manager to generate a behavior vector that includes a concise definition of an observed mobile device behavior. In an aspect the behavior vector may be a behavior signature that functions as an identifier that may be used by the behavior analyzer module to quickly and efficiency identify analyze and or classify a mobile device behavior.

In the example illustrated in the mobile device further includes a hot API manager a hot API table component and a hot action pattern table component . The hot API manager may be configured to identify the frequency at which APIs are invoked classify the most frequently invoked APIs as hot APIs determine the fields values in the hot APIs that are generic fields values that have a high probability of being the same across different invocations of an API determine the fields values in the hot APIs that are specific values that have a high probability of changing across different invocations the API and store the generic and specific values in separate tables in the hot API table component .

The hot API manager may also be configured to identify frequently used sequences or patterns of API invocations and store the identified sequences patterns as a hot action pattern in a hot action pattern table component . The mobile device may be configured to store the hot action patterns as a vector a sequence a regular expression of APIs a state diagram or in any other concise data structure or format. For example the hot action patterns may be generated so that they parameterize a pattern definition store generic parameters that are the same across invocations of an API only once etc.

In an aspect the hot API manager may be configured to format the information received from the logger module and send the formatted information to the log storage manager which may store the information in a log store . In an embodiment the logger module may be configured to store the hot API information in a consolidated log.

The behavior detection module may query the log storage manager and or hot API manager for behavior information and in response receive behavior information and or API log entries. The behavior detection module may use this information to generate a behavior vector that includes a concise definition of an observed mobile device behavior that may be used by the behavior analyzer module to identify analyze and or classify a mobile device behavior. In an aspect the behavior analyzer module may be configured to compare the hot action patterns included in the behavior vector to known statistics of API usage to quickly and efficiently classify a mobile device behavior as benign or malicious performance degrading.

In the example illustrated in the generic fields include the API name and function argument fields . These values are typically the same across different invocations of the API and generally do not store information that is useful for determining whether a mobile device behavior is malicious or benign. The specific fields may include a timestamp value and this information is generally specific to an invocation and may be relevant to determining whether the mobile device behavior is malicious or benign e.g. application performing a send operation at midnight etc. .

In various aspects a mobile device may be configured to identify the frequency at which certain APIs are used and tailor the operations of the behavior observer and or analyzer modules to focus on those APIs that are used most often. In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to identify hot APIs i.e. frequently invoked APIs determine which fields may be categorized as generic and store the generic fields for those APIs just once. Since these APIs are the ones that are most frequently invoked storing the generic fields only once may significantly reduce the amount of information that is stored in each software application s API log.

In an aspect the specific fields may be stored in a hash table along with hot API index values in a consolidated log . The hot API index values may be stored as hash key in a hot API table that stores the generic fields for the hot APIs. Since the generic fields store the same values for different invocations of an API multiple hot API index values may be used as keys to the same hot API table . This reduces the amount of information that is stored in the consolidated log by eliminating many repetitive entries that would be included in a conventional API log. Further since the generic fields are not likely to be useful for the behavior analysis operations the system can better tolerate the longer access times that may be required to retrieve values from the hot API table .

In block the processing core may identify generic values fields in the collected behavior information by determining the values fields that have a high probability of being the same across different invocations of the API and or that have a low probability of being used when classifying a mobile device behavior as being malicious or benign. That is in block the processing core may classify an API information field as a generic field in response to determining that there is a low probability that a value of the API information field will change across different invocations of that API and or in response to determining that there is a low probability that a value of the API information field will be used when performing behavior analysis operations.

In block the processing core may identify specific values fields in the collected behavior information by determining the values fields that have a high probability of changing across different invocations of the API and or have a high probability of being used in classifying a mobile device behavior as malicious or benign. That is in block the processing core may classify an API information field as a specific field in response to determining that there is a high probability that a value of the API information field will change across different invocations of that API and or in response to determining that there is a high probability that a value of the API information field will be used when performing the behavior analysis operations.

In block the processing core may generate a hot API log so that the generic values fields are stored in a separate table as the specific values fields and so that the specific fields values are stored in a table along with hash keys to the table that stores the generic fields values. In block the processing core may retrieve the specific values from the hot API log. In block the processing core may perform behavior analysis operations to classify a mobile device behavior as being either malicious or benign based on the specific values retrieved from the hot API log.

In determination block the processing core may determine whether suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified based on the results of the behavioral analysis operations performed in block . When the processing core determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes the processing core may initiate a process to correct the behavior in block and continue performing additional observations identify additional APIs as being hot APIs and or update the list of Hot APIs in block .

When the processing core determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can not be identified based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No the processing core may determine whether there is a likelihood of a problem in determination block .

In an aspect the processing core may determine that there is a likelihood of a problem by computing a probability of the mobile device encountering potential problems and or engaging in suspicious behaviors and determining whether the computed probability is greater than a predetermined threshold. When the processing core determines that the computed probability is not greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is not a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block No the processing core may return to block to perform additional observations identify additional APIs as being hot APIs and or update the list of Hot APIs.

When the processing core determines that the computed probability is greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block Yes the processing core may retrieve generic values from the hot API log and or perform additional behavior monitoring or analysis operations to classify the behavior as malicious or benign. The operations of blocks may be performed repeatedly and or in low power or background processes so as to continuously or near continuously monitor mobile device behaviors and prevent or correct problematic or malicious behaviors without consuming a significant amount of the mobile device s processing memory or power resources.

In an aspect method may be performed by a processing core in a mobile device as part of a method of analyzing mobile device behaviors and or as part of a comprehensive behavior monitoring and analysis solution. For example the processing core may identify hot application programming interfaces APIs by identifying APIs that are used most frequently by software applications executing on the mobile device store information regarding usage of identified hot APIs in a hot API log in a memory of the mobile device and perform behavior analysis operations based on the information stored in the hot API log to identify mobile device behaviors that are inconsistent with normal operation patterns. The processing core may perform method to generate the hot API log so that it is organized so that values of generic fields that remain the same across invocations of an API are stored in a separate table as values of specific fields that are specific to each invocation of the API and so that the values of the specific fields are stored in a table along with hash keys to the separate table that stores the values of the generic fields.

In an aspect storing information regarding usage of identified hot APIs in the hot API log may include identifying sequences of hot API invocations that are repeated frequently and storing these identified sequences of hot API invocations as hot action patterns in a hot action pattern log. In an aspect performing the behavior analysis operations based on the information stored in the hot API log may include comparing hot action patterns stored in the hot action pattern log to known statistics of API usage and using the results of this comparison to classify a mobile device behavior as malicious or benign.

In block the processing core may store the identified hot action patterns in a hot API log or a hot action pattern log in concise structures or formats. For example the processing core may store the hot action patterns as a vector a sequence a regular expression of APIs a state diagram or in any other concise data structure or format that reduces the amount of memory consumed by the API logs. The processing core may also store hot action patterns so that they parameterize a pattern definition store generic parameters that are the same across invocations of an API only once etc.

In block the processing core may retrieve a hot action pattern from the hot API log or a hot action pattern log . In block the processing core may perform behavior analysis operations by comparing the hot action pattern as well as other hot APIs to known statistics of API usage to classify a mobile device behavior as malicious or benign.

In determination block the processing core may determine whether suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified based on the results of the behavioral analysis operations performed in block . When the processing core determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes the processing core may initiate a process to correct the behavior in block and continue performing additional observations identify additional action patterns as being hot action patterns and or update the list of hot action patterns in block .

When the processing core determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems cannot be identified based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No the processing core may determine whether there is a likelihood of a problem in determination block . In an aspect the processing core may determine that there is a likelihood of a problem by computing a probability of the mobile device encountering potential problems and or engaging in suspicious behaviors and determining whether the computed probability is greater than a predetermined threshold. When the processing core determines that the computed probability is not greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is not a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block No the processing core may continue performing additional observations identify additional action patterns as being hot action patterns and or update the list of hot action patterns in block .

When the processing core determines that the computed probability is greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block Yes the processing core may retrieve additional information from the API logs and or generate a more robust behavior vector. In block the processing core may perform additional behavior monitoring or analysis operations to classify the behavior as malicious or benign. The operations of blocks may be performed repeatedly until the system times out or a problem is identified and fixed.

The observer mode module may receive control information from various sources which may include an analyzer unit e.g. the behavior analyzer module described above with reference to and or an application API. The observer mode module may send control information pertaining to various observer modes to the adaptive filter module and the high level behavior detection module .

The adaptive filter module may receive data information from multiple sources and intelligently filter the received information to generate a smaller subset of information selected from the received information. This filter may be adapted based on information or control received from the analyzer module or a higher level process communicating through an API. The filtered information may be sent to the throttle module which may be responsible for controlling the amount of information flowing from the filter to ensure that the high level behavior detection module does not become flooded or overloaded with requests or information.

The high level behavior detection module may receive data information from the throttle module control information from the observer mode module and context information from other components of the mobile device. The high level behavior detection module may use the received information to perform spatial and temporal correlations to detect or identify high level behaviors that may cause the device to perform at sub optimal levels. The results of the spatial and temporal correlations may be sent to the behavior vector generator which may receive the correlation information and generate a behavior vector that describes the behaviors of particular process application or sub system. In an aspect the behavior vector generator may generate the behavior vector such that each high level behavior of a particular process application or sub system is an element of the behavior vector. In an aspect the generated behavior vector may be stored in a secure buffer . Examples of high level behavior detection may include detection of the existence of a particular event the amount or frequency of another event the relationship between multiple events the order in which events occur time differences between the occurrence of certain events etc any or all of which may be determined based on information stored in the API hot API and or hot action pattern logs.

In the various aspects the behavior observer module may perform adaptive observations and control the observation granularity. That is the behavior observer module may dynamically identify the relevant behaviors that are to be observed and dynamically determine the level of detail at which the identified behaviors are to be observed. In this manner the behavior observer module enables the system to monitor the behaviors of the mobile device at various levels e.g. multiple coarse and fine levels . The behavior observer module may enable the system to adapt to what is being observed. The behavior observer module may enable the system to dynamically change the factors behaviors being observed based on a focused subset of information which may be obtained from a wide verity of sources.

As discussed above the behavior observer module may perform adaptive observation techniques and control the observation granularity based on information received from a variety of sources. For example the high level behavior detection module may receive information from the throttle module the observer mode module and context information received from other components e.g. sensors of the mobile device. As an example a high level behavior detection module performing temporal correlations might detect that a camera has been used and that the mobile device is attempting to upload the picture to a server. The high level behavior detection module may also perform spatial correlations to determine whether an application on the mobile device took the picture while the device was holstered and attached to the user s belt. The high level behavior detection module may determine whether this detected high level behavior e.g. usage of the camera while holstered is a behavior that is acceptable or common which may be achieved by comparing the current behavior with past behaviors of the mobile device and or accessing information collected from a plurality of devices e.g. information received from a crowd sourcing server . Since taking pictures and uploading them to a server while holstered is an unusual behavior as may be determined from observed normal behaviors in the context of being holstered in this situation the high level behavior detection module may recognize this as a potentially threatening behavior and initiate an appropriate response e.g. shutting off the camera sounding an alarm etc. .

The various aspects may provide cross layer observations on mobile devices encompassing webkit SDK NDK kernel drivers and hardware in order to characterize system behavior. The behavior observations may be made in real time.

The observer module may perform adaptive observation techniques and control the observation granularity. As discussed above there are a large number i.e. thousands of factors that could contribute to the mobile device s degradation and it may not be feasible to monitor observe all of the different factors that may contribute to the degradation of the device s performance. To overcome this the various aspects dynamically identify the relevant behaviors that are to be observed and dynamically determine the level of detail at which the identified behaviors are to be observed.

When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can not be identified and or corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No in determination block the mobile device processor may determine whether there is a likelihood of a problem. In an aspect the mobile device processor may determine that there is a likelihood of a problem by computing a probability of the mobile device encountering potential problems and or engaging in suspicious behaviors and determining whether the computed probability is greater than a predetermined threshold. When the mobile device processor determines that the computed probability is not greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is not a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block No the processor may return to block to perform additional coarse observations.

When the mobile device processor determines that there is a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may perform deeper logging observations or final logging on the identified subsystems processes or applications. In block the mobile device processor may perform deeper and more detailed observations on the identified subsystems processes or applications. In block the mobile device processor may perform further and or deeper behavioral analysis based on the deeper and more detailed observations. In determination block the mobile device processor may again determine whether the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis. When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can not be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No the processor may repeat the operations in blocks until the level of detail is fine enough to identify the problem or until it is determined that the problem cannot be identified with additional detail or that no problem exists.

When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may perform operations to correct the problem behavior and the processor may return to block to perform additional operations.

In an aspect as part of blocks of method the mobile device processor may perform real time behavior analysis of the system s behaviors to identify suspicious behavior from limited and coarse observations to dynamically determine the behaviors to observe in greater detail and to dynamically determine the precise level of detail required for the observations. This enables the mobile device processor to efficiently identify and prevent problems from occurring without requiring the use of a large amount of processor memory or battery resources on the device.
