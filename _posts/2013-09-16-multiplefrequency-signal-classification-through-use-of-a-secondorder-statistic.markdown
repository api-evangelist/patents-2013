title: Multiple-frequency signal classification through use of a second-order statistic
abstract: A multi-frequency (also known as multiple-frequency) signal, such as a dual-tone signal, can be a repeating signal that indicates a character designated on a keypad. The signal can be processed such that the character is identifiable. This processing can include using first and second-order statistics of the signal to determine an estimated average frequency of the signal. A table can be accessed that lists individual characters of the keypad and specific average frequency values can be associated with the individual characters. The specific average frequency value that is closest to the estimated average frequency can be identified and the character associated with this closest specific average frequency value can be appointed as the character indicated by the signal. Thus, the multi-frequency signal can be classified as communicating the appointed character.

A transmitter can send out a communication signal. A receiver that receives the communication signal whether the receiver is a receiver intended by the transmitter or not can attempt to process the communication signal. Processing of this signal can be a relatively long process. Further if a specific piece of information is desired from the signal then it can be considered resource intensive to decode the whole single for the piece of information.

A system is disclosed comprising an identification component configured to identify an average frequency of a multi frequency signal. The system also comprises a determination component configured to determine a data set associated with the multi frequency signal through use of the average frequency where the data set is outputted and where the identification component the determination component or a combination thereof is at least in part implemented through non software.

Another system is disclosed comprising a computation component a correlation component a causation component and a processor. The estimation component can be configured to make an estimation of an average of a high frequency of a dual tone frequency signal and a low frequency of the dual tone frequency signal where the estimation is made through use a second order statistic of the dual tone frequency signal. The correlation component can be configured to make a correlation of the average with a character. The causation component can be configured to cause an output of the character. The processor can be configured to execute at least one instruction associated with the computation component the correlation component the causation component or a combination thereof.

Yet another system is disclosed comprising a non transitory computer readable medium configured to store processor executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method. The method can comprise correlating an estimated average frequency of a dual tone frequency signal with a key of a digital communication keypad where the dual tone frequency signal comprises a high frequency and a low frequency that is different from the high frequency and where the average frequency is an average of the high frequency and the low frequency. The method can additionally comprise causing an output of the key after the correlation.

A multi frequency also known as multiple frequency signal such as a dual tone signal can be a repeating signal that indicates a character designated on a keypad. The signal can be processed such that the character is identifiable. This processing can include using first and second order statistics of the signal to determine an estimated average frequency of the signal. A table can be accessed that lists individual characters of the keypad and specific average frequency values can be associated with the individual characters. The specific average frequency value that is closest to the estimated average frequency can be identified and the character associated with this closest specific average frequency value can be appointed as the character indicated by the signal. Thus the multi frequency signal can be classified as communicating the appointed character.

Aspects disclosed herein can be related to communications and signal detection. Aspects can be used to detect a dual tone multi frequency or other signal used for synchronizing patterns and preambles preceding user data in data communications protocols signaling information in telephony as well as radio communications supervisory audio tones in cellular telephony predefined bit sequences on a specific channel that provides phase reference of other associated channels etc.

In one example a system can be is transmitting voice data image or video. Embedded in this signal can be one or more synchronizing patterns which identify the beginning of a frame or form a preamble to user data a predefined bit sequence that provides a timing reference signaling information etc. These synchronizing signals can be at least in part a dual tone multi frequency signal. Aspects disclosed herein can be used to detect the dual tone multi frequency signal without decoding the signal.

Component may include a software controlled microprocessor a discrete component an analog circuit a digital circuit a programmed logic device a memory device containing instructions and so on.

The instructions may be embodied in various forms including routines algorithms modules methods threads and or programs including separate applications or code from dynamically linked libraries.

The determination component can be configured to determine a data set e.g. a piece of information associated with the multi frequency signal through use of the average frequency and the system can output the data set. In one embodiment the data set e.g. one or more pieces of data can be a key of a telephone number pad e.g. 0 9 A D and . Different keys of the telephone number pad can associated with different average frequencies. Below is an example table of keys associated with different average frequencies as well as low and high frequencies that can produce a particular average frequency.

In one embodiment the multi frequency signal is an information portion of a communication signal. In one embodiment the multi frequency signal is a synchronizing signal and a repeating signal. The multi frequency signal can be a header of the communication signal. The header can contain identifying information of a sender of the communication signal an indication of other information contained of the communication signal identifying information of an intended recipient of the communication signal etc.

In one embodiment the best matching frequency is identical to the average frequency. For example the average frequency can be 1087 Hz. This matches directly for the average frequency of the character 3 in the table above. In one embodiment the best matching frequency is the nearest frequency to the average frequency but not an exact match. For example the average frequency can be 1093 Hz. Since this is closest to 1094 Hz the average frequency in the example table for the character 8 then the match component can designate the 1094 Hz as the best matching frequency for 1093 Hz. In turn the determination component can determine that the data set is the character 8. 

In one embodiment the calculation component can calculate the first order statistic and that first order statistic can include the high frequency and the low frequency of the multi frequency signal. The calculation component can also calculate the second order statistic and that second order statistic can include the high frequency the low frequency and an estimated average frequency. A mathematical operation such as subtraction can be performed with the first order statistic and the second order statistic to cancel out the low frequency and the high frequency such that the estimated average frequency is isolated and thus identified by the identification component .

As discussed above the average frequency of the multi frequency signal may be determined through use of a second order statistic and thus the average frequency can be an estimated average frequency. Since estimates can be used as opposed to accurate values there may be a possibility that the average frequency identified by the identification component is not correct. In one example an average frequency of 1042 Hz can be in between the average frequencies for 7 and 5. In one embodiment if the determination component determines that the data set is 7 this may have low probability due to the closeness of the underlying average frequency to that of 5. Therefore the output component can produce an error report if the probability is too low where probability is based on a result from the comparison component . In one embodiment the output component can output the data set along with an associated probability of being correct or output the data set.

In one embodiment the identification component the determination component confidence component and the comparison component work in conjunction together. The identification component can identify the average frequency. The comparison component can compare the average frequency with the average frequencies of the example table and for the comparisons a correctness likelihood can be established. The confidence component can identify a highest matching likelihood and or likelihoods that meet a threshold and the results of this identification can be used by the determination component to determine the data set.

In one embodiment the confidence component comparison component and or output component operate after operation of the identification component but before operation of the determination component . In one example the identification component can identify the average frequency through estimation. At that point the confidence component comparison component and or the output component can function with regard to a likelihood of the estimated average frequency being accurate. In one embodiment the confidence component comparison component and or the output component operate after operation of the identification component and the determination component . In one example the confidence component comparison component and or the output component can function with regard to a likelihood of the data set determined being accurate.

In one embodiment the estimation component estimates the average and then makes the average accessible to the causation component . The correlation component can make the correlation through use of the example table discussed above as a look up table perform a query to determine a closest corresponding known average associated with a candidate character e.g. individual keys of the key column of the table that can be appointed as the character etc. In one example the estimation component estimates the average and then causes retention of the average in a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium can also retain the example table discussed above. The correlation component can access the average and the example table from the computer readable medium. The correlation component can then find a closest counterpart of the average in the average frequency column of the example table. The correlation component can determine the character that is associated with the closest counterpart and as such appoint that the character. The correlation component can inform the causation component of the appointed character and the causation component can disclose the appointed character to an identified location.

In one embodiment the correlation component correlates the average by identifying a best matching frequency for the average on a frequency look up table e.g. the example table above and identifying a candidate character that is associated with the best matching frequency. In one example the correlation component can individually compare the average with the sixteen average frequency entries of the example table as part of the correlation. This comparison can include performing a subtraction between the average and individual entries of the sixteen average frequency entries. The correlation component can determine which of the sixteen average frequency entries has the smallest absolute value result from the subtraction as part of the correlation. The correlation component as part of the correlation can designate a key associated with the average frequency with the smallest absolute value result as the character and instruct the causation component to cause output of the character. The causation component can follow this instruction and cause output of the character.

In one embodiment the estimated average frequency can be close to two average frequencies of the example table. The method can correlate at with a closer average frequency of the two but this may result in a low confidence. The method can re perform the correlation returning to with the less close of the two close two average frequencies. The method can make the determinations at with the less close average frequency and if the confidence is high enough then action can occur. In one embodiment if the threshold is not met and or a set number of key determination iterations are made e.g. neither of the two close frequencies have enough confidence to be used then an error report can be outputted at where the error report indicates a key communicated by the dual tone frequency signal is not able to be determined e.g. the error report can indicate that two close average frequencies were correlated but neither have a high enough confidence level .

In one embodiment the dual tone frequency signal is an information portion of a communication signal. In one embodiment the dual tone signal is a synchronizing signal and a repeating signal. In one embodiment the dual tone frequency signal from which the correlation is based is a processed dual tone frequency signal subjected to band pass filtering and subjected to zero padding.

The first order spectrum of Equation 2 can produce the first order statistic discussed above and the second order spectrum of Equation 3 can produce the second order statistic discussed above. In the first order spectrum high magnitudes e.g. peaks can be observed at the lower frequency franged between 697 Hz and 941 Hz and at the higher frequency franged between 1209 Hz and 1633 Hz. A low magnitude e.g. non peaks can be observed at the first order middle frequency or average frequency

The amplitudes of the first and the second order spectral can be obtained using a Fast Fourier transform of yand z denoted by Yand Z respectively. Where Zis the first order spectrum associated to EQ. 2 m 1 . . . 2 and Yis the second order spectrum associated to EQ. 3 m 1 . . . 2. A test function e.g. an estimation of the average frequency can be generated at by taking the first 2frequency items from both Yand Zto form 2for 7 where the index m is the same as the index used in Z and mand mare corresponding to frequencies fand f respectively. The DTMF can be detected by searching for m m min such that dhas a minimum magnitude reversed spectral peak in a given frequency domain. Thus a test score e.g. that can be used to determine a confidence level can be calculated at through use of 8 

The test score dcan also be used to be the confidence measurement of the detection. The more negative the value of d the higher confidence the detection decision can be. Therefore a threshold T e.g. chosen by a designer can be used to control the confidence of the detection at as shown below 9 

The frequency associated to dis denoted by fand is the test result contributed by both the first order and second order spectra to match a list of average frequency fin the example table so that the DTMF is detected by a best match. In one example if dis greater than T then a successful detection is reported at . Otherwise a failure is reported at . illustrates one embodiment of a first graph illustrates one embodiment of a second graph and illustrates one embodiment of a third graph . The graphs show an example detection of potential DTMF keys 1 2 3 A 4 5 6 B 7 8 9 C 0 and D . In the simulation a DTMF signal described by EQ. 4 can generated from 0 to 3 milliseconds. The sampling frequency fis 8 165 Hz with 25 xsamples. The value yis obtained by extending the data length of xto 64 samples and the value zis obtained by extending xto 128 samples using zero padding. The threshold can be chosen as 10. The DTMF key 1 which is described by
