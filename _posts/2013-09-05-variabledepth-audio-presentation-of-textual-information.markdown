The present invention relates to data processing and more specifically to personalized audio presentation of textual information as synthesized human speech.

As data processing systems such as computers mobile phones cameras gaming systems vehicle computers and the like have become pervasive users of such data processing systems have come to expect and rely upon access via the Internet to various resources such as information executable programs and services. The resources accessible via the Internet include for example news and weather reports financial information and financial transactions various applications apps mapping services data backup management and storage services video and audio entertainment information services and feeds and various knowledge bases e.g. dictionaries encyclopedias real estate listings etc. . User access to these and other resources available via the Internet is encouraged by making many of these resources available at low or no cost to the user.

Although resources accessible via the Internet commonly include or are provided in conjunction with image and or video content a significant proportion of the resources accessible via the Internet are provided as or in conjunction with textual content. Consequently many of the resources of the Internet have been effectively inaccessible or unusable by users that are either temporarily or permanently unable to read such textual content for example due to the temporary inability of the user to view the textual content e.g. while driving an automobile or visual impairment of the user.

In at least some embodiments a user s access to the textual content of resources available on the Internet is promoted by enabling a personalized audio presentation of the textual content as synthesized speech.

In at least some embodiments each of a plurality of stations has a respective sequence of tracks of Internet content of common subject matter and a respective play pointer indicating a location in the sequence of tracks. In response to a first input the presentation mode of the station is configured in a continuous play mode in which the play pointer is progressed through the sequence of tracks queued to the station regardless of whether or not the station is presently selected for presentation. In response to a second input the presentation mode is configured in a pause play mode in which the play pointer is progressed through the sequence of tracks queued to the station only while the station is selected for presentation to a user and otherwise pauses progression of the play pointer. The processor transmits tracks of the station and progresses the play pointer in accordance with the configured presentation mode.

In at least some embodiments a respective sequence of tracks of Internet content of common subject matter is queued to each of a plurality of stations where each of the tracks of Internet content resides on a respective Internet resource in textual form. In response to receiving a sample input snippets of each of multiple tracks queued to a selected station among the plurality of stations is transmitted for audible presentation as synthesized human speech where each of the snippets includes only a subset of a corresponding track. Thereafter one or more complete tracks among the multiple tracks for which snippets were previously transmitted are transmitted for audio presentation as synthesized human speech.

In at least some embodiments a selected track among the sequence of tracks queued to a selected station among the plurality of stations includes multiple items of specific information all related to the common subject matter of the selected station. In response to receiving an in depth input during presentation of the selected track as synthesized human speech automatically searching for and accessing additional textual Internet content concerning one of the multiple items of specific information and queuing the additional Internet content to the selected station for presentation in one or more additional tracks.

It may also generally exclude some of the input devices and sensors shown in DPS .

With reference now to there is illustrated a layer diagram of an exemplary software configuration of data processing system of in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated the software configuration of data processing system includes at a lowest level an operating system OS that provides a collection of services such as thread scheduling memory management interrupts etc. that may be accessed by higher level software. Running on top of operating system may be an optional runtime environment such as one of the JAVA or BREW runtime environments. Finally the software configuration of data processing system includes a client application and optionally a browser running on top of operating system and if present runtime environment . In various embodiments client application may be preinstalled on data processing system or may be downloaded to data processing system from server computer system or a third party service provider for example over the air via the wireless WAN and WAN wireless transceiver and or Internet .

As illustrated client application comprises a number of individual modules each executed to perform a function of data processing system . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the illustrated modules are illustrative rather than exhaustive and that client application may include additional or alternative modules to support or extend the functionality of data processing system .

As shown in the modules within client application preferably include a visual presentation module that manages the presentation of a graphical user interface of client application within display and handles inputs received via the graphical user interface. An exemplary graphical user interface that may be presented by client application or browser is depicted in .

An audio presentation module is preferably equipped to audibly present as synthesized human speech textual information of a resource resident in or accessed from Internet or another network . The textual information in each resource e.g. web page email message blog post Twitter tweet Facebook post forms an individual audio track. In some embodiments audio presentation module may present audio tracks directly from audio files such as MP3 or MP4 files received from server computer system . In other embodiments client application may receive information to be presented by audio presentation module in an alternative format such as a textual format. In such embodiments client application includes a text to speech converter and audio presentation module presents in audio format audio files and or audio streams received from text to speech converter following conversion of the information. As will be appreciated text to speech converter may also provide automated language translation of textual content from a source human language to a receptor human language and such translation can be subject to user configuration.

Client application preferably further includes a browser interface module that receives from browser designations of textual information accessed via browser that the user desires to be audibly presented as synthesized human speech by client application . Illustrative techniques by which the textual information can be designated by a user are described in greater detail below with reference to .

A backend communication module supports communication between client application and a server application see e.g. running on server computer system . Backend communication module receives information from resources in or accessed from Internet and if the information is in a textual format passes the information to text to speech converter and if the information has already been converted from a textual format into an audio format e.g. by server application passes the information directly to audio presentation module . Backend communication module also communicates to server application application settings preferences and inputs received by client application .

Client application optionally but preferably includes a contextual awareness module that receives substantially real time contextual information e.g. GPS and or WAN location information time information automotive inputs provided by automobile weather information news information route information from a mapping service video or still camera inputs etc. . Based on the content and priority of the contextual information contextual awareness module may provide one or more tracks of contextual information to audio presentation module for inclusion within e.g. interruption of the sequence of audio tracks presented by audio presentation module . An exemplary method of presenting automotive inputs in a stream of audio tracks of Internet content is described in greater detail below with reference to .

Referring now to there is depicted a layer diagram of at least a portion of an exemplary software configuration of server computer system of . In some embodiments server computer system may optionally implement one or more unillustrated lower level software or virtualization layers e.g. a virtual machine manager VMM . At a still relatively low level the software configuration of server computer system further includes an operating system OS which is preferably one of the commercially available operating systems such as Windows UNIX LINUX AIX etc. OS has an associated application programming interface API though which middleware if present and application programs may access the services of OS .

Running on top of OS is a hypertext transport protocol HTTP server which as is well known in the art communicates data over Internet utilizing HTTP. In particular HTTP server supports data communication with mobile phone client computer system and vehicle computer utilizing HTTP. Communication with server computer system may alternatively or additionally be conducted utilizing a sockets layer interface or other lower layer protocol running over IP.

Also running on top of OS is a server application that supports audio presentation by client application and or browser of personalized streams of Internet content formatted as synthesized human speech. As a organizational construct server application preferably employs a station model according to which Internet content having related subject matter is associated by users and or server application with various stations channels loosely analogous to over the air broadcast radio stations or television channels. Although server application may offer predefined stations e.g. Daily News Weather Sports Movie Reviews etc. server application preferably permits users to define and curate the contents of their own personal or shared stations and or permits users to subscribe to stations curated or shared by others. Thus each individual station s content may be as encompassing or as specific as desired by the user s having permission to curate the individual stations.

In the depicted embodiment server application includes a number of different modules that support the audio presentation service. In the depicted embodiment these modules include an account manager that manages accounts including the credentials permissions feature sets service levels etc. of various users of the audio presentation service supported by server application . Thus server application may offer the service to a plurality of users forming a user community may restrict the service or at least some features of the service to users that have been issued login IDs and passwords for accessing server application and may further offer the service or at least some features of the service in exchange for a subscription fee. Account manager may use the commonly used OAuth protocol to enable users to log in using credentials already established at other web services such as Google Facebook or Twitter.

Server application maintains associations between the various subject matters of Internet content and a plurality of user defined stations in a user station database . User station database additionally stores for each station the configuration of the station and a play pointer indicating a current location in a track from which Internet content is to be streamed. Server application additionally implements a content acquisition module that autonomously and continuously searches Internet and accesses freely available or subscription based textual content for presentation to users via the stations. To avoid dead air content acquisition module preferably prioritizes the acquisition of content for stations currently being listened to by users via client applications and or browsers but additionally preferably acquires and queues some content for stations that are not currently being listened to refreshing that content as needed to avoid the queued content becoming stale. In at least one embodiment content acquisition module includes an RSS Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication reader that obtains Internet content from the web feeds of various web sites in Internet .

The textual Internet content accessed by content acquisition module is optionally but preferably converted into synthesized human speech by a text to speech converter executing within server application or within a separate application executing on server computer system or a third party service provider . As noted above in an alternative embodiment text to speech conversion can alternatively be performed by a text to speech converter executing on a data processing system . As described above with reference to text to speech converter of client application text to speech converter of server application may further be configured to translate textual content not already in a user selected receptor language.

As further shown in server application includes a station streamer module that streams tracks of Internet content retrieved by content acquisition module preferably in audio format and after conversion to synthesized human speech by text to speech converter to client applications and or browsers executing on the data processing systems of various users via the appropriate stations identified in user station database . As described further below in some embodiments a presentation mode of each station can be individually configured in either a continuous play mode in which station streamer module progresses the play pointer at an appropriately selected rate through tracks of Internet content assigned to a station regardless of whether or not any users are presently listening to that station or a pause play mode in which station streamer module progresses play pointer through a sequence of tracks of Internet content queued for a particular station only when a user is listening to the station and otherwise pauses presentation of the sequence of tracks i.e. temporarily halts updates to play pointer until the user again listens to the station to which the tracks are queued.

Server application finally includes a front end communication module and an optional ad manager . Front end communication manager handles all incoming communication received from client applications and or browsers via HTTP server . Thus for example front end communication module receives and acts upon requests to change stations or to update application settings presentation modes user preferences station content etc. Ad manager if present places audio and or multimedia advertisements in the streams of tracks of Internet content transmitted by station streamer module to data processing systems . Ad manager can select the advertisements based on for example the user subscription level e.g. higher subscription prices may have fewer advertisements user preferences station content and contextual information received from contextual awareness module . For example ad manager may include within the stream of tracks to be transmitted to a given user restaurant and or hotel advertisements based on a time of day and a GPS or network location directional heading or other input reported by contextual awareness module . Similarly if the user is listening to a Home Improvement station ad manger may include within the stream of tracks for the Home Improvement station advertisements for appliances or home remodeling services based on the station content.

With reference now to there is illustrated an exemplary graphical user interface of a browser through which textual content of an Internet resource can be selected for audio presentation as synthesized human speech. Graphical user interface includes a window having a toolbar and a display pane . Toolbar includes conventional browser features such as a back button forward button reload button favorites bookmark button as well as window controls such as minimize button maximize button and close button . Toolbar further includes an address and search field in which IP addresses or URLs Universal Resource Locators can be entered to cause browser to present a desired web page within display pane or into which textual search terms may be entered to invoke operation of a search engine to compile a results page containing a hyperlinked list of resources of possible interest. When a web page that offers an RSS feed is presented in display pane address and search field includes RSS icon to indicate a RSS feed is available for that particular web page.

In accordance with some embodiments toolbar of browser is modified for example by a browser plug in or extension to enable a user to designate textual content of Internet resources for audio presentation via the audio presentation service supported by server application . For example in some embodiments the user can select RSS icon e.g. utilizing cursor or a touch input to open a dialog box that includes the option to add the RSS feed of the displayed web page to a desired station of the user. Alternatively or additionally the user can add all the textual content of the displayed web page to a desired station of the user by selecting a station button on toolbar . Alternatively or additionally the user can add only selected textual content of the webpage presented in display pane to a desired station by right clicking or otherwise selecting textual content of webpage and then navigating a primary pop up window and secondary pop up window to designate the desired station e.g. Tech .

In addition to the three modalities of selection of textual content of an Internet resource for audio presentation as synthesized human speech noted above which all rely on modification of the interface of a conventional browser the user may alternatively or additionally add selected textual content of the webpage presented in display pane to a desired station by selecting a share to station icon embedded in the web page itself. Thus web page publishers can encourage audio presentation of their textual content even if a user s browser lacks an explicit tool to add the textual content to a station. Such web page publishers may also choose to provide an already converted to speech version of the content for delivery through a third party service provider .

Referring now to there is depicted an exemplary graphical user interface of a client application or browser though which a user can control the audio presentation of textual content of an Internet resource. Graphical user interface can be presented in the display of a data processing system for example in response to the user opening client application e.g. by selecting an associated icon on a desktop or by navigating to a player page of a service website on server computer system utilizing browser of data processing system .

Graphical user interface includes a number of fields buttons and controls by which a user can manage their personal and or shared stations add content to stations and or control the listening experience. Although exemplary fields buttons and controls are illustrated and described those skilled in the art will appreciate that the described functionality can alternatively be achieved through multiple GUI screens rather than a single one as shown and can optionally employ different numbers and or types of GUI elements.

In the depicted example a user manages stations via text field and buttons . In particular the user can enter a station name into text field and then add the station to the list of the user s personal stations maintained in user station database by selecting add button or delete the station from the list of the user s personal stations by selecting delete button . Further the user can change of the presentation mode of the identified station between continuous play mode and pause play mode by toggling presentation mode button . As noted above in the continuous play mode station streamer module progresses play pointer through tracks of Internet content assigned to the selected station regardless of whether or not the user is presently listening to that station. Station streamer module can control the rate at which it progresses play pointer through the content queued on the station based on the rate at which content is being added to the station. In contrast in the pause play mode station streamer module progresses play pointer through a sequence of tracks of Internet content queued to the selected station only when the user is listening to the station and otherwise pauses presentation of the sequence of tracks and temporarily halts updates to play pointer until the user again listens to the station. These presentation modes are further described below with reference to .

In the depicted example a user can add content to a station via text fields . These fields can be utilized to supplement the direct selection of textual content described above with reference to . For example the user enters the station name in text field and then designates content for addition to the station by entering an IP address URL or the name of a bookmark of browser in text field . The user can alternatively or additionally designate content for addition to the station by entering keywords in text field . It should be understood that the Internet content can include the user s own library of content residing either on the user s data processing system on a network accessible drive or in the cloud. Thus for example the Internet content may include but preferably is not restricted to the user s own email messages Twitter feed documents e books etc. In response to entry of information in field and or field client application or browser passes the information entered in field and or to server application . Content acquisition module of server application then utilizes the information to search for and or to access additional textual Internet content for presentation on the selected station of the user.

The user can control his or her individual listening experience for a particular station utilizing controls . That is settings of controls are preferably customizable on a station by station basis but in some embodiments can be applied to multiple of the user s stations. In text field the user enters the name of station to which the user desires to listen. In response to entry of a valid station name in text field client application or browser communicates the station name and a presentation request to server application which responds by causing station streamer module to stream a sequence of tracks of Internet content to the user s data processing system for presentation by audio presentation module of client application or by browser . The user can mute or un mute the station by toggling mute button and can further adjust the volume of the presentation utilizing slider . The user can also control the speed rate of playback using slider .

In accordance with a preferred embodiment the user can control the subject matter depth and duration of a presentation of the content associated with a selected station utilizing controls . For example using slider the user can control the default subject matter depth of the selected station. In response to selection of a smaller depth station streamer module presents fewer and or shorter tracks regarding the general subject matter associated with the selected station and conversely station streamer module presents more and or longer tracks regarding the general subject matter associated with the selected station in response to selection of a greater depth. If the station to which the user is listening is currently presenting a track of particular interest to the user the user may select In Depth Now button to cause content acquisition module to acquire and station streamer module to stream more in depth content related to the specific subject matter of the current track. For example if the selected station is a History channel and the current track mentions a historical figure the user can select In Depth Now button to request server application to provide more in depth information regarding the historical figure which may be for example a biographical sketch from an Internet encyclopedia.

The user may also desire to limit the scope of information provided on a given topic either due to time limitations or desire for greater breadth at the expense of depth. In such cases the user may utilize slider to indicate a level of automated content summarization to be applied to the Internet content prior to presentation. In various embodiments the automated content summarization can be performed by client application server application or a third party service provider . The user may also enter a desired audio program duration in text field which may correspond for example to the anticipated duration of an automobile trip. In response to receipt of the desired program duration station streamer module may tailor the length depth and summarization of a collection of tracks of Internet content to achieve the desired overall audio program duration.

If the user wants to gauge his or her interest in listening to the station the user may also toggle Sample Now button . In response to the user toggling button station streamer module streams a brief snippet e.g. 5 10 s of each of multiple e.g. 5 10 tracks queued for presentation on that station. Based on interest in the snippets presented the user can then decide to change the station using text field or can again toggle button to cause station streamer module to begin full presentation of the tracks that were sampled. One exemplary implementation of the track sampling feature of the audio presentation service is described below in greater detail with reference to .

GUI further includes radio buttons that permit the user to select either a male or female voice for rendering the synthesized speech presentation of the Internet content. The user can further adjust the degree of emotional inflection in the synthesized speech utilizing slider . If the user desires to hear tracks related to a variety of different subject matter the user can cause station streamer module to shuffle tracks between stations by toggling shuffle button . The user can also cause station streamer module to replay a track from the beginning or skip to the next track by selecting buttons and respectively. The user can confirm interest in the subject matter of a track by selecting button or if a track is not of interest can so indicate by selecting button . Content acquisition module can select additional Internet content to acquire based on the level of user interest reflected by the inputs received via buttons . If the user wants to associate content currently being presented and related content with a new or different station the user can redirect such content by selecting button which opens a control that enables the user to specify the new or existing station on which the content is to be presented. In this manner the user is able to craft and curate the content of each station in accordance with his or her individual preferences.

GUI finally preferably includes controls that control the influence of context on the listening experience. In the illustrated example GUI includes radio buttons that enable the user to enable and disable the inclusion of station content selected based at least in part on contextual awareness information e.g. reported by contextual awareness module . The user may further control the relative priority of contextually influenced content when enabled with respect to other content utilizing slider . Thus for example at lower levels of contextual priority a contextually influenced track e.g. a restaurant review of a nearby restaurant may only be presented if the user is listening to a station playing related content e.g. a Local Attractions station . However at higher levels of contextual priority a contextually influenced track e.g. mapping service directions to a chosen destination e.g. Take the exit to the right. or information regarding a nearby historical site make break in to the regular stream of tracks of the station currently being listened to regardless of its content.

With reference now to there is illustrated a high level block logical flowchart of an exemplary method of audio presentation of textual content of an Internet resource as synthesized human speech in accordance with one embodiment. The process begins at block and the proceeds to block which illustrates a user curating the content of one or more stations for example utilizing GUI of to provide the relevant inputs to server application . The curation of the station s enables the user to develop and maintain personalized stations each providing a respective stream of tracks of relevant Internet content. At block content acquisition module of server application accesses textual Internet content relevant to the user and associates the Internet content with one or more stations and then station streamer module streams tracks of content associated with at least one station to the user s data processing system . As further noted in block the textual Internet content is also transformed into synthesized speech and optionally translated for example by text to speech converter or . Following conversion into synthesized speech the tracks of Internet content associated with a currently selected station are presented to the user for example by browser or audio presentation module of client application .

Referring now to there is depicted a high level block logical flowchart of an exemplary method of controlling a presentation mode of an audio presentation of textual content of an Internet resource. The process begins at block and then proceeds to block which depicts server application initializing a given station of a user to a default presentation mode such as the continuous play mode and then recording the presentation mode in user station database . As indicated at block and while a station is in the continuous play mode station streamer module progresses play pointer through tracks of Internet content assigned to the station at a predetermined rate e.g. a simulated rate at which the content would be presented in audio format regardless of whether or not the user is presently listening to that station. In this manner the station follows the paradigm of conventional over the air broadcast media such as radio and television.

In response to front end communication module of server application receiving a request to change the presentation mode e.g. where the mode change request is generated in response to the user toggling button of GUI at block server application modifies the presentation mode of the station in user database to the pause play mode as shown at block . While the station is configured in the pause play mode station streamer module progresses play pointer through a sequence of tracks of Internet content queued to the station only while the station is selected for presentation and otherwise pauses presentation of the sequence of tracks and temporarily halts updates to play pointer until the user again selects the station as illustrated at blocks . In response to server application receiving a mode change request for a station in the pause play mode the process of returns to block which has been described.

With reference now to there is depicted a high level logical flowchart of an exemplary method of presenting a variable depth audio presentation of textual content of an Internet resource. The process begins at block in response to receipt by server application of an input from a user s data processing system . The process then proceeds to block which illustrates server application determining whether or not a sample input has been received for example in response to a user selecting Sample Now toggle button in GUI of . In response to server application determining at block that the received input is not a sample input the process passes to block which is described below.

Returning to block in response to server application determining that a sample input has been received station streamer module begins transmission to the user s data processing system for audio presentation to the user a sequence of snippets e.g. 5 10 s each from multiple tracks in the sequence of tracks queued for the user s currently selected station block . These snippets can also be summarized versions of the tracks as obtained from an external third party service or from the content publisher. The process then proceeds to blocks which illustrate server application monitoring for the first to occur of any of three events namely receipt from the user s data processing system of a full presentation input e.g. toggling of Sample Now toggle button requesting full presentation of one of the sampled tracks block the completion of transmission and or presentation of all of the sequence of snippets block and receipt from the user s data processing system of an input changing the station block .

In response to a determination at block that receipt of an input changing the station is the first event to occur processing continues at block for example by station streamer module beginning to stream full tracks of Internet content in a different station selected by the user. Thereafter the process passes to block . However in response to determining at block that a full presentation input is first received server application initiates streaming of a sequence of full tracks in the currently selected station beginning with the track from which a snippet was being presented when the user entered the full presentation input block . Thereafter processing continues at block .

In response to determining at block that all snippets in the sequence of snippets have been presented prior to receipt of an input changing the station or an input requesting full presentation server application initiates streaming of a sequence of full tracks on the station beginning with the first track from which an audio snippet was presented in response to the user entering the sample input block . Thereafter processing continues at block .

Referring now to block while streaming a sequence of full tracks of Internet content to the user s data processing system for audio presentation as synthesized human speech server application determines whether or not an in depth input has been received from the user s data processing system for example in response to the user selecting In Depth Now button . The in depth input signifies the user s interest in receiving additional information regarding one of a plurality of items of specific information found in the current track. In response to a negative determination at block the process passes to block which is described below. However in response to an affirmative determination at block server application causes content acquisition module to acquire and station streamer module to stream more in depth content related to the subject matter of an item of specific information found in the current track for example one presented substantially contemporaneously with selection of In Depth Now button block . If contextual awareness is enabled via radio buttons the selection of the subject matter of the more in depth content can also be made based at least in part on contextual information such as the location of the user s data processing system . In one embodiment server application selects the depth for example in terms of the number of supplementary tracks elaborating on the subject matter of the item of specific information the duration of the supplementary tracks and the summarization applied to the supplementary tracks based on the setting specified by sliders and in GUI . Following presentation of the in depth tracks the presentation of the regular tracks of the more general Internet content on the station resumes and the process continues at block .

Referring now to block in response to server application determining that the received input is neither a sample input nor an in depth input server application performs other processing as appropriate for the received input.

At block server application determines whether the number of tracks that have been acquired by content acquisition module for the station to which the user is currently listening and that remain to be streamed to the user s data processing system is less than a lower threshold. If not station streamer module continues to stream tracks of the station to the user s data processing system and the process continues at block . In response to a determination at block that the number of acquired tracks that remain to be stream is less than the lower threshold server application causes content acquisition module to automatically acquire and station streamer module to stream additional tracks of Internet content related to the subject matter of the currently selected station block . Thereafter the process continues at block .

Referring now to there is depicted a high level logical flowchart of an exemplary method of audibly presenting an automotive message in accordance with the embodiment. The illustrated process can be performed for example by a vehicle computer or another data processing system that is in communication with vehicle computer and that is executing client application or browser as previously described in order to provide an audio presentation of Internet content in the format of synthesized human speech.

The process of begins at block and then proceeds to block which illustrates a client application or browser running on a data processing system audibly presenting an synthesized human speech presentation of a stream of tracks of Internet content for a station currently selected by the user. As discussed above the presentation can be made for example via speaker of data processing system or via PPS of automobile . At block the client application or browser running on a data processing system monitors for receipt of an automotive input. The automotive input may comprise for example travel directions from a mapping program or service information concerning availability of roadside services or accommodations automotive service or maintenance information e.g. oil change notification tire pressure fuel or electric charge level roadway information e.g. current speed limit roadway congestion notification alternative route safety notifications e.g. lane departure warning notification collision avoidance notification adverse roadway or weather conditions etc. . In the case of client application automotive inputs can be received for example by contextual awareness module .

In response to a determination at block that no automotive input has been received the client application or browser continues to present in audio synthesized speech format the stream of tracks of Internet content associated with the currently selected station as shown at block . In response to a determination at block that data processing system has received an automotive input client application or browser determines a priority of the automotive input at block . For example client application or browser may assign safety notifications a high priority that mandates immediate presentation on any of the user s stations and thus interruption of the current track currently being presented no matter which station is being presented. In some embodiments roadway information or travel directions may be assigned a medium priority that indicates presentation of the automotive input following the conclusion of the current track. Routine service or maintenance information may be assigned a lower priority that allows presentation to be deferred up to a predetermined time interval e.g. two hours or until the user changes station. In at least some embodiments the user can specify priorities for one or more classes of automotive inputs and can further associate particular automotive inputs with the classes. User behavior upon playback of automotive input messages can also be used to guide the system to automatically learn the priority associated with messages and stations.

At block client application or browser schedules and audibly presents e.g. utilizing predetermined tracks of synthesized speech or an audible alarm sound the automotive input in the current station based on the priority of the automotive input determined at block . Thereafter the process of continues at block .

As has been described in some embodiments each of a plurality of stations has a respective sequence of tracks of Internet content of common subject matter and a respective play pointer indicating a location in the sequence of tracks. In response to a first input the presentation mode of the station is configured in a continuous play mode in which the play pointer is progressed through the sequence of tracks queued to the station regardless of whether or not the station is presently selected for presentation. In response to a second input the presentation mode is configured in a pause play mode in which the play pointer is progressed through the sequence of tracks queued to the station only while the station is selected for presentation to a user and otherwise pauses progression of the play pointer. The processor transmits tracks of the station and progresses the play pointer in accordance with the configured presentation mode.

In at least some embodiments a respective sequence of tracks of Internet content of common subject matter is queued to each of a plurality of stations where each of the tracks of Internet content resides on a respective Internet resource in textual form. In response to receiving a sample input snippets of each of multiple tracks queued to a selected station among the plurality of stations is transmitted for audible presentation as synthesized human speech where each of the snippets includes only a subset of a corresponding track. Thereafter one or more complete tracks among the multiple tracks for which snippets were previously transmitted are transmitted for audio presentation as synthesized human speech.

In at least some embodiments a selected track among the sequence of tracks queued to a selected station among the plurality of stations includes multiple items of specific information all related to the common subject matter of the selected station. In response to receiving an in depth input during presentation of the selected track as synthesized human speech automatically searching for and accessing additional textual Internet content concerning one of the multiple items of specific information and queuing the additional Internet content to the selected station for presentation in one or more additional tracks.

While the present invention has been particularly shown as described with reference to one or more preferred embodiments it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example although embodiments have been disclosed with reference to an exemplary data processing environment in which provision of the audio presentation service employs a distributed client server paradigm in which a portable data processing system e.g. mobile phone client computer system or vehicle computer system implements the client and a possibly conventional server computer hardware can be utilized to implement the server in alternative implementations the client server paradigm of service provision can be adapted such that a mobile phone or other mobile data processing system can act as the server and the vehicle computer or another mobile data processing system can serve as the client. Alternatively the disclosed audio presentation service can be implemented on a single data processing system implementing the functionality of both client application and server application .

Further although aspects have been described with respect to a data processing system executing program code that directs the functions of the present invention it should be understood that present invention may alternatively be implemented as a program product including a storage device e.g. DRAM SRAM EEPROM ROM flash memory magnetic disk optical disk etc. storing program code that can be processed by a data processing system. As employed herein the term storage device should be construed according to its plain meaning as understood by those skilled in the art and is defined to exclude transient propagating signals per se. It should also be understood that the term exemplary means a characteristic or typical example of a feature not necessarily the absolute best or most desirable example. Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment an embodiment or similar language means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus the phrases in one embodiment in an embodiment and similar language throughout this specification may but do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.
