title: Container lift and leveling system
abstract: A system for vertically lifting and lowering a container relative to a supporting surface. The system includes at least two lift mechanisms wherein each mechanism includes a frame attached to the container. An elongated cylinder and piston is associated with each frame so that its axis is substantially vertical. A control circuit selectively connects a power source to each cylinder and piston to move the cylinder and piston between a retracted position in which the piston is spaced upwardly from the supporting surface and an extended position in which a foot on the piston engages the supporting surface and lifts the container upwardly from the supporting surface.

This application claims the benefit of priority of provisional application Ser. No. 61 625 769 filed on Apr. 18 2012.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

Shipping containers are widely used to ship goods of all sorts throughout the world. These shipping containers typically are rectangular in shape and standardized in size. As such these containers fit on a wide variety of transport devices such as boats trains and trucks.

The shipping containers are oftentimes temporarily stored on a ground support surface. Consequently in order to position the shipping container on a flatbed truck it is often necessary to bring in additional equipment in order to lift the container onto the flatbed truck. For example a crane or forklift is oftentimes used to lift the container onto a flatbed truck.

Unfortunately the loading equipment e.g. a crane or forklift truck may not be readily available when needed to load the container onto the flatbed truck which introduces additional delays in the shipment of the goods. Furthermore the operation of such lifting equipment requires specialized and highly trained personnel. Such personnel may not be readily available and if available add to the overall cost of transporting the container with its cargo.

In addition to shipping cargo such containers are oftentimes used by the military and others for specialized purposes such as a mobile laboratory or mobile communication unit. In such cases it is oftentimes necessary to protect the container against impacts which may damage such mobile devices. Unfortunately careful handling of the container and the avoidance of such impacts with the use of cranes and forklift trucks is oftentimes difficult to achieve. Consequently such mobile devices are oftentimes damaged in the process of loading the container onto a flatbed truck.

The present invention provides a container lift and leveling system that overcomes all of the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known containers.

In brief the system of the present invention includes at least two lift mechanisms. Each mechanism has a frame which is attached to the container. Preferably four lift mechanisms are attached to each container with one lift mechanism positioned adjacent each corner of the container.

An elongated cylinder and piston is associated with and attached to each frame. The cylinder and piston are oriented so that a longitudinal axis of the piston and cylinder extends in a generally vertical direction with the cylinder above the piston. A foot is attached to the distal or free end of the piston.

Each frame is pivotally mounted between an upper and a lower support block to the container so that the frame is pivotal between a storage position and an operational position. In its storage position the frame nests closely adjacent the container. Conversely in its operational position the frame with its associated piston and cylinder is spaced outwardly from the container.

A control circuit selectively powers the cylinder and pistons on the lift mechanisms to bring the container to a level position and or to an elevated position for loading the container onto or off from a truck. A two axis level sensor provides an input signal to the control circuit to facilitate the leveling of the container.

Since the entire level and lifting system of the present invention is self contained with the container the use of additional equipment such as a crane or forklift is unnecessary to both load the container onto a flatbed truck as well as to remove the container from a flatbed truck.

With reference first to a standard cargo container is shown. The cargo container is generally rectangular in shape. Furthermore the container is preferably of conventional size and as such usable on boats trains flatbed trucks and the like.

With reference now to a lift mechanism is associated with each corner of the container . The lift mechanism includes a frame which is pivotally mounted about a vertical axis between an upper support block and a lower support block . The support blocks are fixedly mounted to the container .

A turntable connects the frame to the support block . This turntable includes two 90 detents which ensure that the frame can be positioned in only two rotational positions i.e. the storage position shown in and the operational position shown in .

As best shown in the frame is thus pivotal between a storage position illustrated in and an operational position illustrated in . In its storage position the frame is nested closely adjacent the container . Preferably in its storage position a door on the container covers the lift mechanism and protects it from unintentional damage. Conversely in its operational position the frame protrudes laterally outwardly from the container .

Still referring to an elongated cylinder and piston assembly is secured to the frame so that the axis of the cylinder and piston assembly extends generally vertically. The cylinder and piston assembly includes a cylinder secured to the frame and a piston which extends telescopically longitudinally outwardly from its cylinder when powered foot is secured to the lower or free end of the piston .

As best shown in with the lift mechanisms in their operational position the application of power to the cylinder and piston assemblies causes the pistons to telescope downwardly so that the foot engages and lifts the container upwardly from a ground supporting surface . Conversely the container may be lowered by selectively retracting the pistons within their associated cylinders .

An electrical control system including storage batteries is contained within a compartment in the container . The batteries may also be charged by shore power portable generator or by the electrical system of a transport vehicle to enable the container to be functional as a laboratory command center or hospital immediately upon delivery.

With reference now particularly to phantom line with the frame in its operational position the frame is vertically slidably mounted between an upper position illustrated in a lower position illustrated in solid line. When the frame is in its operational position a top of the frame registers with a like shaped recess formed in the upper support mount . Thus as the pistons extend downwardly the frame lifts upwardly until its upper end is nested within the recess . The recess as well as the upper end of the frame are noncircular in shape so that the coaction between the frame and the recess locks the frame against pivotal movement when the frame is in its operational position and the container is elevated. Conversely when the pistons are retracted into their cylinder the weight of the frame causes the frame to move downwardly which allows the frame to pivot to its storage position illustrated in .

Preferably the cylinder and piston assemblies are hydraulic cylinder and piston assemblies and a control circuit illustrated in selectively controls the application of power to the various hydraulic power units and piston assemblies . However other types of cylinder and piston assemblies such as electric motor driven cylinder and piston assemblies or a centralized hydraulic power unit that provides hydraulic fluid to each individual cylinder and piston assembly may alternatively be employed without deviation from the spirit or scope of the invention.

With reference now to a hydraulic power unit is associated with each lift mechanism to selectively extend or retract the piston relative to its associated cylinder . The control circuit includes a control module which receives as an input signal a signal from a two axis level sensor . In response to the signal from the two axis level sensor as well as a control panel which a user utilizes to select the desired operation the control module controls the actuation of the hydraulic power units through a solenoid module .

In operation in order to move the cargo container upwardly to a load position relative to the ground support surface the frame with their associated cylinder and piston assemblies are first pivoted outwardly to their operational position and so that the detent for the turntable locks the frame in the operational position. The control panel which may be remote from the container is then utilized to select a lift operation. The control module then activates the power units for the lift mechanisms.

However in order to prevent actuation of the power unit unless all frames are positioned in their operational position a sensor is associated with each frame and provides an output signal to the control module only when its associated frame is in its operational position. Unless all four sensors provide the signal to the control module the control module disables all power units.

Upon the initial extension of the piston from its associated cylinder the cylinder and piston assembly first moves the frame upwardly so that it upper end engages the locking recess on the upper support to prevent further pivoting of the frame as shown in phantom line in . Thereafter the control module activates all power units which moves the cargo container to its elevated position illustrated in . This allows a flatbed truck to be driven underneath the cargo container. Thereafter the control panel is activated to lower the cargo container onto the flatbed truck by retracting the pistons into their associated cylinders . When fully retracted the frame for each lift mechanism slides vertically downwardly due to its own weight whereupon the frames with their attached cylinder and piston assemblies can be pivoted to their storage position and the doors closed.

If leveling is required after pressing the level button in the level remote controller the control module then selectively operates the power units in response to the signal from the two axis level sensor until the container is in a level position. Such leveling would be desirable for example if the container was used as a laboratory or mobile hospital.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a simple yet effective mechanism for elevating and lowering a cargo container. Having described our invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those of skill in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
