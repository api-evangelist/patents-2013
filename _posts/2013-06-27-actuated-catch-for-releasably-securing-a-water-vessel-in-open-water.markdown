The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the claimed invention may be manufactured used licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The following description relates generally to a method and apparatus for the releasable latching of a water vessel to a line in open water.

Larger parent ships often recover smaller surface water vessels such as manned or unmanned surface water vessels USN s . Once recovered by the parent ship servicing operations on the smaller vessels may be performed. Typically the recovery of a smaller vessel is accomplished by driving the smaller vessel alongside a stationary parent ship and lifting the smaller vessel by davit into the parent ship. Alternatively the smaller water vessel may be driven up a ramp into the larger ship.

Traditional methods of capturing smaller surface water vessels can cause damage to the hull of the smaller vessel. For example some USVs weigh about 20 000 pounds or more and are made from materials such as aluminum and the like. A capturing method that for example requires the USV to be driven into a parent ship in an uncontrolled manner can cause damage to the hull resulting in expensive repairs and loss of operation. Similarly smaller vessels may incur damage when driven alongside a parent ship prior to being lifted onto the ship.

The U.S. Navy has recently worked on different methods of securing water vessels in open water in locations remote from the parent ship avoiding unnecessary damage to the water vessels. U.S. Pat. No. 7 975 638 teaches one such application in which a water vessel is captured remotely from a parent ship by dropping a line into the open water. The line may be attached at one end to a parent ship and the water vessel drives at a relatively high speed over the line and in one or more attempts scoops up the line into a latching mechanism. It is desired to have an arrangement that captures a water vessel in a more controlled environment at reduced speeds.

In one aspect the invention is a water vessel for releasably capturing a substantially taut line. The water vessel has a hull body having a bow and an actuated catch attached at the bow of a water vessel. The actuated catch is positioned for capturing the line at about the water level. The actuated catch has a pivotable hook assembly having a substantially V shaped receiving portion for receiving the line therein. The pivotable hook assembly includes a substantially L shaped arm including a triangular claw and a protective shield attached to the substantially L shaped arm at a pivot point wherein the pivotable hook assembly is pivotable about the pivot point. The protective shield and the triangular claw are angled to form the substantially V shaped receiving portion. In this aspect the actuated catch also includes an actuator for pivoting the pivotable hook assembly about the pivot point from a release position to a retrieval and holding position. The actuated catch also has a spring biased retaining catch having a holding tip for maintain the line within the receiving portion when the pivotable hook assembly is in the retrieval and holding position and wherein the protective shield covers the holding tip when the pivotable hook assembly is in the release position.

In another aspect the invention is a system for the open water securing and towing a water vessel. The system includes a parent ship and a towing station attached to the parent ship via a first tow line. The towing station has a first arm and a second arm wherein the first and second arms define a substantially LT shaped opening for receiving a water vessel in a receiving direction. The towing station also has a line attached to each of the first and second arms so that the line is substantially taut and is substantially perpendicular to said receiving direction. In this aspect the system also includes a water vessel for releasably capturing the substantially taut line. The water vessel has a hull body having a bow. The water vessel has an actuated catch attached at the bow of the water vessel the actuated catch positioned for capturing the line at about the water level. The actuated catch has a pivotable hook assembly having a substantially V shaped receiving portion for receiving the line therein. The pivotable hook assembly has a substantially L shaped arm including a triangular claw and a protective shield attached to the substantially L shaped arm at a pivot point wherein the pivotable hook assembly is pivotable about said pivot point and wherein the protective shield and the triangular claw are angled to form the substantially V shaped receiving portion. The actuated catch also has an actuator for pivoting the pivotable hook assembly about the pivot point from a release position to a retrieval and holding position. Also included is a spring biased retaining catch for maintaining the line within the receiving portion when the pivotable hook assembly is in the retrieval and holding position. The protective shield covers the holding tip when the pivotable hook assembly is in the release position.

In another aspect the invention is a method of releasably capturing a line in open water. The method includes the providing of a parent ship the providing of a towing station connected to the parent ship via a first tow line. According to the method the towing station has a first arm and a second arm wherein the first and second arms define a substantially U shaped opening for receiving a water vessel in a receiving direction. The towing station also has a line attached to each of the first and second arms so that the line is substantially taut and is substantially perpendicular to said receiving direction. The method also includes the providing a of water vessel on the open water. The water vessel includes a hull body having a bow and an actuated catch attached at the bow of a water vessel. The actuated catch is positioned for capturing the line at about the water level and has a pivotable hook assembly having a substantially V shaped receiving portion for receiving the line therein. The pivotable hook assembly has a substantially L shaped arm including a triangular claw and a protective shield attached to the substantially L shaped arm at a pivot point wherein the pivotable hook assembly is pivotable about said pivot point and wherein the protective shield and the triangular claw are angled to form the substantially V shaped receiving portion. The actuated catch also includes an actuator for pivoting the pivotable hook assembly about the pivot point from a release position to a retrieval and holding position and a spring biased retaining catch having a holding tip for maintain the line within the receiving portion when the pivotable hook assembly is in the retrieval and holding position and wherein the protective shield covers the holding tip when the pivotable hook assembly is in the release position. In this aspect the method further includes propelling the parent ship thereby towing the towing station therebehind and setting the hook assembly of water vessel in a retrieval mode. The method also includes driving the water vessel at a greater speed than that of the parent ship so that the water vessel enters the substantially U shaped opening of the towing station and driving the water vessel over the substantially taut line so that said substantially taut line contacts and slides over the actuated catch onto a bow surface below the actuated catch. The method further includes throttling down the water vessel to stop or reduce the water velocity to a speed less than that of the parent ship so that the substantially taut line travels in a reverse direction with respect to the water vessel the substantially taut line riding up the bow onto the actuated catch wherein the substantially taut line presses down on the spring biased retaining catch and enters into the substantially V shaped receiving portion wherein the line is held by the hook assembly and the retaining catch so that the water vessel is securely attached to the towing station and is towed behind the parent ship.

As stated above in operation the parent ship pulls the towing station via the tow line and the water vessel attaches itself to the towing station so that the water vessel is also towed by the parent ship . The key to this arrangement is the ability of the water vessel to attach itself to the towing station . As shown schematically in the water vessel includes an actuated catch . The actuated catch captures the line therein securely fastening the water vessel to the towing station . as described below outline the different features of the actuated catch in two different modes of operation release mode and retrieval and holding mode.

The side view of also shows the internal elements of the actuated catch . For illustration purposes only the plate has been presented as transparent. As shown the device includes an actuator which includes an electrical motor . As shown the actuator is a pneumatic actuator or the like having an arm that extends and retracts from a cylinder . The actuator is pivotally attached at pivot point to a chassis support within the casing of the actuated catch . As outlined below the actuator may pivot about the pivot point to accommodate for the extension of the .

The arm of the actuator is attached to a link . As shown the other end of the link is attached to a hook assembly . The hook assembly is pivotally mounted about a pivot point . As outlined below when initiated the actuator arm extends into a channel pushing the link which in turn pushes and pivots the hook assembly about the pivot point . also shows a cam lock device .

Returning to as shown the actuated catch also includes a spring biased retaining catch pivotally mounted at pivot point . The retaining catch is biased so that when pushed inwards in direction shown by arrow the retaining catch moves in and pivots about the pivot point . When the force on the spring is released the catch returns to the original position. This process is outlined below with respect to . As outlined below with respect to in operation the retaining catch and the triangular claw help maintain the line within the substantially V shaped receiving portion .

As stated above the illustration in represents the actuated catch in a release mode. In release mode the actuated catch is in the position shown with the hook assembly is in a release position. In this release position both the triangular claw and the protective shield arm extending beyond the middle and bottom edge portions and of the plate . Thus if the hook assembly had been holding a line within the substantially V shaped portion that line would be free to slide out of the hook. It should be noted that the retaining catch is biased so that its default position also extends beyond the bottom edge portion of the plate . However in the release position the protective shield arm covers and protects the edge holding tip see of the retaining catch thereby preventing any debris from being caught in the device. It should be noted that because the protective shield arm covers the holding tip the holding tip is not visible in the illustration of however the holding tip can be seen in .

As stated above tracks the path of the line over the actuated catch and the bow when the water vessel is driven forward in direction X. shows the line in a first position Lwith respect to the water vessel then subsequent positions Land Letc. as the water vessel is moves forward in direction X. As shown the first four positions shown i.e. Lto Lrepresent positions along the waterline . shows the line making initial contact with the actuated catch at the middle edge portion at L. As the water vessel continues to move forward the line slides down the middle edge portion onto the bottom edge portion and finally onto the bow of the water vessel. The middle edge portion the bottom edge portion and the bow are angled to allow for a smooth transition of the line as it moves from the location of the initial contact Lto the position L which according to this particular embodiment is the location where the line progresses farthest down the bow . The line stops at Lbecause after initial contact with the line the water vessel is throttled down to stop or reduce the rate of forward movement. Consequently because of the towing station to which the line is attached at both ends is being pulled by the parent ship the towing station advances faster than the water vessel so after reaching location Lthe line is pulled in the opposite direction with respect to the water vessel 

The line capturing system operates in a similar manner to the system outlined above. Thus when the water vessel is directed over the line in direction Y shown in the actuated catch captures the line . According to this embodiment the parent ship and line are initially at rest when the water vessel drives over the line . The water vessel then comes to a stop. During the forward then stopping motion of the water vessel the line follows the path with respect to the bow shown in . Next the parent ship moves from forward from the initial stopped state. The combination of the forward motion of the ship and the shape of the how causes the line to move back to the actuated catch in the path shown in wherein the line is captured by the actuated catch as shown in .

It should be noted that the actuated catch is in the retrieval and holding mode when capturing and securely holding the line . If the line is to be released the actuated catch is switched to the release mode in which the hook assembly rotates down to the release position show in . The switching from release mode to retrieval and holding mode and vice versa may be performed by an operator. Apart from the switching from one mode to another in system shown in the actuated catch operates automatically based on the acceleration and subsequent throttling down of the water vessel without the requirement of sensors. In system shown in the actuated catch operates automatically based on the acceleration and subsequent stopping of the water vessel followed by the subsequent forward motion of the parent ship which was initially stationary also without the requirement of sensors.
