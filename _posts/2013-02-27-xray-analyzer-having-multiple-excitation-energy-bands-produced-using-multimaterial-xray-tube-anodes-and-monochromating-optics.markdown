title: X-ray analyzer having multiple excitation energy bands produced using multi-material x-ray tube anodes and monochromating optics
abstract: An x-ray tube includes a target on which electrons impinge to form a diverging x-ray beam. The target has a surface formed from first and second target materials, each tailored to emit a respective x-ray energy profile. A first x-ray optic may be provided for directing the beam toward the sample spot, the first x-ray optic monochromating the diverging x-ray beam to a first energy from the energy emitted by the first target material; and a second x-ray optic may be provided, for directing the beam toward the sample spot, the second x-ray optic monochromating the diverging x-ray beam to a second energy from the energy emitted by the second target material. Fluorescence from the sample spot induced by the first and second monochromated energies is used to measure the concentration of at least one element in the sample, or separately measure elements in a coating and underlying substrate.

This application is a national stage filing under section 371 of International Application No. PCT US2013 027910 filed on Feb. 27 2013 and published on Sep. 6 2013 as WO 2013 130525 A1. In addition this application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 604 251 filed Feb. 28 2012 both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Certain parts of this invention have been developed with the assistance of the National Science Foundation Grant No. IIP 0839615. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.

Current events e.g. the discovery of toxins in toys environmental air and water concerns and resulting regulations dictate an urgent need for an analyzer for toxic element determination. Advanced x ray fluorescence XRF analyzers can play a valuable role in the quantification of such toxins and many other substances of interest in a variety of samples e.g. toxins in consumer products and various harmful elements in petroleum products.

As one prominent example manufacturers suppliers distributors retailers and regulatory entities need a long term solution for toxic element analysis for a wide variety of consumer goods. Many new regulations require manufacturers to detect many elements such as lead Pb mercury Hg arsenic As cadmium Cd chromium Cr bromine Br selenium Se antimony Sb barium Ba and chlorine Cl . In the EU regulations the maximum concentration in a homogenous material is 1 000 ppm for hexavalent chromium Cr Hg Pb polybrominated biphenyl PBB and polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDE and 100 ppm for Cd. The new U.S. regulation CPSIA for children s products is much more restrictive. For example the maximum allowable lead level in toys and children s jewelry is less than or equal to 100 ppm in any accessible part of a product.

Current measurement methods are either accurate enough but not usable on the factory floor or they may be convenient for use on the factory floor but not close to being sufficiently sensitive or repeatable. As a result there is a need for a truly fit for purpose analyzer for this application. There is a strong market need for a rapid reliable convenient nondestructive high sensitivity quantitative cost effective analyzer to carry out critical and conclusive measurements with a single instrument in a manufacturing facility either at line or on line or any place in a distribution chain. Contaminated products can be eliminated at the most advantageous place in the process substantially mitigating or even eliminating accidental production waste and errors. There is also a strong need for a similar capability at several stages in the distribution and by regulators to verify the compliance of materials and products.

Existing low cost methods of toxin detection are generally ineffective e.g. swab tests. Higher cost methods that provide the requisite accuracy are expensive and time consuming. These methods may involve manually scraping samples digesting them in acids at elevated temperature and pressure introducing them into a combustion chamber and analyzing the combustion product. One widely used method is inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ICP OES a method which is expensive destructive and slow. Alternatively conventional handheld x ray fluorescence XRF guns are rapid and nondestructive but are only reliable for higher than regulated concentrations and are averaged across large sample areas and cannot separately evaluate paint layers.

As discussed further below the present invention provides a measurement solution with fast accurate results for toxins in manufactured products enabled by sophisticated x ray sample excitation and monochromating optic techniques. Such proprietary optics typically provide 10 1 000 improvements in the ability to focus x rays and optic enabled analyzers are especially suited for these targeted markets moving measurements from the lab into the factory field and clinic.

In x ray analysis systems high x ray beam intensity and small beam spot sizes are important to reduce sample exposure times increase spatial resolution and consequently improve the signal to background ratio and overall quality of x ray analysis measurements. In the past expensive and powerful x ray sources in the laboratory such as rotating anode x ray tubes or synchrotrons were the only options available to produce high intensity x ray beams. Recently the development of x ray optic devices enables collection of the diverging radiation from an x ray source by focusing the x rays. A combination of x ray focusing optics and small low power x ray sources can produce x ray beams with intensities comparable to those achieved with larger high power and more expensive devices. As a result systems based on a combination of small inexpensive x ray sources excitation optics and collection optics are greatly expanding the availability and capabilities of x ray analysis equipment in for example small laboratories and in the field factory or clinic etc.

Monochromatization of x ray beams in the excitation and or detection paths is also useful to excite and or detect very precise portions of the x ray energy spectrum corresponding to various elements of interest lead etc. . X ray monochromatization technology is based on diffraction of x rays on optical crystals for example germanium Ge or silicon Si crystals. Curved crystals can provide deflection of diverging radiation from an x ray source onto a target as well as providing monochromatization of photons reaching the target. Two common types of curved crystals are known as singly curved crystals and doubly curved crystals DCCs . Using what is known in the art as Rowland circle geometry singly curved crystals provide focusing in two dimensions leaving x ray radiation unfocused in the third or orthogonal plane. Doubly curved crystals provide focusing of x rays from the source to a point target in all three dimensions. This three dimensional focusing is referred to in the art as point to point focusing.

Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 285 506 and 7 035 374 incorporated by reference herein in their entirety disclose various configurations of curved x ray optics for x ray focusing and monochromatization. In general these patents disclose a flexible layer of crystalline material e.g. Si formed into curved optic elements. The monochromating function and the transmission efficiency of the optic are determined by the crystal structure of the optic.

The ability to focus x ray radiation to smaller spots with higher intensities using focusing and monochromating x ray optics has enabled reductions in the size and cost of x ray tubes and x ray systems have therefore been proliferating beyond the laboratory to in situ field uses. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 934 359 and 7 072 439 incorporated by reference herein in their entirety disclose monochromatic wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence MWD XRF techniques and systems using doubly curved crystal optics in the excitation and or detection paths. The x ray optic enabled systems described in these patents have enjoyed widespread success beyond the laboratory for example measuring sulfur in petroleum fuels in a variety of refinery terminal and pipeline environments.

In such systems precise optic alignment along an axis defined by a source and sample spot may be required as illustrated in above incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 7 035 374 which proposes an arrangement of curved monochromating optics around a central axis operating according to Bragg diffraction conditions. is a representative isometric view of this x ray optic arrangement having a curved optic an x ray source location and an x ray target location . X ray source location and x ray target location define a source to target transmission axis . Optic may include a plurality of individual optic crystals all of which may be curved and arranged symmetrically about axis . The plurality of crystals may be arranged from a small fraction of a rotation to a full rotation around the source to target transmission axis .

The internal atomic diffraction planes of optic crystal also may not be parallel to its surface. For example as shown in the atomic diffraction planes of crystal make an angle with the surface upon which x rays are directed at the point of tangency of the surface and its corresponding optic circle or . is the Bragg angle for crystal optic which determines its diffractive effect. Each individual optic crystal can in one example be fabricated according to the method disclosed in above incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6 285 506 entitled Curved Optical Device and Method of Fabrication. 

All individual crystals should be aligned to the source to target axis for proper Bragg conditions. Improvement in optic alignment especially for such multiple crystal optics therefore remains an important area of interest. Various optic source combinations have already been proposed to handle thermal stability beam stability and alignment issues such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 110 506 7 209 545 and 7 257 193. Each of these patents is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The above described XRF technology and systems have been useful in single element analyzers for measuring generally homogeneous sample structure e.g. sulfur in petroleum products . However the measurement of toxins in manufactured products presents additional levels of challenges. First an instrument should have the capability to measure more than one element simultaneously or near simultaneously from a relatively confined list for example the 10 toxic elements discussed above. Moreover manufactured products are likely to be heterogeneous in nature requiring small spot resolution as well as the ability to detect toxins in one of a number of heterogeneous layers e.g. the level of lead in a paint layer and separately in a substrate layer beneath the paint .

Improved x ray analysis method and systems are required therefore to address the problems associated with measuring multiple toxins in potentially heterogeneous samples to enable in the factory and or in the field measurement of toxins.

Disclosed herein are improved multiple monochromatic x ray excitation techniques and systems for addressing these problems. These techniques can quantify the levels of toxins e.g. lead cadmium etc in consumer products at the low levels currently mandated by regulations and can also differentiate between toxins in paint layers and substrates underlying the paint layers and also provide other industries e.g. petroleum with important elemental analysis capability.

In that regard the present invention in one aspect is an x ray analysis apparatus for analyzing a sample spot. An x ray tube includes a target on which electrons impinge to form a diverging x ray beam. The target has a surface formed from first and second target materials each target material tailored to emit a respective energy profile upon impingement by the electrons. A first x ray optic may be provided for receiving the diverging x ray beam and directing the beam toward the sample spot the first x ray optic monochromating the diverging x ray beam to a first energy from the energy emitted by the first target material and a second x ray optic may also be provided for receiving the diverging x ray beam and directing the beam toward the sample spot the second x ray optic monochromating the diverging x ray beam to a second energy from the energy emitted by the second target material. Fluorescence from the sample spot induced by the first and second monochromated energies is used to measure the concentration of at least one element in the sample or separately measure elements in a coating and underlying substrate.

Three or more target materials may be used for the target. The target materials may be formed in separate layers on the target or alloyed into a single layer or a combination of both. The materials may emit characteristic energies and or bremsstrallung and the x ray optics can be tailored to monochromate to particular x ray energies. Sequencing between tube energies and or optics can also be provided depending on the measurements needed.

In accordance with the present invention depicts one embodiment of a highly aligned x ray optic and source assembly in accordance with the present invention. Various aspects of this package have been disclosed in the commonly assigned previously filed U.S. Provisional Applications entitled X RAY OPTIC AND SOURCE ASSEMBLY FOR PRECISION X RAY ANALYSIS APPLICATIONS filed Mar. 5 2008 as Ser. No. 61 033 899 and HIGHLY ALIGNED X RAY OPTIC AND SOURCE ASSEMBLY FOR PRECISION X RAY ANALYSIS APPLICATIONS filed Mar. 25 2008 as Ser. No. 61 039 220 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 738 630 B2 and XRF SYSTEM HAVING MULTIPLE EXCITATION ENERGY BANDS IN HIGHLY ALIGNED PACKAGE filed Apr. 7 2008 as Ser. No. 61 042 974 now U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011 0170666 A1 published Jul. 14 2011 previously filed PCT Application entitled XRF SYSTEM HAVING MULTIPLE EXCITATION ENERGY BANDS IN HIGHLY ALIGNED PACKAGE filed Mar. 3 2009 as serial no. PCT US2009 035847 and SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR MULTIPLE HIGHLY ALIGNED X RAY OPTICS filed Oct. 26 2011 as Ser. No. 61 551 602 each of which is assigned to X Ray Optical Systems Inc. the assignee of the present invention and each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

As discussed in those Applications the assembly may include a first section second section and third section which together align an x ray tube to a sample spot along a central transmission axis Z. Also aligned along this axis are multiple optic carriage assemblies and which hold exemplary monochromating optics also requiring alignment to transmission axis Z as discussed elsewhere herein .

The ability to provide an efficient economical portable analysis capability depends to a large extent upon x ray tube and optic technology. In that regard certain tube and optic technology can be combined for smaller portable systems e.g. a compact electron bombardment x ray tube. One example of this type of x ray tube is available from Oxford Instruments series 5000 which operates at less than 100 watts i.e. 75 watts at a cost of less than 2000 per tube in contrast to higher power laboratory sources which can cost many thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars which is cost prohibitive for many applications. Another example is the Varian VF 50J similar to that depicted here tubular in shape and which operates at 50 watts or less at a cost of several thousand dollars each with a molybdenum or other material as discussed further below.

Sections and are shown in a form of an exemplary tubular shape. Specifically the sections are shown in the approximate form of a cylinder with a circular cross section which is one type of tubular shape. The cross section of tubular sections and could also be square rectangular etc. The tubular shapes shown with circular cross sections provide a section section alignment technique using outer perimeter mating surfaces and inner perimeter mating surfaces.

Second section also accommodates the attachment of optic carriages and which may be fabricated to adjustably mount and align x ray optics not shown respectively to section and ultimately to transmission axis Z or not shown this section can be formed according to the above incorporated U.S. patent application entitled SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR MULTIPLE HIGHLY ALIGNED X RAY OPTICS. X ray beam focusing and or monochromating can be accomplished using certain focusing and or collimating optics for example curved crystal monochromating optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 285 506 6 317 483 and 7 035 374 and or multilayer optics and or HOPG optics and or polycapillary optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 192 869 5 175 755 5 497 008 5 745 547 5 570 408 and 5 604 353. Each of the above noted patents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Of particular interest are curved monochromating optics discussed elsewhere herein which require precise alignment along and a certain distance from the transmission axis to meet the appropriate Bragg conditions of interest.

Third housing section may include an aperture at the tip of its nose cone which requires alignment to transmission axis Z for proper illumination of sample spot with the focused x ray beam s from the optic s . A cone within this section may also be included for additional shielding rigidly or adjustably mounted to section . Section may also have rigidly mounted thereon an exemplary energy dispersive detector which itself requires close alignment to transmission axis Z. Section and or its nose cone can also be adjusted in directions orthogonal to the transmission axis Z. Other types of optics and detectors e.g. wavelength dispersive may also be used with or without similar optics in the detection path.

Also shown is an automated shutter system having its own carriage which can be used for x ray safety purposes i.e. full blocking shutter and also for selecting which x ray beams from the optics should be applied to the sample in any mix ranging from individual non simultaneous excitation to full simultaneous excitation or any mix thereof. This is especially important for the multiple energy excitation techniques discussed below.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention multiple optics of apparatus may be different i.e. may be tuned to different parts of the x ray energy spectrum to optimize element detection and quantification in respective areas of the x ray energy band. In general for an element to fluoresce and therefore be subject to detection and measurement the excitation energy must be at or above the element s x ray absorption edge. Causing all of the elements of interest to fluoresce therefore requires excitation energy above the absorption edges of the elements of interest.

As an example and with reference to a characteristic energy line E from e.g. a molybdenum target x ray tube at approximately 17 keV can be focused to the sample using a point focusing monochromating optic as discussed above generally causing all elements having fluorescent lines of interest lower that 17 keV to fluoresce. Its excitation effect gradually diminishes however for elements having fluorescence lines much lower e.g. less than 10 keV in this example .

In accordance with the present invention additional optic s can be employed to simultaneously capture the non characteristic broad bremsstrallung energy transmitted from the same x ray tube and provide additional lines of excitation energy at e.g. energies E E E E . . . each line from a respective point focusing monochromating optic. As discussed further below energies higher than 17 keV not shown can also be used. This technique can be used for efficient low background excitation of various ranges of elements in the periodic table. These optics can also be employed to capture different characteristic energies from the tube when the tube includes multiple materials having respective characteristic lines.

In the one exemplary system embodiment discussed above three optics provide the 31 keV from bremsstrallung the 17 keV characteristic molybdenum line along with the 7 keV line also from bremsstrahlung respectively.

These lines may provide optimized excitation of the following approximate ranges of elements of interest from the periodic table listed along with their atomic numbers 

By using different optics and tube materials different excitation angles and or energies can be simultaneously or sequentially or any mix thereof using a shutter system applied to the sample. Because different energies cause different fluorescence effects more information can be determined in the detection path. For example higher energies penetrate deeper depths and can be used to detect substrate rather than painted layers in the material. Moreover even though lower energies may penetrate the paint levels the resultant fluorescence may not giving more insight into material makeup.

Certain elements may exist in the energy band at spacings that generally exceed a detector s ability to resolve e.g. Cd and Sn and in fact have overlapping K L lines and absorption energies. And tin Sn a commonly used lead substitute may mask the cadmium in the detection path. Therefore excitation just below the absorption of the higher element Sn thereby not exciting the tin but effectively exciting all the cadmium can be used to isolate the lower element Cd .

Ratios of fluorescence spectra caused by two different excitation energies can also be exploited for additional information about the sample.

An improved EDXRF engine in accordance with the present invention is shown in schematic form in in the exemplary form of a small spot tri chromatic system with a low medium and high energy excitation beams. The unit consists of these three DCC optics one small spot x ray tube producing a diverging x ray beam and an energy dispersive detector . Three DCC optics with a short focal distance may be used to focus low medium and high energy x rays to a single spot on a sample to stimulate fluorescence. A short focal distance can enable a very compact geometry. Unlike low and medium energy optics the high energy optic may diffract Bremsstrahlung or other characteristic line photons which are emitted with low intensity from the source or from different materials on the tube. As discussed further below an innovative 360 multi layer DCC optic may be used to obtain high x ray flux for example for low level Cd and Sb analysis. An energy dispersive detector in one embodiment a silicon drift detector SDD is used to analyze the fluorescence spectrum. The whole system can be designed to be about 45 40 30 cm 18 16 12 in and weigh about 9 kg 20 lb thereby meeting the operational requirements e.g. at line or on line discussed above.

In this analyzer the scattered peaks of the three beams can be measured because of the low spectral background provided by monochromatic excitation. More importantly the scattered peaks from all three energies provide very useful information for quantitative analysis of a layered sample. The difference in sampling depth of the three beams provides the physical basis for the software logic and control algorithms to obtain elemental concentrations in a layered sample using FP analysis.

As discussed further below x ray tube offers certain improvements in x ray excitation energies providing yet further advantages.

Optics for either of these systems may include for example curved crystal monochromating optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 285 506 6 317 483 7 035 374 and 7 738 629 and or multilayer optics and or HOPG optics and or x ray filters and or polycapillary optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 192 869 5 175 755 5 497 008 5 745 547 5 570 408 and 5 604 353. Optic source combinations such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 110 506 and 7 209 545 are also useable. Each of the above noted patents and patent applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention is directed in one embodiment to the following improvements in x ray source target materials and operating principles. Improved source target materials and operating kV potentials can offer further customization of the excitation energies especially when used in combination with the optics described elsewhere herein. The words tube and or source are used broadly herein to connote any type of device which produces x rays from a target upon stimulation with e.g. electron bombardment and can include any end window or side window embodiments. The material layers below are applicable to both reflective surface and transmissive surface style x ray sources without limitation.

Briefly summarizing an x ray tube may include a target on which electrons impinge to form a diverging x ray beam. The target has a surface formed from first and second target materials each target material tailored to emit a respective energy profile upon impingement by the electrons. A first x ray optic may be provided for receiving the diverging x ray beam and directing the beam toward the sample spot the first x ray optic monochromating the diverging x ray beam to a first energy from the energy emitted by the first target material and a second x ray optic may also be provided for receiving the diverging x ray beam and directing the beam toward the sample spot the second x ray optic monochromating the diverging x ray beam to a second energy from the energy emitted by the second target material. Fluorescence from the sample spot induced by the first and second monochromated energies is used to measure the concentration of at least one element in the sample or separately measure elements in a coating and underlying substrate.

Three or more target materials may be used for the target. The target materials may be formed in separate layers on the target or alloyed into a single layer or a combination of both. The materials may emit characteristic energies and or bremsstrallung and the x ray optics can be tailored to monochromate to particular x ray energies. Sequencing between tube energies and or optics can also be provided depending on the measurements needed.

In accordance with these aspects of the present invention shown in in schematic form is an exemplary compact electron bombardment x ray tube having an electron gun filament which may be heated by applying a voltage to a temperature such that electrons are thermally emitted toward a target . These emitted electrons may be accelerated by an electric potential difference to target e.g. anode which is covered with target materials where they strike within a given surface area of the target. Divergent x rays are emitted from the target as a result of the collision between the accelerated electrons and the atoms of the target. To control the spot size electromagnetic focusing may be positioned between filament and target e.g. anode .

In accordance with the present invention target may be coated with two or more materials which each provide different x ray characteristic energies or other energy profiles in response to electrons . As one example shown in three layers of three different materials and respectively are formed on the upper surface of the target . Each of these materials may be chosen to have a different characteristic x ray energy or other energy profile such that the x rays emitted from the tube can contain different characteristic energies. In one example an Fe upper layer having a K line of approximately 6.4 keV can be applied over a layer of Mo having a K line of approximately 17.4 keV . This will enable more and predictable x ray energies to be transmitted to the sample possibly monochromated by the excitation optics discussed above for greater spectral narrowing . In another example a Co upper layer having a K line of approximately 6.9 keV can be applied over a layer of Mo having a K line of approximately 17.4 keV .

Though not required in general the material with a lower x ray characteristic energies should be placed on the upper layers because higher kV electron beams will tend to penetrate the upper layers toward the lower layers and more efficiently excite the lower layers to the exclusion of the upper layers while lower kV electron beams will not penetrate the upper layers and therefore more efficiently excite the upper layer material at its characteristic energy.

The applied tube potential kV can also be controlled externally e.g. through power cable to separately produce certain desired characteristic energies e.g. using a controllable power supply not shown to further optimize excitation of the desired x ray energies by the multiple target material layers in one embodiment using controllable sequencing techniques to alternatively employ different energies in sequence depending on measurement requirements. Optic sequencing can be used separately or in combination with tube kV sequencing including the use of shutters discussed above physically shifting optics in as needed or using the input aperture of the optic to point at separate areas of the target which can be formed to have different materials across different surface areas in one embodiment.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention shown in where like numerals are used to connote like elements in schematic form is a similar exemplary compact electron bombardment x ray source having an electron gun filament which may be heated by applying a voltage to a temperature such that electrons are thermally emitted toward a target . These emitted electrons may be accelerated by an electric potential difference to target e.g. anode which is covered with a target material where they strike within a given surface area of the target. Divergent x rays are emitted from the target as a result of the collision between the accelerated electrons and the atoms of the target. To control the spot size electromagnetic focusing may be positioned between filament and target e.g. anode .

In accordance with the present invention target may be coated with 2 or more materials which provide different x ray characteristic energies or other energy profiles in response to electrons . As one example shown in a single layer of two different materials can be formed on the upper surface of the target . As in each of these materials may be chosen to have a different characteristic x ray energy or other energy profile such that the x rays emitted from the tube can contain different characteristic energies. In this example however the two different materials are alloyed into a common layer .

In one example a Ce material having a K line of approximately 34.7 keV can be alloyed into a material of Mo having a K line of approximately 17.4 keV . This will enable more and predictable x ray energies to be transmitted to the sample from a single target layer possibly monochromated by the excitation optics discussed above for greater spectral narrowing .

A combination of discrete material layers and alloyed material layers can also be used. For example a Co upper layer having a K line of approximately 6.9 keV can be applied over the alloyed layer of Ce material having a K line of approximately 34.7 keV and Mo having a K line of approximately 17.4 keV together over a base discrete layer of Mo only having a K line of approximately 17.4 keV . In this example the material with a lower x ray characteristic energy Co is placed on the upper layers because higher kV electron beams will tend to penetrate the upper layers toward the lower Ce MO and Mo layers and more efficiently excite the lower layers to the exclusion of the upper layers while lower kV electron beams will not penetrate the upper layers and therefore more efficiently excite the upper layer material Co at its characteristic energy.

As above the applied tube potential kV can be controlled to separately e.g. through power cable produce certain desired characteristic energies e.g. using a controllable power supply not shown to further optimize excitation of the desired x ray energies by the multiple target material layers in one embodiment using controllable sequencing techniques to alternatively employ different energies in sequence depending on measurement requirements. Optic sequencing can be used separately or in combination with tube kV sequencing including the use of shutters discussed above physically shifting optics in as needed or using the input aperture of the optic to point at separate areas of the target which can be formed to have different materials across different surface areas in one embodiment.

The target materials and tube kV may be chosen to excite broader band Bremsstrallung energy from the source which can then be spectrally narrowed or not by the monochromating optics depending on system requirements. Any materials with predictable x ray energy profiles may be used including those mentioned above and others including but not limited to Rh W Cr etc. The target layers can be formed using various deposition and or sputtering techniques.

The present invention is also directed in one embodiment to the following improvements in x ray optics which can be used in combination with any of the improvements disclosed herein including but not limited to the tube improvements above. Improved optics are disclosed for different elemental excitation ranges for example for different energies different input focal distances which are often but not always equivalent to the output focal distances and different optic crystals. As used herein but without limitation low energy means about 3 to 7 keV medium energy means about 15 to 20 keV and high energy means about 30 to 40 keV or more.

Two optics are disclosed using different crystal materials silicon Si and lithium fluoride LiF . The targeted energy selected by the optic needs to be the strong characteristic line from the anode target material in order to maximize the performance of the optic. LiF can increase the monochromatic beam flux for a curved crystal optic. LiF has a wide rocking curve and can capture more photons from a larger source spot size therefore the diffraction efficiency from a larger source spot size is higher than that of an Si crystal. Thus the diffraction flux is much larger than the Si crystal for a larger source spot size e.g. 500 m . In addition LiF will bend more readily than Si for the same thickness. Both optics made of Si and LiF may have a Johann geometry design as discussed elsewhere herein.

To achieve a high intensity beam geometries with very high collection solid angle are disclosed. A fully revolved ellipsoid point to point focusing of LiF is disclosed for this high energy optic as shown in . To achieve the full 360 ellipsoid optic three similar ellipsoidal segments each with about 120 rotational angles are disclosed. The three segments are aligned to the same focal point and form a fully rotated optic. The total collection solid angle of this design can be 0.03 sr. which is about 40 larger than previous designs. Because the slight change of the incident angles for a point source emitting from the focus of the ellipse the reflection energy bandwidth is broadened.

The spot sizes attainable with any of the above described focusing optics can range from approximately 0.4 mm to 0.8 mm to 1.0 mm to 2.0 mm in diameter facilitating analysis of small features on consumer products. In addition the optics may produce spot sizes in any shape depending on the shape of the optic.

Any of the layered optics discussed above can be implemented according to the techniques described in the commonly assigned previously filed U.S. patent application entitled X RAY FOCUSING OPTIC HAVING MULTIPLE LAYERS WITH RESPECTIVE CRYSTAL ORIENTATIONS filed Nov. 16 2007 as Ser. No. 11 941 377 the entirety of which is incorporated by reference.

Each individual crystalline layer provides an individual diffractive effect. These diffractive effects can be separately modeled and their collective effect in the final optic can then be predicted and implemented according to final design criteria. This stands in contrast to known multi layer optics having many layers of angstrom nanometer thicknesses each without an individual diffractive effect but wherein the interactions between the layers result in an overall diffractive effect.

In another aspect of the present invention layers of differing material composition can be employed in the same optic with either the same or differing crystalline orientations between the layers or mixes thereof and layers of similar or the same material composition can be employed again with either the same or differing crystalline orientations between the layers or mixes thereof . In any of these aspects of the present invention material on insulator may be used or adhesive e.g. epoxy layers can be used to bind adjacent crystalline layers in accordance with the sequence of steps discussed in this incorporated Application.

Structure can then be formed into a curved monochromating optic including a doubly curved crystal DCC optic or individual segments thereof . One embodiment of such a doubly curved optical device is depicted in and is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 285 506 B1 issued Sep. 4 2001 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In the embodiment of a doubly curved optical device includes the flexible layered optic a thick epoxy layer and a backing plate . The structure of the device is shown further in the cross sectional elevational view in

In this device the epoxy layer holds and constrains the flexible layer to a selected geometry having a curvature. Preferably the thickness of the epoxy layer is greater than 20 m and the thickness of the flexible layer is greater than 5 m. Further the thickness of the epoxy layer is typically thicker than the thickness of the flexible layer. The flexible layer can be one of a large variety of materials including those discussed herein. The epoxy layer can be a paste type with viscosity in the order of 10to 10poise and 30 to 60 minutes pot life. The backing plate can be a solid object that bonds well with the epoxy. The surface of the backing plate can be flat or curved and its exact shape and surface finish are not critical to the shape and surface finish of the flexible layer. In the device of a specially prepared backing plate is not required.

Surrounding the flexible layer may be a thin sheet of protection material such as a thin plastic which is used around the flexible layer edge see . The protection material protects the fabrication mold so that the mold is reusable and would not be necessary for a mold that is the exact size or smaller than the flexible layer or for a sacrificial mold.

Any of the optics disclosed herein can be shaped in any way depending on the application including but not limited to single directions of curvature singly curved crystals SCCs double directions of curvature doubly curved crystals DCCs and other designs. Doubly curved optical devices such as doubly curved crystal DCC optics may be used in material analysis to collect and focus x rays from a large solid angle and increase the usable flux from an x ray source. Three dimensional focusing of characteristic x rays can be achieved by diffraction from a toroidal crystal used with a small x ray source. This point to point Johan geometry is illustrated in . The diffracting planes of each crystal optic element can be parallel to the crystal surface. If the focal circle containing a point source and the focal point has radius R then the crystal surface has for example a radius R of curvature of 2Rin the plane of the focal circle and a radius of curvature of r 2Rsin in the perpendicular plane with the radius centered on a line segment drawn between the source and the focal point. X rays diverging from the source and incident on the crystal surface at angles within the rocking curve of the crystal will be reflected efficiently to the focal or image point. The monochromatic flux density at the focal point for a DCC based system is several orders of magnitude greater than that of conventional systems with higher power sources and similar source to object distances. This increase yields a very high sensitivity for use in many different applications including as described herein x ray fluorescence and diffraction.

As a further enhancement illustrates that the optical device may comprise multiple doubly curved crystal optic elements arranged in a grid pattern about the Rowland circle each element formed from a flexible structure as discussed above either with similar or different element to element layer structures . Such a structure may be arranged to optimize the capture and redirection of divergent radiation via Bragg diffraction. In one aspect a plurality of optic crystals having varying atomic diffraction plane orientations can be used to capture and focus divergent x rays towards a focal point. In another aspect a two or three dimensional matrix of crystals can be positioned relative to an x ray source to capture and focus divergent x rays in three dimensions. Further details of such a structure are presented in the above incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 7 035 374 B1 issued Apr. 25 2006.

An exemplary EDXRF analyzer system constructed in accordance with the present invention using an exemplary SDD detector an improved source and low medium and high energy optics is shown in measuring a sample toy.

A fundamental parameter FP technique for monochromatic systems with Compton Rayleigh C R modeling may be used to process the x ray fluorescence data detected from a sample stimulated with multiple monochromatic beams generated by the optics and or tubes discussed above. The FP technique is based on a single energy excitation beam and is suitable for bulk and homogenous measurements. Multiple monochromatic beams can be used to sense different parts of the spectrum and to de convolute the toxins the painted layers and separately in the substrate.

A spectral processor SP may be used for fitting an energy dispersive X ray fluorescence EDXRF spectrum based on multiple monochromatic beam excitation. The raw spectral data from the detector in a count vs. energy spectrum can be used for the input. A number of techniques can be utilized to account for various components in the spectrum such as a Gaussian modeling for peak fitting. Noise from the system and detector is also considered.

The fundamental parameters FP based technique is also useful for coating layer quantitative analysis. In this technique the absorption fluorescence and scattering are modeled based on a number of measured factors. Due to the use of monochromatic beams the calculations can simplified compared to the FP methods used for polychromatic excitation.

The layered mode FP may require spectra from the combination of paint with the substrate then from the substrate only to resolve the separate compositions of a paint substrate sample. One technical challenge is that the mass per unit area of the paint is unknown due to the low Z elements C H O in the paint that cannot be detected. This mass per unit area for the coating called t density thickness should be determined in order to calculate the mass fraction of toxins. With two or more monochromatic beams the toxin concentrations in the paint and substrate separately sample can be determined.

Also in accordance with the present invention and with reference to a smaller handheld x ray analyzer can also be implemented according to the principles of the present invention. Handheld x ray analyzers have gained in popularity over the last few years because of their transportability and ease of use. Also shown in is a human interface module which may include the user interface FP processor and or a power source for the handheld analyzer. Such an interface may also be integral to the analyzer.

An example graphic user interface GUI for either of these systems is shown in . This exemplary GUI allows user selections of sample types displays element concentrations and related spectra. The GUI may also display a live image of the sample to assist with sample positioning. A snap shot of the GUI is shown in .
