Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to information systems and more particularly to methods and systems for using augmented reality to determine information.

Users may regularly use mobile devices to look for information of all types including for example to search for information on locations or descriptions of businesses products services private or public facilities such as bus stations and many other types of information. However current information found for example via searches on mobile devices may be very broad outdated and in many cases not relevant to a user s needs or situation.

In accordance with various embodiments described herein methods and systems are provided for using augmented reality to determine information. In one or more embodiments a user device having a general viewer and an application for using augmented reality hereinafter referred to as an augmented reality device or AR device may be used to determine current or real time information such as location destination description or any other information pertaining to one or more objects moving or stationary which are viewable via the general viewer of the AR device.

An AR device may be a user device such as a mobile device including for example a smart phone a tablet a laptop or the like which includes a viewer e.g. a user interface such as an image or video capturing component e.g. a camera a screen a display etc. that may provide a user of the AR device a view and insight to an object. In various embodiments an AR device may include smart glasses or goggles or other appropriate devices having a viewer as part of the device. For example an AR device may include smart glasses such as Google glasses or any other devices having connection capabilities to networks such as the Internet. By looking at an object through a viewer of an AR device such as a smart phone or smart glasses a user may determine real time information about the object. In other embodiments an AR device may include any device that is wearable and smart for example a smart watch such that a user may hold the smart watch towards an object such as a moving object of interest and have relevant information about the object which may be displayed on the smart watch itself. Advantageously according to one or more embodiments herein the user may be provided with current or updated real time information such that the user may determine whether the information is relevant to his or her situation or needs.

According to one or more embodiments an application for an AR device may be provided by a service provider or any appropriate party such that users may choose to download or install and run the application on their AR devices. The application may be provided by a service provider such as PayPal and or eBay of San Jose Calif.

There are many use cases in which augmented reality may be used for determining information. In an example an AR device may provide a user a view and insight showing information about the nearest means of public transport e.g. a bus train taxi car boat jetski or a similar service at a current user location and providing the user with details such as routes times fares etc. for a selected public transport. The user may also select to conduct a transaction e.g. pay for fares or tickets associated with the public transport using the AR device.

Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure only and not for purposes of limiting the same illustrate a set of diagrams for using augmented reality to determine information about moving objects according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In a general example a user that is waiting at a bus stop may see a bus approaching him or her. The user may want to know when the next bus will arrive. The user may look through the user s AR device s viewer e.g. user interface or UI camera etc. to immediately determine when the next bus will arrive. By using location services e.g. GPS of the user s AR device the user may have the ability to look at any transport vehicle such as a bus train or plane to determine the route of the transport vehicle and the current destination of that particular transport vehicle. The user may also find out the fare price to ride on the transport vehicle and even purchase the fare right from the user s AR device in a seamless manner. As such the user may board the transport vehicle e.g. bus immediately. The user immediately knows if the transport vehicle is relevant to his or her needs or situation.

In the embodiment of a user may have a user device or AR device for example a smart phone or smart glasses or any other appropriate device including a wearable device. User may see through a viewer of an AR device a target object such as a transport vehicle e.g. a bus in the distance.

User may be interested in obtaining information about transport vehicle and may use AR device to determine information about transport vehicle . In an embodiment where transport vehicle is a bus user may be interested in knowing information about the bus including for example the particular route or direction of the bus the fare of the bus when the next bus will come in case user wants to wait for a friend so they can take the bus together etc. In one example the information obtained about the bus may indicate that transport vehicle is Metro Bus Route 735 Destination Downtown Seats Available Yes Next Bus 15 minutes Fare 1.75 etc. As such user may discover information about transport vehicle e.g. a bus which is approaching or heading in a direction towards the user.

In an embodiment the AR device and a target object such as transport vehicle e.g. bus may make a connection and be able to share data with each other via networks such as existing wireless networks. In other embodiments infrared data transfer may be used if user has a direct line of sight of a target object such as transport vehicle . In that regard the target object which in this embodiment is transport vehicle may have a system for communicating updated or real time information for example by transmitting or broadcasting signals e.g. beaconing via a wireless communications system such as WiFi Bluetooth etc. In other examples transport vehicle may use other technologies or sensors to convey information such as NFC RFID IR readable or scannable codes attached thereon such as a QR code etc. which AR device is able to detect read scan etc.

In one or more embodiments locations such as business locations or transport vehicle terminals themselves for example bus stops may use technologies or sensors to convey information about associated transport vehicles such as readable or scannable codes e.g. QR codes placed on one or more appropriate locations e.g. on a wall or surface of the bus stop. As such in embodiments herein each bus stop may emit active real time information as opposed to current technologies that may simply show for example a regular bus schedule such that an AR device viewer may look and determine information relevant for the present moment e.g. an updated or current bus schedule for the moment e.g. reflecting delays changes in routes destination or equipment etc. .

As such a system for communicating information for example public information about a transport vehicle may be dynamic such that the information may be updated and provided in real time. For example information may be updated real time for specific locations based on dynamic situations or circumstances such as a history of purchases user provided communications or inputs public traffic information road closures events mechanical failures etc. In this regard communications such as wireless communications e.g. WiFi Bluetooth etc. IR readable codes e.g. QR code NFC RFID technologies etc. may be updated dynamically to reflect real time information that is signals may be transmitted and updated with dynamic information. The information may be managed in several ways for example a long range communication network may be used information may be stored in the cloud or it may be managed by a service.

In various embodiments once user determines that he or she would like to ride a transport vehicle such as transport vehicle user may want to purchase a ticket to ride.

Referring to user may choose to conduct a transaction in connection with transport vehicle . In this regard user may purchase a ticket to ride approaching vehicle transport using AR device . For example on a user interface of AR device an option to purchase a ticket may be displayed therein. In this example as displayed on user interface user may select to purchase a fare for this particular transport vehicle e.g. Metro Route 735.

In various embodiments user may conduct the transaction for example purchase a ticket to ride a bus using a transaction card a payment provider service such as Paypal or other forms of payment as generally accepted in financial transactions.

Referring to a diagram illustrates a system for using augmented reality to determine information about a moving object according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.

In a general example a user may look at an air plane coming into the airport via a viewer of the user s AR device and determine if it is the flight that the user s loved ones are on. The user s AR device may be able to determine whether the air plane being viewed via the AR device s viewer is the correct flight based on factors such as the location of the user where the AR device viewer is looking in the sky and the flight patterns of air planes at that specific point in time.

In the embodiment of first a user having a user device or AR device for example a smart phone or smart glasses may see or capture through a viewer of AR device an image view where user is looking via AR device . In that regard the image view may be deconstructed to identify a moving object such as a transport vehicle e.g. an air plane in the distance. In one example if the image is clear enough even the name of the airline may be identified. A distance A between AR device and a moving object such as transport vehicle e.g. air plane may be determined based at least in part on image recognition.

Second a location of user may be determined via global positioning services such as GPS of AR device .

AR device may determine information about current flying flights including the particular transport vehicle . In that regard in a case where the moving object is a plane information about the plane such as plane type and airline route scheduled departure arrival times current status etc. may be determined. For example public information from the FAA may give tracking information of current flights in the sky. The determined information about an air plane or flight may include plane type airline flight number e.g. Boeing 737 Southwest Airlines SA 195 route e.g. JFK AUS scheduled arrival time e.g. 4 25 PM CST status e.g. On Time . As such in this example transport vehicle may be a Boeing 737 airplane such that AR device may access information e.g. by accessing FAA public information about all Boeing 737 airplanes in flight. In an example an application such as Flight Aware may be used to determine flight status of particular flights. The paths of flights as well as flight information may be analyzed such that current information is obtained for a particular flight. As such the real time status of a plane may be determined.

In an example where an AR device has an application such as Flight Aware wherein such application may digest FAA flight information which is updated in real time the AR device may provide the user the current location of planes as they navigate their routes. As described above the AR device may also determine a location of the user via its GPS location services. As such the AR device knows the GPS location of the user and a location e.g. GPS location of the current flights in the general viewing area of a user. In this regard the AR device may be able to filter or determine all the flights e.g. by processing an algorithm or simple math that are within viewing range of the user as indicated for example by GPS. Then the AR device may be adapted to take visual cues of an actual plane e.g. determine the model of the plane the airline etc. .

Fourth by using AR device to look at a moving object such as transport vehicle e.g. a plane user may immediately determine information about the moving object including for example whether transport vehicle is the flight that the user has been waiting for or whether the moving object e.g. transport vehicle is relevant to the user.

As such in this example based on the location of the user the location of the plane within the user s captured image view and public information such as current FAA information that the AR device interacts with the system may filter out the current possible flights and determine the actual flight the user cares about. If the plane in the user s image view matches the one the user cares about then the plane may be considered a match and information about the plane flight may be presented to the user through a user interface of the AR device etc.

In an embodiment the AR device may determine relevant information about a flight for example based on specific information such as where a loved one has sent a flight confirmation purchase receipt to the user the AR device may determine that the user cares about a Southwest flight specifically SWA . If a plane flying above the user at that current location is a SWA flight for example in view of the AR device and flight SW is in the viewing path of the user then that is indeed the plane the user cares about because loved ones are on that flight.

In various embodiments relevancy of information may be based on various factors or user or AR device specific information including for example location information a user s personal calendar user preferences user behavior user habits purchase history e.g. information about the user buying a plane ticket for a loved one such that the system knows the flight number and airline user conversation history e.g. email conversations user input etc. As such the AR device may determine relevant information for example on which flight the user s loved ones are on or any other information that is important to the user.

In an embodiment the AR device may determine relevant information based on for example a user s personal calendar. For example a calendar on the user s AR device may show that the user is attending an event downtown and so the system may know that the user wants to reach a specific location. In another example when a user looks at a transport vehicle via the user s AR device s viewer such as a bus a cab may be the cab only goes to certain boroughs or neighborhoods a train etc. the system may determine if the transport vehicle routes reach the user.

Relevancy of information may also be based on user preferences. For example when a user looks at a food truck if the user is vegetarian but the food truck is a hamburger truck then the user may not want to have the food truck highlighted in his or her AR device augmented reality view nor look at the food truck s menu.

Relevancy of information may further be based on user behavior. For example if the system notices that a user almost never takes a cab ride where the cab has less than half a tank of gas may be because the user has to travel a long distance during the trip then the AR device may not highlight or include available cabs that do not match or are not in line with the user s behavior when the user attempts to digitally hail a cab.

As described above for example with respect to mixing the location of the AR device and the target object the system may provide relevant information to a user in situations where the user is unsure of the surroundings and does not know if for example a plane in the sky pertains to the user or if that bus coming down the street is going to be able to take the user to work etc. Conversely in some embodiments location may not be as relevant for example when a food truck is down the street the location may not matter that much in that case it may be more relevant to recognize the food truck s particular company the menu the number of customers waiting for food the food reviews on the food truck etc.

There are many other examples of use cases wherein an AR device may be used to look at a target object moving or stationary through a viewer of the AR device in order to determine information about the target object. Following are a few examples of use cases for using augmented reality to determine information.

Use Case 1 an AR device may determine dynamic real time information about a food delivery truck captured via a viewer of the AR device. The food delivery truck may broadcast signals or have readable technologies such as RFID NFC or a readable code such as a QR code communicating updated real time information such as a current menu for example including updated menu items availability of items prices etc. In one example Kamal is outside in his neighborhood and notices a specialty food delivery truck making a stop at a neighbor s house. Using his AR device viewer Kamal may look at the delivery truck and see the menu of offerings from the delivery truck. Kamal may decide if he wants to order something from the delivery truck or reserve an appointment for the truck to visit his home so he may discuss other sales options with the delivery truck.

Use Case 2 Kamal is taking the bus to a concert downtown. Because there is a big event downtown roads have been closed and the bus route is rerouted. When Kamal is waiting at the bus stop he may be able to see the new bus routes and decide if he wants to use the bus. Once Kamal is on the bus the bus routes may change yet again. Using his AR device viewer Kamal is able to see the new rerouted bus route including stops so he may best judge where to request a stop of the bus.

Use Case 3 Kamal has finished his concert and is trying to take the bus home again. He is still downtown and the big event has still caused roads to close. Using his AR device viewer Kamal may look up and down the street and different street corners to see designated zones for where buses are loading and unloading people. Kamal may also be able to see the bus routes for these designated zones so he knows which bus applies to him. Kamal may further be able to see when the next bus is scheduled to stop at the designated zone by looking at the zone himself e.g. a countdown clock may be used for the designated zone . If there are no designated zones within Kamal s AR device viewer he may be able to have a map displayed which may show directions to the closest pickup dropoff bus zone e.g. using the GPS feature of his AR device .

Use Case 4 Kamal just misses his train and he sees it rush by. Using Kamal s AR device viewer he may be able to look at the train and know when the next train associated with that route is scheduled to stop so he can board the next train.

Use Case 5 A user may use his or her AR device to determine information about a taxi cab parked in front of the user for instance the user may want to know the taxi cab fares which may be broadcasted by the taxi cab. In an embodiment the taxi cab may also broadcast diagnostics for example how much gas is in the taxi cab the tire air pressure etc. such that a user may determine how safe the taxi cab is to ride.

Use Case 6 Kamal is visiting a new city and is not sure where he should hail a cab. Using his AR device viewer Kamal may be able to see designated Hail a Cab zones. Once Kamal navigates to a Hail a Cab zone he may be able to digitally flag down a cab. Upon Kamal confirming his intent to take a cab the nearest cab driver e.g. based on GPS location locating an available cab the cab driver may receive a text message or alert in his or her cab indicating Kamal is waiting for a cab. In an embodiment Kamal may then instantly be presented with a countdown timer in his AR device viewer for when the cab is set to arrive. As such the AR device may determine the closest location to most easily pick up a taxi cab the location of designated pick up areas fares for a nearby taxi cab or any other pertinent information for the taxi cab.

Use Case 7 Kamal is in an airport in a foreign country where he does not speak the language. The airport has a rail system similar to Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson which moves commuters to different regions of the airport. When Kamal is waiting at a rail stop he may want to know when he should get on the railcar. Using his AR device viewer he knows which railcar to take so he can continue on his trip.

Use Case 8 Kamal has ordered a package from an e commerce website and the package is shipping from a delivery service such as FedEx or UPS . A package delivery truck such as FedEx or UPS may broadcast dynamic real time information e.g. within wireless communication range such as WiFi or Bluetooth such that an AR device may determine whether a particular package is in the delivery truck. Kamal may use his AR device to look at any delivery truck such as a UPS vehicle and determine if the UPS vehicle he is viewing contains the item he has ordered. Kamal may walk up to the UPS vehicle and sign for his package right on the spot. If the UPS vehicle does not contain Kamal s package Kamal may be presented with a view that shows which truck contains Kamal s package and the current location of the truck. This way Kamal may determine when he needs to go home and sign for his package.

Use Case 9 Kamal is driving around residential neighborhoods right when the local school buses are dropping off students at their homes. Using Kamal s AR device viewer Kamal may be able to look directly at a school bus in front of him and immediately know the route of the school bus. Once Kamal knows this he may change his travel route so he may avoid the route of the school bus and hence more safely and easily reach his destination.

Use Case 10 It is a hot day and Kamal sees an ice cream truck coming down the street. Using his AR device viewer Kamal may look at the ice cream truck and immediately determine what flavors of ice cream are for sale. Kamal may reserve and or pay for his ice cream before the ice cream truck even stops.

Referring now to a flow diagram illustrates a method for using augmented reality to determine information according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In block an image view may be captured via a viewer of an AR device of a user having an AR information service enabled on the AR device. In that regard an AR device may include a viewer such as a camera that may capture an image that includes one or more objects areas or zones. The objects may include a mobile object such as a transport vehicle approaching a user of the AR device or it may be a stationary object such as a transport vehicle parked in front of the user of the AR device. In other embodiments the target object may be an area or zone which may be associated with a particular item or service for example Hail a Cab zones streets or street corners to see designated loading unloading zones for public transportation.

In block the captured image view may be deconstructed into one or more different objects of potential interest to a user using for example image recognition. In various embodiments once an image view including an object is captured via a viewer of the AR device the system may use for example image recognition to determine key features of the image including the object to obtain related information. For example once an image view is captured via a viewer of an AR device such as a smart phone camera a smart glasses viewer a smart watch viewer etc. the image view may be deconstructed into key or important objects parts or points of interest using image recognition.

In block based on specific relevancy information such as user factors or user specific information in the AR device including for example user preferences e.g. user is a vegetarian user personal calendar e.g. an appointment scheduled in 30 minutes user habits e.g. user always takes the bus in the morning etc. one or more different objects of interest may be identified or sorted. The system may determine a key or important object of interest in the captured image view based on for example information specific to the AR device or to the user at the current time.

In block real time information may be determined about an object of interest. For example to determine information the AR information service may resolve communications with the object of interest based on the type of object for example either through direct communication via NFC Bluetooth WiFi etc. or through indirect communication with the object of interest using publicly available information through for example APIs to the public service using web scraping etc. As such the system may obtain real time information related to an object of interest via various ways including direct or indirect communications or web scraping. In an embodiment the image view including an object of interest area or zone may be transmitted to a server at a remote location for example a service provider server to process related information. The system may then display the related information on a user s AR device about the captured object of interest area or zone.

In block the real time information may be presented to a user on a user interface for example on a screen or display of an AR device. Once a connection has been established with the object of interest e.g. either directly or indirectly the user may understand information about the object of interest and possibly conduct a transaction e.g. make purchases e.g. buying a bus pass . In that regard dynamic real time information about the captured object or area may be displayed on the AR device. The information may be shared about the target object or area for example via wireless networks or other technologies such as IR readable codes etc. such that the user of the AR device may immediately determine information relevant to the user s particular needs or situation.

In the example described above with respect to involving a bus stop the GPS component of a user s AR device may track the GPS location of the user to a bus stop. Thus the system knows that the user is located at a bus stop. When the user points his or her AR device e.g. smart phone in the direction of an oncoming bus an image may be captured and deconstructed. The image may include various items such as a metro bus some trees in the background traffic lights etc. but because the user is at a bus stop the system may determine that the metro bus is most likely the object of interest. In another embodiment the user may also have a personal calendar appointment such as be at the downtown office at 8 30 am. In that case the system may determine that the user is at a bus stop in the morning and has an appointment downtown thus the system may determine that the user is most likely trying to get downtown. In other embodiments any other relevant objects in the captured image view may be deconstructed and presented to the user. For example if there is also a coffee shop e.g. a Starbucks location across the street from the bus stop that ends up in the user s captured image view from his or her AR device the user may have the option of receiving related information about the coffee shop.

Furthermore with respect to the bus stop example the system may determine that the AR device has captured an image of the approaching bus. The bus itself may be transmitting related information for example status information such as a current route number of people on board fare price etc. In this regard the bus may transmit information via a network such as WiFi or 4G i.e. long range technologies that may be picked up by the metro city bus service such that when the AR device captures an image view including a bus image recognition may be used to determine that this is a metro city bus. The system may resolve other information about the bus for example routes fare prices the type of bus etc. from specific bus service information for example information provided by either the metro bus website or from an API that the system may tap into to get general information about the bus. Web scraping may also be used. According to one or more embodiments herein real time information about an object of interest e.g. this is the current route of the bus this many people are on board at this exact moment etc. may be resolved by the system communicating with the object of interest e.g. the metro bus itself. In an embodiment the system may figure out how to obtain information from the metro bus by knowing the user s current location approximating the bus s current location by using the user s location and figuring out the distance from the user and then tapping into the general information about the metro bus routes from the metro bus website for example. Therefore the exact point in time when the AR device captures an image view including the bus e.g. the user takes a picture of the bus the exact bus may be determined and thus the user may find out related information about the oncoming bus. Once the exact metro bus has been determined the user may be able to interact with the bus as if the user were already on the bus for example the user may conduct a transaction such as purchasing a ticket if needed for the bus etc.

In one or more embodiments a transaction may be processed using the AR device in connection with a target object or area based at least in part on the real time information communicated by the target object or area. For example if a user of the AR device receives information about a particular bus route or destination and fare the user may purchase a ticket to ride the bus using his or her AR device. Thus the user may identify the correct bus purchase a bus ticket and board the bus in a seamless manner.

Referring now to a block diagram of a system adapted to use augmented reality to determine information is illustrated according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in the system includes at least one AR device e.g. network computing device one or more servers or devices associated with one or more target objects areas or zones e.g. network server devices and at least one service provider server or device e.g. network server device in communication over a network .
