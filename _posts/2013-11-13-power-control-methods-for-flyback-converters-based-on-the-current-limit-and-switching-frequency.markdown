This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Applications No. 61 725 811 filed on Nov. 13 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to power systems and in particular to methods for methods for flyback converters.

Switching mode power supplies SMPS or converters provide superior power conversion efficiency. It is because the switch device transistor or MOSFET in its power stage works either in saturation high current but voltage close to zero or cut off high voltage but zero current region periodically with high frequency so the loss of the switch device is low For linear converter the semiconductor device in power stage always works in active region with high power loss due to its voltage and current are both high during operation. Due to its high efficiency the switching mode converters have been found to be particularly useful in a variety of portable devices e.g. mobile phones digital cameras tablets digital music players media players portable disk drives handheld game consoles and other handheld consumer electronic devices that are powered by limited internal batteries such as the lithium batteries. Flyback converter usually is implemented to provide voltage regulation.

As technology develops more features and functions are incorporated into the portable devices leading to a higher demand on the power delivery from the power converter. In some applications higher current is required for a short period of time temporary power boost requirement for a short period of time . Some examples are in printers motors or for CPU boost operations. The amount of excess power may be as high as twice that of the maximum power delivered in a normal operation the conventional converters can t deliver the amount of excess power without adding cost bigger transformer to avoid saturation . The advantages of those methods mentioned above are 

By increasing switching frequency and transformer primary peak current limitation during surge load condition it is not necessary to use bulky transformer to avoid core saturation at surge load condition.

The efficiency of the power supply at rated load can be optimized. The switching frequency at rated load is lower than that at surge mode operation so the switching loss at rated load condition is lower and can get better efficiency.

This invention proposes a method to increase the power delivery capability of a converter for short period to fulfill surge power demand without adding cost or minimum if it is necessary. It also proposes a method to mitigate issues related to short circuit conditions. A detailed description is given in the following embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.

An embodiment of a method is provided adopted by a flyback converter circuit including a transformer comprising determining an output voltage generated from a secondary circuit of the transformer feeding a feedback voltage based on the output voltage to a primary circuit of the transformer increasing a current limit and a switching frequency of a primary current according the feedback voltage and supplying the primary current to a primary winding of the transformer.

Another embodiment of a method is disclosed adopted by a flyback converter circuit including a transformer comprising determining an output voltage generated from a secondary circuit of the transformer feeding a feedback voltage based on the output voltage to a primary circuit of the transformer increasing a switching frequency of a primary current according the feedback voltage by a first fixed rate increasing current limit of the primary current with the determined output voltage by an adaptable rate and supplying the primary current to a primary winding of the transformer.

Another embodiment of a method is described adopted by a flyback converter circuit including a transformer comprising determining an output voltage generated from a secondary circuit of the transformer feeding a feedback voltage based on the output voltage to a primary circuit of the transformer increasing a current limit and a switching frequency of the primary current according the feedback voltage supplying the primary current to the primary winding of the transformer and when the feedback voltage exceeds a short circuit threshold voltage the primary current limit reduced to a substantially constant overload current wherein the substantially constant overload current is less than a maximal current limit of the primary current.

The following description is of the best contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is best determined by reference to the appended claims.

The AC input power source from the power source is converted into DC power through the rectifier the DC power source supplied to transformer is controlled by the switching transistor Q. The switching transistor Q and transformer form the heart of the flyback SMPS . The transformer contains a primary winding W a secondary winding W and an auxiliary winding Waux. The power source is supplied to the switching transistor Q through the primary winding W of the transformer. The switching transistor Q acts as a switch. When the switch transistor Q is turned on driven into saturation and conducts the switch is closed and provides a path for a primary current I primary current to flow through the primary winding W of the pulse transformer to the power return lead thus energy is stored in the transformer core through the magnetizing inductance of the primary winding W. When the switching transistor Q is turned off in a cutoff region and does not conduct the switch is opened and the stored energy is delivered into the load through secondary winding W. Consequently current does not flow simultaneously in the primary and second windings W and W of the transformer.

Varying the switching frequency by Pulse Rate Modulation referred to as PRM or duration by Pulse Width Modulation referred to as PWM of the PWM signal Swill result in duty cycle variation of the input Iand a corresponding output regulation of the output voltage V. The output voltage regulation is provided through the optic couplers Dand D. In one implementation the output voltage Vis detected and divided into a voltage Vthrough a resistor network. The voltage Vis used to control the shunt regulator T which generates a current proportional to difference between the voltage Vand an internal regulated voltage typically at 2.5V of the shunt regulator T. The shunt regulator generated current is converted into a feedback voltage Vthrough the optic couplers Dand Dwhich provide isolation between the primary and secondary circuits of the flyback SMPS .

The flyback SMPS can operate with a peak current control mode. In the peak current control converter the feedback voltage Vis employed to set the current limit Iof the peak current of the primary current Ifor each duty cycle. The controller can sense the current Ithrough the primary winding W and the sense voltage Vcs across the sense resistor Rs. The current limit Lis controlled by the controller according to the sense voltage limit Vcs lim. More specifically the controller is configured to connected to the sense resistor Rs to detect the sense voltage Vcs and configure the current limit Ifor the current Iaccording to Equation 1   Equation 1 The sense voltage Vcs is the voltage across the sense resistor Rs. When the output load draws certain amount of output power the sense voltage limit Vcs lim will be increased according to a relationship to the feedback voltage Vcorresponding to the output power which in turn is used by the controller to control the switching transistor Q to restrict the sense voltage Vcs equaling the sense voltage limit Vcs lim thereby imposing the current limit Iover the primary current I. More specifically when the primary winding W trying to draw current to make a sense voltage Vcs exceeding the sense voltage limit Vcs lim the controller is configured to turn off the switching transistor Q so that the ON time of the primary current Iis decreased thereby restricting the sense voltage Vcs within the sense voltage limit Vcs lim. Conversely when the primary winding W draws current to make a sense voltage Vcs equaling or less than the sense voltage limit Vcs lim the controller is configured to keep the switching transistor Q turning on so that the ON time of the primary current Icontinues thereby increasing the sense voltage Vcs and delivering the required power to the secondary circuit. As explained herein the sense voltage limit Vcs lim is in direct proportion to the current limit I an increase in the current limit Iwill follow an increase in the sense voltage limit Vcs lim and vice versa. Thus in the following sections when the behavior of only one of the two terms is described it would automatically imply behavior of the other term can act similarly.

The flyback SMPS can operate in either continuous current mode CCM or discontinuous current mode DCM . The output power can be derived from the following equation 

We can also explain more detailed by the following equation. For higher power operations it is desirable to operate the converter in CCM mode for better efficiency the delivered output power at the secondary circuit can be expressed as 

In the embodiment of the invention the controller uses the feedback voltage Vto control the duty cycle and the switching frequency of an PWM signal Sconnect to the switching transistor Q such that proper output voltage regulation is achieved. In some embodiments the controller is configured to determine a control voltage Vctl not shown which is simply the feedback voltage Vor positively correlated to the feedback voltage V and then utilize the control voltage Vctl or the feedback voltage Vto determine an operation mode for the flyback SMPS . The operation mode includes a normal mode and a high power mode. The controller is configured to generate the duty cycle and a switching frequency of the PWM signal Saccording to the feedback voltage V. The PWM signal Sis connected to the switching transistor Q thereby controlling a current limit Iand a switching frequency Fof the input current Iat the primary circuit and providing regulated output voltage Vat the secondary circuit.

In some embodiments the flyback SMPS is configured to increase a current limit Iat an adaptable rate preventing the switching transistor Q from being blown out under excessive current stress as depicted in .

In other embodiments the flyback SMPS is configured to further limit the current limit Iof the primary current Iin short circuit conditions to a short circuit current Isc preventing the switching transistor Q from being blown out as depicted in .

While the embodiments utilize the peak current control mode to illustrate the feature and principle of the invention applications thereof may extend to an averaged current mode in which the peak current parameter is replaced with an averaged current parameter.

The flyback SMPS provides increased power delivery at the output by increasing the current limit Iand or the switching frequency Fof the primary input current Iat the primary circuit.

Accordingly the flyback SMPS can operate in the normal mode and the high power mode. illustrates a line diagram which shows a control scheme 2 of a Vcs limit curve and a switching frequency curve according to an embodiment of the invention incorporating the flyback SMPS in . The Vcs limit curve and the switching frequency curve respectively represent a current limit and a switching frequency of the primary current Iwith respect to the feedback voltage V. In some embodiments the controller can control the switching transistor Q to impose the Vcs limit and the switching frequency on the primary current Iaccording to the feedback voltage V.

Referring to the Vcs limit curve and the switching frequency curve of when the feedback voltage Vis less than a peak power mode voltage Vctlp first threshold voltage the flyback SMPS operates in the normal mode the controller determines the current limit of the primary current Iaccording to the feedback voltage V while the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iremains substantially constant or fixed independent of the feedback voltage V. In the normal mode as the output load increases the feedback voltage Vincreases and the flyback SMPS increases the power delivery by increasing only the current limit of the primary current I.

In particularly in the normal mode as shown in left part of the Vcs limit curve and the switching frequency curve respectively when the feedback voltage Vhas not yet reached a base feedback voltage V the current limit of the primary current Iand the sense voltage limit Vcs lim can remain at a constant to supply sufficient energy to the output load. When the feedback voltage Vequals or exceeds the base feedback voltage V then the current limit of the primary current Iand the sense voltage limit Vcs lim have to be increased to supply sufficient energy to the output load. In the embodiments when the feedback voltage Vequals or exceeds the base feedback voltage V then the current limit of the primary current Iand the sense voltage limit Vcs lim are increased in proportion to the feedback voltage Vaccordingly. The peak power mode voltage Vctlp is determined by the core saturation point of the transformer such that the transformer will not result in the core saturation condition when the switching frequency Fremains substantially constant at F and the primary current Iincreases up to I not shown as a first sense voltage Vincreases to V. Although in the present embodiment the Vcs limit curve rises from the base feedback voltage V in some implementations the Vcs limit curve does not rise from the base feedback voltage V but rather increases steadily from the origin of the graph in .

When the feedback voltage Vexceeds a n peak power mode voltage Vctlp the flyback SMPS operates in the high power mode. In certain circuit applications such as printers motors or CPU a higher current limit is required for a short period of time for boosted power operations. The amount of excess power in the high power mode may be as high as twice or three four times of the maximum power delivered in the normal mode. In the high power mode as the output load increases then the feedback voltage Vincreases and the flyback SMPS increases the power delivery by increasing the current limit of the primary current Iand or the switching frequency Fof the primary input current I. Specifically the current limit of the primary current Iand the switching frequency Fcan be increased with the feedback voltage V. The switching frequency Fis increased to extend the operating range of the input current Iwithout causing the core saturation condition. Therefore by increasing switching frequency F the current limit of the primary current Ican be increased to boost the energy provision without resulting in the core saturation condition. In certain embodiments the current limit of the primary current Ican be increased with the feedback voltage Vat a rate substantially the same as the increasing rate in the normal mode. In other embodiments the current limit of the primary current Ican be increased at a rate different from that in the normal mode. Moreover in some embodiments the increasing rate of the current limit of the primary current Iin the high power mode is adaptable by a configuration set to the controller as depicted in FIG. .

In some embodiments the high power mode is further implemented in 3 zones illustrated by zones A B and C. The zone A is defined by a range between the peak power mode voltage Vctlp and a voltage of control voltage limit Vcp second threshold voltage . When the feedback voltage Vis in the zone A the current limit of the primary current Iand the switching frequency Fare increased in proportion to the feedback voltage V. The current limit of the primary current Iand the switching frequency Fmay be increased in the same or different rates. When the current limit of the primary current Icontinues to be increased till the maximal voltage limit Vis reached the transformer is close to the core saturation condition despite the increase in the switching frequency F thus the flyback SMPS enters the zone B.

The zone B is defined by a range between the voltage of control voltage limit Vcp and a voltage of switching frequency limit Vfp third threshold voltage . When the feedback voltage Vis in the zone B the switching frequency Fare increased in proportion to the feedback voltage Vwhile the current limit of the primary current Iremains substantially constant as the sense voltage Vremains at the maximal voltage limit V independent of the change in the feedback voltage V. In the zone B the power delivery is not increased much because when the switching frequency Fhas approached a relatively large value the reciprocal of the switching frequency Fin Equation 3 is an insignificant term. For a transformer having a lower margin to saturation the core saturation condition is easily resulted in when the feedback voltage Vapproaches the voltage of control voltage limit Vcp a small increase in the primary current Iwill easily lead to the core saturation of the transformer. Thus the zone B serves as a buffer region to compensate for the sharp surge of the inductor current when the transformer design is marginal. Referring to Equation 3 when the switching frequency Fis the only parameter which increases the reciprocal term of the switching frequency Fin Equation 3 becomes negligible when the switching frequency Fincreases to a certain level a further increase in the switching frequency Fwill result in very little increase in the output power P. Thus the flyback SMPS enters the zone C.

The zone C is defined by a range exceeding the voltage of switching frequency limit Vfp. When the feedback voltage Vis in the zone C the current limit of the primary current Iand the switching frequency Frespectively remain substantially constant at I not shown corresponding to V and F irrespective of the increase of the feedback voltage V. Since the current limit of the primary current Iand the switching frequency Fare both fixed the output power Premains substantially the same. If the delivered power is still insufficient for the output load and the transformer attempts to draw additional current the flyback SMPS will enter a short circuit mode or an overload mode as depicted in . Typically a timer will keep the controller from operating in the short circuit mode for too long. A protection mechanism will be triggered to either shut down the flyback SMPS or enable the flyback SMPS to enter an auto start state.

While the embodiment in illustrates the flyback SMPS incorporating the zones A B and C for the high power mode those skilled in the art would recognize that the flyback SMPS can be adapted to operate with simply the zone A the zones A and B or the zones A and C according to the design preference.

The embodiment in illustrates a flyback SMPS employing the high power mode to acquire increased power delivery.

In the normal mode the Vcs limit curves and are identical and merged into one line the switching frequency line remains substantially constant with respect to the feedback voltage V as discussed in . After the flyback SMPS transitions from the normal mode to the high power mode the flyback SMPS is configured to select one of the Vcs limit curves and and adjust the current limit of the primary current Iaccording to the selected voltage limit curve. The adaptable changing rate of the current limit of the primary current Iallows the flyback SMPS to select the smoother Vcs limit curve when the high current may cause the core saturation in the transformer and or the over current stress across the switching transistor Q or select the steeper Vcs limit curve to provide extensive power delivery to the output load or select the original Vcs limit curve when moderate power delivery is required by the output load without causing the core saturation in the transformer and the current breakthrough across the switching transistor Q.

In some implementations the controller of the flyback SMPS can switch the Vcs limit curve at any time according to a predefined selection scheme implemented by hardware circuit or embedded codes in the controller . For example the predefined selection scheme may include that when the required power delivery exceeds a high power delivery threshold switch the selected Vcs limit curve to the steeper Vcs limit curve when the current limit approaches to the saturation current of the transformer switch the selected Vcs limit curve to the smoother Vcs limit curve when first entering the high power mode use the original Vcs limit curve as the default Vcs limit curve. In other implementations the controller can select the Vcs limit curve upon entering the high power mode.

The different changing rates through may be implemented by parallel connected current sources with an increasing number of the parallel connected current sources to provide for the changing rates through

Although the embodiment only shows the zone A and zone C in the high power mode those skilled in the art should recognize that other combination of the zones A B and C may be incorporated in the high power mode in .

The embodiment in depicts the flyback SMPS incorporating an adaptive changing rate of the current limit for the primary current Iin the high power mode offering flexible and controllable power delivery.

The control scheme 4 is different from the control schemes and in that a short circuit protection is implemented into the design. When the output load draws an extraordinary amount of the output power from the flyback SMPS the large current may saturate the transformer damage the switching transistor Q or other internal circuit component in the flyback SMPS . T As a consequence the flyback SMPS is designed to be protected from drawing the excessive current in the short circuit condition. When the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to a short circuit voltage V the short circuit condition is identified.

To prevent the flyback SMPS from being burnt out by the short circuit condition the controller may include a timer circuit not shown to limit the duration of time which the system falls into the short circuit condition. When the timer reaches its set point the controller enters a protection zone D which adjusts the PWM output Sand the current limit of the primary current Ito a short circuit current protection level which corresponds to a voltage limit V. In some implementations the controller is configured to gradually lower the current limit of the primary current Ito a short circuit current limit which corresponds to a short circuit voltage limit V. In other implementations the controller is configured to directly reduce the current limit of the primary current Ito a short circuit current limit which corresponds to a short circuit voltage limit Vby a step function without the intermediate decreasing buffer region not shown . In some implementations the controller is configured to trigger a re start mechanism when the short circuit condition is not removed. If the short circuit condition continues the flyback SMPS will be shut down and re started again repeatedly until the short circuit condition is removed.

The embodiment in depicts the flyback SMPS incorporating a short circuit protection preventing from the irreversible damage to the flyback SMPS under the short circuit condition.

The embodiments in show the flyback SMPS providing the high power mode which supports extensive power delivery by increasing the switching frequency Falong with the current limit of the primary current Iof the transformer primary current I as the feedback voltage Vexceeds the peak power mode voltage Vctlp. The current waveforms in show the behaviors of the input primary current I top half and the output secondary current I bottom half as the output load increases. As the output load increases the peak current waveforms current Iand the average current waveforms current Iare increased accordingly transformer secondary averaged output current Tis increased as well resulting in the increase in the output power delivery at the secondary circuit.

Upon startup the flyback SMPS is powered on and operates in the normal mode where the current limit Iof the primary current Iincreases with the feedback voltage V while the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iremains constant irrespective of the feedback voltage V S thereby providing the output voltage Vthrough the secondary winding W to the secondary circuit when the switching transistor Q is turned off. The resistor network at the secondary circuit then determines the output voltage V S to provide the feedback voltage Vthrough the optic couplers Dand Dto the controller S . The feedback voltage Vis generated by firstly dividing the output voltage Vby a voltage divider circuit to acquire the divided voltage V feeding the divided voltage Vto the shunt regulator T to produces a shunt regulator generated current which is in proportion to the difference of the divided voltage Vand the internal reference voltage converting the shunt regulator generated current proportionally to the feedback voltage Vthrough the optic couplers Dand D and providing the feedback voltage Vto the controller for controlling the current limit and the switching frequency of the PWM signal S. Upon receiving the feedback voltage V the controller compares the feedback voltage Vand the peak power mode voltage Vctlp and determines whether the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the peak power mode voltage Vctlp S . When it does the output load demands a power delivery exceeding the power supply capacity supported by the normal mode thus the controller switches the operation mode of the flyback SMPS from the normal mode to the high power mode S . In the high power mode both the current limit Iand the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iincreases with the feedback voltage V thereby flux density of transformer is lower the maximum allowed transformer primary current can be increased subsequently the current limit can be raised accordingly without causing the core saturation condition and supply more power to the output load. The method adopted in the high power mode is detailed in control methods through in . When the feedback voltage Vis less than the peak power mode voltage Vctlp the normal mode is able to handle the power requirement demanded by the output load then the controller remains to operate in the normal mode S .

The control method 6 allows the flyback SMPS to operate in the normal mode and the high power mode increasing power delivery to the output load in the high power mode by concurrently increasing the current limit Iand the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iaccording with increased feedback voltage V.

Upon startup of the control method 7 the flyback SMPS has been switched to the high power mode therefore the controller controls the PWM signal Sto allow the current limit Iand the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iincrease with the feedback voltage V S . Referring to the high power mode contains the zones A B and C. The controller determines whether the flyback SMPS should operate in the zone A or zone B to meet the power requirement of the output load by determining whether the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the voltage of control voltage limit Vcp S .

When the feedback voltage Vis less than the voltage of control voltage limit Vcp the controller keeps the flyback SMPS remain in the zone A the current limit Iand the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iincrease with the feedback voltage V S the controller returns to Step to determine zone A or zone B to go by monitoring voltage of V S .

If the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the voltage of control voltage limit Vcp the controller then keeps the flyback SMPS in the zone B that is the current limit Iapproaches to the saturation current of the transformer consequently the controller increases the switching frequency Fwith the feedback voltage Vwhile maintains a substantially constant current limit I S . In the zone B the power delivery is not increased much with the increasing switching frequency F since the switching frequency Fhas approached a relatively large value the reciprocal term of the switching frequency Fin Equation 3 is insignificant producing little increase in the output power.

While the flyback SMPS is operating in the zone B the controller will determine whether the flyback SMPS should stay in zone B or enters zone C by Step S in which the controller checks whether the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the voltage of switching frequency limit Vfp.

When the feedback voltage Vis less than the voltage of switching frequency limit Vfp the controller keeps the flyback SMPS in the zone B the control method 7 returns to Step S increasing the switching frequency Fwith the feedback voltage Vand maintain a substantially constant current limit I.

When the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the switching frequency limit Vfp the controller switches the flyback SMPS to the zone B that is both the current limit Iand the switching frequency Fof the primary current Iremains substantially constant regardless of the change of the feedback voltage V S . If the feedback voltage Vcontinues increasing the output power delivery is still insufficient for the output load and the transformer attempts to draw additional current the flyback SMPS will enter short circuit mode and is either shut down or re started before the short circuit condition removed.

After Step S the control method 7 is completed and exited S . The control method 7 allows the flyback SMPS to operate in the zones A B and C of the high power mode increasing output power delivery while preventing the core of the transformer from saturation.

Upon startup of the control method 8 the flyback SMPS has been switched to the high power mode therefore the controller controls the PWM signal Sto allow the current limit Iand the switching frequency F of the primary current Iincreases with the feedback voltage V S . Referring to the current limit Icurve is adaptable by the controller based on the power requirement. The controller can increase the current limit Iwith the feedback voltage Vat the adaptable rate S . Upon firstly entering into the high power mode the controller may use the Vcs limit curve as a default adaptable rate and changes the adaptable rate to the smoother Vcs limit curve or the steeper Vcs limit curve based on whether the transformer close to core saturation the current stress across the switching transistor Q and power requirement by the output load. In some implementations the adaptable rate may be changed at any time during the high power mode. The controller continues to check and determine whether the adaptable rate should be changed S . If the adaptable rate remains the same the controller will go back to Step S and continue to restrict the current limit Iof the primary current Ibased on the current adaptable rate. If the adaptable rate is changed the controller will modify the current limit Ibased on the changed new adaptable rate S . When the controller detects that the core saturation or the transistor over current stress condition are about to occur the adaptable rate can be decreased. When the controller detects that surge power requirement is demanded by the output load the adaptable rate can be increased. When the controller detects the power requirement of the output load can be met by the present changing rate the controller will maintain the present adaptable rate. After Step S the control method 8 is completed and exited S .

The control method 8 allows the flyback SMPS to operate by an adaptable rate in the high power mode delivering surge output power while preventing the transformer from saturation.

Upon startup of the control method 9 the flyback SMPS has been switched to the high power mode S . When the output load requires considerable output power which makes the feedback voltage exceed switching frequency limit Vfp the controller is configured to maintain the switching frequency Fat the frequency limit Fand the current limit Iat the current limit I. After the point of the voltage of switching frequency limit Vfp The controller continues to check whether the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the short circuit voltage V S . When the feedback voltage Vexceeds or equals to the short circuit voltage V the output load has demanded more output power than the flyback SMPS can provide. Consequently the controller is configured to reduce the current limit Ito the short circuit current Iwhich is less than the current limit I. S to prevent from drawing excessive current at the input primary current I otherwise will result the unwanted transformer saturation and switching transistor Q over current stress conditions. The control method 9 is then completed and exited S .

The control method 9 provides a short circuit protection to the flyback SMPS preventing the flyback SMPS from damage due to the over loading condition.
