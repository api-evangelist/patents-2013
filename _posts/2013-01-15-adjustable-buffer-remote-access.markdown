The computing device may render a representation of the operating environment as part of a graphical interface which may be output for presentation on a display unit of the computing device. The representation of the operating environment may be rendered at a defined display resolution which may define a display area included in the graphical interface.

An aspect is a method for adjustable buffer remote access. Adjustable buffer remote access may include generating at a client device a client display buffer request indicating a portion of a display area of an operating environment of a host device transmitting the client display buffer request to the host device receiving a rendered buffer portion including a rendering of a representation of the portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device wherein the rendered buffer portion includes a client display portion and a margin portion presenting the client display portion as a window into the display area of the operating environment of the host device.

Another aspect is another method for adjustable buffer remote access. Adjustable buffer remote access may include initiating an adjustable buffer remote access session wherein initiating the adjustable buffer remote access session includes receiving host display information indicating the display area generating at a client device a client display buffer request indicating a portion of a display area of an operating environment of a host device and transmitting the client display buffer request to the host device via an electronic communication network. The method of adjustable buffer remote access may include receiving via the electronic communication network a rendered buffer portion including a rendering of a representation of the portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device wherein the rendered buffer portion includes a client display portion and a margin portion identifying the client display portion based on a difference between the rendered buffer portion and the margin portion and presenting the client display portion as a window into the display area of the operating environment of the host device by outputting a portion of the rendered buffer portion corresponding to the client display portion to a graphical display device of the client device.

Adjustable buffer remote access may include initiating an adjustable buffer remote access session wherein initiating the adjustable buffer remote access session includes receiving host display information indicating the display area generating at a client device a client display buffer request indicating a portion of a display area of an operating environment of a host device and transmitting the client display buffer request to the host device via an electronic communication network. The method of adjustable buffer remote access may include receiving via the electronic communication network a rendered buffer portion including a rendering of a representation of the portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device wherein the rendered buffer portion includes a client display portion and a margin portion presenting the client display portion as a window into the display area of the operating environment of the host device by outputting a portion of the rendered buffer portion corresponding to the client display portion to a graphical display device of the client device receiving an indication of a client display portion change from a user input device of the client device via an operating system of the client device wherein the client display portion change indicates a change in position size or zoom of the client display portion relative to the representation of the display area of the operating environment of the host device presenting an updated client display portion based on the rendered buffer portion and the client display portion change wherein the updated client display portion includes a portion of the margin portion transmitting an updated client display buffer request to the host device indicating an updated portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device based on the client display portion change receiving an updated rendered buffer portion including a rendering of a representation of the updated portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device wherein the updated rendered buffer portion includes the updated client display portion and an updated margin portion and presenting the updated client display portion.

Remote access technologies such as remote desktop or screen sharing may allow a computing device client to remotely access an operating environment of another computing device host . For example the host device may render a representation of a display area of the operating environment which may be associated with a defined resolution and may transmit the rendered output to the client device for presentation on a display unit of the client device. Rendering the representation of the display area may include for example capturing the content of the display area and encoding the content as a series of frames.

In moving window based remote access technologies the host device may render a representation of a portion of the display area of operating environment on the host device and may transmit the output including the rendered portion of the display area to the client device. The client device may present the output as a window into the display area of the operating environment. The window may be moved to include another portion of the display area and the host device may render the other portion of the display area and transmit the output to the client device for presentation.

In some implementations moving window based remote access technologies may perform poorly at the client device due to the time utilized between input of a change in window position at the client device and receipt at the client device of the output rendered by the host device. For example changing the portion displayed may include transmitting information indicating the new the portion of the display area from the client device to the host device which may include a size of the portion rendering the new portion of the display area at the host device transmitting the output from the host device to the client device and presenting the rendering of the new portion at the display unit of the client device.

Adjustable buffer remote access may improve remote access performance and may include transmitting information indicating the a buffer portion of the display area from the client device to the host device rendering the buffer portion of the display area at the host device transmitting the output from the host device to the client device and presenting the a display portion of the rendered buffer portion at the display unit of the client device wherein the display portion is smaller than and included within the buffer portion.
