The present Application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 793 504 filed Mar. 15 2013 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent it does not conflict herewith.

The present invention relates to gas dispersing test fixtures and more particularly to a disseminated vapor capture device configured for disseminating a vapor stream to facilitate testing and evaluating of vapor detection instruments in a safe reliable and cost effective manner.

Chemical weapons used for dispersing chemical warfare CW agents over a wide target area pose serious threats to both civilian and military personnel throughout the world. CW agents can be classified into four categories nerve agents blister agents choking agents and blood agents. Some examples of CW agents which are formulated to inflict death or harm to people include sarin GB soman GD distilled mustard HD cyanogen chloride CK and hydrogen cyanide AC . In the face of such threats the ability to rapidly detect and identify CW agents becomes critical to initiating an immediate and effective response to minimize casualties. Such detection relies on the use of vapor detection instruments configured to detect CW agents and other such hazardous vapors. To ensure operational effectiveness these vapor detection instruments especially those of newly developed systems must undergo specific procedures for testing and evaluation prior to service and periodically thereafter.

During testing test fixtures are typically used to deliver vapor streams containing target particles or analyte to the vapor detection instrument under testing. These test fixtures are generally constructed with an open cup design through which the vapor stream is passed. The open cup includes a closed end through which an inlet is connected to a vapor generating apparatus and an open end located opposite from the closed end. The gas sampling inlet of the vapor detection instrument is positioned in the test fixture s cup through the open end prior to activating the vapor generating apparatus. Once the vapor generating apparatus is activated the vapor detection instrument is challenged via the test fixture as the vapor stream disseminates into the open cup from the inlet. Samples of the vapor stream can be collected by the vapor detection instrument through the corresponding gas sampling inlet to provide the necessary test readings.

The open cup design of the test fixtures offers a suitable means for delivering a vapor stream challenge to vapor detection instruments. However this design provides no safeguard against inadvertent release of potentially dangerous target particles or analytes into the atmosphere at large and contamination of the environment or individuals testing the vapor detection instrument. Because portions of the vapor stream not sampled by a typical vapor detection instrument are expelled through the open end of the cup portion of the associated test fixture the testing must be carried out under a fume hood to capture the expelled vapors and minimize its release into the testing work area.

The above arrangement provides sufficient safety for non toxic or slightly toxic target particles or analytes. However this arrangement is especially impractical where the target particles or analytes are extremely toxic and too dangerous to handle directly. The operation of the test fixtures in fume hoods can pose undue safety hazards to the testing worker. In such circumstances the test must be performed with the entire assembly i.e. vapor generating equipment reference detector and vapor detection instrument inside a glovebox under a fume hood. There are several disadvantages associated with above mentioned test fixtures and their reliance on fume hoods and or gloveboxes.

Fume hoods alone provide only limited protection against exposure. In addition to their limited protection the relatively large size and complexity of such equipment necessitates costly and labor intensive cleanup after multiple testing. With regard to gloveboxes they are quite expensive to fabricate and use. Although gloveboxes are vastly safer and more effective in isolating the toxic target particles or analytes from the immediate work area the thick gloves and placement of all the equipment therein make the testing process more difficult to carry out. Furthermore the placement of the test equipment including the vapor generating equipment and the vapor detection instrument within the glovebox means that they are exposed to the dangerous chemicals during testing. This necessitates not only cleanup and decontamination of the glovebox interior but also all the equipment housed therein. Accordingly extensive labor and cost expenditures are accrued after each use.

Accordingly there is a need to develop a disseminated vapor capture device configured for challenging a gas sampling apparatus such as a vapor detection instrument with a vapor stream containing target particles or analytes in a safe reliable and cost effective manner. There is a further need for a disseminated vapor capture device capable of disseminating a vapor stream that significantly reduces the risks of a testing worker s exposure to the vapor stream while offering enhanced portability and convenient operation. There is a further need for a disseminated vapor capture device that is lightweight compact and relatively inexpensive.

The present invention relates generally to a disseminated vapor capture device configured for challenging a gas sampling apparatus e.g. vapor detection instrument with a vapor stream in a manner that minimizes release of the vapor stream into the ambient atmosphere. The device of the present invention is designed to facilitate chemical vapor detection testing of the gas sampling apparatus to detect target particles or analytes entrained in the vapor stream. The device of the present invention is configured to provide compact containment of the vapor stream with the flexibility of permitting one or more gas sampling apparatuses to be tested for greater efficiency and convenience. The device of the present invention eliminates the need to rely on expensive bulky and difficult to use fume hoods and gloveboxes that would require subsequent decontamination cleaning of the fume hoods gloveboxes and the test gear equipment. The present invention provides a safe reliable and cost effective means for implementing the testing of gas sampling apparatuses.

In particular the compact structural features of the present invention enable capture of all excess vapor stream for enhanced safety to testing workers. The device of the present invention is compatible for testing of any gas sampling apparatus regardless of its size shape or configuration. In addition the device of the present invention avoids the problem of gross contamination of the gas sampling apparatus under testing that would otherwise occur using prior art methods with gloveboxes for example where the entire gas sampling apparatus would be exposed to the vapor stream.

The present device also avoids the need to view the gas sampling apparatus in an enclosed containment and operating it through thick gloves as encountered with the use of the gloveboxes during testing. Any manipulation of the gas sampling apparatus under test including pressing buttons or reading display screens requires much less effort with this device because a large portion of the apparatus is not enclosed. Further the present device is relatively inexpensive and simple to make as compared to the gloveboxes which require significant design build and installation time with costs that can reach tens of thousands of dollars.

Accordingly the device of the present invention is designed to substantially enhance the efficiency and effective dissemination of the vapor stream through its self contained compact and lightweight construction while avoiding or at least substantially minimizing the limitations and problems associated with prior art test fixture devices. The design of the present device also greatly reduces the amount of material required to generate the vapor stream and the target particles or analytes resulting in less waste and further cost savings. Optionally the device of the present invention can further be configured to permit simultaneous testing of multiple gas sampling apparatuses e.g. vapor detection instruments for enhanced savings in time and labor. The device of the present invention is cost effective and relatively simple to make and implement.

In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a disseminated vapor capture device for challenging a gas sampling apparatus with a vapor stream in which the device includes an inlet being adapted for connection to a vapor generating apparatus producing a vapor stream containing target particles or analytes an outer shell enclosing an inner chamber in communication with the inlet the inner chamber being adapted for passing the vapor stream therethrough an outlet being adapted for connection to a vacuum source the outlet being in communication with the inner chamber for passing the vapor stream out of the inner chamber and at least one sampling port in communication with the inner chamber the at least one sampling port each being configured for coupling engagement with a gas sampling apparatus.

The term gas sampling apparatus as used herein refers to a chemical vapor detection instrument or system containing sensors that generate a signal in the presence of target particles or analytes which may be in the form of hazardous or dangerous chemical vapors or gases in the air informing personnel of the presence of such chemical vapors or gases. Such gas sampling apparatuses typically include an external gas sampling inlet through which a sample gas flow is collected from the ambient atmosphere. An example of a gas sampling apparatus is the Smiths Detection GID 3 Chemical Detector marketed by Smiths Detection of Danbury Conn.

The term vapor stream as used herein refers to a flowing mixture of air entrained with a vapor emission produced by a vapor generating apparatus to which the present invention is operatively connected. The vapor emission contains target particles or analytes at a target vapor challenge concentration. The vapor stream is presented to a gas sampling apparatus via the present invention to test its detection capability. Such vapor generating apparatuses typically rely on precision micro dispensing technology such as ink jet technology to precisely eject minute amounts of selected chemical compounds and convert them into target particles or analytes in the form of vapor.

For example this can be achieved by applying an electrical pulse to a piezoelectric micro dispenser which causes a drop of fluid to be ejected through a precise orifice and the resulting droplets are exposed to heat thereby converting them into vapor. The amount of target particles or analytes challenged can be readily controlled by the number frequency or size of the droplets generated or concentration of the target compounds in the droplets.

The term target articles or analytes as used herein refers to vapor gas or aerosol particles or analytes that are used to test the detection capability of a gas sampling apparatus to a particular chemical vapor or gas. The target particles or analytes may be a CW agent or a suitable chemical simulant.

In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a disseminated vapor capture device for challenging a gas sampling apparatus with a vapor stream in which the device includes an outer shell having an interior surface and opposed first and second ends an inlet located at the first end of the outer shell for attachment to a vapor generating apparatus an inner tubular member enclosed within the outer shell with a truncated open end extending from the inlet toward the second end of the outer shell the tubular member defining an inner chamber in communication with the inlet at least one sampling port located at the second end of the outer shell in communication with the inner chamber the at least one sampling port being configured for coupling engagement with a gas sampling apparatus a cavity defined by the interior surface of the outer shell extending along an outer portion of the tubular member the cavity being in communication with the inner chamber through the truncated open end of the tubular member and an outlet located on the outer shell in communication with the cavity wherein the pathway of the vapor stream extends from the inlet through the inner chamber the truncated open end of the tubular member and the cavity to the outlet.

With reference to there is shown a disseminated vapor capture device referred hereinafter as the device identified generally by reference numeral in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The device is adapted to disseminate a vapor stream containing target particles or analytes to a gas sampling apparatus e.g. vapor detection instrument or chemical vapor detector for testing purposes. In this manner the device functions to simulate the dispersal of target particles or analytes in the ambient atmosphere under conditions which the gas sampling device would encounter in the field. The device is adapted to simulate such conditions within a closed environment preventing any release of the disseminated vapor stream into the ambient atmosphere. The use of the device effectively eliminates the need for gloveboxes fume hoods to handle or manage the contaminated vapors for substantial savings in terms of cost and labor while maintaining an elevated level of safety. Although the present invention is described in the context of challenging the sampling apparatus with gases and vapors it will be understood that the present invention can readily be used in connection with challenging an aerosol sample apparatus with a vapor stream containing an aerosol type target particles solids or liquids as one skilled in the art will recognize.

In one embodiment of the present invention the device generally includes an vapor stream inlet configured for operatively coupling to a vapor generating apparatus via line tubing an vapor stream outlet configured for operatively coupling to a vacuum source via line tubing and a sampling port adapted for receiving and retaining a sampling tube connected via a line tubing to an external gas sampling inlet of the gas sampling apparatus . The sampling port and sampling tube in combination provide an interface for the gas sampling apparatus to draw a quantity of a gas sample as needed. The vapor generating apparatus is designed to supply a vapor stream containing target particles or analytes to the device through the line tubing and inlet . The vacuum source produces a vacuum or pressure drop in the device to draw the vapor stream through the outlet .

The vacuum source may include a gas purification module to decontaminate the vapor stream of any dangerous or hazardous chemicals that may be present. In this manner the vapor stream can be made safe for subsequent release into the atmosphere. The gas purification module may accomplish the decontamination through any suitable means including but not limited to filters sorbents activated carbon catalysts enzymes thermal treatment and the like.

The device includes an outer shell or housing having an interior surface and opposing first and second ends and and an inner tubular member enclosed within the outer shell . The inner tubular member affixed to the interior surface at the first end of the outer shell coaxially extends downwardly toward the second end terminating into a truncated open end . The tubular member defines an inner chamber that is in communication with the inlet located at the first end of the outer shell .

The device further includes a cavity defined between the interior surface of the outer shell and an outer portion of the tubular member . The cavity is in communication with the inner chamber at the truncated open end of the tubular member . The sampling port located at the second end of the outer shell proximate to the inner chamber is configured to receive and retain the sampling tube which extends into the inner chamber for facilitating sampling of the vapor stream passing therethrough. The outlet in communication with the cavity is connected to the vacuum source to generate a pressure gradient much less than atmospheric pressure. The vapor stream is drawn through the device by way of the inlet into the inner chamber .

The vapor stream disseminates within the inner chamber allowing the gas sampling apparatus or vapor detector to sample the vapor stream for the target particles or analytes. The disseminated vapor stream then proceeds through the truncated open end of the outer shell and the cavity and exits through the outlet to the vacuum source . During vapor dissemination the vapor stream remains confined within the device and is removed by the vacuum source with none of the vapor stream being released into the ambient atmosphere.

In a further embodiment of the present invention the device includes an open vent port located on the outer shell proximate the outlet and an access aperture as shown best in located on the tubular member . The aperture is aligned axially with the vent port . The vent port remains open to ambient atmosphere to allow air to entrain with the vapor stream and prevent buildup of excessive negative pressure in the device . It is understood that the pressure within the device should be maintained at a suitable level ensuring continuous air flow from ambient through the vent port to avoid release of the vapor stream into the atmosphere. The access aperture provides the testing worker access to the atmosphere of the inner chamber for accurate sampling and vapor concentration determination using a standardized or laboratory gas sampling apparatus not shown .

In particular the access aperture allows the testing worker to safely measure the actual concentration of the target particles or analytes in the vapor stream . To measure the actual value the sampling probe e.g. sorbent tube or bubbler of the standard or laboratory gas sampling apparatus is inserted through the vent port and access aperture into the vapor stream passing the inner chamber . This actual value as measured by the standardized gas sampling apparatus is used to appropriately evaluate qualify and validate the gas sampling apparatus being tested. The performance quality safety stability and effectiveness of the tested gas sampling apparatus can be determined accordingly.

A pressure port is disposed on the outer shell in communication with the cavity and is adapted for fluid coupling to a pressure measuring apparatus such as a manometer via a line tubing . In one embodiment of the present invention the pressure port is positioned on the side opposite from the outlet to provide a stable reading. The manometer is used to monitor the pressure within the device to ensure proper operation and to detect any unwanted leakage. The presence of leakage can easily be checked by covering the vent port and comparing the corresponding pressure reading of the manometer with the expected pressure reading. If the pressure measured with the vent port covered is greater than the expected pressure then a suspected leak may be present in the device . Corrective measures can thereby be taken accordingly.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the outer shell and inner tubular member is constructed from any suitable inert material compatible with the gas medium and the target particles or analytes of the vapor stream and capable of enduring the physical rigors associated with disseminating a vapor stream within the device . Examples of such suitable inert material include but are not limited to metals plastics ceramics elastomers and glass. Preferably the inert material is glass and more preferably borosilicate glass. The device can be constructed using any suitable manufacturing processes as known to those skilled in the art including but not limited to glassforming 3 dimensional printing casting e.g. centrifugal continuous die molding e.g. injection compression extrusion forming e.g. forging rolling extrusion pressing machining e.g. milling turning drilling and the like.

With reference to the tubular member is configured radially spaced apart from the outer shell thus defining the cavity therebetween. The truncated open end of the tubular member optionally includes a plurality of spaced apart slots disposed radially along the periphery thereof to facilitate passage of the vapor stream from the inner chamber to the cavity as will be further described hereinafter. The outer shell further includes an externally threaded opening an internally threaded cap see with the sampling port configured for threaded coupling engagement with the externally threaded opening and a sealing member or gasket disposed between the opening and the cap . The sealing member is configured to retain the sampling tube extending through the sampling port of the cap forming a hermetic seal therearound. The distal end of the sampling tube extends into the inner chamber .

One embodiment of the present invention includes the sealing member with a resilient disk shaped plate body and a centrally located aperture axially aligned with the sampling port . The plate body is preferably constructed from an elastomeric material such as for example rubber. The sealing member aperture is suitably dimensioned for receiving and retaining the sampling tube in a snug fit. With the cap threadedly engaged to the opening the sealing member is securely packed between the edge portion of the opening and an inside portion of the cap which urges the body to compress inwardly about the sampling tube thereby forming a tight hermetic seal therearound.

Referring back to the tubular member of the device is configured to uniformly disseminate the vapor stream generated and supplied by the vapor generating apparatus within the inner chamber from the inlet to the truncated open end of the tubular member . The sampling tube is connected to the gas sampling apparatus with its distal end positioned centrally within the inner chamber to allow the vapor stream to be sampled. At the truncated open end of the tubular member the vapor stream is captured in the cavity and exits through the outlet . The vent port remains open to the atmosphere to allow make up air to be pulled in from the ambient atmosphere and avoid a build up of negative pressure in the device . The ambient air entrained into the vapor stream passes through the outlet .

With reference to the second end of the outer shell is shown with the cap with internal threads extending along the inside portion thereof and the opening with external threads extending therearound for threaded mating with the internal threads of the cap . The cap includes the centrally located sampling port for receiving and retaining the sampling tube therein. The sealing member is configured for seating within the inside portion of the cap with the aperture disposed therethrough in alignment with the sampling port .

Referring back to the overall operation of the device will now be discussed herein. The vapor generating apparatus is connected to the inlet of the device via the line tubing . The pressure measuring device is connected to the pressure port of the device via the line tubing . The cap is threadedly disengaged from the opening of the outer shell and the sealing member is removed with the cap . The sampling tube attached to the external gas sampling inlet of the gas sampling apparatus is inserted through the sampling port of the cap and the aperture of the sealing member . The cap and the sealing member are threadedly mounted back onto the threaded opening of the outer shell and secured with the sealing member abutting against the edge portion along the opening while ensuring a hermetic seal about the sampling tube .

Once the gas sampling apparatus is secured to the device for testing verification is made to ensure the entire vapor stream is safely captured. The total air entering the inner chamber is determined for achieving a desired flow rate. Once the flow rate for the device is determined and set through the vapor generating apparatus the vacuum source is connected to the outlet via the line tubing . A vapor stream absent the target particles or analytes is passed through the inlet from the vapor generating apparatus at a set flow rate. The vacuum source is set to a flow rate that is higher than the flow rate of the vapor stream passing through the inlet . Preferably the flow rate at the outlet is about 20 higher than the flow rate at the inlet .

With the vapor stream flowing the vent port which is normally open to the ambient atmosphere is covered. The pressure measuring device should display a negative pressure reading to indicate total capture of the vapor stream i.e. no leaks . If a positive pressure reading is presented on the pressure measuring device then this indicates that less than all the vapor stream is being captured. Corrective action should be made to avoid release of the vapor stream . Once it is verified that the device is operating properly with no leaks then testing of the gas sampling apparatus can be safely initiated in the usual manner.

With reference to there is shown a disseminated vapor capture device in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The structural features of present embodiment of the device are similar to the previous embodiment of the device . The device includes a plurality of sampling ports each configured for receiving and retaining a corresponding sampling tube connected to a gas sampling apparatus . With this configuration the device allows the testing worker to test multiple gas sampling apparatuses simultaneously.

A prototype of the disseminated vapor capture device was constructed with the following dimensions. It will be understood that the dimensions disclosed herein is not meant to be limiting and that the following is provided only to illustrate a particular embodiment of the present invention. The outer shell and tubular member device was fabricated from borosilicate glass using conventional glass forming techniques such as for example glassblowing.

The inlet of the device connecting the inner chamber to the vapor generating apparatus was formed into a inch ground glass joint which allows the vapor stream to be disseminated with the inner chamber . The outer shell was about 2 inches in diameter and further included the outlet vent port and pressure port each formed into a inch ground glass joint. The access aperture was about 3 mm in diameter and formed into the tubular member axially aligned with the vent port .
