title: Portable computing device with methodologies for client-side analytic data collection
abstract: A portable computing device with methodologies for client-side analytic data collection are described. In one embodiment, for example, a method performed by a portable computing device having volatile and non-volatile memory includes obtaining a plurality of events to be logged; serializing the events to be logged; storing the serialized events in the volatile memory; encrypting the serialized events to produce serialized and encrypted events; storing the serialized and encrypted events in the non-volatile memory; decrypting the serialized and encrypted events to produce serialized and decrypted events; storing the serialized and decrypted events in the volatile memory; compressing the serialized and decrypted events to produce compressed, serialized, and decrypted events; encrypting the compressed, serialized, and decrypted events to produce encrypted, compressed, and serialized events and storing the encrypted, compressed, and serialized events in the non-volatile memory.
