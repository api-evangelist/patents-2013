title: System and method for generating, accessing, and updating geofeeds
abstract: A system and method for generating a geofeed is provided. A geofeed includes a collection of content, aggregated from various content providers, that is relevant to one or more geographically definable locations. The generated content may include, for example, video, audio, images, text, hyperlinks, and/or other content that may be relevant to a geographically definable location. The content providers may include, for example, social media platforms, online knowledge databases, individual content creators, and/or other providers that can distribute content that may be relevant to a geographically definable location. The geographically definable location may be specified by a boundary, geo coordinates, an address, a place name, a point of interest, a zip code, and/or other information that can spatially identify an area. The geofeed may be presented via an interface that spatially arranges the content according to a geo-location related to the content and/or for integration with other data collection systems.

This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 13 619 888 filed Sep. 14 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention relates generally to generating geofeeds and more particularly to aggregating from various providers content relevant to one or more geographically definable locations and spatially organizing the aggregated content on a display.

The availability of content such as videos audio files photos and text over networks such as the Internet has grown at impressive rates. This growth has been fueled largely by the popularity of social media providers platforms that register users receive content from their users and distribute the content to others. Put another way users may be seen as content creators that publish their content through social media platforms. Other content creators publish content using their own websites and or network based exchanges and services such as online forums chat rooms and the like.

In many instances the created content can be automatically tagged with information such as user identifications date time information or geographic information that specifies a location where the content was created. For example cameras equipped with Global Positioning Satellite GPS units or other location aware systems may embed into an image file latitude longitude coordinates that indicate where a picture was taken. In addition modern hand held devices such as smartphones may be equipped with a GPS sensor which allows users to generate content text photos and videos with their devices and immediately share the content through a plurality of social networks. Moreover some devices allow users to manually input the foregoing and other information for embedding into the content. Furthermore editing software may allow a user to embed or otherwise associate information along with the content after the content was created.

Thus various content available online may be tagged with both automatically and manually curated information that may be useful when parsing through the overwhelming amount of content that is available. In particular because social media has become a real time instant data source obtaining tags that indicate the geographic location where the content originated could be valuable across multiple markets including news marketing first response and others.

Conventional systems have been developed in an attempt to organize the content in a meaningful way. For example various social media platforms expose Application Programming Interfaces that allow access to their data using various query parameters including location parameters. However conventional systems fail to leverage multiple sources of content such as different social media providers websites online exchanges and knowledge databases. Conventional systems also fail to collect aggregate and present in a meaningful way the diversity of content.

As such what is needed is to be able to collect and aggregate content from different providers of content such as social media platforms websites online exchanges and knowledge database. What is further needed is to be able to search for social media by geography and present the aggregated content in a meaningful way that identifies the location of where the content originated. These and other problems exist.

The invention addressing these and other drawbacks relates to a system and method for creating and accessing geofeeds. A geofeed includes an integrated collection of content aggregated from a predefined set of one or more content providers that is relevant to one or more geographically definable locations. The aggregated content may include for example video audio images text hyperlinks and or other content that may be relevant to a geographically definable location. The system may create store update and retrieve the geofeed. The system may also communicate a user interface that allows a content consumer to interact with the geofeed in various ways such as by providing multiple views of the geofeed. For example the content consumer may manipulate the geofeed by showing hiding or sorting content from the geofeed based on a source of the content a ranking of the content and or other criteria for modifying the view of the geofeed. The content consumer may also manipulate the presentation of the geofeed by switching between or combining a collage or grid like view of the aggregated content a map view that spatially arranges the aggregated content on a map and a list view that shows a listing of the aggregated content. The content consumer may also choose to access the geofeed s content via an application programming interface API provided by the Geofeed system for integration with other systems including Geographic Information Systems GIS applications Customer Relationship Management CRM systems Content Management Systems CMS etc.

In some implementations the system may include a computer that aggregates the content from the predefined set of content providers which may include social media platforms online knowledge databases individual content creators and or other providers that can distribute content that may be relevant to a geographically definable location.

In some implementations the computer may be programmed with computer program modules. The computer program modules may include a geofeed creation module a geofeed retrieval module a geofeed update module a geofeed user interface module and or other modules.

The geofeed creation module may configure the computer to receive a request to create the geofeed. The request to create the geofeed may include a specification of one or more geographically definable locations also referred to herein as the geo location and one or more geofeed parameters such as for example providers to include or exclude types of content to include or exclude date ranges content matching patterns keywords and or other parameters that instruct the system as to which content should be included in the geofeed.

The geofeed creation module may include sub modules that are used to create the geofeed based on the request. The sub modules may format the request receive content from the providers format the received content filter the received content perform a data integrity check on the received content and or perform other processing to create the geofeed. For example the sub modules may include a pre processing module a post processing module a filtering module an integrity checking module and or other modules.

The pre processing module may configure the computer to format the request in order to be compatible with a format used by each of the predefined set of content providers. For example a content provider may expose an API for accessing e.g. request and or receiving its content. The API may require an input according to a particular format that may be different from the input format required from another API. For example and without limitation a request to create a geofeed may include a geo location specification that specifies an address for which to create the geofeed but the API may take as input a point and radius location. Yet another API may take as input a zip code. Another example is that of one or more boundaries that define the geo location specification for a geofeed and that geo location specification may be transformed into point and radius or other boundaries as required by the provider APIs.

The pre processing module may configure the computer to normalize the geo location specification from the request to be compatible with both APIs. For example the address may be normalized into a point that defines a geographic center of the address and a radius about the center in order to interface with the API that requires a point and radius as input. On the other hand the address may be normalized into a zip code of which the address is a part in order to interface with the API that requests a zip code as input.

Some content providers may not expose an API. In these implementations the pre processing module may configure the computer to normalize the request to be compatible with the content provider even in the absence of an API. For example the pre processing module may configure the computer to request content from the content provider directly by crawling a website of the provider executing search queries related to the provider on a search module and or using other techniques to access content from the provider.

In some implementations the pre processing module may generate a geofeed definition that describes a geofeed such that a geofeed may be dynamically generated based on the geofeed definition. For example the geofeed definition may include the geo location specification geofeed parameters and or other information related to the geofeed that can be used to aggregate content from various content providers. The geofeed definition may be identified by a geofeed identifier and stored for later retrieval so that a content consumer or others may select and obtain a geofeed that was previously defined.

The post processing module may configure the computer to normalize the content and or other descriptive information into a format that is compatible with the system. The content from the content providers may be provided in different formats and may include various meta data and or other descriptive information that describes the content. In some implementations the content may include embedded data such as for example EXIF data. The post processing module may configure the computer to extract the embedded data and normalize the extracted data as appropriate. In some implementations the post processing module may configure the computer to rank the received content. For example a rank or score may be assigned to the received content based on various ranking factors such as for example relevance to a specified geo location content creator who created the content and other attributes about the creator such as influencer ranking content provider who provided the content and or other factors that can be used to rank content.

In some implementations the filtering module may configure the computer to filter the received content from the content providers by adding and or removing particular ones of the received content. The filtered content may be added to and or omitted from the geofeed. In some implementations the content that is omitted from the geofeed may be stored in a memory so that the content consumer may be notified of such content. In some implementations the filtering module may configure the computer to filter content based on a sensitivity of the received content. For example the system may omit granular content that may be used to track a location of an individual content creator.

In some implementations the integrity checking module may configure the computer to determine whether content includes potentially inaccurate information. Content that is associated with inaccurate information may be omitted and or flagged. For example the integrity checking module may configure the computer to determine whether a geo location related to provided content is accurately reported by content providers. In particular when content from a content creator e.g. a social media user is not automatically geo tagged e.g. by a GPS enabled hand held device a particular content provider may use an address associated with the content creator to define a location of where the content was created.

The geofeed creation module may configure the computer to aggregate the received content which may or may not be filtered and or checked for potential data integrity problems and generate a geofeed based on the aggregated content. In some implementations the geofeed e.g. content of the geofeed may be stored. In these implementations a stored geofeed may include only content that was aggregated at the time that the geofeed was created. The stored geofeed is different from a stored geofeed definition in that the stored geofeed includes only content and or links to content aggregated at the time that the geofeed was created e.g. has no new relevant content that may have been newly added since the geofeed was originally created defined while a geofeed definition may be used to dynamically aggregate content from providers that is currently available which may include content that is available after the geofeed was originally defined.

The geofeed user interface module may configure the computer to communicate a user interface for receiving requests to create a geofeed receiving requests to retrieve a previously created geofeed and or communicating the geofeed as described above with respect to manipulating views of a geofeed.

The geofeed retrieval module may configure the computer to receive a request to obtain a previously requested geofeed. The previously requested geofeed may be obtained in various ways.

In some implementations a previously requested geofeed may be retrieved by obtaining a corresponding geofeed definition for the requested geofeed. In these implementations the geofeed retrieval module may cause the geofeed creation module to dynamically aggregate content from the content providers that conforms to the geofeed definition. As such the retrieved geofeed will include relevant content that was newly added since the previously requested geofeed was first created.

In some implementations the previously requested geofeed may be retrieved from memory instead of being dynamically generated based on a geofeed definition. In these implementations the retrieved geofeed will not include newly added relevant content since the geofeed was originally created unless the geofeed was subsequently updated . In this manner a content consumer may retrieve a previously created and stored geofeed as it existed when originally created. Also in these implementations the geofeed update module may configure the computer to automatically and or based on user input update the geofeed with newly available content. For example new content from a content provider may become available after the geofeed was created. The geofeed update module may configure the computer to update the geofeed by including the newly available content with the content that was aggregated when the geofeed was created.

Various other objects features and advantages of the invention will be apparent through the detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the drawings attached hereto. It is also to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and not restrictive of the scope of the invention.

Generally speaking the system may obtain from content providers content that may be relevant to a geo location. The system may relate content to the geo location using various techniques such as for example using geotags embedded within or associated with the content meta data that describes the content image recognition of the content to automatically determine a location and or other techniques. As used herein the term user and content consumer can each refer to a single person more than one person and or an entity such as a company or organization.

Using the system a content consumer may specify a geo location and obtain content from various social media platforms e.g. FACEBOOK TWITTER INSTAGRAM FLICKR etc. and or other information providers. The user may also store a geofeed for later retrieval. Geofeeds may be used in various ways. For example news providers may obtain real time sources of content that may be localized to a geo location allowing for more complete coverage of a developing story and also targeting where reporters should be sent to further investigate. Marketers may obtain consumer sentiment and brand insights associated with their planned or existing products services and or physical locations as well as perform needs analysis for due diligence on potential future physical locations. First responders and disaster response teams may use geofeeds to obtain initial reports in order to direct responders to appropriate locations. Government agencies or others can perform situational awareness on a developing protest riot or other conflict.

The foregoing are merely examples of implementations and uses of the system. Other uses and implementations will now be described with respect to various system components.

Computer may comprise one or more computing devices configured with various modules that enable the features and functions of the invention as described in greater detail below. In some implementations the computer may be programmed with computer program modules. The computer program modules may include a geofeed creation module a geofeed retrieval module a geofeed update module a geofeed user interface module and or other modules.

The geofeed creation module may program computer to receive a request to create the geofeed. The request to create the geofeed may include a specification of one or more geographically definable locations also referred to herein as the geo location and one or more geofeed parameters such as for example providers to include or exclude types of content to include or exclude date ranges content matching patterns keywords and or other parameters that instruct the system as to which content should be included in the a geofeed.

In some embodiments geofeed creation module may stream a geofeed. The stream may include a geofeed that is updated and communicated in real time. For example the stream may include content that may be relevant to a geo location that is continuously or otherwise regularly updated and provided to a content consumer and or others. In these embodiments geofeed creation module may continuously or at regular intervals stream content that is relevant to a geo location and complies with geofeed parameters if any . In this manner a content consumer may receive live streaming updates of a geofeed.

The geofeed creation module may include sub modules that are used to create the geofeed based on the request. The sub modules may format the request receive content from the providers format the received content filter the received content perform a data integrity check on the received content and or perform other processing to create the geofeed. For example the sub modules may include a pre processing module a post processing module a filtering module an integrity checking module and or other modules as discussed below with respect to .

The geofeed retrieval module may program the computer to receive a request to access a previously requested geofeed. The previously requested geofeed may be obtained in various ways.

In some implementations a previously requested geofeed may be retrieved by obtaining a corresponding geofeed definition for the requested geofeed. In these implementations geofeed retrieval module cause geofeed creation module to dynamically aggregate content from the content providers that conforms to the geofeed definition. As such the retrieved geofeed may include relevant content that was newly added since the previously requested geofeed was first created.

In some implementations the previously requested geofeed may be retrieved from memory such as geofeed database instead of being dynamically generated based on a geofeed definition. In these implementations the retrieved geofeed will not include newly added relevant content since the geofeed was originally created unless the geofeed was subsequently updated . In this manner a content consumer may retrieve a previously created and stored geofeed as it existed when originally created. Also in these implementations geofeed update module may configure the computer to automatically and or based on user input update the geofeed with newly available content. For example new content from a content provider may become available after the geofeed was created. Geofeed update module may configure the computer to update the geofeed by including the newly available content with the content that was aggregated when the geofeed was created.

In some implementations computer may receive a request for a geofeed from a content consumer device . The request may include a specification of the geo location which may be input via content consumer device using an interface exposed by computer . The interface may include a map interface and or other interface that receives a boundary of the geo location. The map interface allows the content consumer or other user to designate an outline on the map zoom in or out of the map and or pan the map to specify the geo location. Other interfaces may include a text input that allows the content consumer or other user to input an address a geo coordinate a locality such as a city a zip code a description of a point of interest such as White House and or other information that can specify a geo location. In some implementations the geo location may be calculated based on a current location of a device such as content consumer device .

In some implementations the geo location may include an altitude and or orientation that further define a geo location of interest. In these implementations the content consumer may request a geofeed having aggregated content relevant to the altitude and or orientation. For example the content consumer may request a geofeed having content originating from a particular altitude. The content consumer may also request a geofeed having content that was created with respect to a particular spatial orientation e.g. facing Southeast Azimuth of 125 degrees facing the White House etc. in these implementations the geofeed may include a reference point from which content was created e.g. videos taken while facing the White House images of celestial objects viewed from a location at particular angles etc. .

In some implementations the request may include a geofeed parameter that specifies content to include with and or exclude from the geofeed. The geofeed parameters may specify for example content providers content type e.g. video audio etc. date e.g. when content was created modified published etc. demographic information known about content creators keywords hashtags included in or associated with the content and or other parameter that may be used to further filter in addition to the geo location specification content that should be included and or excluded in a geofeed. The system can also automatically display or bubble up social media posts by certain content creators that have been designated by the user via a ranking or tagging system.

The date parameter may specify dates when content was created modified published etc. before a particular date after a particular date and or within a range of dates. A date parameter that specifies content before a particular date may cause a geofeed having historical content from before the particular date. A date parameter that specifies content after a particular date may cause a geofeed having recent content or otherwise content after the particular date. A date parameter that specifies a range of dates e.g. start to end consecutive dates multiple non consecutive dates and or other plurality of times may cause a geofeed having content from an event that spans the particular range of dates. As used herein the term date may include any measure of time such as for example a month a day and or a time. For example a date parameter may include a particular day of the year and or a time.

In some implementations computer may generate a geofeed based on the geo location specification and or geofeed parameters. Computer may request or otherwise crawl content that may be relevant to the geo location from content providers . Typically although not necessarily computer may request and receive the content via various Provider Application Programming Interfaces APIs illustrated in as API A API B . . . API C exposed by content providers . In other instances computer may simply request and or receive content from content providers without using an API such as by crawling a website of the provider or otherwise requesting content without an API. Data input to and output from a content provider hereinafter will be described with respect to an API for convenience although processing may be similarly applied to interfacing with a content provider without using an API.

The various content providers may accept requests using different formats. For example provider A may receive a geo location specification via a point and radius input while another provider B may receive a geo location specification using a zip code. Yet another provider C may receive a geo location specification using a geographic boundary. As such computer may normalize the geo location specification and or the geofeed parameters so that they conform to APIs .

In some implementations APIs may not take as input one or more geofeed parameters or a normalized equivalent . In these implementations computer may use the geofeed parameters to filter the provided content returned from APIs . For example a particular API may not receive as input a date parameter but may provide a date related to the provided content. The date or other information may be provided using meta data or other information that accompanies or describes the provided content such as Exchangeable Image File format EXIF data. In the foregoing example computer may receive all content from the particular provider and later filter the received content using the provided date and the date parameter.

The content provided by different content providers may be received in various formats which may be specific to the content provider. In some implementations computer may reformat the received content into a uniform format for processing into or excluding from a geofeed.

In some implementations computer may process the content from content providers and aggregate relevant content into a geofeed. Processing may include determining a relevance of the content filtering the content to remove undesired content performing a data integrity check ranking the content sorting the content and or performing other processing that assesses the received content. Computer may aggregate the content into a geofeed. The geofeed may be communicated via a user interface which may include the same interface used to receive the geo location.

In some implementations computer may include or otherwise access one or more databases which may include a consumer profile database and a provider profile database . Consumer profile database may be configured to store information related to a content consumer such as for example prior geo location specifications prior geofeed parameters and or other information related to a content consumer. In some implementations a geofeed may be stored by the content consumer for later retrieval. Computer may also store a name associated with the geofeed. The content consumer may label or otherwise provide a name for the stored geofeed.

Provider profile database may be configured to store information related to a content provider such as for example information used to normalize reformat inputs to and outputs from content provider. The provider profiles may identify the set of content providers from which the computer aggregates content. For example each provider may have a corresponding provider profile that is stored in provider profile database and identifiers the provider. In this manner new providers may be added to the predefined set of content providers by adding a corresponding provider profile.

A provider profile may include for example an identification of the provider an indication of the types of content provided by the provider translation data that describes how to retrieve the content from the provider e.g. an API call and or other information that describes the provider. For example an administrator of computer may add an additional content provider by storing rules and or other intelligence that allows computer to translate requests for content into a format that is compatible with the new content provider. Similarly rules and other intelligence may be added that allows computer to translate output from the new provider into a format that is compatible with computer . In some implementations computer may register a new provider. During the registration process the new provider may input the rules intelligence and or other information related to the new provider. In this manner system is scalable and may easily be configured to add additional providers.

Geofeed database may store content aggregated from content providers e.g. may cache the content links to content aggregated from the content providers geofeed definitions and or other information related to geofeeds as described herein.

In some implementations computer may expose a Geofeed API that allows for integration with other systems such as without limitation GIS applications CRM systems CMSs. In this manner one or more computers may interface with computer via Geofeed API to request and receive a geofeed.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that computer and content consumer device may each comprise one or more processors one or more interfaces to various peripheral devices or components memory one or more storage devices and or other components coupled via a bus. The memory may comprise random access memory RAM read only memory ROM or other memory. The memory may store computer executable instructions to be executed by the processor as well as data that may be manipulated by the processor. The storage devices may comprise floppy disks hard disks optical disks tapes or other storage devices for storing computer executable instructions and or data.

One or more applications including various modules may be loaded into memory and run on an operating system of computer and or consumer device . In one implementation computer and consumer device may each comprise a server device a desktop computer a laptop a cell phone a smart phone a Personal Digital Assistant a pocket PC or other device.

Network may include any one or more of for instance the Internet an intranet a PAN Personal Area Network a LAN Local Area Network a WAN Wide Area Network a SAN Storage Area Network a MAN Metropolitan Area Network a wireless network a cellular communications network a Public Switched Telephone Network and or other network.

The foregoing description of the various components comprising system is exemplary only and should not be viewed as limiting. The invention described herein may work with various system configurations. For example the system configuration and various disclosure described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 284 455 filed Oct. 28 2011 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AGGREGATING AND DISTRIBUTING GEOTAGGED CONTENT which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety may be used. Accordingly more or less of the aforementioned system components may be used and or combined in various implementations.

Having provided a non limiting overview of exemplary system architecture the various features and functions enabled by computer will now be explained.

Geofeed creation module may communicate a user interface via user interface module . The user interface may include a web page an application executing on a mobile device or other interface that can receive inputs and or communicate outputs. Although not illustrated in geofeed creation module may expose an interface that allows application programs to communicate requests and or receive outputs from geofeed creation module . Content consumer device may display a user interface provided by user interface module which a content consumer may use to request a geofeed. The request may include a specification of one or more geo locations and geofeed parameters such as for example providers to include or exclude types of content to include or exclude and or other parameters by which to generate a geofeed. Geofeed creation module may receive the request and begin to process the request.

In some implementations geofeed creation module may retrieve and or store a consumer profile related to the content consumer in one or more consumer profiles. The consumer profile may include for example a prior geofeed request a prior geofeed identification of the content consumer such as a name of an individual or organization and or other information known about the content consumer. Similarly geofeed creation module may retrieve and or store a provider profile related to a content provider. The provider profile may include for example various rules that describe accessing content of the provider and or other information known about the provider such as an identity of the provider and a type of content provided by the provider.

In some implementations geofeed creation module may use pre processing module to begin processing the request. Pre processing module may process the geo location specification in order to determine the geographically definable location or locations for which the geofeed is requested. Pre processing module may also parse the geofeed parameters if any to determine which providers types of content and or other parameters should be used to generate the requested geofeed. Based on the geofeed parameters pre processing module may determine which ones of the content providers from which geofeed creation module receives content should be used. If no geofeed parameters limit providers preprocessing module may determine that content from all of the content providers to which geofeed creation module has access should be obtained.

In some implementations preprocessing module may store the geo location specification geofeed parameter and or other information related to the request as a geofeed definition in a memory such as geofeed database . In these implementations pre processing module may associate the geofeed to be generated with one or more geofeed identifiers which may be named using alphanumeric or other characters by the content consumer and or include numeric identifiers stored by the system.

The geofeed definition may include information that allows geofeed creation module and or other components of the system to generate a geofeed that was previously requested using the geo location specification geofeed parameters and or other information related to the geofeed. In this manner a content consumer or others may store a previously specified geofeed request and later retrieve a geofeed based on the previously specified geofeed request.

For example and without limitation a content consumer may specify particular coordinates for a city as a geo location and specify a geofeed parameter that limits aggregated content to include only photos. The content consumer may name the geofeed favorite city and pre processing module may generate a geofeed definition identified by the name favorite city and or other identifier. The content consumer may later obtain a geofeed that includes aggregated photos for the particular city by specifying that the favorite city geofeed is requested. In this manner the content consumer need not re enter the geo location for the particular city nor the photo geofeed parameter in order to view the geofeed defined by a favorite city geofeed definition.

In some implementations the request itself may be stored as a geofeed definition. In other implementations the geo location specification geofeed parameters and or other information from the request may be normalized for input to the various providers prior to being stored as a geofeed definition.

Pre processing module may determine rules and or other intelligence for accessing content from providers . For example pre processing module may obtain this information from the various provider profiles. As would be appreciated the rules and or other intelligence of the provider profiles may be hard coded into pre processing module implemented as compiled objects configuration settings and or using other techniques that can implement rules.

As illustrated in providers A C may each expose a respective API A C for accessing e.g. request and or receiving content. Pre processing module may use a provider profile associated with each provider A C in order to normalize the request so that the request is compatible with each API. For example and without limitation the request may include a geo location specification that is an address while API A may take as input a point and radius location for defining a geo location and API B may take as input a zip code for defining the geo location.

Pre processing module may normalize the geo location specification from the request to be compatible with API A and API B. For example pre processing module may normalize the address into a point that defines a geographic center of the address and determine a radius about the center to approximate the geographic region of the address in order to request content from provider A using API A. On the other hand pre processing module may normalize the address into a zip code of which the address is a part in order to request content from provider B using API B.

In some implementations a content provider may not expose an API. In these implementations pre processor may normalize the request to be compatible with provider N. For example pre processor may request content from provider N directly by crawling a website of provider N executing search queries on a search module of provider N and or using other techniques to access content from provider N.

In some instances the content from providers may be over inclusive because of the normalization process e.g. a zip code may return more results than a particular address . The over inclusive content may be filtered by geofeed generator using filtering module as described in more detail below.

In some implementations content from providers may be received by geofeed creation module using post processing module . The content may be received via API as would be appreciated. The content from the different providers may be provided in different formats and may include various meta data and or other descriptive information that describes the content. As such post processing module may normalize the content and or other descriptive information into a format that is compatible with geofeed creation module . In some implementations the content may include embedded data such as for example EXIF data. Post processing module may extract the embedded data and normalize the extracted data as appropriate. In some implementations post processing module may rank the received content. For example post processing module may assign a rank or score to the received content based on various ranking factors such as for example relevance to a specified geo location content creator who created the content content provider who provided the content and or other factors that can be used to rank content.

In some implementations geofeed creation module may use filtering module to filter the received content from providers by removing unwanted ones of the received content. The filtered out content may be omitted from the geofeed. In some implementations the filtered out content may be retained so that the content consumer may be notified of the filtered out content.

In some implementations filtering module may filter content based on a sensitivity of the received content. For example filtering module may omit granular content that may be used to track a location of an individual content creator.

In some implementations filtering module may filter content based on excess content that may result from normalizing inputs. For example a geo location specification that includes an address may be normalized to a zip code input of a particular provider. In this example the returned content based on the normalized zip code input may be greater than content requested based on the address. As such filtering module may filter out the extraneous content such as content that is within the zip code but outside the address. Filtering module may determine a location associated with each content and determine whether the location is within the original request in the foregoing example within a location specified by the address . In this manner even if a particular provider provides only an input mechanism that broadly defines a geo location such as a zip code filtering module may be used to fine tune the content to a narrower geo location such as but not limited to an address a neighborhood boundary within the zip code or a building boundary within the zip code or a user defined location.

In some implementations filtering module may filter content based on geofeed parameters not supported by a particular provider. As described above with respect to pre processing module geofeed parameters supported by a particular provider will be included in the processed request to an API and or the particular provider. In this case the particular provider may perform its own filtering to filter out content based on the supported geofeed parameter. However if the particular provider does not support the particular geofeed parameter filtering module may be used filter out the received content from the provider using the unsupported geofeed parameter. In this manner even if a particular provider does not support a geofeed parameter geofeed creation module may filter out content based on unsupported geofeed parameter making the geofeed creation module scalable to include various providers and also support different types of geofeed parameters. The content may be filtered out by comparing information such as meta data or other information related to the received content with a geofeed parameter. In some implementations filtering module may filter out content based on rules or other logic from a content consumer. For example the content consumer may enter a rule that content from a particular content creator should be excluded. Filtering module may obtain the rules or other logic and exclude or otherwise omit received content from the particular content creator based on the rules or other logic.

In some implementations geofeed creation module may use integrity checking module to determine whether content includes potentially inaccurate information. Geofeed creation module may omit or flag content that is associated with inaccurate information.

In some implementations integrity checking module may determine whether a geo location related to provided content is accurately reported by providers . For example when content from a content creator e.g. a social media user is not automatically geo tagged e.g. by a GPS enabled camera a particular provider may use an address associated with the content creator to define a location of where the content was created. When content is not automatically geo tagged and is created at a location other than the address associated with the content creator the foregoing behavior of the particular provider may incorrectly identify where the content was created. Integrity checking module may omit or flag such data by determining whether the content has been automatically geo tagged and if the content has not been automatically geo tagged omit the content from the geofeed. In this manner a higher accuracy of locations where content is created may be achieved.

In some implementations integrity checking module may determine whether a time associated with provided content is accurately reported by providers . For example a content creator may upload to provider multiple photos taken several days ago. Provider may erroneously assign a date and time of creation for the photos with the date and time when the photos were uploaded. Integrity checking module may recognize that the multiple photos could not have been created on the same date and time and may flag or omit the content due to this potential errant information.

Not all providers exhibit the foregoing and or other examples of reporting potentially incorrect information. As such whether a provider is known to perform these and or other behaviors that may result in incorrect information may be stored in a provider profile.

In some implementations geofeed creation module may use sorting module to sort the content. Sorting module may sort the content based on a geofeed parameter e.g. as requested by the content consumer rules or other intelligence for sorting the content and or other source of sorting instruction. The content may be sorted in various ways such as in reverse chronological order or other chronological sort. The chronology may be based on a publication date a creation date and or other date related to the content.

Geofeed creation module may aggregate the received content which may or may not be filtered checked for potential data integrity problems and or sorted and generate a geofeed based on the aggregated content. The geofeed may be communicated to the content consumer via the user interface communicated via user interface module and or other communication channel. Examples of various user interfaces are described with respect to .

In some implementations the geofeed e.g. the aggregated content of the geofeed may be stored in a memory such as geofeed database . In these implementations unlike storing a geofeed definition and retrieving a geofeed live from content providers based on the geofeed definition the stored geofeed may include content that was retrieved at the time that the geofeed was originally created. In this manner historic or past geofeed content may be obtained that omits any content that may have been added since the geofeed was originally created.

In some implementations a geofeed may include content that overlaps with one or more other geofeeds. For example the geofeed may include a geo location that is at least partially co extensive with one or more other geo locations. In some implementations one geofeed may completely overlap with another geofeed. In some implementations a request for a geofeed may be compared with other requests for geofeeds to determine whether the geofeeds overlap. If two or more geofeeds overlap the content already retrieved for a prior geofeed may be used for the overlapping geofeed. In these implementations for example a request may not be redundantly made to a content provider for content that has already been retrieved.

In an operation process may include receiving a request for a geofeed. The request may include a geo location specification. In an operation process may include determining whether the request includes a geofeed parameter. If the request includes a geofeed parameter process may include generating a query based on the geo location specification and the geofeed parameter in an operation . On the other hand if the request does not include a geofeed parameter process may include generating a query based on the geo location specification alone in an operation .

In an operation process may include normalizing the query for the next provider from which content is received. In an operation process may include communicating the normalized query to the next provider. In an operation process may include receiving the requested content from the provider. In an operation process may include formatting the received content from the provider into a normalized format in an operation process may include filtering the received content. In an operation process may include performing a data integrity check on the content. In an operation process may include normalizing the content received from the content provider. In some implementations the content may be normalized into a common format such that content from different providers outputting content in different formats may be presented in the geofeed using the common format. In some implementations the original e.g. not normalized content may be provided as well.

In an operation the content may be added to the requested geofeed. In an operation process may include determining whether more providers are to be queried for content. If more providers remain process may return to operation where the request is normalized for the next provider. If no more providers remain in an operation process may include generating and communicating the geofeed. The geofeed may be communicated via a user interface which may include presentation interfaces for displaying the geofeed.

In an operation process may determine whether excess content has been provided. In some implementations excess content may be provided by content providers as a result of normalizing input parameters. For example the excess content may include content related to a geo location outside the originally requested geo location but within the normalized queried geo location.

In operation process may include determining a geo location related to the content provided by the content providers. The geo location may be determined based on data embedded or included with the content. Process may include comparing the determined geo location with the geo location specification from the original request for the geofeed. If the determined geo location is within the geo location specification process may include determining that the content is not excess content that should be filtered. On the other hand if the determined geo location is outside the geo location specification process may include determining that the content is excess content that should be filtered and may include flagging the excess content for omission in an operation .

In an operation process may include determining that geofeed parameters from the original request were not supported by a particular provider. Process may include determining whether to filter the content based on the unsupported geofeed parameters. For example process may include comparing information related to the content from the particular provider with the geofeed parameters. In particular if the particular provider does not include an input to filter by content type and the original request included a geofeed parameter that specified to return only photos process may include determining that the content from the particular provider is a photo and therefore complies with the geofeed parameter. In operation if the content does not comply with the geofeed parameter process may include flagging the content for omission in an operation .

In an operation process may include determining whether the content was flagged for omission. If the content was not flagged for omission process may include adding the content for potential inclusion into the requested geofeed in an operation . If the content was flagged for omission process may include causing the content to be omitted from e.g. not added to the requested geofeed in an operation .

In an operation process may include determining whether a time associated with provided content is accurately reported by providers . For example a content creator may upload to provider multiple photos taken several days ago. Provider may erroneously assign a date and time of creation or other date and time for the photos with the date and time when the photos were uploaded. Process may recognize that the multiple photos could not have been created on the same date and time and may flag them for omission in an operation . Dates times other than the date and time of creation may be integrity checked as well. These other dates times may include for example a publication date a date taken a last edited date and or other dates or times related to content.

In an operation process may include determining whether the content was flagged for omission. If the content was not flagged for omission process may include adding the content for potential inclusion into the requested geofeed in an operation . If the content was flagged for omission process may include causing the content to be omitted from e.g. not added to the requested geofeed in an operation .

Interface A and other interfaces described herein may be implemented as a web page communicated from computer to a client an application such as a mobile application executing on the client that receives generates the interface based on information communicated from computer and or other interface. Whichever type of interface is used computer may communicate the data and or formatting instructions related to the interface to the client causing the client to generate the various interfaces of and other drawing figures. Furthermore computer may receive data from the client via the various interfaces as would be appreciated.

To switch between the various interfaces illustrated in each interface may include a navigation element having links or other controls that switch between the MAP display illustrated by the COLLAGE display illustrated by and the LIST display illustrated by .

Referring to interface A may provide different ways in which to specify a geo location to request a geofeed. For example interface A may include an input element that receives a geo location specification. Via input element content consumer may input an address a place name and or other geo location specification described herein.

Interface A may include a map navigation element that allows interaction with a map displayed by interface A. Map navigation element may include a map control a search by circle control a search by polygon control a delete control and a search by visible area control . Map control may include various map functions such as for example zooming panning and overlaying e.g. overlaying satellite images onto the map . Search by circle control when selected allows a user to draw a circle on map to specify a geo location of interest. Search by Polygon control when selected allows the user to draw a polygon or other non circular shape to specify a geo location of interest.

In some implementations multiple circular and or non circular shapes may be drawn to specify locations of interest on map . Delete control when selected may delete the circles polygons and or other shapes drawn on the map. Search by visible area control when selected allows the user to specify a geo location of interest based on what is currently displayed by map .

As illustrated a circle having a radius and center not illustrated is displayed that indicates a boundary of a geofeed. User interface A may transform the circle or other non circle shape into coordinates of map onto which circle is overlayed. For example user interface may determine latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to the center of circle and a distance corresponding to a radius of circle . User interface A may communicate the coordinates and distance to computer to request a geofeed bounded by a geo location defined by circle . In some implementations computer may transform circle into coordinates. In these implementations user interface may communicate information related to map and circle so that computer may transform circle into coordinates.

In implementations where the visible area of the map is used to specify the geo location the boundary of the geofeed includes the visible area of the map . Whichever geo location specification is used computer may generate or obtain a geofeed based on the geo location specification. Computer may communicate the geofeed to user interface for display. The geofeed includes content that is relevant to the geo location specification. The content may include location information for presentation on map . For example user interface A may overlay coordinates of the content from the geofeed onto map using an appropriate coordinate transform.

The geofeed as illustrated includes content indicators and which provide graphical indicia of aggregated content of the geofeed. The content may be provided from different or the same content provider. Content and may each include an icon a logo and or other identifying indicia that indicates the source of the content and or a type of content. As illustrated when content indicator is selected e.g. moused over clicked touched or otherwise interacted with interface A may cause content detail element A to appear. Content detail element A may include information related to the content such as for example the content itself such as video photo audio text etc. a content creator e.g. social media user who posted the content an identification of the content provider that provided the content a time associated with the content e.g. create time publication time etc. a location where the content was created e.g. address geo coordinates etc. and or other information known or determined about the content. In some implementations the information from content detail element A may be included within the location indicators .

Interface B may include a COLLAGE view that includes content elements and . The content elements may each include content that was aggregated into the geofeed. Content elements and may include similar information displayed by content indicators and and or content detail element A described with respect to interface A. For example one or more content elements and may include for example the content itself such as video photo audio text etc. a content creator e.g. social media user who posted the content an identification of the content provider that provided the content a time associated with the content e.g. create time publication time etc. a location where the content was created e.g. address geo coordinates etc. and or other information known or determined about the content.

Interface C may include a LIST view that includes content elements and listed in tabular form. The content elements may each include content that was aggregated into the geofeed. Content elements and may include information displayed by content indicators and and or content detail element A described with respect to interface A. In some implementations the LIST view may communicate the geofeed to the requestor in a compact UI format or for electronic data transfer such as a Javascript Object Notation list JSON RSS and GeoRSS ATOM or comma separated values.
