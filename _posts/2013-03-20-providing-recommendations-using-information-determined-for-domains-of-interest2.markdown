title: Providing recommendations using information determined for domains of interest
abstract: Techniques are described for determining and using information related to domains of interest, such as by automatically analyzing documents and other information related to a domain in order to automatically determine relationships between particular terms within the domain. Such automatically determined information may then be used to assist users in obtaining information from the domain that is of interest (e.g., documents with contents that are relevant to user-specified terms and/or to other terms that are determined to be sufficiently related to the user-specified terms). For example, recommendations may be automatically generated for a user by using information about specified preferences or other interests of the user with respect to one or more terms and identifying other particular terms that are sufficiently probable to be of interest to that user, such as based on a generated probabilistic representation of relationships between particular terms for the domain.

This application claims the benefit of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61 122 282 filed Dec. 12 2008 and entitled Determining Relevant Information For Domains Of Interest which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

With the current abundance of available information locating documents and other information that match interests of a user can be difficult. One option for attempting to locate documents involves performing searches using various Web based search engines. A typical Web search involves a user providing a search query that includes one or more search terms to a search engine with the search query in some situations also including one or more logical search operators e.g. AND OR NOT an indication that a particular search term is required etc. that are each related to one or more of the search terms. After receiving such a search query the search engine typically identifies at least some available documents whose contents match the search query e.g. the contents include each of the required search terms generates one or more Web pages that include links to one or more of the identified documents and provides one or more of the generated Web pages to the user as search results for the search query. In addition different users entering the same search string typically receive the same search results.

Various techniques are used by search engines to identify documents whose contents match particular search terms. For example some search engines do automated pre processing prior to receiving search requests in order to create an index that maps terms to Web pages whose contents include those terms. Such pre processing typically uses an automated program called a Web spider that crawls the Web to identify documents to index such as by traversing links from known Web pages to new Web pages. In addition some search engines use manual categorization of documents to track which Web pages are related to specified categories and or terms such as via a hierarchical directory of categories and sub categories. Thus search results from a search engine may be based in some cases on information from an automatically pre generated index and or from a manually pre generated category directory.

However existing search engines and other techniques for identifying information of interest to users suffer from various problems.

Techniques are described for determining and using relevant information related to topics and subject areas of interest also referred to as domains of interest herein. In at least some embodiments the techniques include automatically analyzing documents and other content items related to one or more related domains of interest in order to automatically determine information about relevant terms within the domain such as to determine relationships between particular terms as well as to determine which content items have contents that are relevant to particular terms. Such automatically determined relevance information for the domain s may then be used in various ways including to assist users in obtaining information of possible positive interest to those users e.g. content items with contents that are relevant to user specific terms and or to other terms that are determined to be sufficiently related to the user specific terms and or to assist users in avoiding information of possible negative interest to those users. For example in at least some embodiments the automatically determined relevance information for the domain s may be used to generate a Bayesian network or other probabilistic representation of relationships between particular terms such that information about specified preferences of a user with respect to one or more terms and or other information specific to the user may be used to automatically determine the probabilities that other particular terms may also be of interest to that user such as for use in providing user specific recommendations or other suggestions to that user. As discussed in greater detail below terms preferences and content items may have various forms in various embodiments. Furthermore in at least some situations the techniques may be used in conjunction with an embodiment of a computer implemented Domain Specific Relevance Determination DSRD service that automatically determines relevance information related to domains of interest and or uses such determined relevance information to provide user specific recommendations or other suggestions of information that is likely to be of interest to particular users as described in greater detail below.

In at least some embodiments the described techniques include automatically analyzing documents and or other content items related to a domain of interest in order to automatically determine information about relevant terms within the domain such as to determine relevant relationships between particular terms e.g. to determine multi term themes within the domain or more generally to determine concepts within the domain that may each include or otherwise be associated with one or more terms . In at least some embodiments the relationships between terms may be automatically determined based at least in part on the use of various terms in content items related to a domain of interest and the analysis of the various content items may include generating an index that relates the contents of particular content items to particular terms. While various of the following discussion refers to content items as being documents it will be appreciated that the described techniques may be used with a wide variety of types of content items including for example textual documents e.g. Web pages word processing documents slide shows and other presentations emails and other electronic messages etc. images video files audio files software code firmware and other logic genetic codes that each accompany one or more sequences of genetic information other biological data etc. Furthermore the content items may be of one or more file types or other data structures e.g. streaming data including document fragments or other pieces or portions of a larger document or other content item and the contents of such content items may include text and or a variety of other types of data e.g. binary encodings of audio information binary encodings of video information binary encodings of image information measurements of physical properties mathematical equations and mathematical data structures other types of alphanumeric data structures and or symbolic data structures encrypted data etc. . Thus the terms that are included in the contents of content items or otherwise associated with content items may have various forms in various embodiments including individual textual words combinations of multiple textual words e.g. multi term phrases tuples of multiple words in a defined relationship such as a semantic triple that includes a subject object and a preference relationship between the subject and object etc. or in some embodiments any other type of recognizable data feature property or other attribute that is part of the contents of those content items or that is otherwise associated with those content items as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Furthermore in at least some of the following discussion references are generally made to relationships between terms which are intended to cover groups of one or more terms unless otherwise indicated such that a particular relationship may be between a first group of one or more first terms e.g. related to a first concept with one or more associated terms or otherwise to a first multi term theme or a first aggregate term made up of a specified string or other combination of multiple other terms and a second group of one or more second terms e.g. related to a second concept with one or more associated terms or otherwise to a second theme or a second aggregate term . In addition as described in greater detail below in some embodiments the described techniques include identifying one or more terms that reflect known preferences of a user and automatically attempting to identify additional terms that reflect additional preferences of the user that have not been explicitly identified such as based at least in part on the relationships between the known preference terms and the possible additional term preferences. Such known preference terms and or possible additional term preferences may have various forms in various embodiments e.g. as noted above a term may reflect any type of recognizable data feature property or other attribute that is part of the contents of interest or that is otherwise associated with that content and may reflect a positive interest e.g. a preference for a particular term and or a negative interest e.g. a preference against a particular term. Furthermore known preferences of a user may include not only terms that are explicitly identified by the user as being of positive or negative interest but in some embodiments may include terms for which some positive or negative interest may be inferred for a particular user e.g. based on actions of the user such as searching for or otherwise selecting particular terms or more generally may include any information known about or otherwise associated with a particular user e.g. demographic information for the user such as age sex gender etc. accomplishments or activities of the user etc. .

In at least some embodiments a group of multiple documents that are specific to a domain are selected and automatically analyzed by an embodiment of the DSRD service. The group of documents may be for example a corpus that includes all available documents for a particular domain or that includes sufficient documents to be representative of the domain. In addition the documents to be analyzed may be obtained from one or more sources such as from a Web site that includes comprehensive information specific to one or more domains e.g. a hypothetical all baseball now.com Web site that includes comprehensive information about baseball the espn.com Web site that includes varied information about a variety of sports the imdb.com Web site that includes varied information about a variety of movies and television shows the Wikipedia encyclopedia Web site at wikipedia.org and Wikipedia Commons media collection Web site at commons.wikipedia.org and Wikinews news source Web site at wikinews.org that include varied information about a large number of domains etc. . In some embodiments each of the documents has contents that are at least partially textual information that are analyzed.

The automated analysis of documents for a domain may in at least some embodiments include analyzing the contents of the documents in order to determine relationships between terms that are relevant to the domain including in some embodiments to identify themes or other concepts that are relevant to the domain such as by using data mining techniques or other techniques. For example if the documents being analyzed are related to the baseball domain terms may be specific to particular players to particular teams to particular leagues e.g. Major League Baseball Division I college baseball etc. to particular events or situations e.g. a particular year s All Star game or World Series the steroid use controversy etc. to particular seasons to particular records e.g. the cumulative home run record etc. Furthermore relationships between terms may reflect at least some such information such as to identify relationships corresponding to multiple players on a given team to multiple teams that have a historical rivalry to particular players or teams associated with particular events or records etc.

In at least some embodiments the automated analysis of documents for a domain to identify relevant terms includes indexing the documents to determine what terms are present in each of the documents and then analyzing the importance of some or all such terms to the documents. For example in at least some embodiments an initial determination of a degree of relevance of each term in a document to the document is made based on the distinctiveness of the term to the contents of the document such as by using a term frequency inverse document frequency TF IDF analysis. In addition combinations of one or more related terms used throughout the group of documents may be selected to represent themes or other concepts of the domain such as for the most relevant terms and or inter term relationships and the determined degree of relevance of the one or more related terms for a theme or a concept to one or more documents may be used to determine a degree of relevance of the one or more documents to the theme or concept as discussed in greater detail below. While some examples and embodiments below discuss the use of multi term themes in various manners it will be appreciated that such discussion equally applies to the use of determined concepts having one or more associated terms as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Furthermore as discussed in greater detail elsewhere the terms or other information that are associated with a document or other content item and that are analyzed may in some embodiments include other types of information including information that is not included in the contents of the content item such as metadata associated with the content item and or information associated with one or more users to whom the content item corresponds.

In addition in some embodiments the automated analysis of documents for a domain to identify relevant terms may include one or more other techniques whether instead of or in addition to using a TF IDF analysis or similar technique to determine the degree of relevance of each term in a document to the document contents. For example the automated analysis of the contents of one or more documents may in some embodiments include performing a statistical analysis to identify terms that are distinctive in the contents of the one or more documents relative to other contents e.g. other documents in the domain a baseline set of contents used to represent the domain etc. such as to identify statistical outliers e.g. terms that may be considered to have a high signal to noise ratio relative to other terms or to otherwise identify terms that are relevant relative to other terms. In addition in situations in which the documents for a domain are changing e.g. based on new documents becoming available such as to reflect current news or other recently available information the automated analysis of the changing documents may be used in some embodiments to identify newly relevant terms e.g. new relevant terms that are introduced in the changing documents previously existing terms whose relevance increases in the changing documents etc. . Such newly relevant terms may in some situations reflect hot topics of interest and the changing documents used to identify such newly relevant terms may have various forms in various embodiments e.g. news feeds social networking site pages blog postings opt in information sharing systems such as Twitter etc. . Furthermore as discussed in greater detail below when particular terms are identified as being relevant e.g. for newly relevant terms the described techniques may identify particular users for whom such particular terms are relevant and provide documents or other content that are identified as being related to those particular terms to those particular users e.g. by pushing or otherwise providing recommendations to those particular users of that identified content by including that identified content as part of information provided to those particular users in response to requests from those particular users etc. . The identification of particular users for whom particular terms are relevant may be performed in various manners in various embodiments such as by identifying particular users whose known preferences include those particular terms by analyzing information about the known user preferences of one or more users e.g. all users in order to determine the likelihood that the particular terms are additional terms reflecting unknown user preferences of those users etc.

As noted above the generation of document term analysis information may be performed in various manners in various embodiments and in some embodiments uses a TF IDF analysis. Such a TF IDF analysis uses a vector space representation of the documents to be analyzed in which each document is treated as being similar to a bag of words without considering the role of the terms in the document e.g. without considering grammar sentence structure paragraph structure punctuation etc. . In such situations the document representation may largely or solely reflect the Term Frequency TF of the terms in the documents which enables an efficient mapping of documents into a mathematically straightforward high dimensional vector space. In addition the distinctiveness of a particular term relative to the various documents for a domain may be considered and used when determining the relevance of terms to documents such as by considering how ubiquitous a particular term is in the documents of a corpus or other group of documents. In particular the Term Frequency of a term i in a document d and the Inverse Document Frequency IDF of the term i across the documents of a domain may be expressed as follows in at least some embodiments 

The automated analysis of the documents for a domain may in at least some embodiments include analyzing the contents of selected documents in order to determine which documents have contents that are relevant to identified terms and or determined themes for the domain. For example in at least some embodiments an initial determination of the relevance of the selected documents may be performed so as to determine a degree of relevance of each document to each of some or all terms or themes such as based on the relevance of particular terms within a theme to the content of a particular document as discussed in greater detail below. In addition in some embodiments the documents that are selected to be analyzed as part of the document relevance determination are the same documents that were previously analyzed to determine inter term relationships while in other embodiments some or all of the selected document relevance determination documents are distinct from the inter term relevance determination documents e.g. if the document relevance determination documents include new documents that were not available during a prior inter term relevance determination if the inter term relevance determination documents are a specialized subset of documents that are selected for training purposes such as due to being representative of a domain etc. . Furthermore in at least some embodiments and situations groups of multiple related documents may be analyzed together with respect to some or all terms and or themes such as by treating the multiple related documents as a single document for the purpose of the analysis while in other situations a particular document may be divided into multiple parts that are each treated as a distinct document with respect to some or all terms and or themes for the purpose of the analysis. Additional details are included below related to analyzing documents of a domain in order to determine documents that are relevant to identified terms and or determined themes.

After documents for a domain are automatically analyzed to determine their relevance to particular terms such relevance information may be used to further identify relationships between particular terms in at least some embodiments. For example in at least some embodiments the relationship between two terms may be determined based at least in part on the individual relevance of those terms to various of the documents e.g. such that two terms that are both highly relevant to one or more common documents may be determined to be likely to be highly relevant to each other and such that two terms that are not both highly relevant to any of the same documents may be determined to be likely to be of little relevance to each other . Thus in embodiments in which the relevance of particular documents to particular terms is identified based at least in part on TF IDF scores the determination of relationships between terms may similarly be based at least in part of the TF IDF scores. Particular manners of generating scores or other representations of the relevance of the relationships of terms are discussed in greater detail below including in manners other than based on TF IDF scores.

After relevance information is automatically determined by the DSRD service regarding relationships between terms within or across one or more domains such automatically determined relevance information may then be used in various ways in various embodiments. For example in at least some embodiments the relevance information regarding the inter term relationships for one or more domains is used to automatically generate a Bayesian network or other probabilistic representation of the relationships between selected terms such as for the relationships that are identified as being the strongest or otherwise the most relevant. Such generation of the probabilistic representation information may be performed in various manners as discussed in greater detail below and may include selecting various particular first terms that each have sufficiently high assessed degrees of relevance to other second terms that an influence is represented from those first terms to the corresponding second terms and may include generating probability information that represents a strength of those represented influences. In particular the structure of a Bayesian network reflects the probabilistic dependencies of each node and provides a framework in which to perform inference on the status of each node as discussed in greater detail below. After the probabilistic representation information is generated it may be used to automatically determine the probability or other measure of likelihood that a particular user has a positive or negative preference for or other interest whether positive or negative in a particular target term given a known positive or negative preference for or other interest whether positive or negative of that user in one or more other terms. Thus such known preferences or interest of a particular user in particular terms may be treated as evidence of the likelihood of other unexpressed preferences or interests of that user in such target terms e.g. other preferences or interests of which that user is aware but which are unknown to the DSRD service other preferences or interests of which that user is not explicitly aware etc. from which particular unexpressed preferences or interests for particular target terms may be inferred.

In some embodiments the determination of the likely interest of a particular user in one or more target terms based on a known or suspected interest of that particular user in one or more other terms used as evidence may be further based at least in part on information about other users that have known or suspected levels of interest in both the evidence terms and target terms such as in a manner analogous to collaborative filtering techniques e.g. based on user feedback and automated learning techniques as discussed in greater detail below . In other embodiments however such a determination of the likely interest of a particular user in the one or more target terms based on the known or suspected interest of that particular user in the one or more other evidence terms is performed without the use of any information about other users levels of interest in both the evidence terms and target terms or more generally in some cases without the use of any information about other users levels of interest in any of the target terms in such embodiments the described techniques may be of particular use in addressing the so called cold start recommendation problem in which inferences cannot typically be initially made for collaborative filtering and other recommendation techniques due to lack of data regarding users preferences in an area of interest. The use of such automatically generated relevance information from analysis of domain related documents may further be used in some embodiments and situations to extend the ability to provide meaningful user specific recommendations or other suggestions to a new domain of interest for which little or no user preference information is yet available such as by leveraging available preference information for one or more other domains that have at least some overlap with the new domain as discussed in greater detail below. Furthermore even if initial determinations of the likely interest in target terms based on known interests in other evidence terms is performed without the use of any information about users actual levels of interest in both the evidence terms and target terms subsequent determinations may be updated to incorporate information that is learned about users actual levels of interest in both the evidence terms and target terms as discussed below.

After such relevance information regarding probabilistic relationships between terms within or across one or more domains is determined e.g. as expressed using a probabilistic representation of those inter term relationships the relevance information may be used in various manners including to assist a human user or other entity in obtaining recommendations or other suggestions of documents and or other information that is likely to be of interest to the user based on information about the user s preferences for or interests related to particular terms. For example one or more particular target terms for which a user s preference is unknown may be automatically selected as being of likely interest to the user based on that user s known interests such as target terms for which the determined probability or other likelihood of interest is above a defined threshold or otherwise satisfies one or more specified criteria based on the use of the determined probabilistic inter term relationships and given those known interests. Such automatically selected target terms may then be used in various manners including to provide recommendations or other suggestions or indications of information of interest to that user e.g. indications of documents that are relevant to those selected target terms indications of those selected target terms such as for selection by the user to indicate an interest or disinterest in that target term or to indicate that a particular target term should be combined as part of a common theme with the other known terms to which the selected target terms are particular relevant etc. . In addition the automatically determined relevance information may be used in various other manners in various embodiments such as by receiving one or more terms from a user and presenting related information to the user e.g. themes that include the received terms etc. by presenting a list of automatically determined themes or other inter term relationships to a user for browsing or selection or other feedback etc. Thus automatically determined relevance information based on documents within a domain may be used by the DSRD service or other affiliated service to assist a human user or other entity e.g. an automated program external to the DSRD service in obtaining content related to one or more terms of explicit or inferred interest such as in response to a search query by pushing or otherwise providing relevant information to a user that is not explicitly requested e.g. based on previously specified preferences for receiving information etc. Furthermore information about the inter relatedness of various terms may be displayed to users in various manners in various embodiments.

In addition in at least some embodiments information about how automatically determined inter term relevance information and or document relevance information is used by users or other entities is tracked and used in various ways. For example in at least some embodiments the information about the use of the automatically determined inter term and or document information may be used by the DSRD service as feedback related to the automatically determined inter term and or document relevance information. Such feedback may be used for example to revise the initial determination of the relevance of particular terms and inter term relationships and or to revise the initial determination of the relevance of particular documents to determined terms and such revised determined relevance information may then be used by the DSRD service or other affiliated service in a manner similar to that as the initially determined relevance information. Similarly such feedback may be used for example to revise Bayesian networks decision trees and or other probabilistic representations of inter term relationships and such revised determined inter term relationship probabilistic representations may then be used by the DSRD service or other affiliated service in a manner similar to that as the initially determined probabilistic representation information. In this manner a one time feedback occurrence or instead continuous or other repeated feedback loop may be used to repeatedly improve the automatic relevance determinations performed by the DSRD service. As described in greater detail below in some embodiments the feedback is used to learn or revise automatically determined inter term relationship information and or document relevance information such as by use of a configured neural network or other adaptive model or system and or by updating a configured Bayesian network or decision tree or other probabilistic representation data structure. Furthermore in at least some embodiments and situations the configured neural network or other adaptive system may be automatically extended in various ways to use information about new documents that become available and or new inter term relationships that are determined.

For illustrative purposes some examples and embodiments are described below in which specific types of information are analyzed in specific manners and in which determined information related to a particular domain is used in specific manners. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are simplified for the sake of brevity and it will be appreciated that the inventive techniques may be used in a wide variety of other situations some of which are described in greater detail below. For example while the analysis of particular textual documents is described below information in other forms may be similarly analyzed and used. In addition while particular algorithms and technologies are illustrated as being used to determine relevant inter term relationships and or themes within or across one or more domains to determine particular documents that are relevant to terms and or themes and to learning improved relevance based on actual use and other feedback other algorithms and technologies may be used in other manners.

In this example the DSRD service provides at least some of the determined relevant inter term relationship information and or at least some of the determined relevant document information to various users for their use such as by indicating documents that are relevant to user specified query terms by indicating suggestions of other terms that may be relevant to user specified terms etc. While not illustrated here in other embodiments the DSRD service may instead provide the determined relevant inter term relationship information and or the determined relevant document information to the users and or other entities in one or more other manners such as via one or more intermediate other services e.g. other services that obtain the relevant domain specific information from the DSRD service and use it in various ways . Furthermore in this example the DSRD service may obtain various feedback or other information related to the use by the users or other entities of the determined relevant domain specific information and or whether directly from the users or instead from one or more intermediate other services and may use that feedback to refine the determined relevant domain specific information and or . It will be appreciated that the receiving of the feedback information and or the use of received feedback information to the determined relevant domain specific information may occur in various manners in various embodiments and situations including in an incremental and dynamic manner or instead in a batch manner e.g. from an intermediate other service that gathers such information and periodically provides it to the DSRD service . Additional details related to the various data flow and actions of the DSRD service are described in greater detail elsewhere including with respect to example embodiments discussed in and .

In addition in this example the DSRD service includes several modules that each provides some of the functionality of the DSRD service including a Domain Analysis Manager module a Relevant Document Determination Manager module an Inter Term Relevance Determination Manager module and a Term Relationship Recommendation Generation Manager module . In particular the Domain Analysis Manager module performs various actions to obtain and automatically analyze the contents of the domain related documents such as to make such analyzed information available for use by the modules and . The Relevant Document Determination Manager module uses the analyzed document information to determine documents that are relevant to particular terms or other themes such as to generate the domain document relevance information of not shown in but which may be stored on one or more storage devices also not shown in . Similarly the Inter Term Relevance Determination Manager module uses the analyzed document information to determine inter term relationships that are relevant to the domain such as to generate the domain inter term relevance information of not shown in but which may be stored on one or more storage devices also not shown in although in other embodiments may determine at least some of the inter term relationship information in manners other than based on document related information. The Term Relationship Recommendation Generation Manager module then generates information for use in determining user specific recommendations or other suggestions based on inter term relationships such as to generate the probabilistic representations and or of inter term relationship information of not shown in but which may be stored on one or more storage devices also not shown in . The information generated by the module may be based at least in part on the determined inter term relationship information from the module and the module may further optionally use the generated information to determine user specific recommendations or other suggestions for users in some embodiments. In this illustrated embodiment the modules and or may then provide the generated domain specific relevance information and or determined user specific recommendations or other suggestions to the users or optional other services such as via provided GUIs graphical user interfaces that users may interactively use and or via provided APIs application programming interfaces via which software programs may programmatically interact. In other embodiments other modules may be present such as a module not shown that determines content items that are relevant to particular indicated terms of interest or one or more other modules not shown of the DSRD service that may instead interact with the users and or optional other services via one or more GUIs and or one or more APIs that are provided by the DSRD service such as on behalf of other of the modules .

The DSRD service may be implemented in various manners including with one or more software modules that have software instructions for execution on one or more computing systems not shown in and may store various information on one or more local or remote storage devices not shown . For example in some embodiments the DSRD service may be implemented on a single computing system while in other embodiments the DSRD service may be implemented in a distributed manner e.g. with different modules each executing on different computing systems but interacting directly or via shared data storage locations with one or more of the modules each being distributed across multiple computing systems such as to have multiple alternative implementations of a module on different computing systems that operate on distinct sets of data relative to the other alternative implementations of the same module etc. such as using cloud computing techniques and or in a peer to peer manner. Similarly the users other services and domain documents may use or be associated with computing devices or systems not shown to perform the various described interactions and or to store the various described information. In addition while the DSRD service and other services may be provided by unaffiliated entities in some embodiments in other embodiments the DSRD service and one or more of the other services may instead be provided by a single operator e.g. in conjunction with each other . Furthermore the network illustrated in may have various forms such as for example a publicly accessible network of linked networks e.g. the Internet possibly operated by various distinct parties. In other embodiments the network may be a private network such as for example a corporate or university network that is wholly or partially inaccessible to non privileged users. In still other embodiments the network may include one or more private networks with access to and or from the Internet and some or all of the network may further include broadband or broadcast wired or wireless links e.g. a cellular telephone connection a wireless computer connection that uses Wi Fi Wi MAX Bluetooth broadcast analog or digital television EVDO satellite or other wireless networking or communication protocol etc. in at least some embodiments.

In addition the various users and other entities may interact with the DSRD service in various manners to make requests and to specify various information. For example users may register or subscribe with the DSRD service and or an optional other service such as to supply various term related preferences and other information that may be used in later requests. In such embodiments after a user interacts with the DSRD service to register the user may be issued one or more identifiers e.g. keys tokens user names etc. that are associated with the user and later used when other requests are made such as requests for search results for specified queries. In addition in some embodiments an optional other service may register or otherwise interact with the DSRD service to establish an affiliated relationship such as to allow the other service to obtain access to at least some domain specific relevance information generated by the DSRD service . Furthermore various fees may be associated with the use of a DSRD service such that the DSRD service may respond to at least some requests in exchange for fees paid by the requester such as to provide domain specific relevance information to an optional other service in exchange for fees from the other service or to provide domain specific relevance information to a user in exchange for fees from the user. In other embodiments the DSRD service may obtain fees in other manners such as from the providers of domain specific documents and other content to perform a relevance determination related to that content and or for providing user specific recommendations of such domain specific documents and other content to particular users from other third parties such as advertisers and retailers e.g. for providing advertisements or other indicated content to at least some users etc.

In this example during the runtime processing information is obtained for a particular user such as to indicate preferences of the user for one or more terms related to the one or more domains to which the domain documents correspond. The user may be one of the users that optionally provided feedback as part of generating the information as discussed with respect to or may instead be an unrelated user. In addition the information about the user s known preferences for or other interest in particular terms may be obtained in various manners such as based on terms indicated by the user as part of a search query terms selected by the user to represent topics of interest to the user terms that are part of a document that the user specifies as being of interest terms that are extracted from a profile of the user or other information related to the user etc. The service not shown performing the runtime processing activities may then use the user specific term preference information and the non user specific inter term relationship information to identify one or more additional user specific terms that are inferred to be of interest to the user based on the various inter term relationships optionally with information to indicate the corresponding probability that each of the additional terms will be of interest to the particular user .

After the additional term s are identified they may be used in various manners including to optionally provide user specific recommendations or other suggestions to the user . The user specific recommendations or other suggestions may have various forms in various embodiments. For example in at least some embodiments some or all of the user specific recommendations suggestions may be some or all of the additional inferred terms such as to enable the user to specify that particular ones of the additional inferred terms are actually of interest or not to specify that particular ones of the additional inferred terms should be combined with the known terms of interest as part of a common theme etc. In other embodiments some or all of the user specific recommendations suggestions may be particular domain documents or other content items selected from a group of candidate domain documents based on some or all of the additional inferred terms of interest such as to include those selected domain documents as part of search results provided to the user or to otherwise enable the user to obtain access to the selected domain documents. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the candidate domain documents may be of various types such as to include some or all of the domain documents used to generate the inter term relationship information and to not include any of the domain documents but to include other documents that are related to the same one or more domains to which the domain documents correspond to include documents that are related to one or more additional domains that are distinct from the one or more initial domains to which the domain documents correspond e.g. additional domains that include documents with terms having at least some overlap with terms in the initial domains such as to extend automatically determined inter term relationships for the initial domains to provide initial recommendations or other suggestions for the additional domains despite having limited or no information about actual user interests for the additional domains etc. While not explicitly illustrated in FIG. C additional information may in some embodiments be obtained from the user that reflects the user s positive or negative interest in one or more of the additional inferred term s of interest e.g. based on the user s selections or other indications in response to the optional providing of the user specific recommendations and if so optional feedback may be used to update the user s known term s of interest based on that additional information obtained from the user. In other embodiments the user specific information may be updated at times even without specific confirmation or other indications from the user such as if the probability that an additional term is of interest to the user exceeds a defined threshold or is otherwise sufficiently high. Furthermore while not illustrated in feedback from users and other entities may similarly in some embodiments be used to update the domain inter term relevance information and as discussed in greater detail with respect to .

While illustrates the use of the automatically determined inter term relationship information with respect to a single user it will be appreciated that the generating and providing of the user specific recommendation or other suggestion information may be provided for a variety of users at various times. Similarly the generated information and or may be updated at various times e.g. periodically when new domain documents become available based on user feedback that is received etc. such that the most recent version of the generated information is used to provide information to particular users . In addition the automatically determined inter term relationship information may be used in various other manners in other embodiments e.g. search query term expansion identifying corrections for common misspellings clarifying user specific preferences determining domain specific multi term themes etc. as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In particular illustrates an example neural network that models determined inter term relationship relevance information which in this example has been generated based on analysis of an example corpus of domain specific documents for an example domain of interest. In particular the initial domain of interest relates to baseball in this example and the example corpus of domain specific documents that are available includes documents of various types e.g. news articles player biographies team summaries etc. as discussed in greater detail with respect to example . Furthermore as discussed in greater detail with respect to the example domain specific information from the corpus documents may be analyzed and used in various manners e.g. based in part on TF IDF values indicating the relationships of terms to documents in the corpus including to determine domain document relevance information and domain inter term relevance information similar to that discussed with respect to . The examples of further provide details regarding example uses of automatically determined relevance information for inter term relationships such as to provide recommendations based on the automatically determined inter term relationship information and or to update the automatically determined inter term relationship information based on user feedback.

In this example the inter term neural network of is based on the example inter term neural network of whose construction is discussed in greater detail with respect to . For example the inter term neural network of includes various term based input nodes and term based output nodes in an analogous manner to the term based input and output nodes and of and further illustrates inter term relevance information to indicate particular inter term relevance values for particular output nodes based on particular selected example input nodes in a manner that is based on analogous inter term relevance values illustrated for . In this example input nodes and corresponding to the terms Bonds and steroids have been selected in a manner analogous to selected input nodes and of . With respect to the inter term relevance value for a particular output term is based on average non normalized TF IDF values for that output term with respect to selected domain documents with those domain documents being selected based on being determined to be particularly relevant to the selected input term s . Thus the example inter term neural network of determines relevance between terms based at least in part on the relevance of the terms to selected documents in the corpus as reflected in part on the interior nodes of that represent particular domain documents. Conversely the example inter term neural network of does not explicitly indicate any corresponding particular document based interior nodes. Thus while in some embodiments the interior nodes of may correspond to a combination of the interior nodes and of such as if the determined relevance values for the output nodes are based on the relevance of terms to corpus documents in other embodiments the inter term relevance determinations for the output nodes of may not be based on documents to which the various terms correspond and or the relevance of terms to each other and or to documents may be determined in manners other than based on TF IDF values. Moreover it will be appreciated that even if the inter term relevance determinations for output nodes of were initially based on documents to which the various terms are determined to correspond and or initially based on relevance information determined using TF IDF values the links and their associated weights and the resulting output node values of such an inter term neural network may subsequently be modified based on feedback such that a current version of the inter term neural network is no longer based on those initial determinations. More generally and as discussed in greater detail with respect to the one or more layers of interior nodes in may represent various calculations that are performed as part of generating the inter term relevance numbers for particular output nodes based on particular selected input terms . Thus while only a single set of interior nodes are illustrated in for the sake of simplicity it will be appreciated that some such neural networks may have additional layers of interior nodes. In addition the inter term neural network of further includes various inter node links and and the discussion of include additional details regarding how such links are determined and used as part of an inter term neural network e.g. how to determine weights associated with some or all such links as well as how to use feedback to update weights and or links .

In the example of various graph nodes are illustrated corresponding to the seven example terms illustrated in as well as an additional example term Atlanta Braves. In the example graph the graph node corresponding to the term Bonds is illustrated as being directly dependent on or otherwise influenced by five other graph nodes those being graphs nodes and corresponding to the terms Hank Aaron steroids home run indictment and Giants respectively . Some of these other nodes may themselves be directly dependent on or otherwise influenced by other graph nodes e.g. graph node that is influenced by graph node graph node that is influenced by graph node etc. while other graph nodes do not have any such influences e.g. graph nodes etc. . In addition in this example each of the graph nodes may further have associated probability information or that is determined for and associated with the graph nodes such as prior probability information and conditional probability information although in some embodiments such prior probability information may not be used. Furthermore in this example the various graph nodes are all treated as being discrete random variables that each have only two possible values although in other embodiments graph nodes may represent other types of values e.g. more than two discrete values continuous values over a specified range etc. . provide additional details regarding examples of such determined probability information and possible node values. In other embodiments the graph that is constructed may instead have other forms such as to not be a DAG e.g. to include one or more cycles to have at least some of the nodes be continuous random variables or otherwise have forms other than discrete random variables etc. and more generally the inter term relationships may be represented in a manner other than a graph.

To construct the example graph in this example each of the terms of the example domain is first consecutively selected as an individual input node for an inter term neural network that represents the example domain e.g. the inter term neural network of and the output nodes with the highest associated inter term relevance values are selected as candidates for representing significant inter term relationships with the selected input node such that the terms corresponding to the selected output nodes may be likely to be influenced by the term for the selected input node. In embodiments in which the inter term relevance is based at least initially on the relevance of terms to documents in the corpus the individual selection of the various input terms may result in differing documents being selected as being among the most relevant to those selected input terms as discussed with respect to . In addition illustrates example information that indicates particular ones of the example documents 1 5 that may be selected for use with each of the eight example terms although various other corpus documents may similarly be selected for some or all of the example terms that are not shown and documents may similarly be selected for various other example terms that are not shown. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the particular documents to use may be selected in various manners in various embodiments such as for example the following a fixed number or percentage of the documents e.g. ten a thousand etc. such as ranked by the TF IDF relevance value of the selected input term to the document by a term to document relevance value determined by a corresponding network e.g. neural network of or in other manners all of the documents above a fixed such TF IDF value fixed such term to document relevance value or other value or above a percentage such TF IDF value percentage such term to document relevance value or other value of the selected input term for all of the corpus documents to select all of the corpus documents but vary their influence e.g. by weighting each document s contribution to the most relevant candidate other terms by the document s relevance to the selected input term such as based on the TF IDF value for the selected input term and document on the term to document relevance value determined by a corresponding network or instead in other manners etc. As discussed elsewhere while TF IDF values are used as part of the example for such as to initialize term to document relevance values for a corresponding network in other embodiments the relevance of terms to documents and or to other terms may be determined in other manners. In this example the relevant documents may be selected based on for example having TF IDF values or term to document relevance values for the selected input term that are above 0.400. After the relevant documents are selected and or relative weights are selected to be used for each of some or all possible documents for each of the selected input terms the relevance of each other output term to the selected input term may be determined by using the TF IDF values or term to document relevance values for the other term to those selected relevant documents such as for example based on an average of such TF IDF values or term to document relevance values. Additional details regarding the creation of an inter term relevance neural network to model such information are included with respect to including modifying such an inter term neural network after initial creation to reflect various user feedback which may cause the various inter term relevance values to vary from TDF IF values initially determined based solely on the corpus document analysis . Furthermore the relevance of a particular output term to multiple relevant documents may be determined in a variety of manners other than an average of the output term s TF IDF values or term to document relevance values for those documents.

Thus for the purposes of this example and using only the five example documents 1 5 the relevance of other output term home run of to selected input term indictment of may be 0.267 the TF IDF value or term to document relevance value for the term home run to example document 3 which is the only one of the five example documents that is selected as being relevant for input term indictment as illustrated in row of while the relevance of other term indictment to selected input term home run may be 0.000 the average TF IDF value or average term to document relevance value for the term indictment to example documents 1 and 2 which are the example documents selected as being relevant for input term home run as illustrated in row of . In this manner the previously constructed inter term neural network that represents such inter term information may be used to provide determined inter term relevance values for the other terms for each of the individually selected input terms as shown in example information of . Furthermore in some embodiments the various determined inter term relevance values are normalized e.g. to be between 0 and 1 although such normalization is not illustrated in the example of .

After the various inter term relevance values are determined for the various output terms for each of the selected input terms the most relevant output terms for the various input terms may be selected based on having sufficiently high inter term relevance values. Moreover in this example if two terms are both selected as each being relevant to the other only the relationship with the higher inter term relevance value is selected to be represented in the graph so as to provide a direction of greatest influence between those two terms. In this manner the information in table of may be used to identify the structure of the graph of except for term Atlanta Braves which is not listed in with the inter term relevance values that are selected to identify influence relationships between terms being shown in bold for convenience. It will be appreciated that in embodiments in which an acyclic graph is desired additional actions may be taken if needed to prevent cycles such as to eliminate one or more influence links that are part of a cycle e.g. the influence links with the lowest corresponding inter term relevance values for the cycle or instead in other manners in other embodiments. Furthermore as discussed in greater detail elsewhere the particular inter term relationships between input terms and output terms to be used for the graph may be selected in various manners in various embodiments such as for example the following a fixed number or percentage of the output terms for each input term e.g. ten a thousand etc. as ranked by the inter term relevance values all of the output terms above a fixed such inter term relevance value or above a percentage such inter term relevance value for the selected input term and all of the possible output terms etc. In this example for the sake of simplicity the output terms having an inter term non normalized relevance value above 0.400 have been selected. In addition the input terms that are allowed to influence any particular output term in the graph may further be limited in various manners in various embodiments such as for example a fixed number or percentage of such input terms influencing each output term e.g. ten a thousand etc. .

After the structure of the example inter term relationship graph of is determined in this manner the example probability information and or may be determined in various manners. illustrates examples of prior probability information and corresponding to terms Hank Aaron and Giants respectively which in this example are both treated as discrete random variables having only two values corresponding to a user having a preference for or other interest in the term or instead not having a preference for or other interest or having a negative preference or interest in the term. As previously noted in other embodiments prior probability information may have forms other than discrete random variables with two values e.g. discrete random variables with more than two discrete values continuous random variables with continuous values over a specified range etc. . Thus for example the prior probability of a given user having an interest in the term Hank Aaron is identified as being 5 in this example with the corresponding probability value of not being interested in the term Hank Aaron being 95 . The prior probability of a given user having an interest in the term Giants is identified as being 10 in this example and thus has a corresponding probability value of 90 of not being interested in the term Giants which is not shown for the sake of brevity . Such prior probability information may be automatically assessed in various manners such as by using a term s IDF value across the corpus documents as an inverse representation of the likely interest of the term to users e.g. to give a highest prior probability of interest to a term with the lowest IDF value such as a predetermined maximum prior probability and to give proportionally lower prior probabilities of interest to other terms with increasing IDF values or instead in other manners. In other embodiments such prior probability information may not be determined and used.

Such conditional probability information and may be automatically determined in various manners. For example each combination of possible term values may be individually consecutively selected and used as input to a constructed inter term relevance neural network that represents the domain e.g. the inter term relevance neural network of with the various corresponding relevance values for the output term Bonds being tracked. Those corresponding relevance values may then be converted into probability values in various manners e.g. to give a highest probability of interest to the combination of input term values with the highest corresponding inter term relevance value for the output term Bonds such as a predetermined maximum probability and to give proportionally lower probabilities of interest to other combinations of input term values with decreasing corresponding inter term relevance values for the output term Bonds or instead in other manners as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. For example in one particular embodiment the inter term neural network is viewed as defining a Markov Blanket over term space in the form params forwardcomputation of through exp Equation 6 where d is an output term where U V and Eare parameters of the inter term neural network that are discussed in greater detail with respect to . For example Eis the cost function of the inter term relevance neural network as follows 

In addition for a given user with a defined evidence set preference terms the likelihood of the user having a preference for another term X may be determined by performing inference in the sub graph spanning the evidence and the specific term or terms in the preference and term X. In the case where X is disconnected from all the evidence nodes in the determined network structure an indication of no result may be returned. When there is a graph spanning the evidence and term X approximate inference may be performed in the graph e.g. using Gibbs sampling based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling simulations using variational methods etc. to estimate the marginal over the non evidence initialized nodes of the probability of term X given the evidence for the user. In other embodiments such as if a generated Bayesian network is sufficiently small and or the speed of response time is not important exact inference may instead be performed in at least some situations.

Thus once the inter term graph structure and probability information are determined for the graph of the graph may be used as a Bayesian network whose information is a probabilistic representation of the significant inter term relationships for the domain s of interest. Accordingly illustrates a subset of such a Bayesian network in a manner similar to the graph of . In this example evidence has been obtained regarding preferences of a given example user User X which include positive preferences for the terms Hank Aaron and home run but a negative preference or non preference for the term Giants as reflected in the new user specific evidence nodes and respectively that have been added to the Bayesian network subset . Furthermore in this example only the subset of the Bayesian network that is relevant to the target term Bonds and the available evidence is shown thus nodes and corresponding to the terms indictment and steroids respectively may not be used in this situation to determine User X s probability of interest in the term Bonds based on the lack of evidence of User X s interest in those terms although in other embodiments information regarding prior probability information and or conditional probability information that may influence the probability of those nodes being preferred by User X may be considered . Accordingly given the user specific evidence and and ignoring the influence of nodes and a user specific determination is made that User X has a 92 probability of having a preference for target term Bonds as reflected in row of information of again ignoring the influence of nodes and for the sake of this example as illustrated by the determined preference probability value in this example. Similar determinations may also be made of User X s probability of preferences for other term nodes in the full Bayesian network given the available evidence of User X s preferences such as for node corresponding to the term Atlanta Braves and or other nodes although such determinations are not illustrated in . Once the preference probabilities are determined for one or more such target nodes particular target nodes may be selected as being sufficiently likely e.g. based on exceeding a defined threshold for the preference probability or other determined likelihood or on otherwise satisfying one or more determined criteria to represent additional preferences of that particular user that have not yet been expressed by the user or made available to the DSRD service such as in this example to have an unexpressed preference for term Bonds. Such particular target nodes may be selected in various manners such as for example the following a fixed number or percentage of such target terms as ranked by the determined preference probability values all of the target terms above a fixed such determined preference probability value or percentage such determined preference probability value for all of the possible target terms etc.

As previously discussed one or more decision trees may also be generated to each represent a subset of a Bayesian network or other probabilistic representation of inter term relationship information. illustrates an example of a decision tree that is constructed to represent the portion of the Bayesian network illustrated in that being nodes and again with the simplifying assumption that other nodes and do not have an influence on the node corresponding to term Bonds for this example . The various eight end nodes of the decision tree correspond to the eight rows through of and with each such end node having a corresponding preference probability value for graph node corresponding to term Bonds as shown in the column of the information of . The additional decision nodes of the decision tree correspond to the varying values for the three nodes and that are treated in this example as having an influence on the preference probability value for graph node . Thus using the user specific evidence and of for User X the decision tree would be traversed in the indicated manner as follows by taking the left arrow out of decision node corresponding to a positive preference for term Hank Aaron by next taking the right arrow out of decision node corresponding to a negative or neutral preference for term Giants and by then taking the left arrow out of decision node corresponding to a positive preference for term home run thus arriving at end node indicating the preference probability value of 92 for the term Bonds. It will be appreciated that such decision trees may be generated encoded and compiled in various manners to enhance the speed of run time processing given particular preference evidence for a particular user.

In addition as discussed elsewhere in some embodiments the determined inter term relevance information for one or more first domains e.g. obtained by document analysis for those first domains and or user feedback corresponding to those first domains may be extended to one or more second domains for which only limited or no user preference information is available. illustrates an example graph that is similar to graph of but which has been expanded in this example to identify inter term relevance information to new terms from a new second domain of interest. In particular in this example various documents or other content items have been analyzed corresponding to the domain of American movies and various significant inter term probabilistic relationships have been identified between new terms in the movie domain to existing terms in the baseball domain. In this example the movie related terms correspond to titles of movies such that the expanded graph is a Bayesian network that includes not only the graph nodes but also new graph nodes corresponding to nine example movies furthermore for use as part of the example two additional baseball domain related nodes and have been added corresponding to terms Oakland Athletics and Mark McGwire which influence previously existing nodes and as illustrated .

In particular in this expanded example influences have been automatically identified from the existing graph node corresponding to term home run to multiple baseball related movies in which home runs are an important part of the plot which in this example include the movies Bull Durham The Natural and Hank Aaron Chasing The Dream. Such automatic identification of influences may be determined in a manner similar to that previously discussed such as by analyzing content items that include summaries of movie plots and or reviewers critiques of movies and identifying a significant relevance of the term home run to those movies furthermore as discussed in greater detail elsewhere this automatic identification of additional influences may optionally be performed without any information about any users that had preferences for both the term home run and any of the indicated movies or more generally without any information about any users preferences for any movies . In addition in this example various other significant inter term probabilistic relationships have been further determined such as the following between the baseball related movie Bull Durham and the basketball related movie Hoosiers e.g. based on both movies being on lists of the best sports related movies or otherwise being compared in content items for the second and or first domains between The Natural and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid e.g. based on both having Robert Redford as a leading actor from each of The Natural and Hoosiers to Downhill Racer e.g. based on leading actors in both of those two movies also being in the latter movie between The Natural and Ordinary People e.g. based on having Robert Redford as an actor in one and a director for the other between Ordinary People and Raging Bull e.g. based on both being nominated for best picture in the same year and or otherwise being discussed together etc. It will be appreciated that relationships between movies and between baseball related terms and movies may be identified in a variety of manners in various embodiments. Furthermore given such an expanded Bayesian network a given user s preferences in the baseball related domain may be used to identify likely target movies in which that user will also have a preference. For example given User X s evidence discussed in including preferences for the terms Hank Aaron and home run it may be inferred that User X is likely to have preferences for movies such as Hank Aaron Chasing the Dream The Natural and Bull Durham and possibly to other related movies as well e.g. Hoosiers Ordinary People etc. .

As discussed with respect to and elsewhere probability information for use in a Bayesian network or other determined probabilistic relationship data structure related to one or more domains may be determined in various manners in various embodiments including based on analysis of documents for the domain s and optionally without any feedback of actual users interests in particular inter term relationships. Furthermore as previously noted if such actual user interest information is available the actual user interest information may be incorporated with the automatically determined inter term relationship information from the automated document analysis at various times e.g. as part of the initial creation of the probability information to update probability information that was initially determined based solely on the automated document analysis etc. and in some situations and embodiments may be used to replace the automatically determined inter term relationship information from the automated document analysis e.g. if sufficient actual user interest information becomes available . illustrates updated examples of the prior probability information of and of the conditional probability information of such as if the initial versions of the probability information and is generated based on automatically determined inter term relationship information from the automated document analysis and the updated versions of the probability information and is based at least in part on actual user interest information. For example illustrates that the updated prior probability information related to user interest in the term Hank Aaron reflects a current prior probability of 18 of a given user s interest in the term Hank Aaron updated from the previous prior probability of only 5 of a given user s interest in the term Hank Aaron. In addition the updated conditional probability information in shows that updates have been made to the probability of a given user s interest in the term Bonds for the rows from 0.12 to 0.09 and from 0.92 to 0.87 and other rows values may similarly be updated actual user interest related to the combination of input values for those rows becomes available. Such updated probability information may further be used with an updated version of a corresponding Bayesian network and or decision tree as described in greater detail with respect to .

Thus in at least some embodiments automatically determined information about inter term relationships for a domain may be obtained and used e.g. based on analysis of documents for the domain and distinct actual user interest information that reflects inter term relationships for the domain may be obtained and used. In situations in which both of these types of information are available they may be combined in various manners. For example as previously discussed illustrate examples of inter term networks that may be generated based on an automated analysis of documents of a domain and that may optionally be modified based on user feedback. While not illustrated here in some embodiments one or more similar inter term networks may be generated that reflect actual user interest information but that may optionally differ in one or more manners from the inter term networks generated from the automated document analysis. For example with comparison to a similar inter term network may be generated based on actual user interest information but that lacks the existing link in from the term indictment to Bonds e.g. based on there being few or no users who actually indicated positive and or negative interests for both of those terms together and that further includes a new link relative to from the term Canseco to Bonds e.g. based on there being one or more users who indicated positive and or negative interests for both of those terms together such as based at least in part on Jose Canseco s ability to hit home runs . In addition such a similar actual user interest inter term network may include different degrees of relevance of particular terms e.g. as reflected in conditional probability tables and or prior probability information for the actual user interest inter term network whether instead of or in addition to one or more structural differences in the actual user interest inter term network relative to the automated document analysis inter term network. If data is available corresponding to both an automated document analysis inter term network and an actual user interest inter term network for the same domain the data may be used in various manners. For example to generate a particular set of recommendations given a particular set of known user preferences both types of networks may be independently assessed using those known user preferences in some embodiments and the results from the two networks may be aggregated together. Alternatively the data corresponding to the two types of graphs may be used to construct a single aggregate inter term network in various manners and that single aggregate inter term network may be used to provide recommendations corresponding to a particular set of known user preferences. The construction of a single aggregate inter term network may include for example using the information about the structure of the actual user interest inter term network and the data from the automated document analysis inter term network to specify the degree of relevance between terms or more generally may include using data from one of the networks to prune and or augment the structure of the other network and or more generally may include using data from one of the networks to adjust the strength or influence of inter term relationships for the other network. Thus as discussed above inter term relevance information obtained from the automated analysis of corpus documents may be automatically integrated in at least some embodiments with user related inter term relevance data that is obtained in other manners e.g. collaborative filtering etc. potentially providing benefits over the use of any of such techniques alone.

It will be appreciated that updates to determined probability information may be made in a variety of manners in various embodiments and may reflect various factors. For example the update to the prior probability information for the term Hank Aaron may reflect that the documents in the initially analyzed domain corpus focus primarily on current news such that current actual user interest in at least some historical players may be higher than would be indicated by the analyzed domain corpus documents may reflect a recent growing interest in the term Hank Aaron relative to a time to which the initially analyzed domain corpus documents correspond etc. When actual user interest information is combined with automatically determined user interest information based on automated analysis of domain corpus documents the combination may be performed in various manners such as by weighting one or both types of user interest information e.g. to give greater weight to the type of information that is believed to be more accurate to give greater weight to the type of information that is more recent etc. . As one simplistic example the user interest information that is automatically determined based on automated analysis of domain corpus documents may be treated as the equivalent of actual user interest information from 10 users such that if 5 of 20 actual users are determined to have an interest in the term Hank Aaron the updated prior probability information would be as indicated in the example i.e. 5 0.05 10 20 10 0.183 . Alternatively the weight given to actual user interest information may vary based on the number of actual users such as to give only limited weight to the actual user interest of the first few users e.g. so as to prevent anomalous information from having a disparate effect on the combined probability information to increase the weight exponentially as the number of users grows and optionally to eventually discard or ignore or give very low relative weight to the automatically determined user interest information based on automated analysis of domain corpus documents as the number of actual users reaches a sufficient quantity. The updates to the conditional probability information for the output term Bonds may be updated in a manner similar to that of the prior probability information . For example with respect to the changes in the probability for the term Bonds with respect to row the reduction in that probability may be based on one or more users who are determined to have actual interest in the terms Hank Aaron and home run corresponding to the yes values in the columns and for row and to have an actual lack of interest or negative interest in the term Giants corresponding to the no value in the column for row and further to have an actual lack of interest or negative interest in the term Bonds. 

In a manner similar to that of illustrates an updated Bayesian network portion data structure that is similar to the Bayesian network portion of with the same graph nodes and but with the evidence nodes and illustrated in reflecting evidence for a new user in this example User Y who has the same indicated preference information as example User X of . In particular in this example the conditional probability table information not shown for graph node corresponding to term Bonds of has been updated with respect to the conditional probability table information for the same node in such as to in this example reflect the updated probability value 87 of column and row of as well as the updated probability value 9 of column and row of . The prior probability information not shown for graph node corresponding to term Hank Aaron of may similarly be updated with respect to the same graph node of such as to reflect the updated prior probability information of but is not used in this example. Thus as actual user interest information becomes available to update probability information such as information of corresponding Bayesian network information such as for Bayesian network portion may be updated for future use. Thus in this example with respect to User Y who is determined to have a preference for or other interest in terms Hank Aaron and home run as shown in evidence nodes and but to have a lack of a preference for or other interest or negative preference or interest in the term Giants as shown in evidence node will be determined to have an 87 probability of having a preference for or other interest in term Bonds as shown by the determined preference probability value of .

Thus information corresponding to probabilistic representations of inter term relationships such as may be determined at least in part on automated analysis of documents related to a domain may be updated to reflect actual user interest information that becomes available such as in the manner illustrated with respect to . Furthermore in some situations such actual user interest information may identify additional inter term relationships that were not previously determined to be sufficiently relevant based solely on the information that was previously available and if so the generated probabilistic representations of the inter term relationships may be updated to reflect the additional inter term relationships. As one example an inter term relevance neural network or other representation of inter term relevance information may be updated to reflect the actual user interest information and the probabilistic representations of the inter term relationships may be newly generated based on the updated inter term relevance information. In other embodiments and situations at least some types of generated inter term relationship probabilistic representation information may instead be updated in other manners.

As previously noted illustrate examples of techniques for determining and using relevance information related to an example domain of interest such as that may be automatically performed by an embodiment of the DSRD service and include additional details related to various of the examples discussed in .

For example illustrate examples of summary information about several documents that are part of a particular example domain of interest along with example term analysis information that may be generated by an embodiment of the DSRD service for the documents related to the domain. In particular as indicated with respect to example summary information the example domain of interest relates to baseball and the corpus of domain specific documents that are available in this example for the domain includes 1000 documents e.g. news articles player biographies team summaries etc. .

The information in this example includes a summary of a few example terms that are present in the corpus along with IDF information for those terms. In particular several terms are shown with each having a unique term ID an indication of a number of documents in the corpus that include that term and a corresponding IDF value for the term and the corpus documents. Various other summary information may also be generated and stored but is not shown in this example. In addition each row in the example table reflects a distinct term such as for row that corresponds to the common term the which is present in every one of the 1000 documents in the corpus and thus has an IDF value of zero. In this example the rows are sorted based on IDF value such that subsequent terms have increasing IDF values reflecting their presence in less of the documents of the corpus than preceding terms and thus being more distinctive with respect to those documents in which they are present. Additional details regarding calculating IDF values are included elsewhere. In addition in some embodiments some common terms or other indicated terms e.g. the term the may be removed as part of the document term analysis and thus may not be shown in such summary information or used in the later determination of relevance related information. Furthermore some of the terms in this example are phrases that include multiple related words such as home run and Hank Aaron while other terms that may be used together at times e.g. Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonds are shown as separate terms. It will be appreciated that such multi word aggregate terms may be determined in various manners such as automatically based on their repeated use together and lack of use separately automatically based on the inclusion of such terms in a dictionary of common terms for the domain or other similar information at least partially in a manual manner based on input from an operator of the DSRD service etc. In other embodiments each word may be treated as a separate term at least initially and may optionally be later grouped together as part of a common multi term theme based on a learned relevance of the inter relatedness of those terms from the terms being repeatedly used together by users as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The other example tables and that are illustrated in each reflect an example document in the corpus and include various information about example terms in those documents and corresponding term relevance information for those terms and those documents. In particular information corresponds to an example document 1 which in this example is a news article related to Barry Bonds setting the career home run HR record in 2007 while playing for the San Francisco Giants surpassing the previous record held by Hank Aaron. While Bonds was pursuing the home run record there was also significant ongoing news coverage related to a steroid controversy among players in Major League Baseball and Bonds was later indicted on charges related to statements regarding his alleged use of steroids.

The various entries in the table each correspond to an example subset of terms that are present in the 1500 word document 1 such as the term Bonds in entry the term Hank Aaron in entry etc. The number of occurrences of each term in document 1 is also illustrated and a corresponding term frequency value is shown. IDF values are also replicated here for the terms and correspond to the same values in information . Furthermore each entry includes a TF IDF value based on the term frequency value and IDF value . For example the term Bonds in entry is indicated to occur 35 times in document 1 which results in a 2.33 frequency among the 1500 words of the document. The IDF value for the term Bonds is 1.10 as corresponds to information of entry of information and the TF IDF value for Bonds in entry in this example is 2.559. The entries are illustrated in this example in order of decreasing value of TF IDF values indicating that the term Bonds is the most descriptive term for this document that is illustrated while other terms such as the and indictment in entries and respectively are not descriptive of this document e.g. due to the term the being present in all the documents of the corpus and thus having a zero IDF value and due to the term indictment not occurring in this example document and thus having a zero term frequency value . While the term indictment is included in this example for document 1 for explanatory reasons in other embodiments the term would not be included in information since is not present in document 1. Additional details regarding calculating TF and TF IDF values are included elsewhere.

Tables and include similar information for example documents 2 3 4 and 5 respectively. In particular example document 2 is an overview biography of Barry Bonds focusing on Bonds various accomplishments and including corresponding terms as shown in various entries . Example document 3 is a news article corresponding to Bonds indictment on bases related to possible steroid related abuses and includes corresponding terms as shown in various entries . The example document 4 corresponds to an event that occurred prior to Bonds indictment and initiated some of the steroids related controversy in Major League Baseball and in particular corresponds to former Major League Baseball player Jose Canseco testifying before Congress related to alleged steroid use in Major League Baseball with corresponding terms shown in various entries . Example document 5 is a news article from the middle of the 2008 Major League Baseball season and focuses on the current status of the San Francisco Giants team for which Bonds stopped playing after the 2007 season with corresponding terms shown in various entries . As discussed in greater detail with respect to the example term information for these example documents will be used to illustrate some of the described techniques in terms of determining relevant multi term themes and other inter term relationships as well as determining relevant documents for particular terms for this example baseball related domain.

In this example example document 3 has the highest generated document relevance value for the query terms as the contents of document 3 related to Bonds steroid related indictment are highly relevant to both query terms . Example documents 1 and 4 are each moderately relevant to the combination of query terms based on each of those example documents being highly relevant to one of the query terms and only slightly relevant to the other query term i.e. with example document 1 being highly relevant to the Bonds term and only slightly relevant to the steroids term and with example document 4 being highly relevant to the steroids term and only slightly relevant to the Bonds term as shown in column for document 1 and column for document 4 in entries and of information . The other example documents 2 and 5 are less relevant to the query terms than the other three example documents.

As previously noted the determination of the relevance of a particular document to one or more specified terms e.g. terms that are part of a search query such as multiple related terms that are part of a theme may be performed in various manners in various embodiments. As one specific example the TF IDF scores for each of the specified terms and document may be combined in various manners such as to generate an average or sum. In particular in at least some embodiments an average of the TF IDF scores for the various specified terms is generated and may further be normalized e.g. to represent a relevance percentage or other number between 0 and 1 so as to produce a normalized document relevance DR score for the specified terms that facilitates comparison between documents and that facilitates human understanding of the DR scores. The DR score for a document d relative to a group g of one or more specified terms i may be determined as follows in at least some embodiments 

In particular in this example the information includes a visual indication of the specified query terms and a list of corresponding search results are shown in order of generated document relevance. Furthermore in this example each of the entries in the list includes an indication not only of the corresponding relevant document e.g. a name or other identifier of the document such as may be displayed as a user selectable link that may be selected by the user to access the document but also an indication of the corresponding generated normalized document relevance number for the document such as to provide information to the user in assessing whether to obtain further information about a particular document or otherwise select the document as being relevant to the query terms . The indicated normalized document relevance numbers in this example each also include a textual assessment of the degree of relevance of the normalized document relevance number although in other embodiments only one or neither of the normalized document relevance numbers and associated textual assessments may be shown. In addition the selection and display of particular search results may be performed in various manners in various embodiments including to show a specified quantity of query results to show some or all query results that are above a specified minimum document relevance value etc.

In addition in this example additional information and user selectable controls are provided for possible selection by the user although in other embodiments such additional information may not be shown. In this example the additional information asks the user if he she would like to expand the previously specified search query to further describe a relevant theme for the domain such as to improve the accuracy of the search results by specifying a more specific or otherwise different theme that better represents the user s interests than the query terms . As one possible example as previously discussed with respect to example documents 1 and 4 that are each highly relevant to one of the specified query terms but only mildly relevant to the other specified query term the user may be able to improve the accuracy of the search results by clarifying whether the user is primarily interested in the steroids related controversy in Major League Baseball e.g. as it pertains to not only Bonds but also to other players or instead is primarily interested in information related to Bonds that is only partially related to Bonds alleged use of steroids e.g. the career home run record set by Bonds . More generally by identifying additional terms that are particularly relevant to the user s current interest the resulting expanded query terms may better disambiguate the various possible themes that may be associated with the terms in the initial query.

The selection of the user selectable Yes control in information of may prompt various additional actions by the DSRD service with one such example described in greater detail with respect to . In particular illustrates information about other terms that may be related to the specified query terms Bonds and steroids with indications of the assessed degrees of relevance of the other terms to the specified query terms that are determined. In other embodiments the use of the inter term relevance information may be prompted in other manners such as if it is performed automatically for some or all users in some or all situations e.g. so as to display additional information with information of regarding the possible relevance of one or more other terms whether instead of or in addition to the information .

The various information in may be used in various ways such as part of further defining a particular theme for use in a refined search query that is based in part on the initially specified query terms or to otherwise identify general interests of the user. For example in some embodiments some or all of such information may be illustrated to the user that specified the query terms although in the illustrated embodiment the information is not displayed to the user. In this example the information includes a number of term entries that each correspond to a candidate additional term for possible combination with the query terms and document columns indicate an assessed degree of relevance of those terms to example documents 1 4. Column indicates an aggregate term relevance score for the candidate term in each entry with respect to the query terms such as to reflect an assessed degree of relevance of the candidate term to the term combination represented by the query terms . The various example documents and candidate additional terms may be selected in various manners in various embodiments. For example the candidate additional terms may be selected by first selecting a subset of the documents of the corpus that are determined to be most relevant to the query terms such as based on the normalized document relevance numbers illustrated in . The most relevant documents may be selected in various manners such as to select a specified quantity of the documents with the highest document relevance numbers to select a specified percentage of the documents with the highest document relevance numbers to select some or all of the documents whose document relevance numbers are above a specified threshold or otherwise satisfy one or more defined criteria e.g. a predefined threshold such as a minimum document relevance number threshold or a dynamically determined threshold such as if grouping documents with similar document relevance number values provides a naturally occurring threshold point between a group of the most relevant documents and other documents etc. In this example of example document 5 has not been selected as a most relevant document for further use in this example based on its low document relevance number of 2 as indicated in column for entry in but the other example documents 1 4 have been selected for use as relevant documents.

In this example once the most relevant documents are selected for the query terms candidate additional terms are selected for the query terms based at least in part on those selected documents. For example the candidate additional terms may be selected based on terms in the selected documents other than the query terms that are most relevant for those selected documents such as based on TF IDF values of those other terms for the selected documents and or based on term frequency values for those other terms for the selected documents. In this example the numbers illustrated in the information for each term entry and example document reflects the TF IDF value for that term and document. For example with respect to entry corresponding to term home run the term relevance value of that term for example document 1 is indicated to be the TF IDF value 1.333 as previously indicated in entry and column of information of and the term relevance value for term home run in entry for example document 2 is indicated to be the TF IDF value of 1.125 as previously indicated in row and column of information of .

Furthermore in this example the term relevance values for each of the terms is then aggregated across the selected documents such as by averaging those individual TF IDF document specific values with the resulting determined aggregate term relevance score or number for each candidate additional term being reflected in column . In this example the candidate terms are shown in decreasing order of their determined aggregate relevance values for the query terms such that the candidate term home run in entry is determined to be the most relevant candidate additional term for the specified query terms and such that the candidate additional term Canseco in entry is determined to be the least relevant candidate additional term for the specified query terms that are shown. The particular candidate additional terms that are selected for consideration based on the group of selected documents may be identified in various ways such as by using a specified quantity of other terms from each document or from all documents that are determined to be most potentially relevant e.g. by using TF IDF values term frequency values or other individual document term relevance values by using a specified percentage of the most potentially relevant other terms from each document or from all documents by using some or all of the other terms whose TF IDF values or other individual document term relevance values are above a specified threshold for at least one of the selected documents or for all of the selected documents or for some specified minimum subset of the most relevant documents or otherwise satisfy one or more defined criteria e.g. a predefined threshold such as a minimum term relevance number threshold or a dynamically determined threshold such as if grouping terms with similar term relevance number values provides a naturally occurring threshold between a group of the most relevant terms and other terms etc. In other embodiments the candidate additional terms and or relevant documents may be selected in other manners and the individual term relevance values and or aggregate term relevance values may be determined in other manners. Additional details related to the generation of example term relevance scores or other values are included elsewhere.

The information screen in this example includes a list of possible other related terms for the specified query terms such as is generated in this example based on at least some of the candidate additional terms of . In particular the example related other terms include several entries that have been selected as being likely to be of interest to the user based on the inter term relationship between the specified query terms and the candidate additional terms and are shown in order of decreasing determined inter term relevance based on the aggregate relevance scores of . In addition in this example an indication of the inter term relevance of each of the included possible other terms is shown although in other embodiments such inter term relevance information may not be included or may be shown in other manners in this example the determined term relevance scores from column of have been translated into a scale from 0 to 10 with possible other terms that are determined to be most relevant having a possible value of 10 and with the possible other terms that are determined to be less relevant having lower values. While not illustrated here each of the possible other terms may be a user selectable link or otherwise have one or more associated user selectable controls to allow the user to select or otherwise specify that term as being of interest such as to specify to include that selected term as part of a revised query or to otherwise treat that term as being among the interests of the user. In other embodiments the inter term relevance information may be displayed in other manners such as to indicate the actual determined term relevance scores from to display a normalized version of such term relevance scores in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to for document relevance scores etc. In addition while textual descriptions of the term relevance values are not shown in in a manner similar to those of in other embodiments such term relevance values may be shown.

In this example information includes additional entries and relative to the information of which have been added to correspond to the two additional query terms. Accordingly the resulting aggregate normalized document relevance numbers in entry have been updated with respect to the previous document relevance numbers of entry of to reflect the addition of the two additional terms. In this example the aggregate normalized document relevance information in entry continues to be based on an average of the individual term relevance numbers for each of the four expanded query terms although in other embodiments the aggregate normalized document relevance scores may be calculated in other manners e.g. using a weighted average . In this example the addition of the two additional search terms has reduced the determined relevance for example document 3 which was previously determined to be the most relevant document in for the initial query terms . In particular as shown in column and entry of information the revised document relevance score for document 3 has been reduced from the previous value of 84 to the current value of 47 . In addition the relative relevance of example documents 1 and 2 has increased relative to the information in as shown in columns and of information such that document 1 is determined to be the most relevant document for the expanded query terms and document 2 is determined to be the second most relevant document for the expanded query terms

In this example the changes in the document relevance numbers can be understood intuitively based on the general topics of the example documents and the theme specified using the expanded query terms . In particular relative to the two initial query terms of the expanded query terms of appear to be less related to the general steroids related controversy in Major League Baseball and more related to information specific to Barry Bonds and his attainment of the home run record. Accordingly the example document 1 news article related to Bonds setting the home run record has now become the most relevant document to the expanded query and example document 4 that is related to the steroids controversy more generally has become much less relevant. Example documents 2 and 3 continue to be at least moderately relevant to the expanded query terms as the example document 2 biography related to Bonds and the example document 3 related to Bonds indictment both include discussion of the home run record and example document 2 mentions the prior record holder Hank Aaron. While the user is illustrated in this example as having selected the two additional query terms home run and Hank Aaron in other embodiments and situations such additional terms may be automatically selected as being of likely interest to the user based on the inter term relationships between the additional query terms and the two original query terms of Bonds and steroids and if so documents that are particularly relevant to the expanded query terms e.g. document 1 may be provided to the user as automatically generated user specific recommendations for the user.

In a similar manner to that of the illustrated information may in at least some embodiments not be displayed to the user but other information similar to that of may be displayed to the user to illustrate a revised list of relevant documents based on the new query terms . In addition the feedback provided by the user by selecting additional query terms as shown in may be used in other manners in at least some embodiments including as feedback to modify the determined relevance of particular documents and or of the inter term relationships for particular terms relative to the initial query terms of .

Thus as discussed with respect to as well as elsewhere the relevance of particular terms to each other and or to a more general concept may be identified in various manners including based on analysis of documents for a domain and or based on user feedback related to particular terms. provides a graphical illustration of various concepts that may be identified and used for a particular domain of interest which in this example continues to be baseball including Major League Baseball MLB . In this example multiple concepts and have been automatically identified and are illustrated in with each concept including a textual summary or other label as well as one or more related terms. Thus for example concept has a textual label of steroid abuse in MLB while concept has a textual label of MLB home run record. Concepts and correspond generally to the examples of respectively as discussed above. In addition concept includes various related terms while concept includes various related terms which in this example include some overlap e.g. Bonds and steroids and each include multiple terms although in other situations may have only a single term and or may not have an overlap in terms with other concepts. It will be appreciated that a large number of additional concepts e.g. hundreds thousands etc. may be identified and used for a domain.

In addition in the previously discussed examples the example query terms have been specified in a relatively simple manner in which the terms are listed without any indicated logical combination operation e.g. AND OR etc. or other indication of relative weighting or use. In other embodiments other types of information may be specified for such search queries and may be used in various ways. For example in some other embodiments users may be able to indicate not only query terms that are of interest or in which they have a positive interest but may also be able to indicate query terms that are not of interest for a particular query or theme or in which they have a negative interest and may also be allowed to modify an initial query in various other ways. For example in a manner similar to that illustrated with respect to information may be determined to reflect the least relevant other terms based on the initial query terms and such least relevant term information may similarly be displayed to the user to allow selection of terms to exclude from the expanded query. In such situations the terms of interest may be combined with terms indicated to be excluded or that are otherwise not of interest in various ways. For example with respect to the example of query terms Bonds and steroids may be indicated to be of interest but an expanded query term with the term Canseco indicated to be excluded may be specified. As shown in entry of information of the term Canseco is relevant only to document 4 of the example documents 1 5 and in particular has a document relevance number of 0.97 for document 4 in this example. Such information may be combined with the information of in various ways to treat the relevance of the excluded term Canseco to each of the documents as a reduction in overall document relevance number for the document based on the expanded query terms such as by treating the term relevance value of an excluded term to a document as the negative of the term relevance value for an included term along with expanding the range of possible values for the normalized document relevance numbers to be from 1 to 1 . If so a revised document relevance number of 0.01 may be generated for document 4 and the expanded query terms in this example by taking an average of the individual term relevance numbers of 0.04 and 0.97 for Bonds and steroids along with the negative term relevance number of 0.97 for Canseco. It will be appreciated that relevance information about excluded terms and other terms that are not of interest may be used and combined with relevance information for terms of interest in other manners in other embodiments.

In addition in a manner similar to that of in some embodiments a user may be allowed to specify one or more documents that the user considers to be particularly relevant to the query terms such as for use in determining other terms that are relevant to the query terms and or other documents that are relevant to the specified document e.g. to request similar documents to the specified document . Alternatively rather than listing particular other possible terms in the manner shown in one or more previously defined multi term themes may instead be displayed to the user for possible selection and use in identifying further relevant documents. Such other defined themes may be specified in various ways including a textual label e.g. Bonds career home run record and or using particular terms that are part of that defined theme e.g. Bonds steroids home run Hank Aaron . If particular defined themes are selected based on their relevance to the initial query terms at least some of the defined themes may not be based on at least one of the initially specified query terms such as to indicate a defined theme based on terms such as Bonds home run Hank Aaron but without steroids and another defined theme similar to that of query . Similarly in situations in which the user selects additional query terms to use as part of an expanded query the user may further remove one or more of the prior query terms if so desired such as to remove the term steroids in the example of or to indicate that such a term should be excluded as previously discussed. The determined term relevance and document relevance information may be similarly used in a variety of other manners in other embodiments.

As another illustrative example techniques similar to those described above for query term expansion or other modification may also be used in situations in which an initially specified query term is misspelled or otherwise in a non standard or atypical form e.g. based on being in singular or plural form based on a verb being in a particular tense based on being in a different language etc. . Thus for example if the query terms of were instead bonds and staroids e.g. based on a user entering those terms but introducing uncertainty by misspelling steroids as staroids and by not capitalizing Bonds the candidate other terms may be expanded or otherwise modified to include additional terms related to addressing the uncertainty in the user specified terms. With respect to staroids for example one of the most relevant additional terms may be the term steroids such as for use instead of or in addition to staroids. The additional term steroids may in some embodiments be identified based solely on a dictionary lookup for the unrecognized word staroids e.g. optionally along with other suggested replacement terms such as asteroids toroids etc. although in other embodiments the previously discussed inter term relevance techniques may be used to identify steroids as a possible or likely candidate for a replacement or supplementary term based on a previously identified relationship between the terms staroids and steroids e.g. if staroids is a common misspelling of steroids by users and or based on a previously identified relationship between the terms bonds and steroids. In a similar manner in an effort to disambiguate the term bonds the additional terms may include choices such as Barry Bonds stocks interest rates Bobby Bonds etc. such as based on previously identified relationships between the term bonds and the other additional terms.

As previously noted in some embodiments an initial determination of the relevance of particular terms to particular documents and or to particular other terms may be made based at least in part on using TF IDF values or other information related to term frequency. In other embodiments determinations of such relevance information may be made in other manners. As one example the relevance of a particular term to one or more documents may be represented as a probability distribution or other distribution and the respective distributions for two or more such terms may be compared to determine how similar those distributions are as a measure of how related the respective terms are. Similarly particular documents may each be represented as a distribution across multiple terms and the respective distributions for two or more such documents may similarly be compared to determine how similar those documents are. Thus for example a search query with one or more terms and a document may be represented as a pair of probability distributions over desired and contained document terms with a comparison of such probability distributions being performed for some or all documents in the corpus so that the document having the most statistical information related to the query may be determined. As one example of performing such a comparison between two distributions the Kullback Leibler divergence statistical measure may be calculated to provide a convex measure of the similarity between two such distributions while in other embodiments differences in statistical information entropy may be used to compare two such distributions. Additional details regarding performing examples of such comparisons are included below and it will be appreciated that such comparisons may be performed in other manners in other embodiments.

In particular the Kullback Leibler divergence between two document related or term related distributions may be utilized to determine the similarity between the two distributions in some embodiments. The Kullback Leibler divergence for two distributions P and Q may be expressed as follows 

In addition as previously discussed illustrate examples of determining document related relevance information and inter term theme related relevance information for a particular example group of documents and using that relevance information in various manners. As discussed elsewhere in some embodiments at least some of the determined relevance related information may be represented in various particular manners and may be updated to reflect user feedback and other changes. illustrate particular examples of representing and revising determined document relevance information and term related relevance information in various ways and in particular in these examples by generating and updating neural networks that represent determined relevance related information.

In particular illustrates an example neural network that represents the relevance of particular documents to particular terms. In this example the neural network includes various input nodes that correspond to terms identified for the corpus of documents various output nodes that represent documents in the corpus and one or more layers of interior nodes that represent calculations performed to generate document relevance numbers for particular output documents based on particular input terms . While only a single set of interior nodes are illustrated in for the sake of simplicity it will be appreciated that some such neural networks may have additional interior nodes. In addition the links between nodes represent relationships between those nodes and may include associated weights as discussed below.

As previously discussed with respect to a search query was specified that included two query terms those being Bonds and steroids . Nodes and in represent those terms in the generated neural network and are illustrated in bold for the sake of recognition. In addition in the example of normalized document relevance numbers were determined for various documents in the corpus including example documents 1 4 and those example documents 1 4 have corresponding nodes in this example. In addition information is illustrated in this example to show the normalized document relevance numbers for those example documents 1 4 based on the two query terms for this example referred to as AC for shorthand to reflect the associated interior nodes and that correspond to the nodes and for those terms. Thus for example the illustrated normalized document relevance value for document 1 based on the query terms is a value of 0.48 as previously shown in column for entry of . Similar information is illustrated for example documents 2 4.

In this example the calculation of the document relevance numbers for the output documents in the generated neural network is separated into two parts that correspond to the links between the input terms and the interior nodes and the links between the interior nodes and the output documents . In addition information and is illustrated to reflect information about the various links that are shown including by indicating an initial weight that is associated with each link based on the initial determined document relevance information. For example with respect to the link between interior node A and output node corresponding to example document 1 referred to in shorthand as link A D1 in the information that link is initially given a weight of 0.000518 or 5.18 10 as shown in information . Similarly with respect to the link between interior node C and output node referred to in shorthand as link C D1 in the information that link is initially given a weight of 0.000053 in information . In addition the links between input nodes and and interior nodes and respectively may be used to determine values of 1 641 and 2 075 respectively based on the example term relevance information described in and as described in greater detail below. Thus the normalized document relevance value for example document 1 based on the query terms and may be determined from the neural network based on those two links A D1 and C D1 as well as on the interior nodes and and on the links between the input node and interior node and between the input node and interior node e.g. by calculating 1641 0.000518 0.85 as the document relevance number for term Bonds by calculating 2075 0.000053 0.11 as the document relevance number for term steroids and with their average being 0.48 as illustrated in information of . Additional details regarding one example embodiment of generating such a neural network follows including with respect to equations 1 5 below.

In particular once the relevance of particular terms to particular documents has been determined e.g. as reflected in the DR scores for the combination of those documents and those terms that information may be represented in various ways including using a neural network that may be updated based on user feedback and in other manners. Similarly once the relevance of inter term relationships from particular terms to other groups of one or more terms has been determined e.g. such as based in part on relevant documents for some or all of those terms that information may also be represented and updated in various ways including using a similar neural network that may be updated based on user feedback and in other manners. The weights and or other aspects of such neural networks e.g. particular links may be then modified to reflect feedback and other additional information that is obtained over time such as to improve the relevance information provided by the neural network over time to reflect automated learning from the feedback and other additional information that may be obtained. The following illustrates one particular example of generating such neural networks and of updating weights in such neural networks and other embodiments may use other related techniques.

As previously noted the DR score also referred to below as a HDR score for a document d relative to a group g of one or more specified terms i may be determined as follows in at least some embodiments.

This DR formula may similarly be used to represent a set of neural network weights representing a linear combination plus biases of TF.IDF values for individual terms i in a query having a group g of one or more such terms i corresponding to a particular document j as follows.

Furthermore using the definition of TF.IDF where xis the Term Frequency of term i in document j a TF.IDF value may be represented as follows 

For a query having a group g of one or more terms t the term frequencies in the document may be viewed as the weights of those terms in a projection into each document and then for a given query a set of weights U xand coefficients may be defined such that a relevance Neural Network may generally be expressed as follows 

Furthermore as previously noted such a generated neural network may be updated to reflect feedback and other information that indicates additional relevance related information for the domain. For example a quadratic error function may be used over a set of training examples t h as follows 

Back propagation rules for updating the network weights by stochastic gradient descent may then be derived. Accordingly the derivatives of E with respect to the weights of the model may be calculated as follows 

Training cases may be developed in various manners in various embodiments including by using user selection of a given document to set a target value of hequal to or some percentage greater than the value for the current most relevant document.

When a generated neural network is expanded to reflect relationships between terms such as may be useful for disambiguating between multiple overlapping or otherwise related themes learning may be performed in various manners in various embodiments. The example neural network of illustrates such an expanded neural network in which new term based output nodes are illustrated with new links between the document based nodes and the new term based output nodes . For example in such situations it is possible to choose either to keep the term frequency weights V fixed or instead to adapt both weights U and V via back propagation. As previously noted the weights U correspond generally to the links between interior nodes and document nodes with exemplary weights illustrated in and the weights V correspond generally to the links between document nodes and term based output nodes with exemplary weights illustrated in .

In such a situation one further feed forward step is used for the links between the document based nodes and new term based output nodes for the purpose of disambiguation d as follows 

In the situation in which weights V are fixed the weights V may be inverted and applied to the new d to obtain appropriate feedback values of h. Alternatively weights U and V and and may be modified with an updated error function E as follows 

In addition the range of learned parameters may be constrained by implementing a weight decay regularization in at least some embodiments. As such this results in adding quadratic terms to E and Ein U V and . The derivatives on the different weights therefore result in linear terms in the gradients of E and Ein the weights causing gradient descent to effect and exponential decay in them in the absence of an error signal based on difference to the target values of h or d. Thus for w any network weight U V and an additional term

While particular details have been described with respect to embodiments for generating and updating such neural networks it will be appreciated that other neural networks may be generated and or updated in other manners in other embodiments.

Returning to the examples previously described with respect to continues those examples and in particular illustrates changes that may occur for the neural network of over time based on feedback related to use of the determined relevance information for the corpus. In particular a modified neural network is illustrated in in which modifications have been made to the normalized document relevance value of example document 1 for the query terms and . Such changes may be based on for example repeated selection by users of example document 1 for review or other use after query terms and have been specified such as to reflect implicit user feedback that example document 1 is the most relevant document that corresponds to those specified terms or instead explicit feedback from users that indicates such relevance of example document 1. Accordingly in this example the document relevance number for example document 1 has been modified so that document 1 is the most relevant of all the example documents based on the user feedback such as in this example by modifying the normalized document relevance number to be equal to or above the most relevant other document by a specified margin e.g. by 0.01 in this example . In addition to reflect the higher normalized document relevance number the value of links A D1 and C D1 have been modified as shown in modified information . In this example the modified link weights and document relevance number are shown in bold for the sake of convenience as well as the visual representations of the links A D1 and C D1. It will be appreciated that the modifications to the weights for links A D1 and C D1 to reflect the increased document relevance value may be distributed between those links in various ways such as by increasing the link weights equally or proportionally to correspond to the increased document relevance number. Alternatively in other embodiments the learning may cause particular link weights to be updated and updated document relevance numbers may instead be generated to correspond to those updated link weights.

In addition while not illustrated in in some embodiments the modification of the document relevance score for example document 1 and or the modification of the link weights for links A D1 and C D1 may further cause modifications to other generated document relevance numbers and or link weights. For example when the relevance of example document 1 is increased for the specified terms and the relevance of other example documents 2 4 may be lowered with respect to those specified terms and to reflect a lower relative relevance value. If so the determined document relevance numbers may be lowered in various manners e.g. proportionally and corresponding link weights for the links between interior nodes and and those other example documents 2 4 may be lowered. Such other information that may be lowered in this example is shown in italics for the sake of convenience although the example values have not been adjusted in . In addition it will be appreciated that in some situations a particular term may be determined to have no relevance to a particular example document such as with respect to the term indictment as represented in input node and the example document 1 as reflected in the value in row for that term and document in . If so the link between the interior node and the node corresponding to the example document 1 may not be present or instead may be present but with a weight value of 0. In this example the links that have 0 value weights and may not be present are shown using dashed lines. It will be appreciated however that a particular link such as E D1 may initially be determined to have a weight of 0 and no relevance to a particular document such as example document 1 but learning and other modifications over time to the determined relevance information for the domain may indicate that some relevance does exist between that term and that document and if so the corresponding link and associated weight in the modified neural network may be modified to reflect that modified determined relevance.

In addition while not illustrated here in some embodiments neural networks such as and of may be modified in other manners after they are created. For example if additional documents for the corpus become available after a neural network for the corpus has been generated and or updated in some embodiments the additional documents may be incorporated into the existing neural network in various manners without re generating the entire neural network. As one example new output nodes may be created for such new documents and new links may be generated between the interior nodes and output document nodes . Furthermore the weights to be assigned to the new links may be determined in various manners such as by initializing those weights based on initial determined relevance values for existing terms to the new documents by taking an average of corresponding link weights that are already in the neural network or otherwise generating the new link weights based on some or all of the existing link weights by determining the most similar other existing documents e.g. by assessing document similarity using the Kullback Leibler divergence statistical measure as previously discussed or instead in another manner and initializing link weights and or document relevance values for the new documents based on the most similar other existing documents e.g. to take the average of the corresponding values for the most similar other existing documents etc.

The initial state of this example neural network corresponds to the example of in which the relevance of other terms is determined based on the example initial query terms . Thus for example the displayed information in includes indications of determined relevance of particular other output terms based on the input terms and shown in bold for the sake of convenience such as the term relevance number for output term for term Hank Aaron that corresponds to information for entry in . Term relevance numbers and similarly indicate term relevance numbers determined for output terms home run and indictment based on the input terms and

In a manner similar to that of illustrates a modified neural network that shows changes to the neural network of corresponding to learned changes in the relevance of particular output terms to particular input terms. In this example the input terms of current interest continue to be the query terms corresponding to input nodes and and the determined relevance of output terms Hank Aaron and home run has been modified to reflect a learned increase in the relevance of those output terms with respect to those input terms. For example as illustrated in a number of users may have selected the additional terms Hank Aaron and home run for use in expanded queries with the terms Bonds and steroids as was previously discussed with respect to the example of . In this example revised term relevance numbers and have been selected for output nodes and respectively which in this example correspond to a 50 increase in the relevance numbers for these two output terms based on the two input terms. In addition the corresponding link weights have been modified accordingly which in this example correspond to the links from each of the subset of documents that were determined to be most relevant to the input terms and which in this example include example documents 1 4 as described in to the affected output term nodes and . The term relevance numbers and links that have been modified in this example are shown in bold for the sake of convenience.

In addition in some embodiments the weights associated with some of the links may similarly be modified either instead of or in addition to the modifications to the links such as to increase the weights for the links between the interior nodes and and one or more of the example documents 1 4 to accommodate some or all of the increased relevance of the output terms and for the input terms and . In addition it will be noted that the weights of links D3 B and D4 B have been increased from having 0 values in to having small associated weights in this example although in other embodiments such weights with 0 values may not be increased.

In particular in the example of the GUI includes a pane that is displayed to User X not shown which includes information about various known and inferred term preferences for various categories or domains . In this illustrated example a user selectable tab corresponding to User X s positive preferences is currently selected such that the information in the lower section of pane currently includes information about such positive preferences. If the user selectable tab is instead selected the information in the lower section will be updated to show information about User X s known and inferred negative preferences. In addition one or more of the categories domains may be selected for expansion in the lower section so as to show the known and preferred preferences for User X for that category domain such as is currently shown with respect to the Sports category domain . In particular in this example four known and inferred positive term preferences are shown for the Sports category domain including known preferences for terms Hank Aaron home run and San Francisco 49ers respectively and inferred suggested preference for terms Bonds shown in this example in a shaded or otherwise highlighted fashion such as with a different color in a GUI that uses multiple colors to indicate to User X that it is a suggested preference . In addition in this example User X may specify other preferences using user selectable text input control and selection control or otherwise modify and manipulate preferences using user selectable controls and . It will be appreciated that other GUIs may display the same or other information in a wide variety of manners and using a wide variety of user interface controls and manipulation techniques. As one example User X may be provided with a mechanism to select or otherwise indicate whether the suggested term preference for term Bonds is an actual positive or negative preference or to otherwise remove the suggested term preference from the current view. Furthermore some embodiments and situations may involve GUI screens of differing size that display varying amounts of information such as to display many more term preferences whether known and or inferred suggestions at a single time.

In addition in the example of additional information is illustrated to correspond to another service in this example an online service with information about movies using a hypothetical American Movie Info.com Web domain that interacts with the DSRD service to exchange information about known and inferred term preferences of User X. In some embodiments the information may be illustrated as an additional pane of the GUI of the DSRD service such as simultaneously or serially with the pane . In other embodiments the information may instead by displayed or otherwise presented to User X by the other service in a manner independent of the GUI or instead some or all of the additional information may be displayed to User X as part of pane e.g. by expanding category domain of pane such as to illustrate information provided to the DSRD service by the other movie related service. Furthermore in some embodiments and situations multiple such other services may be available and affiliated with the DSRD service and if so may be selected using the user selectable dropdown control selection controls or in other manners.

In this example the additional information illustrates a known preference of User X for the movie Raging Bull e.g. based on information that is previously or dynamically supplied to the other service by the DSRD service based on information that the other service previously obtained from User X or other sources etc. and illustrates three inferred suggested preferences for User X based on the known preference and other preference information available from the DSRD service. For example provides additional exemplary details regarding how movie related preferences may be determined based at least in part on such preference information for User X. Thus in this manner a service that provides a GUI such as GUI may provide and obtain preference related information for various users and may use such information to provide various benefits to the users and to the service. In a manner similar to that of pane it will be appreciated that other GUIs may display the same or other information such as that of information in a wide variety of manners and using a wide variety of user interface controls and manipulation techniques including with varying amounts of information.

It will also be appreciated that the various weights relevance numbers and other information illustrated for the example neural networks are provided for the sake of illustration and may have other forms and may be modified in other manners in other embodiments. In addition the information illustrated in the examples of has been provided for illustrative purposes only and it will be appreciated that various of the activities described may be performed in other manners in other embodiments. In addition various other details have been shown in an abstract manner or not illustrated for the sake of understanding. Furthermore various other types of functionality may be provided and used by a DSRD service in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. It will also be appreciated that while a small number of terms documents and neural network nodes are illustrated in actual embodiments the actual quantities may be much larger such as to include hundreds of thousands of terms and millions of documents with corresponding numbers of neural network nodes.

While the examples of are based on analyzing terms that are present in textual documents or other content items it will be appreciated that the described techniques may be used in other manners and with other types of content. In particular a corpus of content items with other types of content may be analyzed in order to identify any other type of recognizable feature or property or other attribute that is part of the contents of those content items or that is otherwise associated with those content items and the relevance of particular attributes to content and or to other such attributes may be determined in manners similar to those discussed for textual terms. A non exclusive list of such content item attributes includes the following a type of a content item e.g. an audio stream or file a video stream or file an image etc. a source of a content item a particular object in image or video content a particular pattern of information in a stream or file content item a particular type of metadata associated with a content item etc. Such attributes may each be treated as a term such as to provide search results that are relevant to specified attributes and or to define themes or other groups of one or more related attributes.

In addition while the examples of use neural networks and back propagation learning to improve determined relevance information over time in other embodiments other types of machine learning techniques or adaptive systems may instead be used. As one example in some other embodiments the initial determined relevance information may be represented using a probabilistic Bayesian neural network that has a similar structure to that discussed in the examples of but with the node values representing conditional probabilities based on corresponding input values from preceding linked nodes in the network with probabilistic belief propagation used to determine particular relevance values and with learning involving updating conditional probability values to correspond to feedback over time.

In addition while examples are previously discussed with respect to a user specifying query terms or preference information other types of information may be used in various manners in various embodiments. For example a group of information that is specific to a user may be automatically analyzed and used to determine preference information for that user which may then be used to automatically determine other content that is relevant to that preference information. Non exclusive examples of such user specific information that may be analyzed include groups of email and other communications e.g. all email that a user has sent and or received for a specified period of time some or all entries in a user s blog or other set of records etc. logs or histories of user actions of various types e.g. histories of searches that are performed and or interactions with resulting search results information about a user s social networks and other relationships etc. Alternatively one or more such groups of user specific information may instead in some embodiments be treated as a corpus of documents that may be of interest to that user and or to others such as automatically determine themes of interest to the user based on an analysis of such user specific information and or to allow retrieval of particular pieces of such user specific information that is relevant to current interests of the user.

For example a user may be accessing a document and the context of information from that document may be used to identify other relevant content items e.g. from that user s computing system from the Internet or other external network or data store etc. . As one specific illustrative example a user John Doe may be editing his her resume and may desire to obtain relevant work history data or other related data from the user s email store and the Web. The email store may for example have emails related to past work done by the user for Company 1 and Company 2 with the headers of those emails including the respective company names. A data store for the user whether local or remote may also contain one or more past resumes of the user or resume examples and a work related social networking site may have a history of the user s past employment. In such a situation the context that the particular user has the resume open may be used to automatically expand or supplement a search that the user specifies with the query term Doe such as to add one or more of the additional query terms John Company 1 Company 2 resume job title or description information from the resume geographical location information for the user from the resume or from other stored profile or preference information for the user etc. The expanded search may then identify various types of relevant documents or other information such as the emails related to past work done by the user for Company 1 and Company 2 other stored documents related to Company 1 and Company 2 the past resumes or resume examples the employment history information from the work related social networking site etc.

Additional details related to examples of determination of relevant information related to domains of interest and to possible use of such determined relevant information are available in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 334 389 filed Dec. 12 2008 and entitled Electronic Profile Development Storage Use and Systems Therefor in U.S. patent application Ser.

Furthermore as described in greater detail elsewhere the described techniques may be used in situations other than identifying or retrieving relevant content items. For example an automated analysis of a first group of content items may be used to identify themes that correspond to types or categories of data in the content items of the first group e.g. based on the data having matching or similar patterns and those identified themes may be used to categorize or otherwise determine a type of another data item that is used as a query term. As one illustrative example various types of encrypted data may be analyzed such that themes are identified that correspond to types of encryption schemes. If an encrypted file or other piece of encrypted data is later supplied or otherwise specified the DSRD service may automatically be used to identify one or more of the most likely encryption schemes used to encrypt that specified data piece. More generally the identified themes from a first group of content items may be types of valid solutions that are relevant to a subject area so that later queries may pose some type of mathematical or other problem for which one or more corresponding identified themes are automatically determined as possible solutions. It will be appreciated that the described techniques may similarly be used in a variety of other manners.

The DSRD system may include software instructions executable in memory by the CPU such as to provide an embodiment of the DSRD service. In particular the DSRD system interacts with some or all of computing systems and over the network e.g. via the Internet and or the World Wide Web via a private cellular network etc. to obtain information and requests and to provide information in response. For example the DSRD system in this example receives requests from various users not shown who are interacting with user computing systems such as requests to provide requested search results and or information about determined themes or other inter term relationships for a domain and responds accordingly. In some embodiments the DSRD system may further receive requests for user specific recommendations on behalf of particular users whether from the users directly or from another system on behalf of the users and provide corresponding user specific recommendations that are based at least in part on domain specific determined relevance information while in other embodiments one or more other systems and or may instead use domain specific determined relevance information provided by the DSRD system to generate and provide such user specific recommendations. In addition one or more of the user computing systems may interact with DSRD system to perform various other types of actions such as to provide various types of feedback regarding user actions as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. The other computing systems may be executing various software as part of interactions with the DSRD system . For example user computing systems may each be executing a Web browser or other software in memory to interact with DSRD system such as to interact with a Web based GUI of the DSRD service provided by the DSRD system .

In order to determine domain specific relevance information the DSRD system obtains domain specific documents or other content from one or more sources and analyzes that information to automatically determine the domain specific relevance information. The sources of the domain specific content may vary in various embodiments such as to optionally include domain related information on local storage optional domain information on other remote computing systems information supplied for analysis by one or more users from user computing systems and or from optional other systems on other computing systems etc. The optional other systems on other computing systems and or the optional other systems executing in memory may have various forms in various embodiments such as affiliated services that obtain determined relevance information from the DSRD system and use that obtained information in various ways e.g. to interact with users of the user computing systems and or content provision services that provide content to the DSRD system for analysis. For example a particular optional other system may maintain and provide domain information to the DSRD system for analysis and obtain and use resulting determined relevance information from the DSRD system but with at least some of the information that is used by the DSRD system in the determination of the relevance information e.g. textual analysis information generated neural networks etc. being stored on the computing system and not provided to the other system . Alternatively in other embodiments the DSRD system may generate and use determined relevance information for one or more domains without interacting with any such optional other services. Furthermore one or more optional other third parties may use one or more of the other computing systems and interact with the DSRD service in various other manners.

Various information related to the operation of the DSRD system may be stored in storage or elsewhere e.g. remotely on one or more other computing systems such as information related to one or more domains of interest e.g. domain specific content to be analyzed or that has already been analyzed information related to the results of the analysis of domain specific content e.g. domain specific relevance information such as generated neural network data structures Bayesian network data structures that include probabilistic representations of inter term relationships generated decision tree data structures that represent subsets of probabilistic representation information etc. determined scores and other information related to particular terms and themes and documents etc. information to reflect information about users interactions with various domain specific information and other feedback information and various user information e.g. preferences for or other interests in particular terms or more generally preferences related to communication or interaction mechanisms . In other embodiments some or all of the information used by or generated by the DSRD system may be stored in other manners including on other computing systems or on other storage nodes systems not shown . The DSRD system may obtain the feedback information in various manners such as by generating the information based on interactions of the DSRD system with users e.g. when providing them with determined relevance information from optional other systems and or that interact with users and that provide those users with determined relevance information from the DSRD system by one or more systems interacting with users for the purpose of generating feedback information etc.

It will be appreciated that computing systems and are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The computing systems may instead each include multiple interacting computing systems or devices and the computing systems may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated including through one or more networks such as the Internet via the Web or via private networks e.g. mobile communication networks etc. . More generally a computing system may comprise any combination of hardware or software that may interact and perform the described types of functionality including without limitation desktop or other computers database servers network storage devices and other network devices PDAs cellphones and wireless phones and other phone systems pagers electronic organizers Internet appliances television based systems e.g. using set top boxes and or personal digital video recorders broadcast systems and various other consumer products that include appropriate communication capabilities using any appropriate communication protocol. In addition the functionality provided by the illustrated DSRD system may in some embodiments be distributed in various modules as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Similarly in some embodiments some of the functionality of the DSRD system may not be provided and or other additional functionality may be available.

It will also be appreciated that while various items are illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them may be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the software modules and or systems may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing systems via inter computer communication. Furthermore in some embodiments some or all of the systems and or modules may be implemented or provided in other manners such as at least partially in firmware and or hardware including but not limited to one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs standard integrated circuits controllers e.g. by executing appropriate instructions and including microcontrollers and or embedded controllers field programmable gate arrays FPGAs complex programmable logic devices CPLDs etc. as well as devices that employ RFID technology. Some or all of the modules systems and data structures may also be stored e.g. as software instructions or structured data on a computer readable medium such as a hard disk a memory a network or a portable media article to be read by an appropriate drive or via an appropriate connection including as encoded in one or more barcodes or other related codes stored on one or more such computer readable mediums and being readable by an appropriate reader device. The systems modules and data structures may also be transmitted as generated data signals e.g. as part of a carrier wave on a variety of computer readable transmission mediums including wireless based and wired cable based mediums and may take a variety of forms or more generally may be mediated on any computer readable medium. Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at block where an indication of a request or other information is received. The routine continues to block to determine whether a request is received to determine relevance related information for an indicated domain or if domain specific content to be analyzed has been provided and if so continues to block . In blocks the routine then analyzes domain specific information in order to determine relevance related information for the domain and stores that information for later use. In addition while blocks are illustrated as performing an initial determination of relevance related information for a domain of interest in at least some embodiments some or all of blocks may similarly be performed to modify previously determined relevance information such as to revise the previously determined relevance information based on user feedback and or to expand the previously determined relevance information based on newly available domain specific content.

In particular the routine in block obtains documents or other domain specific information for the domain to be analyzed such as based on documents currently received in block documents previously received and stored for later use documents retrieved from an external location indicated in the request received in block etc. After block the routine continues to block to perform a Domain Analysis Manager routine to analyze term information for the available domain specific content with one example of such a routine being illustrated with respect to . After block the routine continues to block to perform an Inter Term Relevance Determination Manager routine to determine relevant inter term relationships e.g. theme related information for the domain e.g. based on data generated by block with one example of such a routine being illustrated with respect to . After block the routine continues to block to perform a Relevant Document Determination Manager routine to determine particular documents of the domain that are relevant to particular terms and themes e.g. based on data generated by block with one example of such a routine being illustrated with respect to . After block the routine continues to block to perform a Term Relationship Recommendation Generation Manager routine to generate probabilistic representations of relationships between particular terms for the domain s e.g. based on data generated by blocks and or for later use in generating user specific recommendations based at least in part on such inter term relationships with one example of such a routine being illustrated with respect to . After block the routine continues to block to optionally perform a routine or otherwise operate to identify content items that are relevant to particular terms of interest related to the domain being analyzed e.g. additional term content items that are identified as being of particular interest for other indicated terms such as based on the output of the Term Relationship Recommendation Generation Manager routine of block such as may be performed by the optional module discussed with respect to e.g. for later use in generating user specific recommendations based at least in part on such indicated terms and or additional terms although in some embodiments such content item identification is not performed at this time or at all. After block the routine continues to block to store the determined relevance information from blocks and or to optionally provide some or all of that determined relevance information to the requester such as if the information was determined dynamically in response to a request or is being supplied to accommodate a previous request. The determined relevance information from blocks may be stored in various manners including in volatile memory and or non volatile storage and as discussed in greater detail elsewhere may be stored in various forms e.g. neural networks Bayesian networks decision trees etc. .

If it is instead determined in block that another type of request or information is received the routine continues instead to block to determine whether a request has been received to provide determined relevance information for an indicated domain. Such determined relevance information may be provided for various reasons and at various times such as in response to a search request or as part of assisting a user in specifying information regarding one or more themes of interest as well as in various manners e.g. as part of a Web page or other information screen provided to a user for display or other presentation on a client device of the user to another service in response to a request for information to be used by that service etc. . If it is determined in block that a request has been received to provide determined relevance information for an indicated domain the routine continues to block to determine whether the requested relevance information has already been determined and stored for later use in blocks or if some or all of the requested relevance information is to be dynamically generated. In other embodiments such a determination may not be made such as if relevance information provided in response to such requests is always previously determined and stored or is always dynamically determined or if the request specifies whether to provide stored or dynamically determined information. In the illustrated embodiment if it is determined in block to use stored relevance information the routine continues to block to obtain the requested relevance information from information that was previously determined and stored.

In addition the actions of block may be performed in various manners in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments at least some types of determined relevance information may be available to only a subset of users or other entities who are authorized to receive the information and if so the actions for one or more of blocks may further include determining whether the requester is authorized to receive the requested information e.g. has provided an appropriate fee for paid access to the information has a particular identity that is verified as being authorized to receive confidential requested information etc. . In addition requests may be received and information may be provided in various manners including in electronic messages or via programmatic interactions using one or more APIs provided by the DSRD service such as by an affiliated service. Alternatively a Web based request may be received from a user e.g. based a Web based information search GUI or other GUI provided by the DSRD service or other affiliated service and the requested information may be supplied to the user as part of one or more generated Web pages that are sent in response to the request.

If it is instead determined in block to dynamically obtain at least some of the requested relevance information the routine continues instead to block to perform the dynamic obtaining of the information. In particular as is illustrated in the example routine the performance of block may include executing one or more of the other routines corresponding to blocks as well as optional block if present and obtaining resulting information from the routines. In addition while not illustrated here in some embodiments the performance of block may further include obtaining documents or other content to be analyzed such as by initiating performance of block as well or instead such content to be used may be received in block and provided to one or more of the routines corresponding to blocks and or optional block as part of the performance of block . After blocks or the routine continues to block to provide the obtained information to the user or other requester which may be performed in various manners in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Furthermore it will be appreciated that the performance of block may involve multiple interactions with the user or other requester in at least some situations such as to initially provide some information and to later provide additional information or perform other interactions with the user or other requester based on actions taken by the user or other requester after the initial provision of information. After block the routine continues to block to optionally obtain or determine feedback from the use of the provided relevance information by the user or other requester and if so retains the feedback in the illustrated embodiment for later use in performing learning actions to improve previously determined relevance information in other embodiments the routine may instead immediately use any such obtained feedback in at least some situations such as to re perform the routines corresponding to one or more of blocks using the feedback information.

If it is instead determined in block that a request has not been received to provide determined relevance information for an indicated domain the routine continues instead to block to determine whether a request has been received from or on behalf of a user e.g. from another service that is interacting with the user that relates to providing user specific recommendations for the user based on determined relevance information for one or more indicated domains. If so the routine continues to block to perform a Term Relationship Recommendation Generation Manager routine to generate user specific recommendations for the user for the indicated domain s based on probabilistic representations of relationships between particular terms for the domain s such as probabilistic representations that were previously generated with respect to block or that are instead dynamically generated at a time of responding to the current request. In other embodiments another service may instead provide such user specific recommendations using probabilistic representation information generated by the DSRD Service such that the routine executed in block may merely generate the probabilistic representations of the inter term relationship information for later use and provide that generated information to the other service e.g. with respect to one or more of blocks etc. . After block the routine continues to block to provide the generated recommendation information to the requester.

If it is instead determined in block that a request has not been received to provide recommendations based on determined relevance information for an indicated domain the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example domain specific content may be received in block and stored for later analysis such as information for a new domain to be analyzed and or new or updated information for a domain for which relevance information was previously determined. Alternatively other types of information may be received and used in block such as feedback information related to the use of previously determined relevance information and may be used in various manners. For example if one or more predefined criteria are satisfied by the feedback received in block and or stored in block e.g. based on a minimum or maximum amount of feedback that is obtained a minimum or maximum amount of time since a previous determination of corresponding relevance information etc. an additional performance of the routines corresponding to one or more of blocks may be triggered using the feedback information in order to learn and update previously determined relevance information as described in greater detail elsewhere. In addition other types of requests may be received and processed in block such as requests to update previously determined relevance information e.g. based on subsequent feedback information subsequent additional domain specific content that is available etc. such as a request from a user or other entity with which the DSRD service interacts or from a human operator of the DSRD service. Similarly various administrative requests from a human operator of the DSRD service may be received and processed.

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins in block where an indication of documents to be analyzed for a domain or another request is received. The routine continues to block to determine whether documents to be analyzed were received. If so the routine continues to block to analyze each of the documents to determine terms that are present in the documents. In addition as discussed in greater detail elsewhere the determination of terms for a document may include a variety of types of term processing in various embodiments such as to normalize terms e.g. using term stemming to combine related terms to remove common terms e.g. the a an of and etc. or other indicated terms to aggregate multiple words together into single terms for purposes of the later analysis to generate an index of the terms in the document etc. After block the routine continues to block to perform a term frequency determination for the terms of each document and in block performs an inverse document frequency determination for each term across all of the documents. In block the routine then determines a TF IDF score for each term and document combination based on the information generated in blocks and . After block the routine continues to block to store the determined information for later use and to optionally provide the determined information as output e.g. as a response to a dynamic invocation of the routine for the determined information such as with respect to block of or for use by the Relevant Theme Determination Manager routine of and or the Relevant Document Determination Manager routine of such as corresponding to blocks and or of .

If it is instead determined in block that documents to be analyzed were not received the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example the other operations may include receiving and responding to requests for previously generated document term analysis information to requests to update previously determined document analysis information to reflect new domain specific content that is available to administrative requests from a human operator of the DSRD service etc. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere when updating previously determined document analysis information to reflect new domain specific documents that are available the routine may in some embodiments perform steps for those new documents while in other embodiments may analyze or otherwise incorporate such new documents in other manners e.g. by identifying one or more other previously analyzed documents to which a new document is most similar based on one or more similarity measures and by averaging or otherwise using analyzed relevance information for the other identified document s to represent the new document such as using determined TF IDF scores for terms in the other identified document s to represent the new document .

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends. It will be appreciated that various of the blocks of may be performed in various manners in various embodiments including by analyzing different documents in a serial or parallel manner e.g. in a distributed manner on multiple computing systems .

In addition in the illustrated embodiment the determination of inter term relationship relevance information for a domain in is illustrated as being performed separately from the determination of document related relevance information for the domain in although in other embodiments the determination of such types of relevance information may be performed in other manners. For example only one of inter term relationship relevance information and document related relevance information may be determined in a particular embodiment the determination of both inter term relationship related and document related relevance information for a domain may be performed together as part of a single routine information that is common to both types of determinations may be performed once and then shared between two distinct routines etc.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where document term analysis information for the documents of a domain is received e.g. as output of routine of as information supplied as part of a dynamic determination request etc. or another request is received. The routine continues to block to determine if document term analysis information is received and if so continues to block . In the illustrated embodiment blocks are performed to determine theme related information for each group of one or more terms of the domain that are of interest. Terms to be analyzed may be selected by for example using each term present in any of the documents optionally excluding common terms and or other indicated terms . Alternatively the groups of terms to be analyzed may include for example each combination of two terms or of another indicated quantity of terms that are present in the documents of the domain each combination of two terms or of another indicated quantity of terms that are determined to be sufficiently potentially related to each other e.g. above a specified threshold etc. In addition the blocks may be performed repeatedly to evaluate and revise information about the inter relatedness of multiple terms such as to initially perform the blocks for each term individually to next perform the determination for at least some combinations of two terms e.g. based on information available from the performance of the blocks for those terms individually to next perform the determination for at least some combinations of three terms e.g. based on information available from the performance of the blocks for particular terms that are sufficiently related to previously selected combinations of two terms etc. Alternatively in some embodiments some or all of the blocks may instead be performed in a parallel manner e.g. in a distributed manner on multiple computing systems for some or all groups of one or more terms to be considered.

In particular in the illustrated embodiment the routine in block selects the next group of one or more terms to be considered beginning with the first such group and in block similarly selects the next document of the domain to be considered beginning with the first document. In block the routine then determines the normalized average relevance of the selected term s to the selected document such as based on averaging or otherwise aggregating normalized TF IDF scores for each selected term for the selected document. In block the routine then determines whether there are more documents to be analyzed and if so returns to block . Otherwise the routine continues to block to determine the most relevant documents for the currently selected term s based on the relevant scores determined in block . Next in block the routine identifies one or more of the determined most relevant documents and uses the identified documents to determine other terms that are potentially most relevant to the selected term s such as based on the term frequency of those other terms in the identified document s or other indication of the relevance of those other terms to the identified document s .

In addition in some embodiments the other terms that are determined to be most relevant to the selected term s may optionally be combined with the one or more of the selected term s for possible use as a theme and or for possible later analysis with respect to blocks for the combined group of those terms such as to optionally find additional other terms that may be related to that combined group of terms. Such an ongoing analysis of possible relationships of additional other terms to currently selected terms may be performed in various manners such as by individually combining the group of selected terms with each of the most relevant other terms with all of the most relevant other terms with some or all sub combinations of the most relevant other terms etc. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the most relevant other terms may be combined with some or all of the selected terms to identify possible themes in other manners and or later feedback from the use of terms together by users may be used to refine which groups of terms are related together as themes for the domain.

After block the routine continues to block to determine if there are more groups of one or more terms to consider and if so returns to block . Otherwise the routine continues to block to in the illustrated embodiment generate a neural network to reflect the relevance of terms in the domain to other terms in the domain such as based in part on the information generated with respect to blocks and . As discussed with respect to block such a generated neural network may also later be updated based on feedback to refine the determination of the inter relatedness of particular terms for the domain such as for some or all of the input terms and or output terms in a parallel manner. After block the routine continues to block to store the determined relevant theme related information and the generated neural network and optionally provides some or all of the determined information as output if appropriate e.g. as a response to a request to dynamically generate that information .

If it is instead determined in block that document term analysis information is not received the routine continues instead to block to determine if feedback information is received or determinable such as based on use of previously determined and provided relevance information. If so the routine continues to block to use the feedback information to update a previously generated neural network that corresponds to the feedback as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. The performance of block further stores the updated neural network information and optionally provides the updated information to a requester as output of the routine. If it is instead determined in block that feedback information is not received the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example such other indicated operations may include receiving a request to supply previously determined theme related information for a domain e.g. the theme related information from a current version of a particular previously generated neural network for the domain such as after the neural network has been updated receiving user feedback information to later use in refining determined theme related information for the domain e.g. particular groups of terms that are selected together to represent a theme receiving a request from a user or other entity or other human operator to perform an update to previously determined theme related information e.g. based on user feedback and or additional domain specific content that is available for the domain receiving other administrative requests from a human operator of the DSRD service etc. Feedback information that is received for later use may be handled in various manners. For example if one or more predefined criteria are satisfied by the feedback e.g. based on a minimum or maximum amount of feedback that is obtained a minimum or maximum amount of time since a previous determination of corresponding relevance information etc. the performance of block may trigger a subsequent performance of the routine in which that feedback information is supplied for use in block .

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where document term analysis information for the documents of a domain is received e.g. as output of routine of as information supplied as part of a dynamic determination request etc. or another request is received. The routine continues to block to determine if document term analysis information is received and if so continues to block . In the illustrated embodiment blocks are performed to determine document related information for each group of one or more terms of the domain that are of interest such as in a manner similar to blocks of . Terms to be analyzed may be selected by for example using each term present in any of the documents optionally excluding common terms and or other indicated terms or in other manners as described in greater detail with respect to .

In particular in the illustrated embodiment the routine in block selects the next group of one or more terms to be considered beginning with the first such group and in block similarly selects the next document of the domain to be considered beginning with the first document. In block the routine then determines the normalized average relevance of the selected term s to the selected document such as based on averaging or otherwise aggregating normalized TF IDF scores for each selected term for the selected document. In block the routine then determines whether there are more documents to be analyzed and if so returns to block . Otherwise the routine continues to block to determine the most relevant documents for the currently selected term s based on the relevant scores determined in block . Next in block the routine determines if there are more groups of one or more terms to consider and if so returns to block . In a manner similar to that discussed with respect to the blocks may be performed repeatedly to evaluate and revise information about the relatedness of multiple terms and multiple documents such as to initially perform the blocks for each term individually to next perform the determination for at least some combinations of two terms e.g. based on information available from the performance of the blocks for those terms individually to next perform the determination for at least some combinations of three terms e.g. based on information available from the performance of the blocks for particular terms that are sufficiently related to previously selected combinations of two terms etc. Alternatively in some embodiments some or all of the blocks may instead be performed in a parallel manner e.g. in a distributed manner on multiple computing systems for some or all groups of one or more terms and or one or more documents to be considered.

Otherwise the routine continues to block to in the illustrated embodiment generate a neural network to reflect the relevance of terms in the domain to documents in the domain such as based in part on the information generated with respect to blocks and . As discussed with respect to block such a generated neural network may also later be updated based on feedback to refine the determination of the relatedness of particular terms for the domain to particular documents of the domain such as for some or all of the terms and or documents in a parallel manner. After block the routine continues to block to store the determined relevant document related information and the generated neural network and optionally provides some or all of the determined information as output if appropriate e.g. as a response to a request to dynamically generate that information .

If it is instead determined in block that document term analysis information is not received the routine continues instead to block to determine if feedback information is received or determinable such as based on use of previously determined and provided relevance information. If so the routine continues to block to use the feedback information to update a previously generated neural network that corresponds to the feedback as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. The performance of block further stores the updated neural network information and optionally provides the updated information to a requester as output of the routine. If it is instead determined in block that feedback information is not received the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example such other indicated operations may include receiving a request to supply previously determined document related information for a domain e.g. the document related information from a current version of a particular previously generated neural network for the domain such as after the neural network has been updated receiving user feedback information to later use in refining determined document related information for the domain e.g. particular documents that are selected for use corresponding to a specified theme or other group of terms receiving a request from a user or other entity or other human operator to perform an update to previously determined document related information e.g. based on user feedback and or additional domain specific content that is available for the domain receiving other administrative requests from a human operator of the DSRD service etc. Feedback information that is received for later use may be handled in various manners. For example if one or more predefined criteria are satisfied by the feedback e.g. based on a minimum or maximum amount of feedback that is obtained a minimum or maximum amount of time since a previous determination of corresponding relevance information etc. the performance of block may trigger a subsequent performance of the routine in which that feedback information is supplied for use in block .

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine generates Bayesian network probabilistic representation data structures and optionally corresponding decision trees based on inter term relationship information generated by another module e.g. by module of and as described with respect to such as based on document term analysis information for documents of a domain although in other embodiments may use other types of representations e.g. non probabilistic representations of inter term relationship data and or may determine inter term relationship information in manners other than based on analysis of domain documents. In addition in the illustrated embodiment routine performs both the generation of the probabilistic representations of the inter term relationship information and the subsequent use of that generated inter term relationship information probabilistic representation to provide user specific recommendations to users although in other embodiments such types of functionality may be separated into distinct routines whether both are performed by an embodiment of the DSRD service or one or both are performed by another service . While the illustrated embodiment of the routine describes the initial generation of inter term relationship information probabilistic representations for a domain but does not explicitly discuss updating such previously generated information to reflect subsequent feedback and or other information about inter term relationships for the domain other embodiments of the routine may perform such updating or instead any such updating may instead occur with respect to the underlying inter term relationship information that is used by the routine and the routine may generate new inter term relationship information probabilistic representations for a domain to reflect the updated underlying information. Furthermore in a manner similar to that of the other routines the routine may generate inter term relationship information probabilistic representations for a domain in advance of the use of that generated information as well as dynamically in response to a request for such information.

In addition in the illustrated embodiment the generation of the inter term relationship information probabilistic representations for a domain in is illustrated as being performed separately from the determination of underlying inter term relationship relevance information for a domain in although in other embodiments these activities may be performed in other manners. For example only one of the underlying inter term relationship relevance information and inter term relationship information probabilistic representations may be generated or otherwise determined in a particular embodiment the determination of both underlying inter term relationship related information and inter term relationship information probabilistic representations for a domain may be performed together as part of a single routine information that is common to both types of activities may be performed once and then shared between two distinct routines etc.

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where an indication is received to generate probabilistic representations of inter term relationships for one or more domains of interest or another request is received. In some embodiments the routine may receive input that includes information about underlying determined inter term relevance information e.g. when the routine is executed as part of block of to receive data as input that was generated by block information about particular term related preferences of a particular user for use in determining user specific recommendations based on related terms etc. The routine continues to block to determine if probabilistic representations of inter term relationships are to be generated e.g. based on an explicit request based on the receipt of underlying determined inter term relevance information etc. and if so continues to block . In the illustrated embodiment blocks are performed to generate inter term relationship probabilistic representation data for later use and blocks are performed to use previously generated probabilistic representations of inter term relationships to determine and provide user specific recommendations to users.

In particular with respect to block the routine obtains underlying determined relevance information about inter term relationships for the one or more domains of interest such as based on information received in block by retrieving stored information that was generated by routine and or by dynamically interacting with routine to obtain such information. The routine continues to block to analyze the underlying relevance information to determine significant inter term relationships that each include one or more first terms having an influence on one or more other second terms e.g. with the second terms being causally dependent or otherwise dependent on the first terms . The routine then continues in block to generate one or more directed graphs e.g. a DAG or directed acyclic graph in which the selected terms are represented with random variable nodes corresponding to a preference for or interest in that term within the domain s and in which the dependencies or other influences are represented with directed links or edges between those nodes. The routine then continues to block to determine probability information to use for the generated directed graph s including conditional probability tables for those nodes that are dependent on one or more other nodes and optionally prior probability values to represent uncertainty for those nodes that are not dependent on other nodes. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the determination of the inter term relationships to model in the directed graph s and the determination of the probability information for the graph nodes may be performed in various manners in various embodiments including based at least in part on the determined relevance information from the analysis of domain documents and or based on learning or other modifications that have been made based on user feedback. Furthermore if multiple directed graphs are created that are not inter dependent in some embodiments the multiple graphs will be combined into a single larger directed graph e.g. by modeling additional less relevant inter term relationships while in other embodiments the multiple directed graphs will instead be used to represent the domain s .

After block the routine continues to block to generate one or more Bayesian network probabilistic representations of the relevant inter term relationships for the domain s from the directed graph s and determined probability information. It will be appreciated that in at least some embodiments the generated Bayesian network may have tens of thousands or millions of nodes and corresponding numbers of inter node edges to represent a particular domain of interest. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the routine in block further generates one or more e.g. hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of decision trees that each represent a subset of the generated Bayesian networks such as to enable later run time processing that may be performed in a more rapid manner than use of the entire Bayesian network. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the generation of the Bayesian network s and decision tree s may be performed in various manners in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments after information about a user s term preferences and one or more target terms of interest are identified e.g. as discussed with respect to blocks a partial Bayesian network and or one or more partial decision tree s may be instantiated that correspond to a portion of the Bayesian network if any that connects the term preferences and target term s such as to further include evidence nodes or other evidence information about the term preferences and user specific term relevance information for the target term s . After block the routine continues to block to store the generated information for later use and optionally also provides some or all of the generated information as output e.g. if the generation of the information was performed in response to a request for particular generated information .

If it is instead determined in block that probabilistic representations of inter term relationships are not to be generated the routine continues instead to block to determine whether user specific recommendations are to be determined and provided e.g. based on an explicit request based on the receipt of specified term related preferences for a user etc. and if so continues to block . In block the routine obtains information about a target user s preferences for or other interest in one or more particular terms from one or more indicated domains such as may be received in block retrieved from stored preference information for the user determined by dynamically interacting with the user whether directly or via an intermediate service etc. In block the routine retrieves the stored probabilistic representation information corresponding to the user s domain s and indicated preferences such as one or more of the decision trees previously generated and stored with respect to blocks and or instead an entire Bayesian network that was previously generated and stored with respect to blocks and . In other embodiments the routine may instead dynamically initiate the execution of some or all of blocks to obtain desired inter term relationship probabilistic information.

After block the routine continues to block to identify and select one or more additional user specific target terms that are sufficiently probable to be of interest to the target user based on the available information about the target user s known interests used as evidence. As discussed elsewhere such target terms may be identified in various manners such as the following determining the probability of one or more target terms of interest that are indicated in the request and selecting some or all of them determining the probability of the target user s interest in some or all terms modeled in the generated Bayesian network e.g. other terms that are not directly or indirectly independent of the known evidence interest terms and selecting a subset of those terms with the highest determined probabilities etc.

After block the routine continues to block to determine one or more recommendations for the target user based at least in part on the selected additional target term s and in block to provide indications of the determined recommendation s to the target user e.g. directly via one or more intermediate services etc. . For example the generated recommendations may in some embodiments include one or more domain documents and if so the routine in block may further retrieve information about various candidate documents e.g. information about relevance of the various candidate documents to the selected target terms and determine particular candidate documents to recommend based on those having the most relevance to the selected target term s or to the combination of the selected target term s and the target user s known evidence terms of interest . In some embodiments the recommendations may be generated in other manners and or have other forms. For example some or all of the candidate documents may be supplied as part of the request and or some or all of the candidate documents may be related to domains other than those to which the target user s known evidence terms of interest are known to correspond e.g. if the target user s known evidence terms of interest are known to correspond to one or more first domains of interest to identify additional target terms that are determined to be related to the known evidence terms of interest for one or more other second domains such as to enable recommendations in second domain s for which no information is available about the target user s interests and or about any users interests . In addition in at least some embodiments the selected additional target term s may be determined to be used as some or all of the provided recommendations such as to be provided to the target user for possible selection or other identification of those terms as being of actual interest to the target user or otherwise being relevant for a current activity of the target user. Furthermore in other embodiments the selected additional target term s and or the determined recommendation s for the target user may be used in other manners whether instead of or in addition to providing them to the target user and or using them to generate recommendations such as to store the selected additional target term s as likely or actual interests of the target user for later use proactively push the determined recommendation s to the target user even if the target user has not requested recommendations identify advertisements or other third party information that may be of interest to the target user based on the selected additional target term s etc.

If it is instead determined in block that user specific recommendations are not to be determined and provided the routine continues instead to block to determine whether the relevance of one or more indicated target terms are to be determined for a particular user in a user specific manner e.g. based on an explicit request based on the receipt of specified term related preferences for a user and or target term s of interest etc. and if so continues to block . Such a request may be initiated in various manners such as from a third party service that interacts with the DSRD service to determine if a particular user is likely to have interest in one or more particular target terms for which the third party service has related content by the DSRD service or another service to determine if a particular user is likely to have interest in an advertisement related to one or more target terms etc. In block the routine obtains information about one or more target terms of interest for which a particular user s likely preference for or other interest in is to be determined and in block obtains information about the particular user s preferences for or other interest in one or more particular terms for one or more domain s . The information in blocks and or may be obtained in various manners in various embodiments such as by being received in block being retrieved from stored preference information for a particular identified user determined by dynamically interacting with a particular identified user whether directly or via an intermediate service etc. Furthermore in some embodiments and situations the particular user may be identified while in other embodiments the received request may indicate the term preferences of the particular user but without identifying the particular user e.g. for a particular user that is known by the requester but not identified in the request such as if the requester instead supplies preference information for that unidentified user for an anonymous user for whom preference information is available and optionally with information about the requester indicating likely preferences of the anonymous user or other contextual information related to possible preferences of the anonymous user for a hypothetical user with hypothetical term preferences etc. . In addition in some embodiments the user for whom the relevance of the target term s is determined refers to a single person while in other embodiments the user may have other forms e.g. a non human entity such as a business or organization a collection or group of multiple people such as a club or other aggregation of people with at least some common preferences or otherwise aggregated preferences etc. . In block the routine then retrieves the stored probabilistic representation information corresponding to the relevant domain s such as one or more of the decision trees previously generated and stored with respect to blocks and or instead a single or multiple entire Bayesian networks that were previously generated and stored with respect to blocks and . In other embodiments the routine may instead dynamically initiate the execution of some or all of blocks to obtain desired inter term relationship probabilistic information.

After block the routine continues to block to determine if the retrieved probabilistic representation information shows a relationship between the user s term preferences and the target term s such as one or more paths of a Bayesian network that connect one or more of the term preferences to the target term s . If it is determined in block that the retrieved probabilistic representation information does not show such a relationship the routine continues to block to provide an indication to the requester of a lack of relevance information to determine the likely preference of the particular user for the target term s given the user s current term preferences. Otherwise the routine continues to block to optionally generate or select a subset of the probabilistic representation information that corresponds to the relationship between the user s term preferences and the target term s such as a sub graph of the Bayesian network that includes the one or more paths from the term preferences to the target term s and or one or more decision trees that correspond to the influences between the term preferences and the target term s . In other embodiments the existing Bayesian network and or decision trees may be used without generating any new data structure specific to the particular user.

After block the routine continues to block to determine the probability or other likelihood that the particular user has a preference for or other interest in the target term s such as for each target term individually and or for a combination of multiple target terms based on the optionally generated probabilistic representation information subset or other previously generated probabilistic representation information. In block the routine then provides an indication to the requester of the determined likelihood for the target term s .

If it is instead determined in block that a user specific relevance of one or more indicated target terms for a particular user are not to be determined and provided the routine continues instead to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example in some embodiments the routine may receive updates related to previously generated probabilistic representation information e.g. updates to underlying inter term relevance information updates from user feedback or other learning related to inter term relevance etc. and if so may optionally modify the previously generated probabilistic representation information to reflect the updates and or may initiate the generation of new probabilistic representation information to reflect the updates. In addition in some embodiments the routine may receive and respond to requests to supply previously generated probabilistic representation information periodically initiate the generation of new probabilistic representation information based on whatever underlying inter term relevance information is currently available e.g. in embodiments in which the domain documents and other content items may change in which the determined inter term relevance information may change based on user feedback etc. perform various periodic housekeeping operations etc.

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and if not continues to block and ends.
