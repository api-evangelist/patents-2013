This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

Wave energy converters WECs are devices that extract energy from waves in an open body of water e.g. the ocean . Due to the immensity of oceans continuous movements of waves therein etc. the amount of energy corresponding to waves a wave resource is substantial. Further the wave resource has a relatively high energy density higher than either solar or wind . For instance along the coastal territory of the United States there are approximately 300 GW of potential power that can be extracted from waves. The wave energy resource however is spatially temporally and energetically variable. For example energy within a particular region of a body of water is dependent upon a predominant frequency of waves wave height and width of the wave frequency spectrum.

Conventionally WECs produce power over a relatively narrow band of the full wave frequency spectrum. With more particularity a conventional WEC is configured to have a structural resonant frequency that desirably matches the dominant frequency of waves in a region where the WEC is to be deployed. Thus when a wave impacts the WEC that causes the WEC to be on resonance the WEC can operate efficiently and can absorb a significant amount of energy from the wave. If the WEC is off resonance e.g. waves impact the WEC that cause the WEC to be off resonance the WEC operates much less efficiently.

The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

Described generally herein are various technologies pertaining to wave energy converters WECs . More particularly described herein are technologies pertaining to designing and implementing a controller in a WEC wherein the controller is configured to improve efficiency of the WEC by expanding a wave frequency spectrum over which the WEC can efficiently absorb wave energy. Thus the controller can be used to cause the WEC over time to increase electrical energy generated thereby relative to conventional WECs.

In an exemplary embodiment the controller can be designed using a design process referred to as Hamiltonian Surface Shaping and Power Flow Control HISSPFC . HSSPFC is a two step control law design process. In a first step of the process the WEC is modeled as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system and the Hamiltonian system is treated as if it were a conservative system with no externally applied non conservative forces. Such process enables the shaping of the Hamiltonian surface of the system with acceleration feedback and or proportional feedback to create an isolated minimum stable energy state. Static stability can be utilized to find a first stability boundary a rigid body mode singular stiffness matrix which defines the point of static neutral stability. In a second step of the process controllers are designed and analyzed for the Hamiltonian system with externally applied non conservative forces wherein dynamic stability concepts are applied to modify the power flow with dissipation and generation feedback. A controller with optimal performance is selected for use in the WEC.

The WEC generally includes at least a first body and a second body coupled by a mechanical energy conversion chain where waves impacting the WEC cause the first body to move relative to the second body. The WEC has a resonant frequency associated therewith such that when waves cause the WEC to be at resonance relatively large amplitude movement occurs between the first body and the second body. The mechanical energy conversion chain includes a power take off PTO which outputs electrical energy responsive to movement of the first body and the second body relative to one another. The controller can control the PTO to act as a motor which can affect a natural displacement movement of the first body relative to the second body. Generally the controller can cause the WEC to stay on resonance when wave frequency would otherwise cause the WEC to go off resonance as well as return movement of the WEC to the resonant frequency relatively quickly when the WEC is off resonance.

The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various technologies pertaining to wave energy converters WECs are now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that such aspect s may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.

Moreover the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or. That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B. In addition the articles a and an as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean one or more unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form. Additionally as used herein the term exemplary is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something and is not intended to indicate a preference.

With reference now to an exemplary wave energy converter WEC is illustrated. The WEC is intended to be placed in a body of water e.g. the ocean and subjected to wave motion of varying amplitude and frequency. The WEC can be classified as a resonant responder as its structural design can have a resonance frequency that is within a predominant wave frequency spectrum of the body of water in which the WEC is deployed. In an example the WEC can have a resonant frequency of 8 seconds. Accordingly when a series of 8 second waves impact the WEC the WEC will resonantly respond thus absorbing a relatively large amount of energy of the waves that are impacting the WEC. It can be ascertained that while the exemplary WEC is a two body point absorber aspects described herein are not limited to two body point absorbers. Rather aspects described herein can be utilized in any resonant WEC including a one body resonant WEC e.g. a point absorber terminator or hybrid a two body resonant WEC e.g. a point absorber terminator attenuator or hybrid and an n body resonant WEC e.g. a point absorber terminator attenuator or hybrid .

Thus the WEC is configured to convert incident energy existent in waves into mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is than transformed into electrical energy and can be transmitted by way of a transmission line to a substation or other suitable energy or transmission system. Additionally while not shown the WEC may include local storage such as a battery a capacitor bank or the like that can at least temporarily retain DC energy in the WEC . Further the WEC can extract such energy when needed wherein extracted energy can be used to control the operation of the WEC to provide power to lights on the WEC to provide power to sensors on the WEC to provide power to a processor or circuit that processes sensor data to provide power to a transceiver that communicates to another system or WEC etc.

The exemplary WEC is shown as including two major wave responsive components a float and a spar that is mechanically coupled to the float . The float is designed to generally move e.g. up and down in phase with waves in a body of water . Such body of water may be an ocean a sea a relatively large lake etc. In an example the spar can remain stationary e.g. anchored to an ocean floor mooring as the float moves. In another example the spar can be configured to move generally out of phase with respect to the waves or in a delayed manner with respect to the waves thereby moving relative to the float .

A mechanical energy conversion chain couples the float and the spar . The mechanical energy conversion chain includes a power take off PTO . The PTO is configured to convert the relative motion between the float and the spar to electrical energy which can then be output by way of the transmission line . For example the PTO can include mechanical elements that are generally utilized for example to translate the vertical relative motion between the float and the spar into rotary motion. The PTO can further include a generator that is configured to translate the rotary motion into electrical energy. Exemplary mechanical elements that can be included in the PTO include but are not limited to a rack and pinion system a hydraulic system a flywheel or a ball screw. Additional elements that can be included in the PTO include but are not limited to a water turbine an air turbine a linear generator etc.

As indicated above the WEC is structurally designed to have a resonant frequency within a predominant spectral range of waves in the body of water . Accordingly when waves corresponding to the resonant frequency of the WEC impact the WEC relatively large amplitude vertical motion is created between the float and the spar wherein such motion is translated by the PTO into electrical energy. Conventional WECs however tend to be relatively inefficient when waves in the body of water do not correspond to the resonant frequency of the WEC .

To that end the WEC can include a controller that is configured to control operation of the PTO to cause the PTO to generate larger amounts of electrical energy over time when compared to conventional WECs. For instance the controller can be a PID controller. The controller outputs control signals that are received by the PTO and the PTO operates based upon the control signals received from the control . Thus the controller is configured to cause the PTO to when desirable act as motor such that the PTO affects the displacement between the float and the spar . For example the PTO can generally control the PTO to cause the WEC to remain on resonance when off resonance waves impact the float and can cause the WEC to relatively quickly return to resonance when waves impacting the float cause the WEC to go off resonance. In other words the controller controls the PTO to alter a phase relationship pertaining to the velocity of the float with respect to an excitation force exerted by waves in the body of water on the float . To that end the controller can cause the PTO to exert a force on at least one of the float or the spar wherein the exerted force is in a direction of heave force exerted on the WEC by an impinging wave. In another example the controller can cause the PTO to exert the force on the at least one of the float or the spar in an opposite direction of heave force exerted on the WEC by an impinging wave.

In an exemplary embodiment the controller can control the PTO based at least in part upon a model of the WEC wherein such model retains as many nonlinearities associated with the WEC as possible. For instance the WEC can be modeled as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system and the controller can be designed based upon the modeling of the WEC as the Hamiltonian system. Furthermore the controller utilizes reactive control techniques whereby as indicated above the controller can cause the PTO to act as a motor. Additionally the controller can utilize adaptive control techniques such that the controller can consider variations in parameters that affect the operation of the WEC . Moreover the controller can take into consideration limitations of the PTO when outputting control signals to the PTO . For example the PTO includes mechanical elements that may be subjected to stress torque strain etc. Accordingly the controller can be designed to take into consideration such limitations while controlling the PTO to increase an amount of electrical energy generated by the WEC compared to the amount of energy generated by the WEC without the controller .

The controller can take into consideration signals from a plurality of sensors when controlling operation of the PTO . For instance a PTO sensor can output a signal that is indicative of at least one operating parameter of the PTO . Such operating parameter may be for example an amount of electrical energy being generated by the PTO positions of mechanical elements in the PTO an amount of force being exerted by the PTO on the float and or spar etc. The controller can receive a sensor signal from the PTO sensor and can control operation of the PTO based upon such sensor signal. Accordingly for example the controller can be implemented as a feedback controller.

The WEC may further include or be associated with an environmental sensor that outputs a signal indicative of a condition of the WEC relative to its environment. For instance environmental sensor can be configured to output positional information that indicates an elevation of the float relative to a reference a depth of the spar relative to a reference an amount of vertical displacement between the float and the spar etc. The controller can be configured to control operation of the PTO based at least in part upon a signal output by the environmental sensor .

In addition the WEC can include a predictor that can be or be included in a microprocessor Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA a System on a Chip SoC etc. For instance a microprocessor can be programmed to perform functionality described below as being performed by the predictor . Likewise an ASIC or FPGA can be designed and or programmed to perform the functionality described below as being performed by the predictor . The predictor predicts a time when a wave will impact float as well as an elevation and phase of the wave at the time the wave is predicted to impact the float . With more particularity another environmental sensor can be positioned a distance e.g. 100 meters from the WEC and can output a signal that is indicative of velocity of a wave amplitude of the wave etc. For instance the environmental sensor may have a wireless transceiver thereon which is configured to transmit the signal to the WEC and the predictor . In another example the environmental sensor can be connected to the predictor by way of a wired connection. The predictor may further receive other signals from sensors that can be indicative of environmental conditions such as wind speeds humidity and the like. The predictor component can output the predicted time of impact of the wave with the WEC elevation of the wave at the time of impact and phase of the wave at the time of impact based upon the above mentioned signals. Additionally the predictor component can generate the predictions based upon historically observed data pertaining to waves.

The controller receives the predictions from the predictor and controls operation of the PTO based upon the predictions. For instance the controller can receive the predictions and compute a desired position of the float e.g. elevation at the time that the wave impacts the float . The controller outputs control signals to the PTO then based upon the desired position of the float at the future time current position of the float limitations of the PTO an amount of power that needs to be employed by the PTO to place the float in the desired position etc.

Design of the controller is now described. The controller can be designed using a process referred to as Hamiltonian Surface Shaping and Power Flow Control HISSPFC . HSSPFC is a two step control law design process. In a first step of the process the WEC is modeled as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system and the Hamiltonian system is treated as if it were a conservative system with no externally applied non conservative forces. Such process enables the shaping of the Hamiltonian surface of the WEC with acceleration feedback and or proportional feedback to create an isolated minimum stable energy state. Static stability can be utilized to find a first stability boundary a rigid body mode singular stiffness matrix which defines the point of static neutral stability. In a second step of the process the controller can be designed for the Hamiltonian system with externally applied non conservative forces wherein dynamic stability concepts are applied to modify the power flow with dissipation and generation feedback.

With reference to an exemplary mass spring damper MSD system is illustrated which can be analogized to the WEC shown in . The MSD system includes a mass that is coupled to a wall by a spring and a damper . The mass is moveable over a frictionless floor . The MSD system can be modeled as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system Hamiltonian . The mass has a mass m an external force x exerted thereon a spring force g x exerted therein by the spring and a damping force f dot over x . u is the control force applied to the mass .

Accordingly the following describes the MSD system dot over 1 The energy of the MSD system can be defined as follows 

The time derivative of the energy storage surface defines the power flow dissipated within and stored in the MSD system . Accordingly the MSD system is dynamically stable if the following condition holds 1 0. 3 The MSD system is dynamically unstable if the following condition holds 1 0. 4 The MSD system is dynamically neutral stable is at the limit cycle under the following condition 

The goal of the controller is to control the PTO such that power flow is maximized e.g. the position of the WEC with respect to waves in the body of water over time conforms to the resonant frequency of the WEC . The controller can be designed in accordance with such goal.

Turning to an exemplary RLC circuit that can be analogized to the MSD system and the WEC is illustrated. The RLC circuit includes a voltage source a resistor an inductor and a capacitance . As shown the resistor has a resistance R the inductor has an inductance L and the capacitor has a capacitance C. Current i flowing through the circuit equals the rate of change of charge q. In the exemplary circuit q is not deterministic. Moreover the circuit can be modeled as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system.

An equation of motion EOM for the circuit is as follows 1 cos 6 where 0 for 0 and 0 for 0. 7 where is the fundamental frequency of the voltage source. The nonlinear Hamiltonian of the RLC circuit can thus be as follows 8 where L is the kinetic energy C y dy is the potential energy and y is a variable of integration where the limits of integration relate to for example charge for which is analogous to position displacement with respect to the MSD system . Again it can be ascertained that such Hamiltonian includes at least one nonlinear term and further includes at least one nondeterministic term.

The time derivative of the Hamiltonian of the RLC and thus the power flow for the RLC circuit can be defined as follows 9 

Analogizing the WEC to the RLC circuit it can be ascertained that the controller can be designed to cause a mechanical force to be output that places the WEC on resonance when waves of the body of water are off resonance . Thus the controller is designed to control the PTO to cause the PTO to output a mechanical force that places the WEC at the desired limit cycle e.g. its resonant frequency . Referring again to the RLC circuit continuing with the analogy a goal of a controller for the RLC circuit is cause a designed voltage to create a desired limit cycle e.g. 60 Hz for the electric grid . For a WEC device the goal of the controller can be a function of a dominate frequency in a forcing function . The limit cycle is defined as follows 0 10 where storage terms are matched and 0 11 and vi is desirably maximally used by a connected load.

Continuing with the above noted goal the limit cycle can be as follows for matched storage terms and maximal real power 0. 12 In an example the RLC circuit can include nonlinear capacitance Duffing oscillator and nonlinear resistance Coulomb friction like defined as follows 

Taking into account the nonlinearities reference trajectory controller storage K and the adaptive information potential tilde over tilde over terms results in the following Hamiltonian 

If the ideal resonance frequency is represented as follows 1 21 then 22 where is a natural frequency of a combined controller and physical system and is an incoming reference frequency. Accordingly for the RLC circuit to resonate . It can be ascertained that L and C are constant however controller can control a voltage source to cause inductance and capacitance of the circuit to alter. Thus if 1 23 then feedback control is required. To maintain a power factor of 1 v can be selected as 24 where Kis augmented controller storage capacitance gain Kis augmented generation gain and Kis the augmented controller dissipation gain. This feedback control is used to shape the Hamiltonian surface as necessary to meet static stability conditions and determine stability and performance with respect to dynamic stability conditions. It can be noted that all gains can be selected during the design of the controller as positive definite.

Substituting v v into the power flow equation eq. 17 provides the following tilde over dot over . 25 where

The adaptive parameter update equations including both nonlinear resistance and capacitance can then be defined as follows 

Moreover the acts described herein may be computer executable instructions that can be implemented by one or more processors and or stored on a computer readable medium or media. The computer executable instructions can include a routine a sub routine programs a thread of execution and or the like. Still further results of acts of the methodologies can be stored in a computer readable medium displayed on a display device and or the like.

Now referring to an exemplary methodology for controlling a PTO in a WEC is illustrated. The methodology starts at and at a signal that is indicative of an excitation force of a wave that is to impact the WEC is received. For instance such signal can represent a velocity of a wave an amplitude of a wave etc. Further such signal can indicate a predicted time in the future that the wave is to impact the WEC. At the excitation force of the wave is estimated based upon the signal received at . At operation of a PTO of the WEC is controlled based upon the estimating of the excitation force. In an exemplary embodiment the controlling of the operation of the PTO can be performed by a controller which outputs control signals based upon a modeling of the WEC as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system. Further the controlling of the operation of the PTO can include causing the PTO to act as a motor. The methodology completes at .
