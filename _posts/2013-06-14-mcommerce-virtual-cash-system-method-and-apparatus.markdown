No. 13 351 341 filed Jan. 17 2012 entitled M COMMERCE VIRTUAL CASH SYSTEM METHOD AND APPARATUS which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 434 157 filed May 1 2009 entitled M COMMERCE VIRTUAL CASH SYSTEM METHOD AND APPARATUS now U.S. Pat. No. 8 245 911 issued Aug. 21 2012 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 376 981 filed Mar. 15 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 552 867 issued Jun. 30 2009 entitled M COMMERCE VIRTUAL CASH SYSTEM METHOD AND APPARATUS. The entire contents of the above listed applications are hereby incorporated by reference.

The term m commerce is beginning to find meanings in wireless mobile communication environments that are analogous to e commerce solutions. An increasing number of m commerce solutions are emerging in which a wireless device may be used to transact certain commercial transactions such as simple financial transactions like store couponing credit card transactions automated clearing house ACH funds transfer transactions used like a check with bank routing information and the like.

The term wireless device herein means cellular cordless Personal Communication System PCS or other types of wireless telephone devices pagers wireless personal digital assistants notebook computers with wireless access or any other wireless device two way radios walkie talkies or other type of communications transceiver or mobile stations MS regardless of whether they have valid subscriber identification module SIM or UTMS subscriber identification module USIM identifiers. Wireless devices are becoming so widespread it is estimated there will be about 1.7 billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide by 2007. In fact recently wireless devices with limited telephone capabilities have been made available for even grade school level students.

At the same time card like devices herein referred to simply as cards are finding increasing use to make life easier for individuals and merchants in an increasingly mobile society. Cards come in many forms such as those having a stripe of magnetic material formed on a plastic base or substrate those having an embedded integrated circuit with memory capabilities and the like. Examples of cards in widespread use include credit cards debit cards telephone cards cash cards and gift or general purchase cards generally useful at a particular store and which are now sold in kiosks grocery stores and elsewhere for various other stores such as hardware electronics florists and so forth.

Because of the ease with which cards may be used they are often preferred by merchants as a way to accept payment for services and merchandise. In some cases cards may be preferred in fact even to receiving cash payments for many reasons. Cards generally result in automatic payments directly into an account of the merchant without requiring the handling of cash and the attendant problems associated therewith. By using cards merchants do not need to provide as high a security level as would be required if large amounts of cash were kept on the premises. The use of cards also increases the accuracy of record keeping reduces change making errors and with the present card infrastructures in place reduces the time required to handle cash transactions. The use of cards also simplifies record keeping requirements for most commercial transactions.

In these environments what is needed is an expansion of m commerce applications using the card technologies and infrastructures and more specifically an expansion of m commerce technologies to handle or replace cash and card transactions.

According to a broad aspect of one embodiment of the system method and apparatus described herein a wireless device is provided by which cash payments can be made or by which indicia that provide a virtual cash equivalent can be displayed for use in making cash payments without the attendant problems described above of handling cash itself.

Because some overlap exists in definitions for ease of description the words money currency and cash are used herein with the following meanings.

Money means something generally accepted as a medium of exchange a measure of value or a means of payment. Money is used synonymously herein with funds. Examples of money include the basic concept of something of value represented by dollars and cents pounds and shillings yen pesos and so forth as well as book or ledger entries representing the same by which financial transactions may be accomplished by respective debits and credits. Additionally included are instruments that are payable on demand such as checks or the like.

Currency means something that is in circulation as a medium of money exchange. For example currency includes physical one ten hundred and so on dollar bills one five ten fifty one hundred yen coins and so forth.

Cash means either ready money or ready currency. For instance cash includes checks and currency that is presently in hand.

Additionally the term virtual cash herein means an indicia like a bar code a radio or a light spectrum signal or other machine readable entity or form that represents or is immediately useable and accepted in place of cash in a transaction in which money is exchanged for goods services or other purpose. Virtual cash does not include credit cards or other transaction forms in which a promise to pay or repay in the future is exchanged for goods services or other purpose. Virtual cash is not intended to imply that the money represented thereby is not real or hypothetical however the money represented by the virtual cash is not actually physically present or currently in hand.

Most if not all of the infrastructure needed to realize at least some embodiments of such virtual cash system using a wireless device is presently in place and only specific application software need be added to realize specific desired features. Such system may be accomplished in a number ways. In one embodiment a scannable bar code may be provided on the display screen of a wireless device shown in . As described below the bar code provides information that can be used or spent in place of actual cash. In another embodiment a direct cash transfer may be initiated via the user interface such as a keypad or writeable surface not shown of the wireless device . In yet another embodiment 802.11 Bluetooth LAN capabilities or other short range radio signal technique may be used in the wireless device and appropriately equipped receiving equipment not shown . Likewise infrared IR or other modulated light signal technique may be used in the wireless device and appropriately equipped receiving equipment not shown .

One embodiment of a system method and apparatus described herein is shown in to which reference is now made. The system includes a point of sale POS location of a merchant . The POS location may include a check out station having typical existing equipment such as a bar code scanner and control and display device associated therewith. The point of sale equipment may also include a server through which the check out station and other check out stations not shown at the POS or other POSs that may also exist not shown can be operated.

A bar code system is described in the embodiment shown in since most wireless devices include a display that may be used directly or with minor modification to display scannable bar code information as described below. Additionally most POS equipment has the ability to read bar codes. Therefore existing infrastructure may be used without the need for new equipment in order to facilitate the data interchange required to complete cash transactions of the type described herein.

More particularly normal POS card transactions may be processed through a service center which may be operated by a credit debit banking company such as MasterCard Visa American Express or the like. The service center may be for example a network service that would normally serve to authorize credit card transactions. The service center also generally serves as a clearing and settlement service that would normally transfer payment information between a merchant bank and a customer bank .

Card transactions are normally handled in two stages. The first stage is an approval stage in which the cardholder not shown presents the card to the merchant to pay for purchases. The merchant then swipes the card and enters the dollar amount of the purchase. Then an authorization request is transmitted to the merchant bank sometimes referred to as an acquirer. The acquirer is a financial institution or merchant bank that contracts with the merchant for card acceptance and enables card payments from customers.

In the case of credit card transactions the acquirer sends the authorization request to a network that routes the authorization request to the customer bank sometimes referred to as the issuer. The issuer is a financial institution that issues cards and maintains a contract with cardholders for repayment.

The issuer then approves or declines the authorization request and sends the approving or declining response back through the network to the acquirer . The acquirer then sends the approving or declining response back to the merchant . If the authorization has been approved the process is allowed to continue to the second stage for clearing and settlement.

In the clearing and settlement stage the merchant deposits the transaction receipt with the acquirer . The transactions may be deposited using paper copies but may be electronically transmitted for automatic settlement. The acquirer then credits the merchant s account and electronically submits the transaction to the network service for settlement. Existing network services may for example act as an authorization service for card transactions as described above but as a clearing and settlement service as well to transfer payment information between parties. Typically the network service pays the acquirer and debits the issuer account then sends the transaction to the issuer . The issuer then posts the transaction to the cardholder s account.

Although the virtual cash system method and apparatus described herein might be used in such a credit debit card environment according to one embodiment the wireless device can be used in a manner by which cash payments can be made or by which indicia that provide a virtual cash equivalent can be displayed for use in making direct cash payments. In this embodiment a substantial portion of the authorization stage previously employed in the credit debit card transaction described above can be minimized or eliminated.

To this end a preestablished cash purchase amount is employed. The preestablished cash purchase amount may be kept in an account record that associates a predetermined cash balance with the particular wireless device . The account record may be maintained by a transaction processing center which may be operated in a similar manner to existing purchase card processing centers. An example of operations performed by such purchase card processing center may be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6 999 569 which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments the actual account record may be maintained in a memory of the wireless device itself or elsewhere however security may be more easily monitored and maintained if the account record is managed by a separate processing center under the control of trusted financial institutions as described herein.

Unlike purchasing cards the wireless device has a display on which available cash information can be displayed in the form of bar code information that can be read by a merchant s scanner equipment . As mentioned existing equipment may be employed with appropriate software modifications. For example the wireless device may be equipped with an appropriate Application Programming Interface API to configure the wireless device to hold the available cash information in its memory and to display the required bar code information on its display .

On the other hand the equipment of the merchant may be modified with appropriate software to recognize the transaction as a cash payment transaction. This embodiment enables the use of a transaction processing center to operate in a manner similar to a purchasing card transaction which allows the first stage credit card authorization process described above to be bypassed.

More particularly the bar code information may typically contain for example account identification information a security code an available cash amount or combination thereof The account identification information may be for instance a PIN number selected by the user a phone number of the wireless device some form of a Mobile Identification Number MIN an Electronic Serial Number ESN identification information derived therefrom an actual account number or some other identifying information by which the account with the wireless device by which the transaction is to be made can be associated with the account record .

As indicated above in addition to indicating the available cash information the bar codes may include security information. The security information may be for example a form of rolling code that is changed with every transaction and which is be synchronized with a code at the processing center to which the security information is sent to at least in part verify the point of sale transaction. The rolling code may be employed as a security measure to protect both the customer and the merchant.

In a typical operation the rolling code may be sent with each transaction but is updated after each transaction so that it is not the same from one transaction to the next. Such codes can be received and decoded by the processing center to verify that the code is a proper one. In this way if someone in possession of the wireless device attempted to foil the system by defeating the rolling code change a second transaction based upon the same rolling code as an earlier transaction would be rejected.

A suitable rolling code may be adapted for instance from a rolling code of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 598 475 which is incorporated by reference herein. For greater security both fixed and rolling codes may be used such as for example a code adapted from code arrangement of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 980 655 which is incorporated by reference herein. The fixed portion of the security code may be provided for example by the customer s bank when confirming the deposit of the predetermined funds at the customer s direction. Other security codes rolling codes or other type of security or verification technique may of course be equally advantageously employed.

The available cash amount may be simply a bar code indicting the amount of money that is contained in the account that is available for spending.

In addition other information may optionally be displayed on the screen depending upon the particular application being considered the ease of use to be facilitated and the space available on the screen. For example a human readable form of the available cash may be displayed for verification by the purchaser or by the merchant before attempting to complete a transaction. Routing information to the customer bank may also be displayed if needed. Other information may also be displayed as well.

Thus some or all of the bar code information may be used by the processing center to verify the transaction for example to ensure that the security code checked out and sufficient funds exist in the mobile device account to complete the transaction. The verification could be in the form simply as an accept indication if a sufficient amount of money exists in the account for the purchase or a reject indication if the balance is overrun. On the other hand the verification may return a number indicating the amount of money that can be applied to the purchase leaving the balance to be made up by the purchaser.

Although the money balance information would be kept at the processing center the actual amount would be established by the user. The money balance may be established for example by authorizing the customer bank to move either the money itself to the processing center to be associated with the account or by an authorization to withdraw the money as spent from the customer bank payable to the merchant bank to be credited to the merchant s account.

In one embodiment money may be moved directly into the account by third party devices who make direct payments for example from their own respective wireless device cash accounts to the account associated with the wireless device . If desired the account holder may require that a maximum balance be maintained in the account such that excess amounts deposited to the account be refunded back directly into the account holder s account at the customer bank .

As mentioned the wireless device is configured so that cash payments can be made or so that indicia that provide a virtual cash equivalent can be displayed for use in making cash payments. Consequently if the wireless device is regarded as representing or carrying cash itself as suggested above one embodiment provides that no identification or other sort of user authentication need be required. That is the actual money amount is associated with the wireless device not the user. Because of this characteristic carrying the virtual cash represented in the wireless device has some of the same risks as carrying cash itself. Thus for example if the wireless device is lost a finder may be able to spend the virtual cash just as if it were actual cash in a lost wallet or purse.

Nevertheless some of the risks of carrying cash may be reduced. For example if the wireless device is lost there is a chance that the cash value can be preserved if the issuer is notified before a finder makes purchases. In such cases the account record in the processing center may be modified to decline authorization for purchases made on that account. Additionally since the account contains only a limited predetermined money amount the extent of liability for a lost wireless device is limited to that predetermined amount. The limit may be for example established by the owner of the wireless device who can balance his own comfort level of risk to the amount of money that he places in his account in the same manner as deciding how much actual cash he is comfortable carrying.

One embodiment of a method for making cash transactions of the type described is illustrated in to which reference is now additionally made. After a cash account is set up with a processing center the customer directs his bank to credit the account with a predetermined amount of money as shown in box . The customer s bank then credits the account associated with the customer s wireless device according to the customer s direction shown in box . This may be accomplished directly or via direction to the processing center to credit the account with the deposited funds as shown in box .

As shown in box the customer s bank then sends cash information to the customer s wireless device via a wireless system indicating that the predetermined amount of money has been transferred into the customer s account . The cash information may be stored for example in a memory of the customer s wireless device. As mentioned as a part of the cash information the customer s bank may also include a bank security code that can be incorporated into a security code that may be sent by the wireless device to the processing center to verify a spending transaction. Thus when the processing center updates the customer account information with the deposit information as shown in box it may also associate the bank security code if sent.

When the customer wishes to make a purchase he first configures his wireless device as shown in box to display the bar codes on his display screen required to be scanned. The wireless device may be configured for example by running the API that accesses the memory in which the cash information has been stored to generate and display the appropriate bar codes on the display of the wireless device .

If a security code is also to be sent to assist in verifying the transaction in addition to indicating the available cash information the bar codes may be configured to include the security code. The security code may be generated as a part of the device configuration process as shown in box .

While the customer is configuring his wireless device to display the bar codes as described above the merchant enters the amount that the customer is to pay shown in box for example via the control and display device . The merchant then scans the bar code displayed on the customer s wireless device shown in box . As shown in box the merchant or the merchant s equipment then sends information derived from the scanned bar code together with the amount to be paid to the processing center which as shown in box verifies the bar code information identifies the customer account against which the purchase is to be debited and verifies that the required funds are on deposit to complete the transaction.

The processing center then notifies the merchant according to the predefined notification rules for example that there are sufficient funds that there are not sufficient funds or that a certain funds amount is available for the transaction. The merchant then completes the transaction shown in box .

Meanwhile the processing center settles the transaction by debiting the amount to be paid from the customer s account and depositing the amount to be paid in the merchant s account as shown in box . The processing center then notifies the customer s bank of the transaction shown in box . The customer s bank then wirelessly updates the wireless device information as shown in box via a wireless network such as the wireless network . For example if the amount to be paid is less than the preauthorized cash amount the remaining amount in the customer s account is determined for instance by the processing center and the remaining balance is transmitted to the wireless device for additional spending. If the entire amount has been depleted that fact may also be sent to notify the customer that he needs to have additional money transferred to his wireless device account if additional purchases are to be made.

At this juncture it should be noted that although only one wireless network has been shown wireless networks are ubiquitous and the wireless device can be virtually anywhere while still being in communication with the customer bank . Thus one of the advantages derived from this embodiment is that the overall use of the virtual cash apparatus and system of the type described is not geographically limited so long as wireless service is available. Moreover although the notification transactions have been described as being conducted by the customer s bank it should be appreciated that such notification transactions may be performed by any other entity such as the processing center itself or other entity that is tasked with the account update responsibility.

Virtual cash systems of the type described have a number of other advantages in addition making cash purchases at diverse point of sale locations as described above. For example as suggested above using the keypad or other user interface of the wireless device a user may transfer money directly into a wireless device account of another user. Thus for example cash payments can be made directly to wireless device accounts of casual service providers such as domestic workers baby sitters or the like. Children s allowance may be paid by transferring money directly to an account associated with their individual wireless devices. Additionally preauthorized spending limits may be established by parents with regard to their children s wireless device accounts for example children s spending may be limited to the purchase of food at a school cafeteria or to the purchase of particular discretionary expenses at certain authorized merchants. Other uses will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art.

It should be noted that although a bar code implementation has been described in detail the account identification information security code and available cash amount indicators can be in other forms that may be recognized by the merchant s equipment. For example an alternative embodiment one or more of the indicators may be implemented wholly or partially by rfid radio links which are well known that transfer data to proximity readers.

In yet another alternative embodiment any or all of the account identification information security code and available cash amount indicators may be displayed on the display of the wireless device in a picture format which can be recognized for example as a series of alphanumeric characters that can be manually entered by the merchant as a part of the sales transaction.

Although the invention has been described and illustrated with a certain degree of particularity it should be understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example only and that numerous changes in the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.
