title: Emergency contacts information system
abstract: A system may be configured to receive a request for emergency contact information associated with a first user. The request may include information identifying the first user. The system may further determine a geographic location of the first user; and identify a second user. The identifying may be based on at least one of an amount or frequency of communication between the first user and the second user, or a geographical proximity of the first user to the second user. The system may additionally identify contact information associated with the second user; and output, to a device from which the request was received, the contact information associated with the second user.

User devices such as cellular telephones may store information regarding emergency contacts also referred to as in case of emergency or ICE information . For instance a user may manually provide an entry into a contacts directory of the user device. Users may commonly designate a name of the entry as ICE and a number associated with the ICE entry may be a telephone number associated with the emergency contact. This emergency information may be used when the user is in an emergency situation. For example emergency personnel such as paramedics may use ICE information to call family members of a car crash victim who has been rendered unconscious and or unintelligible.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

As mentioned above users may manually store ICE contact information in contact directories of their user devices. However some users do not store this information in their user devices and or some emergency personnel may not be familiar with the operation of some user devices. Furthermore in some situations emergency contact information may change e.g. a user designated as an emergency contact has changed his or her telephone number . In these situations emergency personnel may have difficulty notifying family members and or other contacts that the user has met with an emergency situation.

One or more implementations described herein may provide for a convenient centralized lookup of emergency contact information for a user. For example as shown in a victim e.g. a victim of a car accident may be carrying a cellular telephone. Emergency personnel e.g. a medical provider may use information associated with the telephone to look up emergency contact information associated with the victim. For example as described below the medical personnel may use the victim s telephone to contact an emergency contact information server in order to retrieve emergency contact information.

Additionally or alternatively the medical personnel may use another device e.g. a cellular phone owned by or otherwise associated with the medical personnel to look up the victim s emergency contact information. For instance in some implementations the medical personnel may look up the emergency contact information based on the user s name telephone number address and or other information e.g. information found on the victim s driver s license and or from another source . As shown the emergency contact information server may provide information regarding emergency contacts to the medical personnel. This information may include manually entered information that is emergency contact information that was previously provided by the victim.

Additionally or alternatively the emergency contact information may include automatically generated emergency contact information. For instance based on factors such as the victim s calling patterns present location and or other factors the emergency contact information server may dynamically identify emergency contacts and may provide information regarding these dynamically generated emergency contacts in addition to or in lieu of information regarding the manually entered emergency contacts. Providing information regarding dynamically generated emergency contacts may be useful in certain situations.

For example referring to assume that the victim lives at geographic location . Further assume that emergency contacts manually provided by the victim live at geographic locations that is relatively near the victim s home. The victim may in some circumstances e.g. vacation a business trip etc. visit a location that is relatively distant from the victim s home and may have been a victim of a car accident while being away from home. For example as shown in assume that the victim has been involved in a car accident at geographic location . In this situation the emergency contact information that was manually provided by the victim may not be entirely useful as the victim is across the country from theses emergency contacts. In some implementations the emergency contact information server may automatically identify dynamically generated emergency contacts such as emergency contacts that are closer to the victim s present location e.g. emergency contacts that are at locations . By identifying these dynamically generated emergency contacts the emergency contact information server may provide more useful emergency contact information as emergency contacts that are closer to a victim may be better suited to provide aid and or support to the victim.

User device may include any computation and communication device such as a wireless mobile communication device that is capable of communicating with network . For example user device may include a radiotelephone a personal communications system PCS terminal e.g. a device that combines a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities a personal digital assistant PDA e.g. that can include a radiotelephone a pager Internet intranet access etc. a smart phone a laptop computer a tablet computer a camera a personal gaming system or another type of mobile computation and communication device. User device may send and or receive traffic to and or from emergency contact information server via network and or one or more other devices.

Emergency contact information server may include one or more devices that perform one or more functions related to providing emergency contact lookup information related to user device and or another device or user. Further detail of example functionality of emergency contact information server according to some implementations is described below with respect to .

Network may include one or more wired and or wireless networks. For example network may include a packet data network PDN such as an IP based PDN. Network may include for example a wide area network such as the Internet or one or more other networks. User device and or other devices may communicate with each other via network and or via one or more other networks.

In some implementations network may include an evolved packet system EPS that includes a LTE network and or an evolved packet core EPC network that operate based on a third generation partnership project 2GPP wireless communication standard. The LTE network may be or may include a radio access network RAN that includes one or more base stations some or all of which may take the form of an evolved node B eNB via which user device may communicate with the EPC network. The EPC network may include one or more serving gateways SGWs mobility management entities MMEs and or packet data network gateways PGWs and may enable user device to communicate with network and or an IP multimedia subsystem IMS core network. The IMS core network may include home a subscriber server authentication authorization and accounting server HSS AAA server and may manage authentication session initiation account information a user profile etc. associated with user device .

Contact input component may receive information regarding manually entered emergency contacts. For example a user e.g. a user of user device may provide information regarding contacts which the user desires to be contacted in case of emergency. The user may input the information via a user interface such as via a web page or an application that is running on user device and or another device. The emergency contact information may include for example a name a telephone number an email address a relationship to the user e.g. relative friend co worker etc. and or other information. Contact input component may output the information regarding the manually entered emergency contacts to contact repository .

Contact repository may store information regarding emergency contacts e.g. as provided by contact input component and or by dynamic contact generation component as described further below . illustrates example data structures and which may be stored by contact repository . As shown data structure may include information that may be used to look up emergency contact information for users. Data structure may include user information such as mobile telephone numbers fixed telephone numbers email addresses and names. For each user data structure may also include information regarding emergency contacts associated with the user.

As is apparent from the example shown in some of the information in data structure may be considered optional in some implementations. That is a set of one or more fields in data structure may be required e.g. the user must provide either a mobile telephone number or a fixed telephone number while other fields may not be required. As described below if a user provides more information than is required it may be more likely that emergency contact information can be looked up for the user.

As shown in the information for a particular user may include information regarding one or more emergency contacts associated with the user. For example the user John Smith may be associated with Contact 1 Contact 2 and Contact 3 Paul Handy may be associated with Contact 4 and Contact 5 and Julia Johnson may be associated with Contact 6.

Data structure may be associated with a particular contact. Thus data structure may include several instances and or references to of data structure . For instance since five distinct contacts are shown in data structure may include five instances of data structure . Data structure may include information regarding a mobile telephone number a fixed telephone number an email address a name and a relationship e.g. relationship to the corresponding user .

Returning to contact update consent component may obtain consent from emergency contacts e.g. permission as to whether these emergency contacts would like to be listed as emergency contacts for a particular user and or may periodically update the information stored by contact repository . For instance when information regarding an emergency contact is received or generated by contact input component and or dynamic contact generation component contact update consent component may obtain consent from the emergency contact. For example contact update consent component may use a telephone number and or an email address to send a message e.g. a short message service SMS message an email message an automated voice call etc. to the emergency contact requesting permission to associate the emergency contact with the user.

Returning to when contact update consent component receives consent from an emergency contact contact update consent component may notify contact repository that consent has been received. Based on this notification contact repository may store emergency contact information for the contact or may forgo removing stored emergency contact information for the contact. When contact update consent component determines that consent has not been received e.g. a consent message has not been received or a denial message has been received contact update consent component may notify contact repository that consent has not been received. Based on this notification contact repository may forgo storing emergency contact information for the contact or may remove stored emergency contact information for the contact.

As mentioned above contact update consent component may in some implementations periodically update emergency contact information that has been stored by contact repository . For example contact update consent component may periodically e.g. once a week once a month twice a year or at any other interval send a confirmation message e.g. an SMS message an email message or another type of message to an emergency contact. This confirmation message may in some implementations request affirmative consent from an emergency contact to remain listed. In other implementations the confirmation message may indicate that the emergency contact will remain to be listed unless affirmative denial is received from the emergency contact. In some implementations the confirmation message may present contact information e.g. telephone numbers etc. associated with the emergency contact and may provide an opportunity for the emergency contact to modify the information. For instance if an emergency contact changes his or her phone number this periodic update message may provide an opportunity for the emergency contact to update the information listed for the emergency contact.

In some implementations contact update consent component may receive information from a service provider e.g. a cellular telecommunications network provider regarding a user whose contact information has changed. For instance contact update consent component may provide information to the service provider indicating that a user associated with the service provider has been listed as an emergency contact. In some implementations the service provider may be capable of identifying when contact information for the user has changed e.g. the service provider may identify when the user changes telephone numbers and may notify contact update consent component when the contact information has changed. In some implementations contact update consent component may periodically request information from the service provider indicating whether contact information for a particular emergency contact has changed.

Contact update consent component may in some implementations periodically place a telephone call to a particular telephone number associated with an emergency contact in order to verify whether the telephone number is valid. If the telephone call does not go through e.g. if the telephone number has been disconnected contact update consent component may identify that the telephone number is no longer valid and may remove the telephone number from the emergency contact information or may remove the emergency contact information entirely. If the telephone call goes through contact update consent component may provide an automated voice message that indicates that the purpose of the call was to verify contact information for the emergency contact. In some implementations the voice call may provide options e.g. by pressing a key on a keypad of a telephone for the emergency contact to modify emergency contact details or to revoke consent to be listed as an emergency contact.

Contact lookup component may receive requests to look up emergency contact information that is associated with a user. For instance contact lookup component may receive information identifying a user e.g. a victim of a car accident and may output emergency contact information associated with the user. Contact lookup component may in some implementations request emergency contact information from contact repository and or from dynamic contact generation component . For instance contact lookup component may receive information associated with the user e.g. a name telephone number address and or other information and may identify whether emergency contact is stored for the user by contact repository and or whether emergency contact information for the user can be provided by dynamic contact generation component . For instance referring to dynamic contact generation component may query contact repository to determine whether information in data structure matches information received for a user. For example assume that contact lookup component receives a request for emergency contact information matching the telephone number 555 555 1234. In some implementations contact lookup component may query contact repository for emergency contact information based on the telephone number. Contact repository may identify based on the telephone number that three emergency contacts are associated with the telephone number Contact 1 Contact 2 and Contact 3. Contact repository may identify the information associated with these emergency contacts e.g. information stored in instances of data structure and may provide the identified emergency contact information to contact lookup component .

Contact lookup component may in turn provide the identified emergency contact information received from contact repository and or dynamic contact generation component to the user who requested the information. In some implementations contact lookup component may rank emergency contacts and provide the emergency contact information in the form of a ranked list. For instance contact lookup component may rank the emergency contacts based on proximity of the emergency contact to a current location of the user associated with the emergency contact relationship of the emergency contact to the user the source from which the emergency contact information was received e.g. from contact repository or from dynamic contact generation component how often the user contacts the emergency contact and or other factors.

Contact lookup component may determine the geographic location of a particular emergency contact or a user with which the emergency contact is associated using one or more techniques. For example information regarding the location of a particular user device may be requested from a service provider associated with the particular user device . As another example information regarding the location of a particular user device may be requested from the particular user device itself. In some implementations the geographic location of a particular user may be determined based on an area code of a telephone number e.g. a fixed telephone number associated with the particular user.

Programming interface component may provide an application programming interface API which may be used to provide a mechanism for a user to request emergency contact information. For instance the API may allow for a software developer e.g. a developer associated with device and or a third party developer to generate a user interface via which a user can request and access emergency contact information. illustrates an example user interface which may utilize such an API. User interface may be used to enter information regarding a user for whom emergency contact information is desired e.g. a victim of a car accident . Information regarding the user may be provided via example user interface such as a telephone number a name an address and a zip code. As mentioned above in some situations not all information regarding the user may be known. In these situations emergency contact information may still be able to be looked up based on at least some of the information being provided.

In some implementations user interface may only include up to a predefined maximum quantity of emergency contacts. For instance assume that contact lookup component has identified five emergency contacts associated with the user. User interface may in some implementations display fewer than five emergency contacts e.g. the highest ranked three emergency contacts . As further shown in user interface may include an indication shown in the figure an asterisk that a particular emergency contact was dynamically identified e.g. identified by dynamic contact generation component as opposed to manually provided by the user .

Returning to dynamic contact generation component may dynamically identify emergency contacts associated with a user. For example dynamic contact generation component may receive an indication e.g. from contact lookup component that emergency contact information was requested for a user. Dynamic contact generation component may dynamically generate emergency contacts hereinafter sometimes referred to as dynamic emergency contacts . These dynamic emergency contacts may be contacts that have not been manually provided by the user. Dynamic contact generation component may identify dynamic emergency contacts based on one or more factors such as proximity of the dynamic emergency contact to the user and or an amount of communication e.g. a frequency and or amount of calls and or messages between the dynamic emergency contact and the user. Dynamic contact generation component may in some implementations receive information regarding the amount of communication between the dynamic emergency contact and the user from a network provider associated with the dynamic emergency contact and or the user.

Referring back to the example situation shown in identifying dynamic emergency contacts may be useful when a user is in a location e.g. location that is distant from the user s manually provided emergency contacts e.g. contacts that are located at locations . Dynamic contact generation component may identify that the user has frequently e.g. at least a threshold frequency such as two times in the last month once a week for the last four weeks or another threshold frequency called contacts closer to location e.g. contacts that are located at locations . Thus based on the proximity of these contacts as well as the amount of communication between these contacts and the user dynamic contact generation component may identify these contacts as dynamic emergency contacts for the user.

In some implementations dynamic contact generation component may periodically or occasionally e.g. at a regular interval or at an irregular interval automatically identify dynamic emergency contacts for users. That is in some such implementations dynamic contact generation component may identify dynamic emergency contacts without a request for emergency contact information from contact lookup component . For instance dynamic contact generation component may periodically or occasionally identify dynamic emergency contact information for users for whom emergency contact information is stored e.g. in data structure . Based on identifying dynamic emergency contacts dynamic contact generation component may provide information regarding the dynamic emergency contacts to contact repository and or to contact update consent component . In turn as discussed above contact update consent component may in some implementations obtain consent from these dynamic emergency contacts before the information is stored by contact repository .

Process may include receiving emergency contact information block . For example as described above with respect to contact input component emergency contact information server may receive emergency contact information from a user e.g. a user who desires to manually provide emergency contact information associated with the user . The emergency contact information may include for example a name a telephone number an email address a relationship to the user and or other information. When receiving the emergency contact information at block contact input component may provide the emergency contact information to contact repository and or to contact update consent component .

Process may also include requesting initial consent from the emergency contact block . For example as described above with respect to contact update consent component emergency contact information server may request consent from the emergency contact using a telephone number an email address and or other information received at block . In some implementations emergency contact information server may request consent using messages similar to those shown in .

If initial consent is not received block NO then process may include discarding or removing the emergency contact information block . For instance as described above with respect to contact update consent component if consent is not received from the emergency contact emergency contact information server may forgo storing the emergency contact information and or may delete stored information corresponding to the emergency contact. In some implementations emergency contact information server may retain information regarding the emergency contact but may store an indication that the emergency contact has not provided consent to be listed as an emergency contact for the user. If on the other hand initial consent is received block YES then process may include storing the emergency contact information block .

Process may additionally include periodically or occasionally confirming consent block . For example as described above with respect to contact update consent component emergency contact information server may periodically e.g. once a week once a month etc. or occasionally request confirmation from the emergency contact that the emergency contact would like to remain listed. If consent is not confirmed block NO then process may include discarding or removing the emergency contact information block .

Process may include periodically verifying the emergency contact information block . For example as described above with respect to contact update consent component emergency contact information server may periodically e.g. once a week once a month etc. verify emergency contact information by sending messages to the emergency contact calling the emergency contact receiving updated contact information from a service provider or via other techniques.

If the emergency contact information is not verified block YES then process may include discarding or removing the emergency contact information block . For example if a telephone number associated with the emergency contact is no longer in service emergency contact information server may discard or remove the emergency contact information. In some implementations emergency contact information server may retain the emergency contact information but remove the telephone number that is no longer in service.

If on the other hand the emergency contact information is verified block NO then portions of process may be periodically repeated. For instance as shown process may return to block . In some implementations blocks may be performed more often or on a different interval than blocks and . While these other implementations may be used the order of blocks shown in is one example of an order in which the various blocks of process may be performed.

Process may include receiving a request for emergency contact information block . For example as described above with respect to contact lookup component emergency contact information server may receive a request with identifying information e.g. name telephone number address and or other information regarding a user. In some implementations the information may be provided via a user interface such as user interface shown in . In some implementations the information may be provided via a selection of an option on user device that is associated with the user e.g. as shown in . As also mentioned above the request may be made via programming interface component in some implementations.

Process may also include identifying manually provided emergency contact information block . For example as described above with respect to contact lookup component emergency contact information server may receive emergency contact information from contact repository that is associated with the user. This emergency contact information may in some implementations correspond to emergency contact information that was manually provided by the user.

Process may further include identifying dynamic emergency contact information based on location and or amount of communication block . For example as described above with respect to dynamic contact generation component emergency contact information server may identify dynamic contact information based on a location of the user and locations of contacts that are frequently communicated with by the user. As mentioned above e.g. with respect to dynamic emergency contact information may be advantageous in situations where a user is outside of a user s normal geographical location.

Process may additionally include ranking the emergency contacts based on location relationship communication amount and or whether the emergency contact is a manually provided emergency contact or a dynamic emergency contact block . For example as described above contact lookup component may rank the emergency contacts received for which information was received from contact repository and or dynamic contact generation component .

Process may also include generating a ranked emergency contact list based on the ranking block and outputting the ranked emergency contact list block . For example emergency contact information server may output the ranked emergency contact list to a requestor of the emergency contact information.

Bus may include one or more communication paths that permit communication among the components of device . Processor may include a processor microprocessor or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions. Memory may include any type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor and or any type of non volatile storage device that may store information for use by processor .

Input component may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to device such as a keyboard a keypad a button a switch a microphone a touch screen etc. Output component may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator such as a display a speaker one or more light emitting diodes LEDs etc.

Communication interface may include any transceiver like mechanism that enables device to communicate with other devices and or systems. For example communication interface may include an Ethernet interface an optical interface a coaxial interface a cellular radio or the like. Communication interface may include a wireless communication device such as an infrared IR receiver a Bluetooth radio or the like. The wireless communication device may be coupled to an external device such as a remote control a wireless keyboard a mobile telephone etc. In some embodiments device may include more than one communication interface . For instance device may include an optical interface and an Ethernet interface.
