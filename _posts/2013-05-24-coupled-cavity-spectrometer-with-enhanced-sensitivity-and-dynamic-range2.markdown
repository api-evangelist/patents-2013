title: Coupled cavity spectrometer with enhanced sensitivity and dynamic range
abstract: A coupled-cavity ring-down spectrometer utilizes an optical resonator to increase the reflectivity of ring-down cavity mirrors by adding external optical cavities that recycle light to the main cavity. These input and output cavities are made up of at least one coupling mirror and at least one movable recycling mirror. The movable recycling mirrors are coupled to at least one piezoelectric transducer, which generates movement of the recycling mirrors. The coupled-cavity ring-down configuration achieves higher spectrometer finesse, sensitivity and dynamic range.

The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 648 100 filed on May 17 2012 and to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 897 285 entitled Coupled Cavity Spectrometer With Enhanced Sensitivity and Dynamic Range filed on May 17 2013.

The present invention relates to the field of optical resonators and more specifically to coupled cavity optical resonators.

As used herein the term absorption coefficient is the loss per unit length also known as the extinction coefficient .

As used herein the term angle of reflection means the angle between the line that is perpendicular to a mirror surface and the direction of reflected light from the mirror.

As used herein the term recycling mirror or feedback mirror means a variably positioned mirror with a preselected reflectivity value which may be altered by repositioning.

As used herein the term detection limit means a dimensionless quantity and represents the minimum measurable fractional change in the laser beam intensity as it propagates through the length of the ring down cavity. The detection limit may be expressed as u tau Finesse . Where u tau is the uncertainty one standard deviation of the measured time constant and is the mean value of the measured time constant.

As used herein the term displacement means the difference in position of the recycling mirror due to the change in angle of reflection.

As used herein the term dynamic range means the range of the largest to smallest absorption strength signal as achieved by the overall reflectivity range achieved by a CRDS.

As used herein the term etalonging means the effect interference between unwanted reflections from external optical elements back to the ring down cavity.

As used herein the term finesse is a dimensionless measurement of the lifetime of the photon in the resonator that indicates the sensitivy of the resonator and as the sensitivity increases the finesse value increases.

As used herein the term piezoelectric transducer PZT means a device that provides micrometric linear translation or which actuates or displaces a recycling or feedback mirror and all functionally equivalent devices.

As used herein the term recycling mirror refers to a mirror external to the optical component that reflects light back into a cavity.

As used herein the term reflectivity value means a numeric value signifying the amount of light reflected from a mirror. A reflectivity value may be varied by positioning a mirror or according to the manufacturing specifications for the mirror.

As used herein the term sensitivity means a value reflecting the smallest quantity of change per unit length that a system is capable of measuring. There is an inverse relationship between sensitivity and finesse.

An optical cavity resonator is an arrangement of mirrors that forms a standing wave cavity for resonating light waves.

Cavity ring down spectroscopy CRDS is a highly sensitive optical spectroscopic technique that enables very precise measurement of samples that scatter and absorb light. CRDS is used to study gas liquid and dispersed aerosol samples which absorb light at specific wavelengths. CRDS can be used to determine mole fractions of analytes down to the parts per trillion level.

A CRDS setup measures how long it takes for the light to decay to 1 e of its initial intensity and this ring down time can be used to calculate the concentration of the absorbing substance present in the cavity. The laser is then turned off in order to allow the measurement of the exponentially decaying light intensity leaking from the cavity. During this decay light is reflected back and forth thousands of times between the mirrors giving an effective path length for the extinction on the order of a few kilometers.

A typical CRDS setup consists of a laser and one or more highly reflective mirrors generally two . The mirrors are placed in optical communication with each on opposite sides of a high finesse optical cavity. If a sample placed in a cavity absorbs light the amount of light decreases faster and the photon life is decreased.

The finesse of an optical cavity is represented as the total phase change in radians of the oscillating electromagnetic wave i.e. the laser beam over the time that the beam is trapped in the resonator. One exemplary equation that may be used to represent finesse is 2 effective path length round trip path length . Finesse equals 1 R where R is the intensity reflectivity of the ring down cavity mirror.

It is desirable to maximize the finesse value of an optical cavity in order to maximize the time a beam is trapped in the resonator referred to as the photon lifetime. The longer the photon lifetime the more sensitive the measurement.

In addition to finesse there are several other key performance parameters of a CRDS system known in the art. These measurements include wavelength coverage dynamic range detection limit and sensitivity.

CRDS systems may be configured for specific experimental needs by structurally altering attributes including 1 distance between mirrors in optical cavity 2 the angle of reflection of each mirror 3 the number of mirrors in a cavity and 4 the preselected reflectivity value of each mirror. It is also known in the art to use dielectric films to increase the reflectivity value.

One problem known in the art is that mirrors for CRDS applications are custom manufactured and have preselected reflectivity value depending on the experimental application for which they are used. The reflectivity value cannot be readily altered after manufacturing resulting in a need for numerous custom mirrors to perform exacting experimentation techniques.

Another problem known in the art is that custom mirrors generally have an upper bound on their reflectivity. Additionally commercially available mirrors generally have a maximum reflectivity value of 0.99999.

It is desirable to increase the maximum attainable reflectivity values available during an experimental process to allow CRDS measurements to be performed over a wider range of physical conditions.

It is further desirable to increase the key performance parameters attainable by a CRDS system known in the art including finesse wavelength coverage dynamic range detection limit and sensitivity.

The present invention uses controlled feedback of the probe laser beam to a ring down cavity which leads to interference between the internally circulating light and that which is fed back through one or more coupled cavities mirror ports. The channeled use of the interference etaloning alters the finesse of the optical resonator in a controlled and quantifiable manner. A coupled cavity component may be used for each primary ring down mirror. In various embodiments the number of coupled cavities may be equal to or less than the number of primary ring down mirrors used in standard ring down cavity.

The coupled cavity configuration enhances the performance of a spectrometer by increasing the finesse of an optical resonator. The invention reduces interferences known as etalons that cause u tau to increase. As u tau decreases so does the detection limit.

The coupled cavity configuration increases the key performance parameters of wavelength coverage dynamic range detection limit and sensitivity.

The invention achieves 10 to 40 fold lower detection limits and 20 fold wider range of concentration. The invention more than doubles the wavelength coverage for a given set of mirrors. The invention enables laser based spectrometer methods to be applied over a wider range of physical conditions than with current technology. Exemplary applications include rare and multiple substituted isotopologues CO CO O measurement of ultra low concentrations

It should be understood that no limitations on the scope of the invention are intended by describing these exemplary embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that alternate but functionally equivalent coupled cavity ring down spectrometers may be used. The inclusion of additional elements may be deemed readily apparent and obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.

It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale instead emphasis has been placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. In addition in the embodiments depicted herein like reference numerals in the various drawings refer to identical or near identical structural elements.

Moreover the terms substantially or approximately as used herein may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related.

One exemplary embodiment of a coupled cavity ring down spectrometer may utilize a 74 cm long ring down cavity and a feedback cavity with an approximate finesse of 16. The use of a dual cavity configuration increases the decay time constant from 210 s to 280 s corresponding to an increase of finesse from 2.7 10to 3.6 10. In this embodiment where a second recycle cavity is utilized ring down times as long as 0.5 ms which is equivalent to 1 R 4.9 10 where R is the effective mirror reflectivity may be achieved.

For an empty cavity with lossless mirrors i.e. no scattering or absorption of intensity reflectivity R and mirror to mirror distance L the ring down time constant is given by L cT where c is the speed of light and T 1 R is the mirror transmittance. The absorption coefficient of the cavity medium is inferred by measuring small changes in the ring down time and its limit of detection is nominally equal to TL. Here whose magnitude is influenced by statistical effects such as signal strength and detector and digitizer noise is the relative standard uncertainty in the measured ring down time . Long term averaging of to improve measurement precision is often limited by uncertainty and variability in the base losses T L that are caused by interference involving unwanted reflections from external optical elements back to the ring down cavity RDC .

This effect known as etaloning increases in importance as R approaches unity. Etaloning leads to an effective RDC mirror reflectivity R that can be greater or less than that of the isolated mirror. In CRDS and other cavity enhanced experiments etaloning is manifest by slow temporal variation and sinusoidal wavelength dependence in . This occurs because the effective base losses are sensitive to uncontrolled variations in the phase of the optical feedback from external cavities that are caused by drift in the relevant optical path lengths.

In the exemplary embodiment shown a voltage applied to PZT actuator allows for displacement of input feedback mirror and output feedback mirror to occur. The ring down cavity time constant is calculated from the etaloning between the input dichroic beam splitter DBS mirror and output dichroic beam splitter DBS mirror and the first primary ring down mirror and secondary primary ring down mirror . The input feedback mirror and output feedback mirror are then locked into position when the desired reading is achieved.

In the exemplary embodiment shown the coupled cavity ring down spectrometer utilizes a RDC that includes a first primary ring down mirror and second primary ring down mirror . First primary ring down mirror and second primary ring down mirror have intensity reflectivities Rand Rrespectively. The coupled cavity ring down spectrometer has an input feedback cavity and an output feedback cavity which consists of two feedback mirrors and and a DBS mirror or

For the isolated RDC system the geometric mean value of the reflectivity is given by R RR . In various embodiments the coupled cavity ring down spectrometer system in which there is retroflection to the RDC Rand Rcan be replaced by their respective effective values which we denote by rand r. This enables us to describe an equivalent two mirror RDC with a coupled cavity system that takes into account the light recycling influence of the recycling mirrors or . Analysis of rand rrequires that one include not only the principal reflection occurring at each RDC mirror but also interference by the transmitted field that is fed back through the cavity end mirror from the feedback mirrors and

In the embodiment shown in the value rcan be used to express how time constants change as the mirror rcorresponds to the first primary ring down mirror and is no longer equal to the square of its wavelength dependent absolute reflectivity r as in an isolated RDC system but is a function of t 1 r 2 L 1 r r t and C where

An expression for ris obtained by evaluating r rtS where the first term corresponds to the directly reflected part rA and the second term is the feedback contribution. Here r 1 and S Crrte n 0 rrrte is the dimensionless circulating field amplitude which has undergone multiple round trips in the external FBC. Evaluating this summation leads to an effective intensity reflectivity for Mof where we note that assuming r 1 the second term in the sum corresponds to the Airy transmission formula for a resonator with round trip losses of rrrtand phase delay of 2 .

From the modified RDC time constant in the case of light recycling through the input mirror Mby the FBC is given as L c 1 rR . In the curve A shows a calculation of the modified RDC time constant for an ideally lossless system t C 1 as a function of the input FBM displacement L L L. The calculations are based on the CC RDS system experimental values discussed below L L 74 cm R R 99.9988 equivalent to T 1.2 10and corresponding to the measured decay time 210 s for the TEMmode of the isolated RDC R 0.71 for the sagittal field polarization s polarization at 940 nm and R R. The self mixing effect leads to a 2 periodic L dependent modulation in about . For in phase self mixing of the two fields the original value of T 1.2 10for Mis reduced two fold to T 5.9 10 280 s . This change in effective mirror transmittance which is caused by the addition of the feedback resonator with a finesse of about 16 F square root over Rm 1 R where R RRR is the mean reflectivity of the FBC corresponds to an increase in F from 2.7 10 isolated ring down cavity to 3.6 10 coupled cavity case .
