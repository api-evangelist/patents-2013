Many organizations obtain store and or safeguard private information and or data relating to individuals. Data breach events may occur in which private data becomes unprotected is removed is stolen and or otherwise transferred from the control of an organization. Breach events may result from for example the actions of malicious outside parties accidental disclosure and or other causes. Upon the occurrence of a breach event one or more entities including for example federal government state government foreign government political union law enforcement private entity and other entities may each require compliance with complex specific rules regulations and laws related to data breach reporting. Complying with all of the applicable laws rules and regulations upon the occurrence of a data breach event may therefore be cumbersome.

Briefly aspects of the present disclosure are directed to methods and systems for data breach compliance. Organization related information may be received. Breach information relating to a data breach event of the organization may be received. The breach information may include for example breach event description information compromised personally identifiable information and remediation action information. A breach report may be generated based on the breach information the organization related information and one or more rules related to data breach. At least one reporting entity may be determined based on the organization related information the breach information and the one or more rules. The breach report may be output.

In some aspects an organization may for example store information related to one or more individuals. An organization may for example store information in an electronic storage location physical storage location and or any other type of storage. The stored information may include for example personally identifiable information PII related to one or more individuals.

In some aspects organization related information may be received from a user via an input output device e.g. input output structure of . A user may for example enter information into system using a keyboard pointer device mouse microphone camera and or any other type of input device. In some aspects organization related information may be received from a system device and or apparatus separate from system . Organization related information may for example be transferred to system over any suitable communication medium e.g. the internet in for example a data file. In some aspects information regarding a breach event may be communicated over the phone and a representation of the telephone communication e.g. a phone conversation may be received as breach information.

In operation breach information related to a data breach event of the organization may be received. The breach information may include for example breach event description information compromised PII and remediation action information. A breach event may occur in many different circumstances in which information is transferred to moved to altered by disclosed to and or otherwise accessed by a third party. A breach event may be the result of for example theft trespass loss and or other type of wrongdoing. A breach event may also occur inadvertently.

Breach event description information e.g. a description of the breach event may include for example a description of a breach event or suspected breach event. Breach event information may include for example names of persons associated with review of the breach event. Breach event information may for example include date s on which the breach occurred estimated or actual time s at which the breach occurred estimated or actual time s at which the breach is suspected to have occurred date and or time s at which the breach was discovered location s of breach event a description of the breach event and or any other information related to the breach event. Breach event information may include equipment related to the breach event. Equipment related to the breach event may include for example electronic data storage equipment e.g. on computer s laptop s mobile device s server s hard drive s portable storage device s thumb drive s USB device s CD s DVD s tape s and or or any other electronic storage location and or media physical storage equipment e.g. a vault locked room protected room safe and or other physical storage equipment . Breach event information may include information representing impact on parties and or entities associated with and or related to the organization e.g. data hosting companies middleware software applications business associates banks financial institutions merchant service providers or other parties . Breach event information may include for example a description of the facts associated with the event including whether the breach event was a loss or theft of a device and or media an internal system breach a result of insider wrongdoing an external system breach e.g. hacking cracking and or theft an inadvertent disclosure and or any other type of event.

Compromised PII may include for example information disclosed stolen removed compromised acquired and or otherwise interfered with as a result of the breach event. PII may include for example information that may be used to uniquely identify contact and or locate a single individual. PII may include for example name date of birth social security number driver s license number credit card number debit card number check routing number check transit number bank account numbers tax identification numbers personal identification number s PIN security code s access code s medical information and or any other type of information that may be used to uniquely identify an individual. Compromised PII may include a list of individuals number of individuals or other data representing the individuals affected by a breach event. By way of example compromised PII may include names residence information e.g. address city state and or country of residence type s of PII disclosed e.g. a name or other personal identifier and social security number driver s license number financial account number credit card number etc. and possibly other information representative of individuals affected by the data breach.

Remediation action information may include for example information relating to actions taken and or performed by an organization in response to a breach event. In response to a breach an organization may for example perform actions including notifying entities e.g. law enforcement authorities credit card companies parent company affiliates customer s bank s ISO Merchant service provider s government entities and or other entities as discussed below performing internal investigation s conducting internal audit s and or any other action s taken by an organization in response to a breach event. An organization may for example confiscate equipment related to the breach event. An organization may for example respond to a breach event by changing data storage policies increasing security measures altering data storage locations increasing protection of stored information and performing other actions. Remediation action information may include for example a description of actions performed date and time of actions performed and possibly other information.

In some aspects breach information may be received in an input field e.g. in a web browser word processing application or other type of application from a user. Breach information may alternatively be received at for example system as a text file e.g. comma separated values file spreadsheet or other type of data file. Text received at system may be organized and or separated into breach event description information compromised PII and remediation action information using text recognition data mining or other techniques.

In some aspects information regarding a breach event may be received through an application programming interface API for example associated with the system . For example an API may be provided to an organization e.g. a financial institution . The API may be included in e.g. embedded in a secure web page for example accessible only by representatives of the organization. Upon detection of a breach event breach information may be entered by the organization e.g. the financial institution into data entry fields within the API.

In some aspects audio representative of breach information may be received and the audio may be converted to text using a speech to text conversion operation or any other suitable audio conversion operation. By way of example a user may provide audio e.g. a voice recording a voicemail message a recorded phone call including information related to a data breach. The audio may be received by for example system and may be converted to text using any suitable speech to text operation. The text may be organized and or separated by system into breach event description information compromised PII and remediation action information. The text may be organized and or separated using text recognition data mining or other techniques. For example audio may be converted to text and the text may be searched for one or more keywords phrases or terms. The keywords phrases or terms may for example relate to the breach event description PII remediation action information or other information associated with data breach. The text may be categorized into breach event description information compromised PII and remediation action information based on the results of the search.

In operation a breach report may be generated based on the breach information the organization related information and rules related to data breach e.g. data breach reporting rules . For example a breach report may be or may include a document populated form table audio recording video and or any other medium for presenting information. A breach report may for example include organization related information breach event description information compromised PII remediation action information and other information organized in a predetermined format. The predetermined format may for example be dictated by applicable data breach reporting rules e.g. state laws federal laws private entity rules clarity considerations and or other factors. In some aspects the predetermined format may be determined based on applicable international e.g. European Union EU and or foreign country data breach reporting rules and or regulations.

Rules related to data breach may be for example federal laws e.g. federal privacy laws federal regulations e.g. federal privacy regulations federal court opinions federal trade commission FTC administrative decisions and consent decrees state laws state regulations state attorney general consent decrees company privacy policies industry policies international privacy laws e.g. EU privacy laws or any country s privacy laws international regulations e.g. EU privacy regulations or any country s privacy regulations international court decisions and or opinions and or any other rules regulations statutes laws and or guidelines.

In some aspects a breach report may be generated based on the organization related information breach information and rules related to data breach. The organization related information breach information and rules related to data breach may be used to for example determine the rules applicable to a specific data breach event of an organization. The one or more data breach reporting rules organization related information breach information and possibly other information may for example be stored in a database and organized into matrices or any other suitable data structure. In order to determine the rules related to data breach applicable to a specific data breach event organization related information breach information and potentially other information may be compared to rules related to data breach e.g. stored in a database . Text searching data comparison and other operations may be used to determine rules applicable to the data breach. Conditional logic may for example be used to determine which of one or more data breach reporting rules may be applicable based on the organization related information the breach information and possibly other information. In some aspects a decision tree graphical model or other suitable approaches may be used to determine applicable data breach reporting rules.

In operation at least one reporting entity may be determined and or selected based on the organization related information breach information one or more rules and possibly other information. A reporting entity may be for example a federal government agency e.g. Office for Civil Rights Office of Health and Human Services Secret Service and or any other government agency a state government agency e.g. Office of the Attorney General for a state Office of Cyber Security Department of State Division of Consumer Protection State Department of Health or any other state government agency international government agency e.g. an EU and or foreign government agency private entity e.g. a credit card company a business an organization and or any other private entity an individual e.g. an individual affected by the data breach event and or any other entity.

At least one reporting entity may be determined and or selected based on the organization related information breach information and one or more rules applicable to data breach. There may be for example no single law e.g. state law federal law international law law of a foreign country etc. statute and or regulation that governs an organization s obligations in the event of a data breach. Instead there may be an evolving patchwork of international federal and states laws and regulations E transaction laws evidentiary rules industry standards and other rules governing the use of personal information. Text searching data comparison and other operations may be used to determine rules applicable to the data breach. Conditional logic may for example be used to determine which of one or more data breach reporting rules may be applicable based on the organization related information the breach information and possibly other information. In some aspects a decision tree graphical model or other suitable approaches may be used to determine applicable data breach reporting rules. Based on the applicable rules at least one reporting entity may be determined and or selected.

In some aspects rules e.g. federal laws state laws private entity rules and or any other rules related to and or applicable to data breach may be updated modified and or altered. Updates to rules applicable to data breach may be received from for example subscription services organizational memberships news data feeds and or any other source of information. The information used to update applicable rules may for example be reviewed monitored curated and or supervised by a user e.g. a subject matter expert in for example data breach compliance . Similarly outdated information may be removed from a database of rules by for example system and or a user. A process of determining a reporting entity may be updated and or refined based on additions changes and or modifications to rules related to and or applicable to data breach.

In some aspects the reporting entities associated with a breach report may be determined based on remediation action information. For example if the remediation action information indicates that an entity has been notified that entity will not be selected or determined to be a reporting entity.

According to some aspects reporting entities may be determined based on at least one geographic location associated with the data breach event. The at least one geographic location may be based for example on organization related information breach information and one or more rules related to data breach. By way of example if the organization is a business incorporated in and or having a presence in a specific state that state s laws may be applicable to a data breach event of that organization. Similarly if PII related to individuals who reside in a certain state is breached and that state s laws include long reach and or long arm provisions extending its jurisdiction to other states that state s laws may be applicable to the data breach event. If for example compromised PII includes information related to residents of multiple countries and or countries other than the United States international laws e.g. EU or foreign country rules and regulations may be applicable to a data breach event of that organization.

According to some aspects reporting entities may be determined and or selected based on one or more types of breached data. One or more types of breached data may be determined based on for example compromised PII. For example compromised PII may include health care related information e.g. medical records associated with one or more individuals. State laws federal laws e.g. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH federal agency regulations and other rules applicable to health care privacy and or security may be deemed applicable. A reporting entity may for example be determined based on applicable rules and the type of data breached. For example federal state international foreign country and possibly other health care related agencies may be deemed reporting entities.

In operation a breach report may be output. A breach report may for example be output to a user of system . A breach report may for example be output to a reporting entity e.g. crime enforcement agency federal government agency state agency foreign government agency private entity credit card company and or other type of entity .

In some aspects a list or other data structure including one or more reporting entities and addresses associated with the reporting entities may be generated based on the organization related information the breach information and the rules related to the data breach event. A breach report may be output to the reporting entities at the addresses. An address associated with an reporting entity may be for example a mailing address an email address a website address an file transfer protocol FTP site or any other type of address. The breach report may be output to the reporting entity at the address by for example transmitting the report to the address via email electronic file transfer e.g. FTP file transfer or using other approaches. The breach report may be output as one or more physical documents a digital file or any other format.

In some aspects a database may be updated to include received organization related information breach information and a generated breach report. The database may include information relating to multiple organizations multiple data breach events and other related information. The database may be used to analyze information related to breach events. In some aspects a request for one or more breach reports related to a selected organization may be received. In response to the request a list of breach reports related to a selected organization may be generated based on the organization related information the breach information and one or more breach reports in the database.

In there is shown a flow diagram which defines steps of a method according to aspects of the present disclosure. Organization related information may be received and in some aspects stored during an account or profile creation operation. An account or profile associated with an organization may be generated to include organization related information e.g. name of organization contact information and other information as discussed previously in connection with .

In response to a data breach event or suspicion of a data breach event breach information may be received by for example system . As described above a breach report may be generated based on the stored organization related information breach information and rules related to data breach. Based on a comparison of the organization related information the breach information and rules related to data breach it may be determined whether the breach report is in a proper format. In some aspects whether a breach report is in a proper format may be determined based on for example state rules federal rules international rules e.g. EU regulations industry standards or other rules applicable to the breach event. For example rules related to data breach reporting in New York North Carolina some federal agencies and possibly other entities may require breach reports be generated in an entity specific format. An entity specific format may be for example a form including predetermined data entry fields or any other type of format. A breach report may be generated and or modified to conform to an entity specific format.

In some aspects a breach report may be reviewed to ensure that the breach report includes correct information complete information correctly formatted information and otherwise conforms to a predefined set of standards. In a review operation a breach report may be output to for example a user to a system external to system and or any other system or device for review. Modified and or updated organization related information and breach information may be received by for example system . Modified organization related information and modified breach information may be generated by for example system in an error detection and or correction operation performed on the breach report. Modified organization related information and modified breach information may be generated by a user e.g. a breach report review specialist based on for example a review of the breach report. The breach report may be updated based on the modified organization related information and modified breach information. A breach report may be updated by for example generating a breach report based on modified organization related information modified breach information and data breach reporting rules.

In some aspects at least one reporting entity may be determined or selected based on the organization related information the breach information and one or more rules. If for example the data breach occurred in the United States and or affected United States citizens residents and or people located in the United States at least one reporting entity may be determined or selected based on rules related to the U.S. federal government state government s and or other entities. If for example the data breach occurred in a country other than the U.S. and or affected non U.S. citizens residents and or people located outside the United States at least one reporting entity may be determined based on rules related to the one or more political unions e.g. the European Union foreign government s state government s and or other entities.
