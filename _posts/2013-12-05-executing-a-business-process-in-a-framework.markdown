Embodiments generally relate to computer systems and more particularly to methods and systems for executing a customized business process in a business process framework.

Enterprise content management generally relates to managing content involving digital data that may be dependent on business processes influenced by attributes such as industry geography lines of business customers product lines and the like. For instance a multinational company having employees throughout the world and having a product portfolio that addresses multiple employee solutions has to provide documentation which supports easy generation of country industry and language specific content. The content may be marketing documents presentations sales pitches cost benefit calculations forms tables files and the like. While much of the content may need to be customized to the business process there is a lot of redundant content that is repeated for each of the processes. There is a need for methods and systems for reusing as much of the available content as possible and for developing the content that is specific to the business process in order to minimize redundancy of development and maintenance efforts.

Various embodiments of systems and methods for configuring a framework to execute a business process are described herein. To customize the business process a user selection of a solution type corresponding to a business process is received from a user interface. In response to the user selection a query is executed to retrieve application types and corresponding sub application types from a business logic associated with the business process. In an embodiment the business logic is stored in a database. Configurable attributes for the solution type are generated based upon the application types and the corresponding sub application types. The business process is customized based upon the application types the corresponding sub application types and the configurable attributes to create a customized business process in a business process framework. Based upon a configuration information associated with the configurable attributes a user input is captured from the user interface for the customized business process. The configuration information associated with the configurable attributes is stored in the business logic. The user input to the customized business process is validated to execute the customized business process in the business process framework. The validation is carried out by comparing the user input to the customized business process with the business logic associated with the business process. The customized business process that is validated is further executed in the business process framework.

In an embodiment the validation process further includes displaying an error message on the user interface. The error message may originate due to an invalid user selection an invalid user input to the attribute an invalid file attached with the user input or the like. The validity of the above user actions is determined based upon the business logic. In response to such error messages error correction information is generated based upon the business process. Metadata of the business process is associated with the business logic and is stored in a database along with the business logic and the business process. The metadata is use to determine the error messages and to generate the error correction information. In an embodiment the error messages are displayed on the user interface based upon a role of the user. Each user has an associated role that allows the user to perform certain operations on the business process. Each user may also be associated with a set of user actions for the customized business process and based upon the validation such user actions are sent to the user for execution. In another embodiment the configurable attributes are configured to send an alert to the user to perform the associated user action.

In an embodiment the user input to the customized business process and the user actions are stored as transaction data in the database. The database is updated with the transaction data based upon the execution of the business process. The transaction data may be tracked at specific instances of the business process to provide specific status updates at the respective instances. In an embodiment the customized business process may be invoked to update the transaction data in the database.

In an embodiment the application types and the corresponding sub application types are mapped based upon a hierarchy in the business process. The hierarchy in the business process may depend upon a priority of the application types and the corresponding sub application types. The hierarchy includes a set of multiple levels of the application types and the corresponding sub application types. Each level in the hierarchy may be associated with a set of users and corresponding user actions. A notification may be sent from the business logic to include the users at different levels in the hierarchy. The user actions may also be requested at different levels in the hierarchy.

In an embodiment the user input to the customized business process may include configuring a set of tasks that have to be performed on the applications and sub applications authorizations for validating the customized business processes fields and field types for displaying on the user interface field actions for the fields visibility statuses validity statuses and accessibility options.

In another embodiment the business logic is configured to define generic application definitions and associated generic application types and sub application types dynamic screen rendering fields associated generic application screen rendering fields a set of values for the dynamic screen rendering fields and the associated generic application screen rendering fields. The business logic is also configured to maintain a set of generic configurable attributes for the generic application types and the corresponding generic sub application types along with a set of generic tasks generic authorizations generic fields and corresponding generic field types generic field actions generic validity statuses generic visibility statuses and generic accessibilities. All of the contents of the business logic act as metadata to the corresponding business process.

These and other benefits and features of embodiments will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof presented in connection with the following drawings.

Embodiments of techniques for systems and methods for configuring a framework to execute a business process are described herein. A business process may be described as an arrangement of a collection of inter dependent actions with a purpose of achieving an intended result. Business processes may be independently operational or supportive of other processes.

The configuration information of configurable attributes further include actions to be performed on application types and corresponding sub application types authorizations for validating business process fields and field types for displaying on the user interface field actions for the fields validity and visibility of the fields accessibilities for the applications types and the sub application types and the like.

Business logic associated with business process is also stored in database . Business logic includes a set of functional rules associated with business process based upon which the metadata of business process is exchanged between database and a user interface. Business logic illustrates functional rules for the collection of objects present in a business process framework . Business logic regulates the interaction between application types sub application types configurable attributes solution types the user interface user inputs to the user interface and the like. Business logic implements methods by which the contents of the business logic and the associated data in database have to be accessed and updated. Business logic also represents functional rules associated with one or more workflows involving business processes . Business logic maintains the processes involved in workflows data management of the workflows user actions required at different stages users interactions with business process and the like. Business logic stores configuration information associated with the configurable attributes. The configuration information may include an information associated with the configurable attributes that allows the configurable attributes to be configured in an intended manner.

An application type may be described as a set of available features for a solution type where each application type defines a business task associated with the solution type. A sub application type may be described as a set of available features for a corresponding application type where each sub application type defines a sub task associated with the application type. Application type provides a set of available features for solution type . Sub application type provides a set of available features for a selected feature of application type . For instance a business process of applying for a leave of absence in an organization includes a set of solution types leaves of absence in USA leaves of absence in UK leaves of absence in Australia and the like.

Based upon a user s properties for e.g. geographic location user s eligibility user s role in the organization a set of solution types displays for a selected business process. If the user selection of a solution type is leaves of absence in Australia configuration module executes a query in database to retrieve a set of application types illness leave casual leave examination leave and the like along with corresponding set of sub application types anticipate leave adjust against loss of pay adjust against compensated day and the like. In an embodiment the sub application types may exist in multiple levels where a first level sub application type invokes a second level sub application type. For instance for a sub application type of adjust against compensated day a second level sub application type of adjust against working on weekend adjust against working on holiday and the like may be invoked.

In an embodiment application types and corresponding sub application types are mapped based upon a hierarchy in business process . The hierarchy in business process may depend upon a priority of application types and corresponding sub application types . For instance a first application having a first sub application and a second sub application is at a higher level when compared to a second application having a third sub application. There may be a need for the first application and the corresponding sub applications to be executed prior to the second sub application and the corresponding sub applications. The mapping is done based upon a priority of occurrence of application types and corresponding sub application types . The hierarchy includes a set of multiple levels of application types and corresponding sub application types . Each level in the hierarchy may be associated with a set of users and corresponding user actions. A notification may be sent from business logic to include the users at different levels in the hierarchy. The user actions may also be requested at different levels in the hierarchy.

Based upon the application types and the corresponding sub application types configuration module generates one or more configurable attributes for the solution type . Configuration module may generate configurable attributes based upon business logic in database . A configurable attribute defines a set of configurable parameters for a business entity where the parameters are properties or values of the business entity. Configurable attributes are associated with metadata of a business entity the metadata of the business entity includes the business information of the entity the configurable attributes describe the properties or values of the business information. Configurable attribute for solution type may include configuring a set of tasks that have to be performed on the applications and corresponding sub applications authorizations for validating the customized business processes fields and field types for displaying on the user interface field actions for the fields visibility statuses validity statuses and accessibility options. Configurable attribute is associated with the configuration describing the manner in which the configurable attribute is configured. For instance a configurable attribute that includes a set of tasks may have configuration that describe the manner in which the tasks have to be performed.

Based upon the application types the corresponding sub application types and the configurable attributes business process is customized to create customized business process .

The fields and field types that are configured to accept user input may include a drop down menu a checkbox a text box a value set a hyper link and the like. The user input to these fields may include selecting an option from a list of options in a drop down menu making a selection in a checkbox entering alpha numeric input in a text box clicking on a hyper link and the like. In an embodiment a field type may include a multiple field table. A multiple field table may be described as a table that includes a set of rows for different instances of the application types and corresponding sub application types.

In an embodiment the user input and the user actions are stored as transaction data in the database . The database is updated with the transaction data based upon the execution of the business process . The transaction data may be tracked at specific instances of the business process to provide specific status updates at the respective instances. In an embodiment the customized business process may be invoked to update the corresponding transaction data in the database .

User input to customized business process is validated to configure customized business process . The validation of user input to customized business process is determined by comparing user input with business logic of business process . Based upon a result of this comparison user input to customized business process is validated. The result of comparison may be described as the information discovered during the process including a successful comparison result if user input to customized business process matches the details in business logic and an error message if the user input to customized business process does not match the details in business logic .

In an embodiment the error message may originate due to an invalid user selection an invalid user input to the attribute an invalid file attached with the user input or the like. The validity of the user actions may be determined based upon business logic . In response to such error messages error correction information is generated based upon business process . The metadata of business process is use to determine the error messages and to generate the error correction information. In an embodiment the error messages are displayed on the user interface based upon a role of the user. Each user has an associated role that allows the user to perform certain operations on the business process . For instance an error correction related to a remuneration of an employee may be displayed only to a user with a role of a manager and may not be available to a user with a role of a team member . A user X may be assigned a role of an approver that allows the user X to approve certain requests on the business process. A user Y may be assigned a role of an employee that allows the user Y to request certain requests on the business process.

Each user may also be associated with a set of user actions for the customized business process and based upon the validation of the user input such user actions are sent to the user for execution. For instance a user with a role of a manager may have an edit action available to perform on customized business process and a user with a role of a team member may have a display action available to perform on customized business process . The user with the role of a manager may validate user input to customized business object based upon the error message by performing an edit on customized business process . In another embodiment the configurable attributes are configured to send an alert to the user to perform the associated user action. The alert may be a generated at regular intervals to remind the user for performing the action. The alert may be periodic appearing in the user s mail box on a specific day. The alert may also be associated with a validity period before which the action specified by the alert has to be performed. Some of the many user actions include an approval user action a rejection user action a modification user action a validation user action an invalidation user action and the like.

Based upon the error correction information configurable attributes may be reconfigured to customize the business process . User input to customized business process is validated by comparing user input to business logic . Customized business process is further executed in the business process framework . In an embodiment customized business process is invoked to update the corresponding transaction data in the database .

In an embodiment business logic is configured to define generic application definitions and associated generic application types and generic sub application types. Business logic is also configured to define dynamic screen rendering fields associated generic application screen rendering fields a set of values for the dynamic screen rendering fields and the associated generic application screen rendering fields. The generic elements listed above are a part of a generic application server that stores the user inputs user selection retrieved application types sub application types generated configurable attributes and the like. The generic application server may include a generic table that stores all properties related to the generic elements. The generic application server is also responsible for maintaining a group of available business processes and the associated solution types for the available business process. The generic application server may also include metadata of the business processes and the associated solution types.

Generic application definition may be described as a generic element associated with the generic application server that stores a list of all available solution types and their association with one or more respective business processes. Once a user chooses a solution type related to a business process a generic table in the generic element server is created and updated with the solution type. Generic application types and corresponding generic sub application types may be described as the generic elements that store in the generic table a list of all available application types corresponding sub application types their hierarchy their levels of priorities alert information and all other details associated with the application types and corresponding sub application types. When a query is invoked to retrieve a set of application types and corresponding set of sub application types based upon a solution type selected by a user the generic table for the respective business process and the selected solution type is identified. Based upon the generic application types and corresponding generic sub application types available in the table the application types and corresponding sub application types associated with the selected solution types are retrieved on the user interface.

Dynamic screen rendering fields may be described as a set of data fields that are invoked to be displayed in the user interface based upon certain tasks performed by the user on the user interface. For instance to display a set of solution types for a specific business process the generic table in the generic application server is invoked. Based upon the generic application definition available for the specific business process a dynamic screen is created on the user interface including the dynamic screen rendering fields containing a list of solution types and associated options of selecting the solution types.

Generic application screen rendering fields may be described as a set of data fields that are associated with the set of available generic application types and the corresponding generic application types available for the solution types of a specific business process. Based upon application types and corresponding sub application types that are invoked by the query the generic screen rendering fields that are associated with the application types and the sub application types are also invoked. These generic application screen rendering fields containing the application types and the sub application types are displayed on the user interface. The generic application screen rendering fields include one or more values that may be assigned to the application types and the corresponding sub application types by the user. These values indicate the user s input to the application types and the corresponding sub application types.

The generic application server is also responsible for maintaining a set of generic configurable attributes for all the application types and corresponding sub application types for the selected solution type. Based upon the retrieved application types and the corresponding sub application types the configurable attributes are generated by extracting one or more relevant configurable attributes from the generic table present in the generic application server. Based upon the user inputs to the application types and corresponding sub application types the configurable attributes are configured. Metadata required for this configuration information is also stored in the generic application table.

The generic table stored in the generic application server maintains the generic tasks and generic authorizations that are available for each business processes. Generic fields and corresponding generic field types define the fields and the field types that may be displayed on the screen. For instance for an application type illness leave a generic field Illness Leave is displayed on the user interface along with a drop down field type showing a list of available illness leaves in the drop down list. There may be a generic field action associated with the generic field and the generic field type. This generic field action allows a user to perform an action on the generic field type. For instance if the generic field type was a check box the associated generic field action allows a user to put a check in the respective field. The available generic fields generic field types and generic field actions for the business process are stored in the generic table.

The generic table also maintains generic validity statuses generic visibility statuses and generic accessibilities that can be used during configuring the configurable attributes. Generic validity statuses represents the available validity statuses that can be assigned to the configurable attributes such as in process processed awaiting approval approved and the like. The generic visibility statuses represent the visibility statuses that can be assigned to the configurable attributes with reference to a role of the user. For instance for a user with a role of a manager the visibility status may be to read and write and for a user with a role of a team member the visibility status may be to read only . Similarly the generic accessibilities represent the accessibility options for particular information based upon the role of the user. For instance a user with a role of a manager is allowed to read and write the remuneration information for each team member . All these information stored in the generic table of the generic application server are stored as metadata in the business logic associated with the business process.

An example for executing a customized business process of reimbursement is described herein. The business process of reimbursement has the associated metadata stored in business logic. Solution types associated with reimbursement are retrieved from business logic. Solution types may include reimbursement of travel expenses reimbursement of medical expenses and reimbursement of education expenses . A user selection of a solution type reimbursement of travel expenses is selected from the user interface. Based upon reimbursement of travel expenses configuration module executes a query in database to retrieve a set of associated applications travel for training business development travel and home leave travel along with corresponding sub application types length of stay proof of expenses bills cash payments credit card payments and required approvers . Each of the application types and sub application types may accept different types of inputs. For instance sub application type length of stay may accept a user input of number of days only.

Based upon the application types and sub application types configuration module generates configurable attributes number of days attachments of bills credit card statements approvals and the like. Thus the business process of reimbursement is customized to reimbursement of travel expenses along with the associated application types corresponding sub application types and the configurable attributes. The user may choose to provide a user input of selecting business development travel and attaching a bill for team dinner to proof of expenses bills select a radio button option for cash payments and select manager from a drop down menu providing a list of approvers for required approver . The user input is assigned to the customized business process. For instance attachments of bills is assigned bill for team dinner along with a copy of the bill and manager approval is assigned manager approval .

The customized business process of reimbursement of travel for business development along with bill for team dinner that was paid by cash and requires manager approval for reimbursement is created. This user input to the customized business process is validated by comparing it with business logic that stores the metadata of the actual business process . Based upon a result of comparison the process of getting a reimbursement of travel is executed in business process framework .

An error message that may occur in such a process may be due to a mismatch between the user input to customized business process and business logic . For instance according to business logic for business process attachments of the type .pdf portable document format of Adobe Systems is the only attachment type that is accepted. If the user has attached files of any other file type an error message is generated during validation.

Configuration module also generates an error correction information for such error messages based upon business logic . For instance an error correction message invalid attachment file type may appear on the user interface. Once the user changes the file type of the attachment the attributes are reconfigured and customized business process is validated and executed in business process framework . A manager of the user may get an alert to approve such a reimbursement request and based upon his approval the customized business process is sent to a finance department to make a reimbursement.

Another example for executing a customized business process of income tax declaration is described herein. The business process of income tax declaration has the associated metadata stored in business logic . Solution types associated with income tax declaration are retrieved from business logic . Solution types may include income tax declaration for Japan income tax declaration for India and income tax declaration for France . A user selection of a solution type income tax declaration for India is selected from the user interface. Based upon income tax declaration for India configuration module executes a query in database to retrieve a set of associated applications along with corresponding sub application types as shown in table 1 . Each of the application types and sub application types may accept different types of inputs as shown in table 1 . Based upon the application types and sub application types configuration module generates configurable attributes shown in table 1 .

Based upon the selected solution type associated application types corresponding sub application types and configurable attributes business process is customized to create customized business process . The user input to customized business process is captured. The user may choose to provide a user input of selecting an application type deductions under government saving schemes and attaching a medical bill of .pdf type for sub application type medical insurance along with an amount of bill INR 2500 numeric and a self selected from a drop down menu status for whom the medicines were purchased. Based upon the user inputs the customized business process is configured. For instance medical insurance is assigned medical bill along with the amount INR 2500 and self status. The customized business process of income tax declaration for India along with medical bill of an amount INR 2500 for self is created. The user input to the customized business process is validated by comparing it with business logic that stores the metadata of the actual business process . Based upon a result of comparison the process of income tax declaration is executed in business process framework .

An error message that may occur in such a process may be due to a mismatch between customized business process and business logic . For instance according to business logic for business process the amount for medical allowance according to income tax declaration in India is only INR 2000 . Since the user has declared INR 2500 an error message is generated during validation. Configuration module also generates an error correction information for such error messages based upon business logic . For instance an error correction message medical allowance limit is INR 2000 may appear on the user interface. Once the user changes the amount and the corresponding attachments the attributes are reconfigured and the business process of income tax declaration is customized. Customized business process is validated and executed in business process framework .

If the result of comparison does not generate errors at decision block the process proceeds to process block where the customized business process is executed in the business process framework.

In process block the result of the comparison is displayed on the user interface. In process block a user action is received for the result of comparison. The user action may include an approval of the result of comparison a rejection of the result of comparison and a subsequent correction in the application types the corresponding sub application types or the configured configurable attributes a modification in the configured configurable attributes a validation action or an invalidation action. Based upon the user action the user input to the customized business process that is validated to configure the business process framework is further executed in the business process framework at process block . In an embodiment based upon the user action received at process block the user input to the customized business process may be re validated and further executed. In an embodiment an invalidation action may lead to a deletion of one or more configured configurable attributes. Based upon such a deletion the customized business process may be re validated and executed.

Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level e.g. a graphical user interface . These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server client peer to peer or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.

The above illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions. The term computer readable storage medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media that stores one or more sets of instructions. The term computer readable storage medium should be taken to include any physical article that is capable of undergoing a set of physical changes to physically store encode or otherwise carry a set of instructions for execution by a computer system which causes the computer system to perform any of the methods or process steps described represented or illustrated herein. A computer readable storage medium may be a non transitory computer readable storage medium. Examples of a non transitory computer readable storage media include but are not limited to magnetic media such as hard disks floppy disks and magnetic tape optical media such as CD ROMs DVDs and holographic devices magneto optical media and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs programmable logic devices PLDs and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of computer readable instructions include machine code such as produced by a compiler and files containing higher level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example an embodiment may be implemented using Java C or other object oriented programming language and development tools. Another embodiment may be implemented in hard wired circuitry in place of or in combination with machine readable software instructions.

A data source is an information resource. Data sources include sources of data that enable data storage and retrieval. Data sources may include databases such as relational transaction hierarchical multi dimensional e.g. OLAP object oriented databases and the like. Further data sources include tabular data e.g. spreadsheets delimited text files data tagged with a markup language e.g. XML data transaction data unstructured data e.g. text files screen scrapings hierarchical data e.g. data in a file system XML data files a plurality of reports and any other data source accessible through an established protocol such as Open Data Base Connectivity ODBC produced by an underlying software system e.g. ERP system and the like. Data sources may also include a data source where the data is not tangibly stored or otherwise ephemeral such as data streams broadcast data and the like. These data sources can include associated data foundations semantic layers management systems security systems and so on.
