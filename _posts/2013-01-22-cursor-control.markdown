Embodiments described herein generally relate to schemes for cursor control and in particular to controlling a cursor in a computer system comprising more than one display region for example a computer system for displaying different images derived from medical image data on different display screens.

A well known aspect of user interfaces commonly associated with computer systems is the provision of pointing devices for controlling a cursor pointer on a display. Typically a pointing device will be a physical input device such as a mouse track pad joystick or stylus based digitizer which responds to movements by a user to cause a cursor displayed on a display to move in a corresponding manner thereby allowing a user to intuitively move the cursor around the display for example to indicate selections relating to what is displayed on the screen by pointing and clicking .

One field in which computer systems are frequently used to view image data is in the medical imaging field. For example a user may wish to view images derived from studying a patient with an imaging modality such as X ray computer assisted tomography CT magnetic resonance MR ultrasound and positron emission tomography PET data sets. In particular a user may wish to view displays of medical image data to analyze various aspects of the data for example by taking measurements therefrom. Measurements may be obtained for example from locations in displayed images which are selected by a user moving a display cursor to identify elements of displayed images that are of interest.

It is common for users to review medical image data using a computer system comprising more than one display screen. For example a first display screen may be used to display a first medical image or images and a second display screen may be used to display a second medical image or images . Providing for multiple displays in this way can help a user readily compare different images on different displays. For example a user may often wish to compare images from studies of a patient from different times or to compare images from a patient with a corresponding reference image.

In circumstances where a computer system provides a single pointing device to allows a user to interact with multiple display regions the cursor will typically be moved from one screen to the other by a user controlling movement of the cursor so the cursor in effect leaves one display region through one of its edges and enters the other display region through a corresponding position on one of its edges. Conveniently the entry and exit edges of the respective display screens will be physically adjacent to provide a user with the impression of there being a single continuous movement of the cursor in moving from one display screen to the other.

The inventor has recognized a drawback with this approach is a potential need for a user to undertake repeated large scale movements which might be termed long moves in order to move a display cursor pointer between regions of interest in images represented on different displays or user interface elements in a medical imaging application that are only presented in one of a plurality of displays. Not only can this become tedious and time consuming for the user it can increase the probability of repetitive strain types of injury.

Previous proposals for helping the process of cursor control in computer systems have involved schemes in which a cursor is moved in response to eye or head movements of a user using vision tracking techniques. However in some situations in particular in medical imaging applications there can be a requirement to maintain precise cursor control in conjunction with the ability to make large cursor movements for example to move between different displays and this is not generally possible with current vision tracking techniques.

With this in mind there is a desire to provide improved schemes for controlling cursors in computer systems employing multiple display regions for example in the field of medical imaging.

Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter and in the context of a computer implemented system method and computer program product which may be stored on a non transitory medium. Although some of the present embodiments are described in terms of a computer program product that causes a computer for example a personal computer or other form of workstation to provide the functionality associated with some embodiments of the invention it will be appreciated from the following description that this relates to only one example of some embodiments of the present invention. For example in some embodiments of the invention a network of computers rather than a stand alone computer may implement the embodiments of the invention. Alternatively or in addition at least some of the functionality of the invention may be implemented by means of special purpose hardware for example in the form of special purpose integrated circuits e.g. Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASICs .

The remote diagnostic device component comprises a CT scanner a common format file server and an internet gateway . The CT scanner and file server are commonly connected to the internet gateway which in turn is connected via the internet to the internet gateway within the main hospital component .

The remote single user component comprises a computer workstation with an internal modem not shown . The computer workstation is also connected via the internet to the internet gateway within the main hospital component .

The network is configured to transmit data within a standardized common format. For example the CT scanner initially generates a source data set i.e. a 3D image data set from which an operator may derive an appropriate 2D image. The 2D image is encoded in a standard image data format and transferred over the LAN to the file server for storage on the file archive . A user working on one of the computer workstations may subsequently request the image the file server will retrieve it from the archive and pass it to the user via the LAN . Similarly a user working remotely from the main hospital component either within the remote diagnostic device component or the remote single user component may also access and transmit data stored on the archive or elsewhere on the network .

The computer includes a central processing unit CPU a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM a hard disk drive a display driver a cursor control unit CCU and two displays namely a first display A and a second display B and a user input output IO circuit coupled to a keyboard vision tracking unit and mouse . These devices are connected via a common bus . The computer also includes a graphics card connected via the common bus . The graphics card includes a graphics processing unit GPU and random access memory tightly coupled to the GPU GPU memory . The cursor control unit is an element of the computer system configured to provide functionality in accordance with embodiments of the invention as discussed further below. The cursor control unit is schematically represented as a discrete element of the computer system in . However it will be appreciated that in many cases the operating functionality of the cursor control unit as discussed further below will be provided as a software implemented function of an operating system of the computer system or of an application program running on the computer system such as a medical imaging software application rather than as a discrete hardware element.

The CPU may execute program instructions stored within the ROM the RAM or the hard disk drive to carry out processing display and manipulation of medical image data that may be stored within the RAM or the hard disk drive . The RAM and hard disk drive are collectively referred to as the system memory. The CPU may also execute program instructions corresponding to an operating system of the computer system . In this respect the CPU may be considered to comprise various functional units for performing tasks associated with the operation of the computer system . The GPU may also execute program instructions to carry out processing image data passed to it from the CPU.

Various functional elements comprising the computer system such as the CPU ROM RAM cursor control unit hard disk display driver user input output IO circuit graphics card and connection bus are contained in an enclosure . The two displays A B keyboard vision tracking unit and mouse are in this case separate from the enclosure with appropriate wiring connecting them back to the relevant functional elements of the computer system in the enclosure . In this respect the computer system of the example embodiment in may be considered as being of a desktop type although other types of computer system could equally be employed.

It will be appreciated the various elements of are shown schematically. For example while the vision tracking unit is represented in as a distinct unit positioned in the vicinity of the displays in practice the vision tracking unit may comprise different components such as a camera component and a processing component and these components may be physically and functionally separate within the computer system. In particular the camera component may be located above the displays as schematically shown in while the functionality of the processing component of the vision tracking unit may be provided through appropriate configuration programming within the user I O circuit and or CPU for example in accordance with established user interface techniques in computer systems. It will further be appreciated the vision tracking unit may be incorporated within other aspects of the computer system. For example the vision tracking unit in some examples may comprise a camera component integrated into one or other or both displays.

A user is able to select desired processing parameters using the keyboard and mouse or other pointing device such as a track pad or pen tablet digitizer in combination with a graphical user interface GUI displayed on the display for example using a movable screen cursor in combination with the mouse track pad etc. to point and click within respective ones of the first and second displays A B as discussed further below.

Methods described herein can be used within a hospital environment. In this case the methods may usefully be integrated into a stand alone software application or with a Picture Archiving and Communication System PACS . A PACS is a hospital based computerized network which can store data representing diagnostic images of different types in a digital format organized in a single central archive. For example images may be stored in the DICOM format. The archive is connected to a computer network provided with a number of workstations so that users all around the hospital site can access and process patient data as needed. Additionally users remote from the site may be permitted to access the archive over the Internet.

A user such as a radiologist a consultant or a researcher can access any medial image data set from the workstation and generate display images on respective ones of the displays A B such as a still image of a 2D or 3D data set or moving images from a 4D data set in accordance with conventional techniques for example following the established principles associated with displaying medical image data of interest on multiple display screens.

In accordance with some embodiments of the invention a computer implementation employing computer program code for storage on a data carrier or in memory can be used to control the operation of the CPU and GPU of the computer system in conjunction with inputs received through the user I O from the input devices such as the keyboard pointing device and vision tracking unit . The computer program can be supplied on a suitable carrier medium for example a storage medium such as solid state memory magnetic optical or magneto optical disk or tape based media. Alternatively it can be supplied on a transmission medium for example a medium with a carrier such as a telephone radio or optical channel.

As noted above the computer system represented in in accordance with an embodiment of the invention includes a vision tracking unit . The vision tracking unit is configured to determine in which direction a user of the computer system is looking. In particular the vision tracking unit in accordance with embodiments of the invention is configured to make a determination as to whether a user is deemed to be looking at the first display A or the second display B. The vision tracking unit may be based on conventional techniques for example eye or head tracking techniques which involve processing video images of the user obtained with a camera component of the vision tracking unit . For example the vision tracking unit may be based around the Kinect input device available from Microsoft. However it will be appreciated the choice of vision tracking technology employed in accordance with different example implementations is not significant to the underlying principles of operation in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Thus the vision tracking unit is configured to provide an indication of a view direction for a user which may be converted to an indication as to whether a user is looking at the first display A or the second display B. This can be readily established based on the location of a camera component of the vision tracking unit and the respective display screens. For example referring to the arrangement in if the vision tracking unit determines that a user is looking downwards and to the left of the camera component of the vision tracking unit it may be determined that the user is looking at the first display A. Conversely if the vision tracking unit determines that a user is looking downwards and to the right of the camera component of the vision tracking unit it may be determined that the user is looking at the second display B. Thus in accordance with embodiments of the invention the vision tracking unit is configured to determine which of a plurality of displays is currently being looked at by a user and furthermore to generate corresponding view direction signaling indicative thereof. A display that is currently being looked at by a user according to the view direction signaling may conveniently be referred to as a currently selected display.

As discussed further below the view direction signaling provided by the vision tracking unit may be used to control a cursor on the displays A B in association with movement signaling generated in correspondence with user movements associated with the mouse . The mouse may operate in accordance with conventional techniques for generating movement signaling in association with a user input device of this kind.

As an example use of cursor control in a multi display computer system in the medical imaging field a clinician radiologist may wish to compare the diameter of an abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA before and after an endovascular aneurysm repair EVAR procedure. This may involve presenting on a first display a pre repair image of the AAA and presenting on a second display a post repair image of the AAA. It will however be appreciated the specific medical condition being considered and the specific type of medical image data being viewed are not significant to the underlying principles of operation in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

For the sake of comparison schematically represent how a user may control a cursor to compare the pre and post repair diameters of a AAA in accordance with conventional techniques. Each of represents a first display screen A and a second display screen B of a conventional two screen computer system at various stages of user operation. Throughout the stages of operation represented in the first display screen A is displaying a pre repair image of an AAA A and the second display screen B is displaying a post repair image of the AAA B. In each representation of the AAA in a dashed line is included to schematically show the distance the user wishes to measure i.e. what the user has identified as the relevant diameter for the AAA in accordance with the user s clinical judgment .

In accordance with conventional techniques a user will manipulate a mouse to move a corresponding cursor on the first display screen A to a first location on one side of the AAA which the user wishes to measure. Once the cursor is located according to the user s wishes the user may record the selected location for example by clicking a button associated with the mouse in accordance with conventional medical image processing software techniques. This first step S is schematically represented in .

In a second step S schematically represented in the user manipulates the cursor on the first display screen A using the associated mouse to a second location on an opposing side of the pre repair AAA image. Once the cursor is located according to the user s wishes the user may again record the selected location by clicking a button associated with the mouse.

Once the user has identified two points on opposing sides of the pre repair AAA in this way an estimate of the diameter of the pre repair AAA can be made in accordance with conventional techniques associated with medical imaging visualization software. For example an estimate of the diameter of the AAA can readily be established based on the distance between the display pixels corresponding to the selected locations on opposing sides of the AAA in steps S and S and by taking account of the scaling of the displayed medical image data.

In order to make a corresponding measurement for the post repair MA image the user undertakes similar steps to those discussed above in relation to in relation to the post repair image data on the second display screen B.

Thus in a third step S schematically represented in the user manipulates the mouse so the cursor moves from the first display screen A to the second display screen B. As noted above this is conventionally done by making a large sweeping movement with the mouse to cause the cursor to switch screens. The user may then further manipulate the cursor to a third location on a first side of the post repair AAA image B. Once the cursor is located according to the user s wishes the user may again click a mouse button to indicate the location has been selected.

Finally in a fourth step schematically represented in the user manipulates the cursor on the second display screen B using the mouse to a fourth location on an opposing side of the post repair AAA image. This location is again recorded by clicking a mouse button.

Once the user has identified the two points on opposing sides of the post repair AAA image represented on the second display screen B an estimate of the diameter of the post repair AAA can be made in accordance with conventional techniques associated with medical imaging visualization software.

Thus a first path section labeled S S in corresponds with the cursor movement across the pre repair AAA a second path section labeled S S corresponds with the cursor movement from the first display screen A to the second display screen B and a third party section labeled S S corresponds with the cursor movement across the post repair AAA.

Having described cursor movements required in accordance with a conventional technique for undertaking this specific example task in a computer system comprising two display screens an approach for undertaking corresponding measurements in accordance with an embodiment of the invention using the computer system of will now be described with reference to and . In this example it will be assumed the computer system is running medical imaging visualization software which is appropriately configured to allow a user to undertake the desired measurements in accordance with conventional medical image processing techniques. As described herein a significant aspect of approaches in accordance with some embodiments of the invention is that control of a cursor displayed on the displays A B is governed both by movement signaling associated with manipulation of the mouse or other pointing device according to the implementation at hand and view direction signaling associated with the vision tracking unit .

More specifically in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention the cursor control unit of the computer system is configured to select one or other of the displays A B as a currently selected display if the vision tracking unit provides signaling indicating the user is looking at that display. A cursor on the selected display is then controlled to move based on movements associated with the mouse in accordance with the established principles for using a mouse to control a cursor on a display. However if a user s view direction changes and the vision tracking unit determines the user is now looking at the other display the cursor control unit is configured to select the other of the displays A B as the newly selected display and to start moving a cursor on the newly selected display based on corresponding movements associated with the mouse. In this respect the selected display i.e. the one the user is determined to be looking towards at a given time may be considered as an active display within which cursor movements are to be made based on movements associated with a user input pointing device e.g. mouse .

This approach based on controlling a cursor in a computer system comprising multiple display regions by taking account of both movement signaling associated with a pointing device and view direction signaling associated with a vision tracking unit can thus provide a user with relatively fine control over cursor movements within one of the display regions by manipulating a pointing device in the usual manner while also allowing the user to rapidly move control of the cursor between different displays by simply changing the direction in which he is looking. Thus embodiments of the invention allow a user to manipulate a pointing device to control a displayed cursor in different display screens by simply looking at the display screen in which he wants the cursor movements to be applied.

Thus schematically represent how a user may control a cursor to compare pre and post repair diameters of a AAA in accordance with an embodiment of the invention using the computer system of . As with the conventional approach described above with reference to it is assumed a clinician radiologist wishes to compare the diameter of the AAA before and after an EVAR procedure and this involves presenting on the first display A a pre repair image of the AAA A and presenting on a second display B a post repair image of the AAA B. In each representation of the AAA in a dashed line is included to schematically show the distance the user wishes to measure i.e. what the user has identified as the relevant diameter for the AAA in accordance with the user s clinical judgment . As already noted above it will be appreciated the specific medical condition being considered and the specific type of medical image data being viewed and analysis performed are not significant to the underlying principles of cursor control in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

Each of represents the first display A to the left and the second display B to the right at various stages of user operation. Throughout the stages of operation represented in the first display A is displaying a pre repair image of the AAA A and the second display B is displaying a post repair image of the AAA B. It is assumed that throughout the steps represented in the user is looking at one or other of the display screens A B and corresponding view direction signaling is provided by the vision tracking unit as described above. As discussed further below in steps T and T represented in the user is concerned with and hence is looking towards what is displayed on the first display A. Accordingly for these steps the view direction signaling associated with the vision tracking unit indicates the user is looking at the first display A. However and again as discussed further below in steps T T and T represented in the user is concerned with and hence is looking towards what is displayed on the second display B. Thus for these steps the view direction signaling indicates the user is looking at the second display B. In each of the display which the view direction signaling indicates is currently being looked at by the user is indicated by a bold outline whilst the other display which the user is determined deemed not to be currently looking towards is shown with shading.

In a first step T schematically represented in the user begins measuring the diameter of the AAA in the pre repair image on display A. Accordingly the user is concerned with and is looking at display A. In accordance with embodiments of the invention as summarized above the cursor control unit of the computer system is configured to control movement of a cursor on one or other display of the computer system in association with corresponding movements of the mouse according to which display the user is deemed to be looking at as determined from the view direction signaling from the vision tracking device .

Thus in step T the user is looking at the first display A and the cursor control unit receives view direction signaling from the vision tracking device to indicate this. Accordingly the cursor control unit is configured to control movement of a cursor on the first display A because this is the one the user is looking at in response to movements associated with the mouse . Accordingly the user looking at the first display A may manipulate a mouse to move a corresponding cursor on the first display A to a first location on one side of the AAA which the user wishes to measure. Once the cursor is located according to the user s wishes the user may record the selected location for example by clicking a button associated with the mouse in accordance with conventional medical image processing software techniques.

In a second step T schematically represented in the user continues looking at the first display A as he now wishes to move the cursor to the other side of the AAA to complete the diameter measurement of the pre repair AAA. Thus the cursor control unit continues to receive view direction signaling from the vision tracking device to indicate the user is looking at the first display A. Accordingly the cursor control unit is configured to continue controlling movement of the cursor on the first display A in response to user movements associated with the mouse . Thus in the second step T the user manipulates the cursor on the first display A using the associated mouse to a second location on an opposing side of the pre repair AAA image. Once the cursor is located according to the user s wishes the user may again record the selected location by clicking a button associated with the mouse.

Once the user has identified two points on opposing sides of the pre repair AAA in this way an estimate of the diameter of the pre repair AAA can be made in accordance with conventional techniques associated with medical imaging visualization software at hand. For example an estimate of the diameter of the AAA can readily be established based on the distance between the display pixels corresponding to the selected locations identifying opposing sides of the AAA in step T and T and by taking account of the display scaling for the medical image data.

In order to make a corresponding measurement for the post repair AAA image the user proceeds to undertake similar steps in relation to the post repair image data presented on the second display B. Accordingly the user s attention switches to the second display B displaying the post repair AAA image with a corresponding change in his view direction whereby the user changes from looking towards the first display A to looking towards the second display B. As a consequence the view direction signaling received by the cursor control unit from the vision tracking unit changes to indicate the user is now looking towards the second display B.

The cursor control unit responds to the change in the display towards which the user is looking based on the view direction signaling received from the vision tracking unit by switching from controlling a cursor on the first display A in response to movements associated with the mouse as in steps T and T when the user was looking at the first display to instead controlling a cursor displayed on the second display in response to mouse movements. In this particular example embodiment when the cursor control unit switches from controlling a cursor on the first display A to controlling a cursor on the second display B in response to a change in the user s view direction it is configured to stop displaying the cursor on the first display screen and to start displaying a cursor on the second display screen with an initial location determined according to a final location for the cursor on the first display screen. This is schematically shown in .

Thus represents a third step T of the processing in which the user s gaze direction has changed from looking towards the first display to the second display and the cursor previously displayed on the first display at the second location has been removed from the first display and a cursor is now displayed instead on the second display at a third location . In this embodiment the initial location for the cursor when first displayed on the newly active display i.e. on the second display B in this example is based on a final location for the cursor from when it was displayed on the previously active display i.e. on the first display A in this example before the change in which display the user is looking at. In particular the initial location for the cursor relative to the second display in this example implementation is at the same location for example in terms of Cartesian coordinates representing the display as the final location for the cursor relative to the first display.

Thus in accordance with this embodiment of the invention a user is able to in effect move the cursor from the first display to the second display simply by changing from looking at the first display to looking at the second display. This is different from the conventional approach presented in in which the user moves a mouse to cause the cursor to move from a final location of interest in the first display A to an initial location of interest in the second display B.

In accordance with some embodiments of the invention when a cursor is first displayed at an initial position on a newly selected display it may be displayed in a highlighted manner as compared to the cursor s normal appearance when being moved in the respective display. This is to help a user more quickly identify the initial location for the cursor on the newly selected display. The highlighting may evolve for example displaying the mouse larger than normal with a different color in a flashing manner or with another visual graphic indicator displayed in the vicinity of the initial location to help catch a user s attention. That is to say the computer system may be configured such that following a change to a newly selected display region from a previously selected display region an initial display characteristic associated with the cursor may be modified in the newly selected display region as compared to the appearance of the cursor when it is subsequently moved within the newly selected display region.

In a fourth step T schematically represented in the user continues looking at the second display B as he wishes to move the cursor to a desired first measurement point on one side of the post repair AAA. The cursor control unit continues to receive view direction signaling from the vision tracking device to indicate the user is looking at the second display B and accordingly controls movement of the cursor on the second display B in response to user movements associated with the mouse . Thus in the fourth step T the user manipulates the cursor on the second display B using the associated mouse to move the cursor from its initial location to a fourth location on a side of the post repair AAA image corresponding to a desired first position for the measurement according to the user s clinical judgment. Once the cursor is located according to the user s wishes the user may record the selected location in the usual manner for example by again clicking a button associated with the mouse.

Finally in a fifth step T schematically represented in the user manipulates the cursor within the second display B using the mouse to a fifth location on an opposing side of the post repair AAA image. This location is again recorded by clicking a mouse button. Because the user naturally continues to look at the second display B whilst positioning the cursor in this step the cursor control unit continues to receive view direction signaling from the vision tracking device which indicates the second screen B should remain as the active screen so far as the cursor control is concerned and hence the cursor is moved response to movements of the mouse in the manner expected by the user.

Once the user has identified the two points on opposing sides of the post repair AAA image represented on the second display B an estimate of the diameter of the post repair AAA can be made in accordance with conventional techniques associated with medical imaging visualization software.

Thus a first path section labeled T T in corresponds with the cursor movement across the pre repair AAA. A second path labeled T T corresponds with the cursor movement from its initial location on the second display B as indicated in to the first measurement location for the post repair AAA in . A third path section labeled T T corresponds with the cursor movement across the post repair AAA.

A comparison of representing mouse movements for undertaking the above described example clinical task in a computer system according to an embodiment of the invention with corresponding mouse movements for undertaking the same task in a conventional computer system as represented in shows how a reduced amount of mouse movement is be needed to perform the same task in accordance with embodiments of the invention thereby helping to address some of the drawbacks described above with reference to conventional cursor control schemes.

In a second step U a user of the computer system comprising multiple displays loads medical image data of interest into a medical image visualization software application running on the computer system. Again it will be appreciated the specific nature of the medical image data and the corresponding clinical aspects of the medical imaging visualization software application are not significant to the principles underlying embodiments of the invention.

In a third step U the user operates the medical visualization software application in accordance with conventional techniques to display multiple images of interest on respective ones of the multiple displays.

In a fourth step U the cursor control unit of the computer system operates to display a cursor in an initial default position on whichever monitor is determined as being the monitor currently being looked at by the user according to the view direction signaling received from the vision tracking unit. The initial default position for the cursor in the currently viewed display may be arbitrary for example the initial default position may be at the center of the display or correspond with a previous cursor position for example a most recent cursor position prior to step U being reached.

For so long as the user continues to look at the same display i.e. the currently viewed display remains the same the cursor control unit is configured to respond to mouse movements by moving the cursor in a corresponding manner on the currently viewed display. In this way the user may interact with and control the visualization software on the currently viewed display in a broadly conventional manner. This process is schematically represented by steps U U and U.

Steps U U and U schematically represent steps in which a user manipulates drags a mouse to move the displayed cursor within the currently viewed display to control the visualization software step U and undertake other interactions with software on the computer system step U . These steps may be undertaken in accordance with conventional techniques according to the implementation at hand for example taking account of the specific operational aspects of the medical visualization software application and what the user wishes to use it for.

In accordance with the processing of it is assumed that after some time reviewing and potentially interacting with what is displayed on the currently viewed display the user wishes to focus on what is displayed on another one of the multiple displays comprising the computer system. This is schematically represented in step U in which a user looks at a different monitor.

In step U the vision tracking device e.g. eye tracking apparatus detects the change in the users gaze direction and generate a corresponding change in the view direction signaling provided to the cursor control unit.

In step U software running on the computer system and providing the functionality of the cursor control unit responds to the changing view direction signaling and switches the displayed cursor from a position on the previous currently viewed display to a corresponding position on the new currently viewed display. Processing then returns to step U where for so long as the user continues to look at the newly selected currently viewed display the cursor control unit is configured to respond to mouse movements by moving the cursor in a corresponding manner on the new currently viewed display. In this way the user may interact with and control the visualization software on the new currently viewed display. This process is again schematically represented by steps U U and U.

This process may repeat with the user switching between displays by simply looking at which display is currently of interest. As discussed above the cursor control unit of the computer system is configured to respond to changes in the display of interest based on changes in corresponding view direction signaling from a vision tracking unit to switch control of the cursor in response to mouse movements to the new display of interest.

Eventually a user may finish the task they wish to perform by reviewing the various images on the various displays step S and the processing represented in may consequently terminate in step U.

Thus have described certain embodiments of the invention which in some respects may be characterized as a method of controlling a computer cursor comprising displaying a computer cursor on one of at least two video displays allowing a user to control the cursor with a pointing device operated by hand or other means tracking the gaze of the user and moving the cursor to the video display in the user s current gaze.

In accordance with embodiments of the invention a cursor may be displayed at an initial position on a newly selected display i.e. a display which a user has just started looking at at a position which corresponds with a previous position for the cursor displayed on the previously selected display i.e. the display which a user was looking at before switching to look at the newly selected display .

As described above the correspondence between an initial cursor position in a newly selected i.e. newly viewed display and a previous cursor position in a previously selected i.e. previously viewed display may be such that the initial cursor position and the previous cursor position are at corresponding coordinates in the respective displays coordinate systems.

In accordance with other embodiments of the invention the computer system may be configured such that the cursor control unit receives information from the software application associated with the data being displayed and selects an initial cursor position in a newly selected display based on such information.

For example a medical visualization software application may be configured to establish a registration mapping between one or more anatomical feature s in different images in different displays. Furthermore the medical visualization software may be configured to provide the cursor control unit with information regarding the relative locations of the corresponding anatomical feature s in the different images in the different displays. The cursor control unit may thus be configured such that the correspondence between an initial cursor position in a newly selected i.e. newly viewed display and a previous cursor position in a previously selected i.e. previously viewed display may be such that the initial cursor position and the previous cursor position are at corresponding locations relative to one or more of the corresponding anatomical features in the respective images represented in the newly selected and previously selected displays.

In a similar manner it is known for medical imaging applications to associate pre defined measurement points or annotation points on a first image for example a prior study image and to establish corresponding locations for these points in a second image of interest by registration mapping. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention the medical visualization software may be configured to provide the cursor control unit with information regarding the relative locations of the corresponding measurement annotation points in the different images in the different displays. The cursor control unit may thus be configured such that the correspondence between an initial cursor position in a newly selected i.e. newly viewed display and a previous cursor position in a previously selected i.e. previously viewed display may be such that the initial cursor position and the previous cursor position are at corresponding locations relative to one or more of the corresponding measurement annotation points in the respective images represented in the newly selected and previously selected displays.

In another example implementation a user may interact with a medical visualization application to view medical image data on a first display and may for example move a cursor to overlay a specific element of pathology of interest for example a tumor polyp stent or other feature of interest . The medical visualization application running on the computer system may be configured to identify that the cursor is associated with the particular pathology element either through computer aided detection algorithm or because manual or automatic segmentation has identified the pathology element as such or the element has otherwise been marked or labeled as a finding of interest by the user. The medical visualization application may further be configured to determine if the relevant pathology element is also present in images represented in the second display region and if so to control the cursor control unit to select an initial edition for the cursor in the vicinity of the pathology element as it appears in the second display region when there is a change from the first display region to the second display region following a change in a user s view direction.

In yet another example implementation a user may interact with a medical visualization application to view medical image data on a first and second and possibly more displays. The appearance of the information on the various displays may have corresponding elements e.g. windows or panes or displayed icons . For example each display may comprise a first window for displaying imaging and a second window for displaying control information associated with the displayed imaging in the associated first window. When switching from controlling the cursor in one display to controlling the cursor in another display following a change in a user s view direction the cursor control units may be configured to select an initial position for the cursor in an area of the newly selected display corresponding to the area of the previously selected display in which the cursor was positioned prior to the change.

More generally a computer system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may be configured such that an initial cursor position in a newly selected display region and a cursor position in a previously selected display region may be at corresponding positions relative to one or more features displayed in both the first and second display regions. The one or more features may for example comprise an anatomical area or location a pathological or other finding an annotation or measurement or a user interface element associated with what is displayed in the respective display regions.

Thus various examples of computer systems and methods in accordance with embodiments of the invention have been described. It will however be appreciated that various aspects of the above described apparatus and techniques may be modified in accordance with other embodiments of the invention.

For example in accordance with some embodiments the control of a cursor might not be moved to a new display following a change in a user s view direction in all situations. For example in some circumstances the cursor might be restricted from moving from one display region to another where doing so might cause distraction for the user. For example because the user is midway through performing a cursor manipulation which is deemed to be one which would not normally be interrupted by a user wishing to switch control to another screen. That is to say in accordance with some embodiments a cursor control units may be provided with signaling for example from a software application running on the computer system which the user is using the cursor to interact with to indicate whether or not it is permissible to move the cursor to a new display if the user changes view direction.

This may be helpful in some example implementations in accordance with embodiments of the invention in respect of user interactions that rely on a series of cursor operations which might be referred to as cursor steps within a single display region. In particular when a user is involved in performing a series of cursor steps it may be appropriate to prevent the cursor control unit from switching the cursor to a different display midway through the series of cursor steps in response to a change in a user s view direction during this time. This can help prevent a momentary change in a user s view direction for example associated with a sudden distraction in the environment in which the user is working or a glance towards a clock from impacting an ongoing task associated with a series of cursor steps.

Examples of tasks which might involve a series of cursor steps include annotation or measurements associated with more than one control or anchor point. For example to create a length measurement with two control points on an image a user may either click on each point for the annotation measurement or click and drag to identify the desired two points i.e. a first point where the mouse button is pressed to click and a second point where the mouse button is released after dragging . Another example of tasks which might involve a series of cursor steps include tasks associated with software tools that respond to a drag movement associated with the cursor. Examples of such movements may include using a cursor to scroll through a set of images in a view change a displayed range of modality values in images in a view called windowing by radiologists adjust one control point of a measurement annotation drag a reference line that shows where one view is positioned in a patient relative to another view and so forth.

If a cursor were to move to another display while a user is performing such tasks then the user may find such movements to be distracting. To help prevent this the cursor control unit may be configured to receive signaling from a software application operating on the computer system to determine whether the cursor control unit may allow the cursor to move to a different display in response to a change in a user s view direction. The software application operating on the computer system may thus correspondingly be configured to provide the cursor control unit with such information during times when the software application is involved in a task associated with multiple cursor steps.

Thus in accordance with some embodiments a computer system may be configured to implement a method broadly corresponding to that represented in but with an additional decision step between steps corresponding to steps U and U represented in . In this additional step once the eye tracking apparatus detects there has been a change in a user s view direction in a step corresponding to step U of but before the cursor control is moved to a different display in a step corresponding to step U of the cursor control unit receives signaling from the medical visualization software operating on the computer system to indicate if the cursor may be moved to the new display. The cursor control unit may receive this signaling in response to a specific request or the signaling may be something which is routinely provided by the medical visualization software for example on a periodic basis.

If the signaling received from the medical visualization software indicates the user is currently performing a task which has been classified as one which should not be interrupted by a change in view direction the cursor control unit is configured to ignore the user s changing view direction and to maintain cursor control in respect of the currently selected display by in effect returning to a step corresponding to step U in without performing a step corresponding to in .

If on the other hand the signaling received from the medical visualization software indicates the user is not currently performing a task which has been classified as one which should not be interrupted by a change view direction the cursor control unit may proceed to switch from the currently selected display to a newly selected display based in response to the user s change in view direction in accordance with the principles described above for example with reference to step U of .

In accordance with these embodiments of the invention the cursor control unit functionality may be provided as either a component part of the medical imaging application itself or a component part of an operating system of the computer. If the functionality of the cursor control unit is provided as part of an operating system then a Software Development Kit SDK of the operating system may be provided with an appropriate Application Programming Interface API to allow the operating system and cursor control unit to communicate the relevant information between them. In another example a plug in SDK containing the appropriate API may be associated with the medical imaging application.

Another technique for preventing a change in active display in response to a momentary change in a user s view direction when the user does not wish to cause a change in active display might be to require the cursor control unit to receive view direction signaling indicating the user has viewed another display for at least a minimum amount of time before moving control of the cursor to the newly viewed display. Thus momentary changes in a user s view direction will not be responded to whereas if a user continuously looks at a new display for more than a pre determined period of time the cursor control unit will switch control of the cursor to the new display accordingly.

It will further be appreciated that whilst the above described embodiments have focused primarily on examples in which corresponding medical image data i.e. pre and post procedure images of the same region are displayed within two display regions in other examples there may be different relationships between what is being displayed in the two display regions or indeed no relationship at all. For example in a medical data context one display may be used to provide rendered images of a medical imaging data set while the other display may comprise elements such as text reports lists of imaging studies medical data associated with non imaging modalities for example graphs or other laboratory results lists of anatomy or pathology features associated with the medical data for which the images displayed on the other screen and so forth. More generally embodiments of the invention may be provided to allow a user to readily switch between controlling a cursor within different ones of multiple display regions by simply looking at the display region of interest.

For example instead of providing for only a single cursor which is in effect moved between different displays to follow which display a user is looking at in other examples each display screen may retain its own cursor with the respective cursors being controlled by the mouse or other pointing device according to whichever screen is currently being looked at. In this case when a user looks to a previously viewed display an initial location for the cursor in the display may correspond with the location of the cursor the last time the display was selected as the viewed display.

It will also be appreciated that whilst the above description has primarily focused for simplicity on a computer system comprising two displays in accordance with other embodiments of the invention a computer system may be provided with more than two displays and cursor control may be switched among the more than two displays in accordance with the principles described above in the context of two displays.

It will further be appreciated that whilst the above described embodiments have focused on implementing embodiments of the invention in the context of a computer system comprising multiple display screens other example embodiments may be implemented in a computer system comprising a single display screen which is considered as being notionally divided into multiple display regions. For example a single display screen may be considered to comprise a first display region in an area generally towards a left hand part of the screen and a second display region in an area generally towards a right hand part of the screen and this is particularly the case for large landscape medical grade displays for example comprising 4 6 or 10 megapixels. Thus in a medical imaging context different medical images of interest may be displayed in the left and right hand regions of the single display screen. In accordance with embodiments of the invention a computer system comprising such a display screen comprising multiple display regions may be configured so that movement of a pointing device controls a cursor in whichever region of the display screen a user is currently determined to be looking at. That is to say embodiments of the invention as described above with reference to a computer system comprising two or more physically distinct display screens may be equally implemented in a computer system comprising a single display screen which is notionally considered as being divided into two or more separate display regions.

It will be appreciated that in principle the control of a cursor in accordance with embodiments of the invention may be provided through use of discrete hardware elements for example within the user I O Interface of which are configured to provide the appropriate functionality. However in many cases and in accordance with conventional techniques for providing user interface functionality cursor control in accordance with embodiments of the invention may be provided by appropriate configuration of an operating system of the computer program. That is to say it may sometimes be the case that an operating system of the computer system implementing an embodiment of the invention will be configured to control a displayed cursor by taking account of the movement signaling and view direction signaling from the associated pointing device and view tracking unit in accordance with the principles described herein. In other cases it may be a software application associated with what data is being displayed such as medical visualization application that is directly responsible for controlling cursor movement and in such cases the software application may comprise functional software elements for providing the relevant functionality in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In still other cases it may be a combination of an operating system of the computer system and a software application associated with what data is being displayed such as a medical imaging application that are together responsible for providing functionality in accordance with embodiments of the invention to control cursor movement.

It will further be appreciated the measurements of movements associated with a user input device and view directions and the corresponding provision of the movement signaling and view direction signaling to the cursor control unit may be made in accordance with conventional techniques associated with such devices. For example the vision tracking unit may be configured to continuously provide view direction signaling on a periodic basis or only when there is a measured change in view direction above a predefined threshold according to the implementation at hand.
