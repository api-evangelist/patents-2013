title: System and method for supporting self service and associated agent-assisted service call routing
abstract: A method and system support an interaction of a user with a self service application via a self service access terminal, which may be a mobile device. The user employs the self service access terminal to navigate a decision tree associated with the self service application. When the user reaches a point in the decision tree which indicates that an agent-assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent, the voice call may be initiated and data associated with the interaction with the self service application is communicated to an agent computer which displays the data to the human agent who handles the voice call. The data may include user data, environmental data, line-of-business data pertaining to the user, and/or data indicating the path on the decision tree which the user traversed prior to the voice call.

This patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e from U.S. provisional patent application 61 615 822 filed on 26 Mar. 2012 and also from U.S. provisional patent application 61 714 259 filed on 16 Oct. 2012 the entire disclosure of each of which provisional applications is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention pertains to the field of self service processes systems and applications. More particularly the present invention is directed to a system and method for self service call routing and intelligent transition from self service to agent assisted service.

Automated telephone based customer support systems such as auto attendant AA systems which may also be referred to as automated attendant systems virtual receptionist systems interactive voice response IVR systems AA IVR systems and other names have evolved from relatively simple devices to more complex computerized systems for handling calls pertaining to a variety of issues. Modern AA systems can often allow a caller to resolve an issue through self service without the need for a human agent to provide agent assisted service. And in cases where agent assisted service is required to address a caller s issue an AA system may facilitate connecting the caller to the appropriate agent for resolving the issue.

For example an AA system may automatically answer a telephone call from a caller play a standard message to the caller and then await a response from the caller. In some AA systems this response may come in the form of the caller depressing a particular telephone key which often generates a standardized set of tones called Dual tone multi frequency tones DTMF and or in the form of voice input for more sophisticated voice recognition systems. Based on the caller response the system may process the incoming call appropriately to resolve one or more issues which prompted the caller to place the call.

Auto attendant systems often have a complex menu structure via which an incoming caller may for example proceed through a complex decision tree being presented with a series of recorded voice prompts or generated voice prompts utilizing Text To Speech and providing corresponding responses in order to connect the incoming caller with a particular person departmental function or information to resolve the incoming caller s issue s . Some AA systems operate using voice communication over traditional Public Switched Telephone Networks PSTN wireless radio infrastructure and or voice over IP technologies.

Many commercial owners or users of AA systems also operate websites which can provide additional information to a customer and in this case one or more voice prompts which are provided by the auto attendant system may encourage incoming callers to stop using the telephone based AA system and instead to switch to using a web browser to engage in a self service operation with a computer based customer support system.

However callers to an organization s telephone based auto attendant system may experience frustration with unsuccessful IVR interactions or encounter long wait times during peak call periods. Computer based customer support systems may provide e.g. via a network a broader range of automated information and with little or no wait times where a customer seeks a resolution to the customer s issue during a self service session. However if the computer based customer support system fails to allow the customer to resolve an issue the customer may still need to speak with a customer service agent to resolve the issue.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide a system and method which supports self service and which can facilitate and streamline the operation of a subsequent telephone call for agent assisted service.

The present invention comprises a system and method for supporting self service and for subsequent call routing for agent assisted service when self service does not resolve an issue.

In one aspect of the invention a method is provided of supporting an interaction of a user with a self service application. The method comprises 1 presenting to the user via a display device of a self service access terminal a user interface for the self service application 2 receiving via the user interface a user supplied input 3 based at least in part on the user supplied input navigating a decision tree associated with the self service application to reach a next node of the decision tree and presenting to the user a user interface screen which is associated with the next node 4 repeating steps 2 and 3 until the next node of the decision tree indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent and 5 when the next node of the decision tree indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent communicating data associated with the interaction with the self service application to an agent computer which displays information to the human agent

In another aspect of the invention another method is provided of supporting an interaction of a user with a self service application. The method comprises 1 at a server receiving user supplied input from a self service access terminal which is located remotely from the server 2 based at least in part on the user supplied input navigating a decision tree associated with a self service application to reach a next node of the decision tree 3 communicating self service data from the server to the remotely located self service access terminal where the self service data is associated with the next node and causes the self service access terminal to display on a display device a user interface screen associated with the next node 4 repeating steps 1 through 3 until the next node of the decision tree indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent and 5 when the next node of the decision tree indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent communicating data associated with the interaction with the self service application from the server to an agent computer which displays information to the human agent.

In yet another aspect of the invention a non transitory data storage medium has stored thereon instructions for causing a processor to execute a process for supporting an interaction of a user with a self service application. The process comprises 1 presenting to a user via a display device of a self service access terminal a user interface screen of a user interface of a self service application 2 receiving via the user interface a user supplied input pertaining to an interaction with the self service application 3 based at least in part on the user supplied input navigating a decision tree associated with the self service application to reach a next node of the decision tree and presenting to the user another user interface screen associated with the next node and 4 repeating steps 2 and 3 until the next node of the decision tree indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent and 5 when the next node of the decision tree indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent automatically communicating data associated with the interaction with the self service application to an agent computer which displays information to the human agent.

In the description to follow an individual may be referred to as a user a caller or a customer. It should be understand that these terms are used interchangeably depending on context to refer to an individual who has an issue which they wish to resolve. The issue may pertain to a technical problem that the individual is experiencing with a product or service provided by a company or organization a need for information about a company or organization and or its products or services a billing problem or any of a variety of other issues for which an individual may seek assistance through an AA system and or via an interaction with a self service application and or via agent assisted support.

Self service access terminal includes a display device a processor memory and one or more user input devices which may include a touch screen a keypad a microphone a keyboard a trackball a mouse and or any other known input device. The memory may comprise a non transitory data storage medium and may have stored thereon instructions for causing the processor to execute a process for supporting an interaction of a user with a self service application as described in greater detail below.

In some embodiments self service access terminal may include an antenna a transmitter and a receiver for communicating over a wireless network. In some embodiments self service access terminal may be capable of voice calls and or data communication over a wireless network for example a 3G or 4G network. In some embodiments self service access terminal may include a wireless local area network WLAN adaptor and antenna for communicating via a WLAN such as an IEEE 802.11 network. In some embodiments self service access terminal may be able to establish an Internet connection via either a wireless network e.g. a 3G or 4G network and or over a WLAN.

In more detail depicts a user interface and application with the ability to render or display various UI controls including but not limited to text areas input fields and virtual buttons . Other embodiments may include the ability to render commonly accepted UI elements including but not limited to listboxes combo boxes multi select scrollable lists and so forth.

In operation still referring to a user may navigate through a series of user interface screens UI screens which are displayed on a display device of self service access terminal selecting various controls available via the various UI screens in order to resolve a specific issue i.e. perform a self service interaction with a self service application which may reside in whole or in part in one or more memory devices of self service access terminal and or a remotely located self service server which will be described in greater detail below . UI screens are updated in response to user input received via UI screens until such time that user s issue has been resolved or until such time that the user chooses to communicate with a contact center agent for agent assisted service to resolve the user s issue. In some embodiments by the series of actions of presenting a UI screen to a user receiving user input in response to the UI screen and presenting a new UI screen in response to the user input a user may traverse through nodes of a decision tree or call tree of a self service application with which the user interacts where each node has associated therewith a corresponding UI screen . Here it should be noted that a decision tree is a logical construct rather than a physical entity and represents an abstraction of a complex algorithm which includes a plurality of optional paths which may be followed by a user while engaged in a self service session to resolve an issue. In some embodiments data representing such a decision tree e.g. metadata may be stored locally in memory of self service access terminal while in other embodiments self service access terminal may execute a client server session with a remotely located self service server where the data representing the decision tree is stored in a database and which communicates data for the UI screen associated with each node of the decision tree to self service access terminal .

Still referring to buttons may exist on UI screen to allow a user at any time during the interaction with the self service application to request an agent assisted service session to resolve the user s issue. The agent assisted service session may take place via a voice call or via a web chat with an agent at a call center. Additionally in some embodiments a button may allow the user to request a call back from the call center agent. Here a Call refers to establishing a voice connection to a call center agent either via regular phone channel e.g. the public switched telephone network PSTN if self service access terminal includes the capability for such phone calls or via a voice over Internet protocol VoIP client installed and running on self service access terminal . In some embodiments buttons allowing the user to place a call to an agent may additionally display the expected hold time that user would experience if calling or web chatting with an agent at the contact center.

In some embodiments when self service access terminal is executing the self service application in a standalone mode and does not presently have access to a communication channel for an HTTP or TCP IP communication session e.g. not presently able to access the Internet then the user may initiate a call to the call center agent via a separate telephone device. In that case UI screen may notify a user of a unique ID assigned to the user s current interaction with the self service application and an AA system to which the user connects via the separate telephone device

In some embodiments self service access terminal or may have associated therewith a variety of sensors and or data gathering devices such as a global positioning system GPS receiver a camera a card swipe or near field readers and or other sensors.

In the description to follow detailed examples and descriptions will be provided in the context of a user employing self service access terminal in particular a smart phone. However as noted above it should be understood that a variety of other devices or platforms may be employed for the self service access terminal without loss of generality.

Referring now to there is shown a mobile device as one possible embodiment of self service access terminal by means of which the user conducts an interaction with a self service application. The self service application executing on self service access terminal retrieves the next step in the self service process from self service application server utilizing either an HTTP or TCP IP connection e.g. via the Internet . HTTP connections are by definition stateless and one or more embodiments of the invention support stateless and stateful operations based on the underlying protocol. Self service application server receives requests from self service access terminal processes logic retrieves data for the next node of a decision tree or call tree from self service application database and returns data associated with the next node to self service access terminal .

In an alternate embodiment the self service application resides on self service access terminal which is able to cache the interaction steps minimizing round trips communications with self service application server . In such a cached deployment a user may be able to navigate through the entire self service session or a subset of such session without communication back to self service application server allowing for operation in a disconnected or offline mode wherein self service access terminal is not in communication from the self service application server and indeed may performs the steps of navigating the decision tree for a self service session without any communication with any external device. In that case self service access terminal may store in a memory device thereof metadata for a processor of self service access terminal to present the self service application to user as series of UI screens .

In some embodiments self service application server can optionally interact with and integrate with Line of Business LOB applications to retrieve relevant customer or supporting information including but not limited to customer information pertaining to customer information systems billing data pertaining to billing systems and knowledgebases. Data from LOB application s can affect logic flow in self service application server and return the results or interpretation of the results back to self service access terminal . Data from LOB application s may also be proactively pushed by self service application server to self service access terminal without requiring the user to have initiated the request.

In some embodiments self service application server can optionally interact with CTI server in order to initiate a call voice chat session with an agent depicted in further detail in or to determine current hold times or to initiate a call back request. CTI server may be supplied by various vendors.

In some embodiments self service application server can interface to and integrate with the applications running on the agent computer to communicate to agent computer data associated with a user s interaction with the self service application. Examples of such integration to agent computer may include but are not limited to providing a screen pop of incoming caller information to an agent using once the user of self service access terminal requests to place a voice call to the contact center providing a detailed history of the sequences performed by user on self service access terminal and the self service interaction including the pages generated by self service application server and data retrieved from LOB applications . In some embodiments the agent is able to see on agent computer a full call path or interaction history or Call Navigation Path performed by the user of self service access terminal prior to or simultaneously with establishing the voice connection.

In some embodiments whenever a user initiates an interaction through system the a unique ID Interaction ID is assigned to the interaction and the interaction state context data and steps performed are continually saved on self service application server and retrievable by this unique Interaction ID. The Interaction ID may be used to retrieve the details at a later time and may also be used to continue or restart an interaction at a later time by restoring the context state and data entered previously.

An initial self service session may be initiated by a user starting or launching a self service application via self service access terminal depicted in by process . In some embodiments self service access terminal establishes contact with self service application server and downloads data associated with a first page or UI screen of the self service application depicted by processes and . The first page or UI screen may be associated with a node e.g. a starting node of a decision tree see associated with the self service application. Self service application server may determine the best starting node for a particular interaction with the self service application based on any number of business rules including but not limited to previous interaction data and results data collected from LOB systems current Contact Center agent availability and or the current state of self service access terminal .

Self service access terminal may display the first UI screen on a display device e.g. a touch screen associated with self service access terminal . The user may interact with the self service application via self service access terminal by selecting an appropriate option or button presented on the UI screen or otherwise by providing user supplied input as depicted in process . In some embodiments at all times during the process self service access terminal may communicate to self service application server environmental data gathered from one or more sensors and or data gathering devices associated with self service access terminal such as GPS data image data a card swipe data etc. User selection of an option via UI screen may initiate communication of the user supplied input from self service access terminal to self service application server where self service application server may store the user supplied input in self service application database for example in a data file associated with a unique Interaction ID for this particular self service session. Furthermore based at least in part on the user supplied input self service application server may navigate the decision tree to reach a next node of the decision tree. The next node may a UI screen associated therewith and self service application server may communicate self service data associated with that UI screen back to self service access terminal as depicted by process . In some embodiments at all times during the process the self service application server may have the ability to connect to LOB application s to retrieve data e.g. customer data or business data and communicate this data to self service access terminal . Processes and may repeat until the problem has been resolved a completed self service interaction or until a node in the decision tree is reached which indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent.

A node in the decision tree indicating that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent may be reached in various ways including for example the receipt of user supplied input via a UI screen whereby the user requests a call back or that the self service application initiate a call to an agent or by the user placing a call to a call center agent or by a dead end in the decision tree where the designer of the self service application has determined that resolution of the problem will require an agent assisted service session.

In some cases the user may initiate an agent assisted service session via a button of a UI screen of the self service application as displayed on the display device of self service access terminal depicted in by an optional process . In that case the user supplied input initiating the agent assisted service session may be communicated from self service access terminal to self service application server depicted in by an optional process . In other cases the design of the decision tree for self service application may include or more nodes where an agent assisted service session is initiated automatically by the self service application. In some embodiments when an agent assisted service session is to be initiated a user may be presented with an option via a UI screen to place a call immediately or to request a call back from an agent when the agent becomes available. In order to assist a user in making a decision as to whether to place a call or to request a call back from an agent in some embodiments self service application server is able to integrate with CTI server to determine an approximate current wait or hold time based on the particular queue or agent group which is needed to resolve a particular issue.

Regardless of whether a user requests a call back whether a call is initiated by the user manually or automatically by the self service application self service application server communicates data associated with the user s interaction with the self service application to agent computer which displays information to the human agent depicted in as a process . The data may include user data environmental data and or a detailed interaction data representing a history of the nodes of the decision tree which were traversed during the interaction of the user with the self service application. Further in some embodiments technology may allow automation of entering data received into applications running on agent desktop in order to reduce handling time by the agent .

In some embodiments to initiate an agent assisted session a call may be automatically placed from self service access terminal to CTI server . In other embodiments a user may manually initiate the call via self service access terminal depicted in as an optional process . In still other embodiments where self service access terminal is not able to be connected to CTI server a user may place the call using a separate telephone. As explained above the call may be conducted over a standard phone channel via the PSTN or using VoIP.

Regardless of the method a call connection is established between self service access terminal and CTI server depicted in as process . CTI server routes the call to the agent telephone and or agent computer depending on the nature of the call PSTN VoIP etc. and the CTI server as depicted in as process . The agent processes the call via agent telephone and or agent computer depicted in as process . Also via agent computer the agent accesses the data associated with the user s interaction with the self service application including for example user data environmental data and or a detailed interaction data representing a history of the nodes of the decision tree which were traversed during the interaction of the user with the self service application depicted in as process . Finally the agent and the user communicate with each other to resolve the user s issue depicted in as processes and .

In the example a user may be prompted with choice lists to select the nature of the self service interaction choice buttons and user also has the ability to enter alpha numeric data .
