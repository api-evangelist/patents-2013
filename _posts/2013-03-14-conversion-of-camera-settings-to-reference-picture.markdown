Unless otherwise specifically defined herein all terms are to be given their broadest possible interpretation including meanings implied from the specification as well as meanings understood by those skilled in the art and or as defined in dictionaries treatises etc.

One or more embodiments relate generally to using an electronic device for using reference photo setting information for taking a photo image of a current framed image with an electronic device. One embodiment provides multiple reference photo selections.

In one embodiment the electronic device comprises a mobile electronic device capable of data communication over a communication link such as a wireless communication link. Examples of such mobile device include a mobile phone device a mobile tablet device smart mobile devices etc.

The system comprises an imaging inspiration module including an object based recognition module a location based information module a camera setting translation module and an image retrieval module . The imaging inspiration module utilizes mobile device hardware functionality including one or more of an image capture device such as e.g. a camera module global positioning satellite GPS receiver module compass module and accelerometer and gyroscope module .

The camera module is used to capture images of objects such as people surroundings places etc. The GPS module is used to identify a current location of the mobile device i.e. user . The compass module is used to identify direction of the mobile device. The accelerometer and gyroscope module is used to identify tilt of the mobile device.

The system determines current location and recognizes the subject matter currently being framed and presents a row of related photo images on the display of the mobile device for selection and use of the selected image photo camera settings for taking a photo of the subject matter currently framed using an image capture device of the mobile device . The system provides a simple fluid and responsive user experience.

Providing reference photo setting information for use in taking a photo image of a current framed image with an electronic device such as mobile device as shown in comprises integrating information including camera settings data e.g. F stop data flash data shutter speed data lighting data etc. location data sensor data i.e. magnetic field accelerometer rotation vector etc. For example Google Android mobile operating system application programming interface API components providing such information may be employed.

In one embodiment locating and obtaining images image photo metadata location data compass data object information recognition keyword information pulled from services from sources such as cloud environments networks servers clients mobile devices etc. In one embodiment the object based recognition module performs object recognition for objects being viewed in a current frame based on for example shape size outline etc. in comparison of known objects stored for example in a database or storage depository.

In one embodiment the location based information module obtains the location of the mobile device using the GPS module and the information from the object based recognition module . For example based on the GPS location information and object recognition information the location based information module may determine that the location and place of the current photo frame is a sports stadium e.g. based on the GPS data and the recognized object the venue may be determined . Similarly if the current frame encompasses a famous statue based on GPS data and object recognition the statue may be recognized and location including elevation angle lighting time of day etc. may be determined.

Additionally rotational information from the accelerometer and gyroscope module may be used to determine the position or angle of the image capture device of the electronic mobile device .

In one embodiment the image retrieval module uses the information obtained from the object based recognition module and the location based information module to search for similar preexisting photo images as compared to the current photo frame of an image capture device on the mobile electronic device via multiple sources such as photo databases photographer databases cloud storage facilities etc. Once similar preexisting photos have been located the mobile electronic device obtains the preexisting photos and the respective camera settings metadata and pulls the information to the mobile electronic device via the transceiver . The retrieved images are displayed on the display as thumbnails in for example a row on a display. The user may then select an inspirational photo image and view the camera settings on the display to determine whether to apply the same settings to the currently framed image.

In one embodiment the camera setting translation module analyzes the camera settings information from the preexisting photo metadata and determines whether the information needs to be translated to settings the camera module understands and automatically changes the camera settings on the electronic mobile device . The user may then capture the currently framed image using the settings based on the selected preexisting photo image.
