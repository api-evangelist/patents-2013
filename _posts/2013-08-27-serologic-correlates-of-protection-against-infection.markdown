title: Serologic correlates of protection against infection
abstract: Regions of protective antigen are provided representing sequences recognized by antibodies in subjects that have vaccine induced lethal toxin neutralizing anti-PA IgG responses. The recognition of these PA regions enhances the utility of anti-PA IgG reactivity as an immune correlate of protection against anthrax in a subject and increases predictive probability of survival. Also provided are vaccines that include at least one of these PA regions that when administered to a subject improve the predictive value of vaccine induced anti-PA IgG and TNA responses as immune correlates of protection against inhalation anthrax.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 577 878 filed Aug. 8 2012 which is the U.S. National Stage of application PCT US2011 024317 filed Feb. 10 2011 and which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 303 055 filed Feb. 10 2010 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 333 456 filed May 11 2010 the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates to physiologically relevant epitope sequences related to acquired immunity to protective antigen PA . The peptide sequences of the invention represent previously unidentified regions of PA that elicit an immune response in a mammal. Particularly the invention presents epitopes targeted by the immune system in rhesus macaques following immunization with compounds and formulations containing or producing anthrax toxin protective antigen PA .

Anthrax is caused by infection with a spore forming rod shaped bacterium. The dormant spore form is highly resistant to extreme conditions high temperatures and a variety of chemical treatments. The spores gain entry either through an open wound causing cutaneous disease by ingestion causing gastrointestinal disease by injection or are inhaled causing inhalation anthrax. All three forms can progress to a systemic infection leading to shock respiratory failure and death. Mock M. and Mignot T 2003 5 1 15 23 . The stability of the spores and their infectious capacity make them a convenient bioterrorist weapon.

Two of the known toxins of are binary combinations of protective antigen PA named for its ability to induce protective immunity against anthrax with either edema factor EF or lethal factor LF . PA is the cell biding component of both toxins and is responsible for bringing the catalytic EF or LF into the host cells. EF is an adenylate cyclase which converts ATP to cyclic AMP and causes edema Brossier F. Mock M 2001 39 11 1747 55 . The combination of PA EF forms edema toxin ETx which causes edema when injected locally. LF is a zinc dependent endoprotease known to target the amino terminus of the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase MAPKK family of response regulators Id. . The cleavage of these proteins disrupts a signaling pathway and leads to cytokine dysregulation and immune dysfunction. LF combined with PA forms lethal toxin LTx which is lethal in some animal models when injected on its own. It is also known that there are fatal anthrax cases where administration of antibiotics and clearance of bacteria have failed to rescue the patient. This indicates that there may be a point of no return level of LTx in the blood that may predict the outcome of infection.

Development of a safe and effective vaccine for inhalation and other forms of anthrax is vital to the health and safety of the population and an essential component of an anthrax bioterrorism defense strategy. Additionally the identification of targeted therapies following infection is essential to managing a patient population. As such there exists a need for vaccines and treatments as well as methods for determining whether post vaccination protection is achieved prior to possible exposure and infection.

The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the invention can be gained by taking the entire specification claims drawings and abstract as a whole.

A process of determining protection against infection or complications therefrom in a subject is provided that includes obtaining a biological sample from a subject optionally after a first onset time and screening the biological sample for the presence or absence of antibodies to one or more predefined regions of protective antigen PA . A predefined region is 5 or more amino acid residues or other epitope region length of amino acids 561 590 or 681 710 of mature protective antigen.

A process optionally includes a second administering of the same or a different vaccine obtaining a second biological sample following a second onset time and screening the second biological sample for the presence or absence of antibodies to one or more predefined regions of protective antigen. The presence or level of protection against is then determined from the screening of the second biological sample.

Also provided is a process of eliciting an immune response in a subject including administering a vaccine including an immunogen corresponding to amino acid regions 41 70 121 150 201 230 221 250 241 270 301 330 321 350 341 370 361 390 421 450 541 570 561 590 or 641 670 of SEQ ID NO 1 an immunogenic fragment thereof or any combination thereof to a subject.

The following description of particular embodiment s is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention its application or uses which may of course vary. The invention is described with relation to the non limiting definitions and terminology included herein. These definitions and terminology are not designed to function as a limitation on the scope or practice of the invention but are presented for illustrative and descriptive purposes only.

The invention has utility as a predictor of immunity to infection. The invention has further utility as one or more peptide sequences that alone or when combined are improved vaccines conferring protection against infection in a subject.

The invention provides polypeptide sequences that include relevant epitopes recognized by antibodies from subjects with acquired immunity to infection. The polypeptide sequences alone or in combination are useful for enhancing serologic correlates of protection to subsequent infection.

As such a process for identifying or predicting immunity to infection by is provided including screening for antibodies in a sample obtained from a subject following vaccination with rPA AVA or fragments thereof or prior infection by to identify whether antibodies to predefined regions of PA are generated by or present in the subject. The presence or absence of antibodies to one or more predefined regions of PA generates protective immune responses against subsequent infection by . Standard vaccines for often require multiple administrations to produce the desired level of immunity. The processes of the invention provide a mechanism by which a physician can identify whether a particular subject needs additional vaccine administrations or has already developed the necessary protection against subsequent infection by . The binding of antibodies from a subject to one or more predefined regions of PA indicates the presence of acquired immunity and enhances immune correlates of protection COP against inhalation anthrax in Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed AVA vaccinated rhesus macaques nonhuman primates NHP .

As defined herein a predefined region is a region of PA at least a portion of which serves as a B cell epitope. A predefined region is a region of PA optionally having 30 amino acids or fewer that is recognized by antibodies from subjects with immunity to infection. A predefined region includes a B cell epitope or immunogenic portion thereof. As such a predefined region may be termed an epitope but it is appreciated that a predefined region may include additional non epitope amino acids or be limited to the epitope region itself. It is also appreciated that the epitope present within one of the sequences listed herein is the essential and minimal sequence necessary. As such the listing of predefined regions herein are appreciated to be a region experimentally determined to include the essential epitope but the invention need not include the entire sequence of each predefined region as listed herein as long as the epitope for the antibodies targeting each predefined region are included or conservative mutations of amino acids therein.

A predefined region is optionally one or more of the following regions of PA the calcium ion chelating residues in the 1 and 1 strands AA181 210 1 1 1 AA201 230 1 and 1 AA 221 250 and 1 and 2 AA241 270 regions in domain 1 the chymotrypsin sensitive loop 2 2 AA 301 330 2 and 2 AA 321 350 2 2 and 2 AA341 370 2 and 2 AA361 390 2 2 2 and 2 AA421 450 2 in domain 2 3 3 AA 561 590 and 3 3 AA581 610 in domain 3 and partially in domain 4 of PA fragments thereof or combinations thereof.

A process optionally includes screening for antibodies to more than one predefined region. Screening is optionally performed following a single administration of vaccine. Optionally screening is done after several vaccinations. Optionally screening is done after each of several vaccinations. Optionally screening is done no more than one time. Illustratively a subject is vaccinated with PA recombinant PA AVA a vaccine as provided by the current invention and or other vaccine known in the art intended to provide immunity against infection once three times five times or more and a biological sample such as blood is obtained from the subject for determination of the presence or absence of antibodies to predefined regions of PA. Recognition of one or more antibodies to one or more predefined regions of PA following vaccination correlates with a predicted level of protection to subsequent infection by

As used herein the term anthrax is intended to mean . As such a subject suffering from anthrax is infected by . Similarly anthrax such as virulent anthrax is the organism

Interestingly and in contrast to results expected from the prior art the chymotrypsin sensitive loop 2 2 presents a strong epitope in PA that is found following vaccination in humans rabbits and rhesus macaques. The 2 2 loop is involved in the transition of PA oligomers from prepore to pore. This region was not expected to show strong antigenicity in each of humans rabbits and Rhesus macaques and to strongly correlate with acquired immunity to virulent anthrax because even though the structural region containing this loop may be important immunologically as a T cell epitope recipients of vaccines such as AVA and rPA may not recognize this region as an antibody reactive B cell epitope. Oscherwitz J et al. 2009 77 8 3380 8. As such this region of PA was not expected to be a good correlate of immunity. The presence of antibodies to this and surrounding regions of PA in multiple species as identified in the present invention surprisingly demonstrates its importance as a correlate of immunity.

Antibody screening is accomplished by methods known in the art illustratively enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA affinity chromatography liquid chromatography or other methods appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments a sample is obtained from a subject and screened in an ELISA assay using one or more peptides representing epitopes in PA or non epitope regions. A positive result is the presence of one or more antibodies in the sample to one or more epitopes above background levels optionally 2 times background optionally 3 times background. In some embodiments an amino acid sequence from each of the four domains of PA domain 1 aa 1 258 domain 2 aa 25 487 domain 3 aa 488 595 and or domain 4 aa 596 735 are represented by at least one peptide. It is appreciated that the numbering of predefined sequences represents the numbering of the mature PA sequence. PA such as that illustrated in SEQ ID NO 1 is free of the putative signal sequence of 29 amino acids that is cleaved to produce the mature PA protein. As such the numbering presented herein is related to mature PA.

Optionally a predefined region of PA useful to as a correlate of protection includes but is not limited to mature PA residues 41 70 the calcium ion chelating residues in the 1 and 1 strands AA181 210 1 1 1 AA201 230 1 and 1 AA221 250 and 1 and 2 AA241 270 regions in domain 1 the chymotrypsin sensitive loop 2 2 AA 301 330 2 and 2 AA 321 350 2 2 and 2 AA341 370 2 and 2 AA361 390 2 2 2 and 2 AA421 450 2 in domain 2 3 3 AA 561 590 and 3 3 AA581 610 in domain 3 and partially in domain 4 of PA mature PA residues 641 670 mature PA residues 681 710 mature PA residues 121 150 immunogenic fragments thereof or combinations thereof.

Optionally a predefined region that serves as a correlate of protection is mature PA residues 41 70 representing peptide 3 and having an amino acid sequence of GDLSIPSSELENIPSENQYFQSAIWSGFIK SEQ ID NO 14 or an immunogenic portion thereof. This predefined region shows weak positive correlation to acquired immunity to alone but as a portion of a collection of predefined regions contributes to significant positive correlation to protection.

Optionally a predefined region that serves as a correlate of protection is in the 2 2 region of mature PA in a peptide having residues 301 330 representing peptide 16 and having an amino acid sequence of SEVHGNAEVHASFFDIGGSVSAGFSNSNSS SEQ ID NO 3 or an immunogenic portion thereof. This predefined region shows positive correlation to acquired immunity to

This predefined region shows positive correlation to acquired immunity to

Optionally a predefined region that serves as a correlate of protection is mature PA residues 561 590 representing peptide 29 and having an amino acid sequence of NIKNQLAELNVTNIYTVLDKIKLNAKMNIL SEQ ID NO 13 or an immunogenic portion thereof. This predefined region shows positive correlation to acquired immunity to

Optionally a predefined region that serves as a correlate of protection is mature PA residues 641 670 representing peptide 33 and having an amino acid sequence of GYIVEIEDTEGLKEVINDRYDMLNISSLRQ SEQ ID NO 16 or an immunogenic portion thereof. This predefined region shows positive correlation to acquired immunity to

Optionally a predefined region that serves as a correlate of protection is mature PA residues 561 590 representing peptide 29 and having an amino acid sequence of NIKNQLAELNVTNIYTVLDKIKLNAKMNIL SEQ ID NO 12 or an immunogenic portion thereof. This predefined region shows positive correlation to acquired immunity to

Optionally a predefined region that serves as a correlate of protection is mature PA residues 681 710 representing peptide 35 and having an amino acid sequence of YNDKLPLYISNPNYKVNVYAVTKENTIINP SEQ ID NO 17 or an immunogenic portion thereof. This predefined region shows negative correlation to acquired immunity to

It is appreciated that peptide numbering is readily obtained from the mature PA sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 as each peptide is a 30 amino acid sequence of mature PA beginning at residue 1 and overlapping by 10 amino acids. Thus a sequence referred to herein as a peptide is readily understood on the basis of amino acid sequence.

An inventive process optionally includes obtaining a biological sample from a subject screening the biological sample for the presence or absence of antibodies to one or more predefined regions of protective antigen at least one of said predefined regions comprising residues 641 670 peptide 33 or 681 710 peptide 35 of mature protective antigen or an immunogenic portion thereof and determining the level of protection against from the screening.

As used herein a subject is a mammal. Optionally a subject is a human or non human primate. Optionally a subject is a dog cat equine sheep bovine rabbit pig or murine.

As used herein the term biological sample is defined as sample obtained from a biological organism a tissue cell cell culture medium or any medium suitable for mimicking biological conditions or from the environment. Non limiting examples include saliva gingival secretions cerebrospinal fluid gastrointestinal fluid mucous urogenital secretions synovial fluid blood serum plasma urine cystic fluid lymph fluid ascites pleural effusion interstitial fluid intracellular fluid ocular fluids seminal fluid mammary secretions vitreal fluid nasal secretions throat or nasal materials and combinations thereof. It is appreciated that a biological sample is optionally a cell illustratively cells of or related to the immune system. Cells illustratively include white blood cells. Illustrative examples of white blood cells include leukocytes such as T cells B cells and T helper cells.

A biological sample is obtained from a subject by conventional techniques. For example CSF is obtained by lumbar puncture. Blood is optionally obtained by venipuncture while plasma and serum are optionally obtained by fractionating whole blood according to known methods.

A process includes screening the biological sample for the presence or absence of antibodies to one or more predefined regions of mature PA or an immunogenic portion thereof. Antibodies are appreciated to be any suitable antibody type illustratively including IgG IgM IgA IgE or other. Optionally antibodies of the IgG type are targeted. A biological sample is screened optionally using a peptide encompassing a predefined region of mature PA using conventional techniques. Illustratively an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA is used. It is appreciated that other techniques known in the art are similarly suitable.

In some embodiments the step of screening includes contacting a plurality of screening peptides with said sample such that specific binding of an immunoglobulin to one or more of said peptides is detectable. A screening peptide is optionally a predefined region includes a predefined region or is an immunogenic portion of a predefined region. A screening peptide includes from 5 to 40 amino acids or any value or range therebetween. Optionally a screening peptide includes 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 or 40 residues. A peptide is not full length mature or immature PA. A plurality of peptides optionally are of overlapping sequence or of non overlapping sequences. Peptides are optionally labeled. A label is optionally biotin streptavidin a fluorophore a nucleic acid an isotope or other label.

One or more screening peptides are optionally used to determine the presence or absence of antibodies that specifically bind one or more of the screening peptides in a biological sample. A positive result is discerned when an antibody is found in the biological sample that binds to a specific peptide. By contacting a library of peptides to a biological sample or portions thereof the epitope regions of any anti PA antibodies present in the sample are readily discernable. The presence or absence of an antibody to one or more predefined regions encompassed by the peptide s is used to determine protection to in the subject from which the biological sample is derived.

The presence or absence of antibodies to one or more predefined regions of mature PA indicates that a subject possesses an immunity to or lacks sufficient immunity to infection. The presence of an antibody to a predefined region that positively correlates to protection indicates protection from infection. The presence of an antibody to a predefined region that negatively correlates with protection indicates a susceptibility or lack of protection to infection. An illustrative predefined region that negatively correlates to protection are peptides 35 28 or an immunogenic portion thereof. Optionally the presence of antibodies to one or more positively correlating predetermined regions and the absence of antibodies to one or more negatively correlating predetermined regions indicates protection to complications from subsequent infection by

It was surprisingly discovered that the presence of antibodies to peptide 35 28 or an immunogenic portion thereof negatively correlates to protection. As is observed in this region of PA is poorly immunogenic such that it was not expected that this region would show any correlation with protection at all either positive or negative. However the statistical analyses clearly demonstrate that the presence of antibodies the specifically bind this region of mature PA indicates a susceptibility to complications from infection by

Optionally a plurality of predefined regions are used to determine the correlate of infection that together provide significantly improved predictability of protection when used in combination than any predefined region alone and result in far superior prediction of protection relative to general measurements of IgG to PA. Such a plurality of predefined regions includes

Optionally a screening peptide includes a single epitope. Optionally the number of single epitope screening peptides included in an assay is no more than 2 3 4 5 or 6. Optionally the number of single epitope containing screening peptides is 2 3 4 or 5.

In some embodiments a vaccine is administered to a subject prior to simultaneous with or subsequent to obtaining a biological sample from the subject. Optionally a vaccine is administered and then an onset time elapses prior to obtaining a biological sample from the subject. An onset time is a time that is generally considered by those of skill in the art to be sufficient for a subject to produce an antibody to a portion of an immunogen such as an immunogen of the prior art. Optionally an onset time is 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more days. Optionally an onset time is 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more weeks. An onset time is optionally any time between 1 day and 60 days or any fraction or specific time period therebetween.

A process optionally includes a first administration of a vaccine a first onset time and then subsequently obtaining a first biological sample. A process optionally also includes determining whether a second administration is required by the presence or absence of an antibody to a peptide in the biological sample. Optionally a second administration is performed followed by a second onset time and obtaining a second biological sample for screening for the presence or absence of antibodies to one or more peptides. This iterative process optionally continues until a subject demonstrates acquired immunity or a physician determines that development of immunity is not possible in the subject. As such a third fourth fifth or additional administration is envisioned under the invention. Similarly a third fourth fifth or subsequent onset time is envisioned under the invention.

Also provided are vaccines that when administered to a subject will elicit an immune response. The term immune response refers to a kinetic or magnitude variation of one or more elements of a subject s immune system. An immune response is optionally the production of antibodies that specifically recognize and interact with the vaccine. Non limiting examples of immune responses include B cell responses calcium mobilization calcium influx or other changes in intracellular calcium concentrations in any cellular compartment illustratively including the cytoplasm nitric oxide production or release phagocytosis immunoglobulin uptake production of immunoglobulin alteration of protein phosphorylation conversion of immune complexes alteration of serum immunoglobulin levels modulating the activity of spleen tyrosine kinase Syk B cell linker BLNK Burton s tyrosine kinase Btk Kit Lck Zap 70 Src Stat1 SHP 2 phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase PI3K phosphoinositol 5 phosphatase other kinases or phosphatases known in the art phospholipase D phospholipase C sphingosine kinase secretion of IL 1 IL 6 IL 10 IL 2 IL 4 IFN Bcl10 TCR TLR or other cytokines chemokines or signaling molecules interferon signaling alteration of expression of interferon response gene s IRG antibody production illustratively IgE or IgG production alteration of the expression of any gene that encodes for a protein alteration of expression or activity of My4 LeuM3 molecule protection from challenge after exposure to infectious organism alteration in nitrite levels B cell responses in various immune compartments lymphoma cell responses natural killer cell responses monocyte responses macrophage responses platelet responses dendritic cell responses any immune cell response Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses in various immune compartments immune cell maturation activation or inhibition of an intracellular signaling pathway such as the NF kappa B signaling pathway apoptosis alteration in allotype or isotype antibody levels in vitro recognition of antigen survival other response known in the art or combinations thereof.

It is appreciated that the peptides of the invention may be representative vaccines operable under the invention with the exception of a peptide encoding an immunogenic portion of peptide 35 or peptide 28. As such any peptide vaccine described herein is suitable in the inventive processes for determining whether a subject has acquired immunity or is at risk for subsequent infection by . The terms polypeptide peptide are used interchangeably herein and are illustratively a chain of two or more amino acid residues. In some embodiments a peptide suitable for use in the instant invention is the amino acid sequence for PA protein fragments thereof or analogues thereof used alone or combined with other peptides or otherwise immunogenic sequence s or therapeutics. A peptide is optionally an immunogen. It is appreciated that an immunogen is any molecule used to vaccinate an organism. As such an immunogen is optionally a peptide a nucleic acid or combinations thereof.

A vaccine optionally includes one or more predefined regions of PA or an analogue thereof. In some embodiments a vaccine is a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a predefined region of PA such that when the nucleic acid sequence is administered to a subject the predefined peptide sequence is expressed by the subject to act as an immunogen for the generation of antibodies to the predefined sequence.

Optionally inventive peptide sequences representing predefined regions of PA useful as vaccines are AA41 70 of mature PA 121 150 of mature PA the calcium ion chelating residues in the 1 and 1 strands AA181 210 1 1 1 AA201 230 1 and 1 AA 221 250 and 1 and 2 AA241 270 regions in domain 1 the chymotrypsin sensitive loop 2 2 AA 301 330 2 and 2 AA 321 350 2 2 and 2 AA341 370 2136 and 2137 AA361 390 2 2 2 and 2 AA421 450 AA 541 570 of mature PA 2 in domain 2 3 3 AA 561 590 3 3 AA581 610 in domain 3 and partially in domain 4 of PA and AA641 670 in domain 4 of PA analogues thereof immunogenic fragments thereof or combinations thereof. When a peptide is used as a vaccine analogues of a peptide are operable as an immunogen. An analogue of an immunogen peptide will elicit the production of antibodies with sufficient affinity to the wild type PA sequence to be used as biological antibodies to the wild type sequence.

Optionally peptides used either as an immunogen or as a screening peptide are chemically synthesized or recombinant and are obtained by methods known in the art. Illustratively a nucleotide sequence may be cloned into a plasmid which is transfected into and expressed. The nucleotide sequence encoding immature PA is illustrated as SEQ ID NO 2.

It is appreciated that any portion of SEQ ID NO 2 or a variant thereof that will encode a peptide of the invention is operable herein for the production of a peptide or for use as a vaccine itself or as a screening peptide. An inventive nucleic acid sequence that encodes a peptide of SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 3 other peptide sequences herein fragments thereof or analogues thereof is encompassed in the invention. Similarly variants of SEQ ID NO 2 or fragments thereof are operable to encode a peptide of the invention. The genetic code is a degenerate code whereby specific nucleic acid sequences encode for particular amino acids yet in most cases more than one codon three nucleotide sequence will encode for the same amino acid. It is therefore appreciated that a variant of SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 1 or a fragment thereof that encodes a polypeptide under the invention is a nucleic acid sequence of the invention. It is well within the level of those of skill in the art to determine a nucleic acid sequence that will encode the inventive peptide immunogens.

Amino acids present in a vaccine or peptide include the common amino acids alanine cysteine aspartic acid glutamic acid phenylalanine glycine histidine isoleucine lysine leucine methionine asparagine proline glutamine arginine serine threonine valine tryptophan and tyrosine as well as less common naturally occurring amino acids modified amino acids or synthetic compounds such as alpha asparagine 2 aminobutanoic acid or 2 aminobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid 2 aminocapric acid 2 aminodecanoic acid 6 aminocaproic acid alpha glutamine 2 aminoheptanoic acid 6 aminohexanoic acid alpha aminoisobutyric acid 2 aminoalanine 3 aminoisobutyric acid beta alanine allo hydroxylysine allo isoleucine 4 amino 7 methylheptanoic acid 4 amino 5 phenylpentanoic acid 2 aminopimelic acid gamma amino beta hydroxybenzenepentanoic acid 2 aminosuberic acid 2 carboxyazetidine beta alanine beta aspartic acid biphenylalanine 3 6 diaminohexanoic acid butanoic acid cyclobutyl alanine cyclohexylalanine cyclohexylglycine N5 aminocarbonylornithine cyclopentyl alanine cyclopropyl alanine 3 sulfoalanine 2 4 diaminobutanoic acid diaminopropionic acid 2 4 diaminobutyric acid diphenyl alanine N N dimethylglycine diaminopimelic acid 2 3 diaminopropanoic acid S ethylthiocysteine N ethylasparagine N ethylglycine 4 aza phenylalanine 4 fluoro phenylalanine gamma glutamic acid gamma carboxyglutamic acid hydroxyacetic acid pyroglutamic acid homoarginine homocysteic acid homocysteine homohistidine 2 hydroxyisovaleric acid homophenylalanine homoleucine homoproline homoserine homoserine 2 hydroxypentanoic acid 5 hydroxylysine 4 hydroxyproline 2 carboxyoctahydroindole 3 carboxylsoquinoline isovaline 2 hydroxypropanoic acid lactic acid mercaptoacetic acid mercaptobutanoic acid sarcosine 4 methyl 3 hydroxyproline mercaptopropanoic acid norleucine nipecotic acid nortyrosine norvaline omega amino acid ornithine penicillamine 3 mercaptovaline 2 phenylglycine 2 carboxypiperidine sarcosine N methylglycine 2 amino 3 4 sulfophenyl propionic acid 1 amino 1 carboxycyclopentane 3 thienylalanine epsilon N trimethyllysine 3 thiazolylalanine thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid alpha amino 2 4 dioxopyrimidinepropanoic acid and 2 naphthylalanine. A peptide optionally has between 2 and about 60 amino acids.

A peptide is obtained by any of various methods known in the art illustratively including isolation from a cell or organism chemical synthesis expression of a nucleic acid sequence and partial hydrolysis of proteins. Chemical methods of peptide synthesis are known in the art and include solid phase peptide synthesis and solution phase peptide synthesis or by the method of Hackeng T M et al. 1997 94 15 7845 50 or those reviewed by Miranda L P 2000 55 217 26 and Kochendoerfer G G 2001 4 2 205 14. In some embodiments the polypeptide sequences are chemically synthesized by Fmoc synthesis.

An inventive PA immunogen has the sequence represented by a fragment of SEQ ID NO 1 wherein the fragment includes at least a portion of AA121 150 of mature PA AA41 70 of mature PA the calcium ion chelating residues in the 1 and 1 strands AA181 210 1 1 1 AA201 230 1 and 1 AA 221 250 and 1 and 2 AA241 270 regions in domain 1 the chymotrypsin sensitive loop 2 2 AA 301 330 2 and 2 AA 321 350 2 2 and 2 AA341 370 2 and 2 AA361 390 2 2 2 and 2 AA421 450 AA541 570 of mature PA 2 in domain 2 3 3 AA 561 590 3 3 AA581 610 in domain 3 and partially in domain 4 of PA AA661 690 of mature PA immunogenic portions thereof or combinations thereof. A peptide immunogen is optionally recombinant. However it is also envisioned that naturally occurring PA immunogen may be isolated from at least a portion of the cellular and other sample material for which the wild type sequence is normally found. Methods for purification of protein from organism derived samples are known and are within the level of skill in the art illustratively affinity chromatography.

To ease purification or screening procedures the expressed polypeptides optionally include a tag sequence. Illustrative examples of tags suitable for use in the instant invention include poly histidine CBP CYD covalent yet dissociable NorpD peptide strep 2 FLAG HPC or heavy chain of protein C peptide tag biotin avidin or GST and MBP protein fusion tag systems. It is appreciated that other tag systems are similarly operable. In some embodiments recombinant peptides are expressed in and purified using an affinity tag system followed by enzymatic cleavage of the tag such as by incorporating a factor Xa thrombin or other enzyme cleavage site in the expressed polypeptide. Methods of tag cleavage are known in the art and any effective method is appreciated to be suitable for use in the instant invention.

It is recognized that numerous analogues of a peptide are within the scope of the present invention including amino acid substitutions alterations modifications or other amino acid changes that increase decrease or do not alter the function or immunogenic propensity of the inventive immunogen. Several post translational modifications are similarly envisioned as within the scope of the present invention illustratively including incorporation of a non naturally occurring amino acid s phosphorylation glycosylation sulfation and addition of pendent groups such as biotynlation fluorophores lumiphores radioactive groups antigens or other molecules.

It is appreciated that the inventive peptides of the present invention are phosphorylated or unphosphorylated. Optionally an inventive peptide is disulfide bonded. Disulfide bonds can be to amino acid residues within the sequence or to a second polypeptide or molecule.

Modifications and changes can be made in the structure of the inventive peptides that are the subject of the application and still obtain a molecule having similar or improved characteristics as the wild type sequence e.g. a conservative amino acid substitution . For example certain amino acids can be substituted for other amino acids in a sequence without appreciable loss of immunogenic activity. Because it is the interactive capacity and nature of a polypeptide that defines that polypeptide s biological functional activity certain amino acid sequence substitutions can be made in a polypeptide sequence and nevertheless obtain a polypeptide with like or improved properties. Optionally a polypeptide is used that has less or more immunogenic activity compared to the wild type sequence.

In making such changes the hydropathic index of amino acids can be considered. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biologic function on a polypeptide is generally understood in the art. It is known that certain amino acids can be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still result in a polypeptide with similar biological activity. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. Those indices are isoleucine 4.5 valine 4.2 leucine 3.8 phenylalanine 2.8 cysteine cysteine 2.5 methionine 1.9 alanine 1.8 glycine 0.4 threonine 0.7 serine 0.8 tryptophan 0.9 tyrosine 1.3 proline 1.6 histidine 3.2 glutamate 3.5 glutamine 3.5 aspartate 3.5 asparagine 3.5 lysine 3.9 and arginine 4.5 .

It is believed that the relative hydropathic character of the amino acid determines the secondary structure of the resultant polypeptide which in turn defines the interaction of the polypeptide with other molecules such as enzymes substrates receptors antibodies antigens and the like. It is known in the art that an amino acid can be substituted by another amino acid having a similar hydropathic index and still obtain a functionally equivalent polypeptide. In making such changes the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within 2 is optional those within 1 are optional and those within 0.5 are similarly optional.

Substitution of like amino acids can also be made on the basis of hydrophilicity particularly where the biological functional equivalent polypeptide or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments. The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to amino acid residues arginine 3.0 lysine 3.0 aspartate 3.0 1 glutamate 3.0 1 serine 0.3 asparagine 0.2 glutamine 0.2 glycine 0 proline 0.5 1 threonine 0.4 alanine 0.5 histidine 0.5 cysteine 1.0 methionine 1.3 valine 1.5 leucine 1.8 isoleucine 1.8 tyrosine 2.3 phenylalanine 2.5 tryptophan 3.4 . It is understood that an amino acid can be substituted for another having a similar hydrophilicity value and still obtain a biologically equivalent and in particular an immunologically equivalent polypeptide. In such changes the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within 2 is optional those within 1 are optional and those within 0.5 are optional.

As outlined above amino acid substitutions are generally based on the relative similarity of the amino acid side chain substituents for example their hydrophobicity hydrophilicity charge size and the like. Exemplary substitutions that take various of the foregoing characteristics into consideration are well known to those of skill in the art and include original residue exemplary substitution Ala Gly Ser Arg Lys Asn Gln His Asp Glu Cys Ser Gln Asn Glu Asp Gly Ala His Asn Gln Ile Leu Val Leu Ile Val Lys Arg Met Leu Tyr Ser Thr Thr Ser Tip Tyr Tyr Trp Phe and Val Ile Leu . Embodiments of this disclosure thus contemplate functional or biological equivalents of a polypeptide as set forth above. In particular embodiments of the polypeptides can include variants having about 50 60 70 80 90 and 95 sequence identity to the polypeptide of interest.

It is appreciated that amino acids are optionally L or D isomers. An inventive polypeptide optionally includes mixtures of L and D isomers.

Peptide expression is illustratively accomplished from transcription of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a peptide of the invention and translation of RNA transcribed from nucleic acid sequence modifications thereof or fragments thereof. Protein expression is optionally performed in a cell based system such as in Hela cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells. It is appreciated that cell free expression systems are similarly operable.

It is recognized that numerous analogues of a peptide are within the scope of the present invention including amino acid substitutions alterations modifications or other amino acid changes that increase decrease or do not alter the function or the ability of PA immunogen to generate antibodies that will interact with a wild type PA protein sequence. It is appreciated that an analogue includes one or more amino acid insertions deletions substitutions or modifications. An analogue of SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 3 or any other amino acid sequence taught herein is sufficiently immunogenic in a host to produce an antibody that will specifically bind to at least a portion of wild type PA. One of ordinary skill in the art understands how to produce antibodies by standard techniques and screen the resulting monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for their ability to interact with an epitope sequence. Such methods are illustratively taught by Monoclonal Antibodies Methods and Protocols Albitar M ed. Humana Press 2010 ISBN 1617376469 and Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Harlos E and Lane D. eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1988 ISBN 10 0879693142 .

Further aspects of the present disclosure concern the purification and in particular embodiments the substantial purification of a peptide. The term purified or isolated peptide as used herein is intended to refer to a composition isolatable from other components wherein the PA immunogen is purified to any degree relative to its naturally obtainable state. A purified peptide therefore also refers to a peptide free from the environment in which it may naturally occur.

Generally purified or isolated will refer to a peptide composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components and which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where the term substantially purified is used this designation will refer to a composition in which the protein or peptide forms the major component of the composition such as constituting about 50 or more of the proteins in the composition.

Various methods for quantifying the degree of purification of the peptide known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure as based on knowledge in the art. These include for example determining the specific activity of an active fraction or assessing the number of peptides within a fraction by SDS PAGE analysis. An illustrative method for assessing the purity of a fraction is to calculate the specific activity of the fraction to compare it to the specific activity of the initial extract and to thus calculate the degree of purity herein assessed by a fold purification number . The actual units used to represent the amount of activity will of course be dependent upon the particular assay technique chosen to follow the purification and whether or not the expressed protein or peptide exhibits a detectable activity.

Various techniques suitable for use in peptide purification will be well known to those of skill in the art. These include for example precipitation with ammonium sulphate polyethylene glycol antibodies and the like or by heat denaturation followed by centrifugation chromatography steps such as ion exchange gel filtration reverse phase hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis and combinations of such and other techniques. As is generally known in the art it is believed that the order of conducting the various purification steps may be changed or that certain steps may be omitted and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified protein or peptide.

Additional methods of peptide isolation illustratively include column chromatography affinity chromatography gel electrophoresis filtration or other methods known in the art. In some embodiments an immunogen is expressed with a tag operable for affinity purification. An illustrative tag is a 6 His tag. A 6 His tagged inventive peptide immunogen is illustratively purified by Ni NTA column chromatography or using an anti 6 His tag antibody fused to a solid support. Geneway Biotech San Diego Calif. Other tags and purification systems are similarly operable.

It is appreciated that an inventive peptide is optionally not tagged. In this embodiment and other embodiments purification is optionally achieved by methods known in the art illustratively including ion exchange chromatography affinity chromatography using antibodies directed to the peptide sequence of interest precipitation with salt such as ammonium sulfate streptomycin sulfate or protamine sulfate reverse phase chromatography size exclusion chromatography such as gel exclusion chromatography HPLC immobilized metal chelate chromatography or other methods known in the art. One of skill in the art may select the most appropriate isolation and purification techniques without departing from the scope of this invention.

There is no general requirement that the peptide always be provided in its most purified state. It is contemplated that less substantially purified products will have utility in certain embodiments. Partial purification may be accomplished by using fewer purification steps in combination or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification scheme. For example it is appreciated that a cation exchange column chromatography performed utilizing an HPLC apparatus will generally result in a greater fold purification than the same technique utilizing a low pressure chromatography system. Methods exhibiting a lower degree of relative purification may have advantages in total recovery of protein product or in maintaining the activity of an expressed protein.

It is known that the migration of a peptide can vary sometimes significantly with different conditions of SDS PAGE Capaldi et al. 76 425 1977 . It will therefore be appreciated that under differing electrophoresis conditions the apparent molecular weights of purified or partially purified expression products may vary.

PA immunogens or screening peptides of this invention may optionally be characterized by measurements including without limitation western blot macromolecular mass determinations by biophysical determinations SDS PAGE staining HPLC and the like antibody recognition assays cell viability assays apoptosis assays and assays to infer immune protection or immune pathology by adoptive transfer of cells proteins or antibodies.

Also provided are isolated nucleic acids encoding the desired peptide sequence analogues thereof or fragments thereof. These nucleic acids can be used to produce the peptides of this invention or as nucleic acid vaccines wherein the peptides of this invention are produced in a subject.

The term nucleotide is intended to mean a base sugar phosphate combination either natural or synthetic linear circular and sequential arrays of nucleotides and nucleosides e.g. cDNA genomic DNA mRNA and RNA oligonucleotides oligonucleosides and derivatives thereof. Included in this definition are modified nucleotides which include additions to the sugar phosphate groups as well as to the bases.

The term nucleic acid or polynucleotide refers to multiple nucleotides attached in the form of a single or double stranded polynucleotide that can be natural or derived synthetically enzymatically and by cloning methods. The term oligonucleotide refers to a polynucleotide of less than 200 nucleotides. The terms nucleic acid and oligonucleotide may be used interchangeably in this application.

A nucleic acid as used herein refers to single or double stranded molecules that may be DNA including of the nucleotide bases A T C and G or RNA comprised of the bases A U substitutes for T C and G. The nucleic acid may represent a coding strand or its complement. Nucleic acids may be identical in sequence to the sequence naturally occurring illustratively SEQ ID NO 2 or a fragment thereof or may include alternative codons that encode the same amino acid as that found in the naturally occurring sequence. Furthermore nucleic acids may include codons that represent conservative substitutions of amino acids as are well known in the art.

The nucleic acid encoding the peptide of this invention can be part of a recombinant nucleic acid construct comprising any combination of restriction sites and or functional elements as are well known in the art that facilitate molecular cloning and other recombinant DNA manipulations. Thus the present invention further provides a recombinant nucleic acid construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding a peptide of this invention.

The present invention also provides a vector with a nucleic acid sequence encoding an inventive PA immunogen or screening peptide sequence therein. Illustrative vectors include a plasmid cosmid cationic lipids non liposomal cationic vectors cationic cyclodextrin viruses with RNA or DNA genetic material polyethylenimines histidylated polylysine or other vector system known in the art. A vector is optionally a plasmid. A suitable vector optionally possesses cell type specific expression or other regulatory sequences or sequences operable to stimulate or inhibit gene or protein expression. A vector illustratively contains a selection marker such as an antibiotic resistance gene.

The inventive nucleic acid sequence is optionally isolated from the cellular materials with which it is naturally associated. As used herein the term isolated nucleic acid means a nucleic acid separated or substantially free from at least some of the other components of the naturally occurring organism for example the cell structural components commonly found associated with nucleic acids in a cellular environment and or other nucleic acids. The isolation of nucleic acids is optionally accomplished by techniques such as cell lysis followed by phenol plus chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation of the nucleic acids. The nucleic acids of this invention can be isolated from cells according to methods well known in the art for isolating nucleic acids. Alternatively the nucleic acids of the present invention can be synthesized according to standard protocols well described in the literature for synthesizing nucleic acids. Modifications to the nucleic acids of the invention are also contemplated provided that the essential structure and function of the peptide encoded by the nucleic acid are maintained.

Numerous methods are known in the art for the synthesis and production of nucleic acid sequences illustratively including cloning and expression in cells such as insect cells such as Sf9 cells yeast and mammalian cell types such as Hela cells Chinese hamster ovary cells or other cells systems known in the art as amendable to transfection and nucleic acid and or protein expression. Methods of nucleic acid isolation are similarly recognized in the art. Illustratively plasmid DNA amplified in is cleaved by suitable restriction enzymes such as NdeI and XhoI to linearize PA DNA. The PA DNA is subsequently isolated following gel electrophoresis using a S.N.A.P. UV Free Gel Purification Kit Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. as per the manufacturer s instructions.

Numerous agents are amenable to facilitate cell transfection illustratively including synthetic or natural transfection agents such as LIPOFECTIN baculovirus naked plasmid or other DNA or other systems known in the art.

The nucleic acid sequences of the invention may be isolated or amplified by conventional uses of polymerase chain reaction or cloning techniques such as those described in conventional texts. For example the nucleic acid sequences of this invention may be prepared or isolated from DNA using DNA primers and PCR techniques. Alternatively the inventive PA nucleic acid sequence may be obtained from gene banks derived from whole genomic DNA. These sequences fragments thereof modifications thereto and the full length sequences may be constructed recombinantly using conventional genetic engineering or chemical synthesis techniques or PCR and the like.

Also provided is a host cell transformed with an appropriate vector or with the inventive PA peptide sequence. Illustrative host cells include or Sf9 cells. Optionally cell transfection is achieved by electroporation.

Recombinant or non recombinant proteinase peptides or recombinant or non recombinant proteinase inhibitor peptides or other non peptide proteinase inhibitors can also be used in the present invention. Proteinase inhibitors are optionally modified to resist degradation for example degradation by digestive enzymes and conditions. Techniques for the expression and purification of recombinant proteins are known in the art see Sambrook Eds. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3ed. Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 2001 .

Some embodiments of the present invention are compositions containing a nucleic acid sequence that can be expressed as a peptide according to the invention. The engineering of DNA segment s for expression in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic system may be performed by techniques generally known to those of skill in recombinant expression. It is believed that virtually any expression system may be employed in the expression of the claimed nucleic acid and amino acid sequences.

As used herein the terms engineered and recombinant cells are synonymous with host cells and are intended to refer to a cell into which an exogenous DNA segment or gene such as a cDNA or gene has been introduced. Therefore engineered cells are distinguishable from naturally occurring cells which do not contain a recombinantly introduced exogenous DNA segment or gene. A host cell is optionally a naturally occurring cell that is transformed with an exogenous DNA segment or gene or a cell that is not modified. Engineered cells are cells having a gene or genes introduced through the hand of man. Recombinant cells include those having an introduced cDNA or genomic DNA and also include genes positioned adjacent to a promoter not naturally associated with the particular introduced gene.

To express a recombinant peptide in accordance with the present invention one optionally prepares an expression vector that comprises a nucleic acid under the control of one or more promoters. To bring a coding sequence under the control of a promoter one positions the 5 end of the translational initiation site of the reading frame generally between about 1 and 50 nucleotides downstream of i.e. 3 of the chosen promoter. The upstream promoter stimulates transcription of the inserted DNA and promotes expression of the encoded recombinant protein. This is the meaning of recombinant expression in the context used here.

Many standard techniques are available to construct expression vectors containing the appropriate nucleic acids and transcriptional translational control sequences in order to achieve peptide expression in a variety of host expression systems. Cell types available for expression include but are not limited to bacteria such as and transformed with recombinant phage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors.

Certain examples of prokaryotic hosts are strain RR1 LE392 B .chi. 1776 ATCC No. 31537 as well as W3110 F lambda prototrophic ATCC No. 273325 bacilli such as and other enterobacteriaceae such as and various species.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example is often transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. Plasmid pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. The pBR322 plasmid or other microbial plasmid or phage must also contain or be modified to contain promoters that can be used by the microbial organism for expression of its own proteins.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example the phage lambda may be utilized in making a recombinant phage vector that can be used to transform host cells such as LE392.

Further useful vectors include pIN vectors and pGEX vectors for use in generating glutathione S transferase GST soluble fusion proteins for later purification and separation or cleavage. Other suitable fusion proteins are those with galactosidase ubiquitin or the like.

Promoters that are most commonly used in recombinant DNA construction include the lactamase penicillinase lactose and tryptophan trp promoter systems. While these are the most commonly used other microbial promoters have been discovered and utilized and details concerning their nucleotide sequences have been published enabling those of skill in the art to ligate them functionally with plasmid vectors.

For expression in the plasmid YRp7 for example is commonly used. This plasmid contains the trp1 gene which provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1. The presence of the trp1 lesion as a characteristic of the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan.

Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phosphofructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase. In constructing suitable expression plasmids the termination sequences associated with these genes are also ligated into the expression vector 3 of the sequence desired to be expressed to provide polyadenylation of the mRNA and termination.

Other suitable promoters which have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions include the promoter region for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism and the aforementioned glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization.

In addition to microorganisms cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms may also be used as hosts. In principle any such cell culture is operable whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. In addition to mammalian cells these include insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus and plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing one or more coding sequences.

In a useful insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The isolated nucleic acid coding sequences are cloned into non essential regions for example the polyhedron gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedron promoter . Successful insertion of the coding sequences results in the inactivation of the polyhedron gene and production of non occluded recombinant virus i.e. virus lacking the proteinaceous coat coded for by the polyhedron gene . These recombinant viruses are then used to infect cells in which the inserted gene is expressed e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 215 051 .

Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are VERO and HeLa cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell lines W138 BHK COS 7 293 HepG2 NIH3T3 RIN and MDCK cell lines. In addition a host cell may be chosen that modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the encoded protein.

Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. Expression vectors for use in mammalian cells ordinarily include an origin of replication as necessary a promoter located in front of the gene to be expressed along with any necessary ribosome binding sites RNA splice sites polyadenylation site and transcriptional terminator sequences. The origin of replication may be provided either by construction of the vector to include an exogenous origin such as may be derived from SV40 or other viral e.g. Polyoma Adeno VSV BPV source or may be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome the latter is often sufficient.

The promoters may be derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Further it is also possible and may be desirable to utilize promoter or control sequences normally associated with the desired gene sequence provided such control sequences are compatible with the host cell systems.

A number of viral based expression systems may be utilized for example commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma Adenovirus 2 cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 . The early and late promoters of SV40 virus are useful because both are obtained easily from the virus as a fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. Smaller or larger SV40 fragments may also be used provided there is included the approximately 250 bp sequence extending from the HindIII site toward the BglI site located in the viral origin of replication.

In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the coding sequences may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing proteins in infected hosts.

Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of the claimed isolated nucleic acid coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Exogenous translational control signals including the ATG initiation codon may additionally need to be provided. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily be capable of determining this need and providing the necessary signals. It is well known that the initiation codon must be in frame or in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements or transcription terminators.

In eukaryotic expression one will also typically desire to incorporate into the transcriptional unit an appropriate polyadenylation site if one was not contained within the original cloned segment. Typically the poly A addition site is placed about 30 to 2000 nucleotides downstream of the termination site of the protein at a position prior to transcription termination.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines that stably express constructs encoding proteins may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with vectors controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched medium and then are switched to a selective medium. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase genes in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin. It is appreciated that numerous other selection systems are known in the art that are similarly operable in the present invention.

It is contemplated that the isolated nucleic acids of the disclosure may be overexpressed i.e. expressed in increased levels relative to its natural expression in cells of its indigenous organism or even relative to the expression of other proteins in the recombinant host cell. Such overexpression may be assessed by a variety of methods including radio labeling and or protein purification. However simple and direct methods are preferred for example those involving SDS PAGE and protein staining or immunoblotting followed by quantitative analyses such as densitometric scanning of the resultant gel or blot. A specific increase in the level of the recombinant protein or peptide in comparison to the level in natural human cells is indicative of overexpression as is a relative abundance of the specific protein in relation to the other proteins produced by the host cell and e.g. visible on a gel.

A nucleic acid of this invention can be in a cell which can be a cell expressing the nucleic acid whereby a peptide of this invention is produced in the cell. In addition the vector of this invention can be in a cell which can be a cell expressing the nucleic acid of the vector whereby a peptide of this invention is produced in the cell. It is also contemplated that the nucleic acids and or vectors of this invention can be present in a host animal e.g. a transgenic animal which expresses the nucleic acids of this invention and produces the peptides of this invention.

The nucleic acid encoding the peptides of this invention can be any nucleic acid that functionally encodes the peptides of this invention. To functionally encode the peptides i.e. allow the nucleic acids to be expressed the nucleic acid of this invention can include for example expression control sequences such as an origin of replication a promoter an enhancer and necessary information processing sites such as ribosome binding sites RNA splice sites polyadenylation sites and transcriptional terminator sequences.

Expression control sequences include promoters derived from metallothionine genes actin genes immunoglobulin genes CMV SV40 adenovirus bovine papilloma virus etc. A nucleic acid encoding a selected peptide can readily be determined based upon the genetic code for the amino acid sequence of the selected peptide and many nucleic acids will encode any selected peptide. Modifications in the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide are also contemplated. Modifications that can be useful are modifications to the sequences controlling expression of the peptide to make production of the peptide inducible or repressible as controlled by the appropriate inducer or repressor. Such methods are standard in the art. The nucleic acid of this invention can be generated by means standard in the art such as by recombinant nucleic acid techniques and by synthetic nucleic acid synthesis or in vitro enzymatic synthesis.

In a non limiting example the antigen is coupled to chemical compounds or immunogenic carriers provided that the coupling does not interfere with the desired biological activity of either the antigen or the carrier.

New Zealand white rabbits were vaccinated with an undiluted human dose or 1 10 or 1 20 dilution at 0 4 26 weeks with 0.5 ml of either AVA or purified rPA. Rhesus macaques are vaccinated by intramuscular injection with 50 g of rPA at 0 2 4 8 12 16 20 weeks. Macaques in one study were vaccinated with AVA at 0 4 26 weeks with undiluted or diluted human dose of AVA 1 5 1 10 1 20 and 1 40 . All dilutions are in saline. As a control animals are vaccinated with an equal volume of saline at the same intervals.

Ten human subjects are vaccinated with AVA at the recommended dose and schedule of administration following the regimen at the time of the study with administration at 0 2 4 weeks and 6 12 30 42 months with annual boosters.

Whole blood is obtained from human macaque and rabbit subjects by venipuncture. All blood is collected into tubes in the absence of an anticoagulant. Tubes are allowed to incubate on the bench top for 45 minutes to induce clot formation. The resulting serum is separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for 15 minutes and aspirated as the supernatant. All samples are either assayed immediately or stored at 80 C. until assay.

IMMULON 2 HB microtiter plates Thermo Labsystems Franklin Mass. were coated with streptavidin Promega Madison Wis. at 2 g ml and purified rPA BEI Resources Manassas Va. in control wells 2 g ml in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.4 Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . Plates were incubated overnight 16 24 hours at 4 C. and then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1 Tween 20 pH 7.4 ELISA Wash Buffer . The plate was divided into two equal parts four rows in each and each part was coated with peptides at 1 g ml one peptide per well incubated overnight 16 24 hours at 4 C. and then washed 3 times with ELISA Wash Buffer. Each well was loaded with 1 50 dilution of test serum top portion of the plate or negative control bottom portion of the plate diluted in PBS containing 5 Skim Milk and 0.5 Tween 20 pH 7.4 Serum Diluent . Plates were incubated for 60 min at 37 C. and washed 3 times with ELISA wash buffer. 100 l of species specific anti IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to all wells and incubated at 37 C. for 60 min. Plates were washed 3 times and 100 l of ABTS Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. was added to all wells. After 30 min incubation at 37 C. 100 l of ABTS Peroxidase Stop Solution Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. was added to each well and plates were read within 30 min with a Microplate Spectrophotometer Bio Tek PowerWave Bio Tek Instruments Inc. Winooski Vt. at a wavelength of 405 nm with a 490 nm reference. Assay endpoints were reported as OD values. A peptide was considered antigenic if its Optical Density OD value was greater than the mean OD plus 3 Standard Deviations SD of controls.

The reactivity of serum from three different pools of vaccinated Rhesus macaques are illustrated in . Additional testing is illustrated in . At least one peptide representing amino acid sequence from each of the four domains of PA is a target for PA specific IgG in Rhesus macaques. Particularly strong reactivity is observed in domain 2 between amino acids 301 and 330 as well as in various locations in domain 4. Macaque AVR817 is a negative control and demonstrates baseline activity throughout PA.

Interestingly similar profiles of reactivity are observed in sera from rabbits and humans vaccinated with AVA. demonstrates strong reactivity in domain 2 for peptides corresponding to residues 301 330 of mature PA. Rabbits also show strong reactivity in a range of domain 3 regions and domain 4 regions. Humans show the most restricted reactivity of the three species but the overall regions of reactivity are similar with high reactivity in domain 2 at amino acids 301 330 and in domain 4.

The seroreactivity is independent on the type of peptide or vaccine used to vaccinate both humans and rhesus macaques. illustrates the reactivity in sera from rhesus macaques vaccinated either with AVA or rPA and show highly correlative reactivity. Additionally the addition of four administrations in macaques to a total of 7 does not alter the reactivity indicating that full immunity is observed after three administrations. 

Overall vaccination with rPA or AVA vaccines produces a robust immune response with the generation of antibodies to several regions of PA encompassing domains 1 4.

Control mice are immunized with a scrambled peptide of 30 amino acids in length. All sequences are Fmoc synthesized as C terminal amides HPLC purified and prepared as trifluoroacetic acid salts.

The immunization studies in mice are performed in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. Female BALB c mice 6 8 weeks old 20 50 g weight The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. were immunized with 3 injections of 20 g of peptides in Sigma Adjuvant System Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. . Blood collected 14 days after the third injection by cardiac puncture. Sera were stored at 20 C.

For detection of PA and anti peptide specific antibodies 96 well microtiter ELISA plates are coated with 100 l well of PA or one of each peptide at a concentration of 2.0 g ml in PBS pH 7.4. The plates are stored overnight at 4 C. The serum samples from the mouse are serially diluted 1 100 to 1 128 000 . Plates are incubated with 100 l of diluted serum samples for 1 h at 37 C. followed by washing with PBS Tween. The plates are then incubated for 1 h at 37 C. with 100 l of HRP conjugated goat anti mouse IgG 1 5 000 dilution of 1 mg ml stock . ABTS Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. was used as the substrate and the reaction was stopped by adding 100 l of Stop Solution Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. . The plates were read within 30 min with a Microplate Spectrophotometer Bio Tek PowerWave Bio Tek Instruments Inc. Winooski Vt. at a wavelength of 405 nm with a 490 nm reference.

Several of the immunogens elicit the production of antibodies in mice with the exception of the control peptide that is at background levels.

The same immunogens may be used to vaccinate humans. The immunogens may be conjugated to KLH or other antigenicity enhancing agent. Serum samples will be collected at the time of each human subject administration. A profile of the presence of antibodies to PA and the level of antibodies in each subject s serum will be determined by ELISA. Human subjects are expected to show little antibody production after the first and second administrations indicating that at least one additional booster immunization is required to develop required immunity. The levels of antibodies are expected to be sufficiently present after three administrations. Subsequent administrations should not significantly increase the level of serum antibodies. Thus three administrations is expected to be sufficient to confer immunity in most human subjects.

Sera from immunized mice as in Example 3 are tested for neutralization in a macrophage cytotoxicity assay. The real time cell analyzer RTCA Roche Applied Science Indianapolis Ind. was used to monitor the LTx induced cell intoxication dynamics and measure the antibody toxin neutralization activity ED50 and toxin potency IC50 via measurement of the cell index CI changes. CI is a parameter describing electronic impendence which corresponds to the number of cells attached to the bottom of microelectrode embedded microplate E plate Roche well. Anthrax LTx intoxicated J774 cells and caused cell death thus declining the CI values. J774 cells were seeded in 96 well E plate at a density of 5 10 well. Cell plate was placed on the RT CES device station and incubated at 37 C. with 5 COatmosphere for 17 20 hours prior to adding toxin or biological samples. Antibody toxin neutralization activity to LTx was measured by mixing a fixed concentration of LTx at 50 ngPA83 40 ngLF ml or 150 ngPA63 100 ngLF ml with serial diluted antibody solutions. The mixture of Ab LTx was incubated at 37 C. for 30 min and then was transferred to E plate. The cell plate was incubated at 37 C. for additional 24 hours. CI was recorded in every 5 minutes for 6 hours and additional 18 hour in one hour interval.

Seroreactivity of peptides was determined by streptavidin capture enzyme immunosorbent assay. A peptide was considered antigenic if its Optical Density OD value was greater than the mean OD plus 3 Standard Deviations SD of control animal serum s reactivity for that peptide. Fisher s exact test was used for comparison of anti peptide antibody responses in survivors vs. non survivors. Predictive measures of survival probability included logistic regression analysis of immunoreactivity for each peptide and for selected groups of peptides and Area under the curve for Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC analysis.

The seroreactivity of individual peptides from rhesus macaques are independently analyzed for determination of degree of protection conferred by antibodies to individual regions of PA. Rhesus macaques previously vaccinated by 3 intramuscular injection of AVA at 0 4 26 wk. of undiluted AVA n 18 or saline diluted AVA 1 5 n 16 1 10 n 25 1 20 n 21 and 1 40 n 15 . All dilutions are in saline. As a control animals are vaccinated with an equal volume of saline at the same intervals.

Survivors and non survivors are analyzed for the presence of absence of antibodies to each predetermined region of PA as described in Example 2. A Fisher s exact test was used for comparison of immune responses to peptides responses from the survivors vs. non survivors. A Logistic Regression Analysis was performed on each peptide and groups of peptides as a variable for predicted probability of survival. Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC area under the curve was used as a measure of the accuracy of survival probability estimates.

Logistic regression analyses are carried out on individual peptides 3 7 16 28 29 33 and 35 as well as the entire group as a model illustrate that antibodies to each of the peptides individually show less correlation to survival than total IgG as a correlate of protection. However when these peptides are modeled as a group anti PA IgG to these sequences enhance the prediction accuracy of survival against anthrax in rhesus macaques with ROC area under the curve of 0.8570. This result is higher than the 0.7652 ROC value when only ED50 is used as the immune correlate. This improves the survival prediction accuracy of vaccine induced anti PA IgG and TNA responses as immune correlates of protection against inhalation anthrax. The following five methods of peptides selection were used 1 Method 1 R Elasticnet Logistic regression model using elastic net penalty which is a combination of LASSO and ridge regression penalties 2 Methods 2 R glmnet Generalized linear modeling using elastic net penalties 3 Method 3 Response Frequency 10 higher frequency response above the OD values of non survivors 4 Method 4 Fisher s Exact Test Contingency analysis tables used in preliminary data analysis where n

Table 2 illustrates logistic regression on group of peptides the ROC analyses and statistical likelihood for each of these peptides.

All peptides show statistical significance in antibody responses to selected regions of PA between AVA vaccinated NHP that survived or succumbed to inhalation anthrax with the exception of peptide 3 when analyzed on an individual basis.

The above studies are repeated for all other combinations of peptides with groupings ranging from 2 to 5 peptides. The groupings with the highest ROC are illustrated in Table 3 

It is observed that each grouping includes peptides 33 AA 641 670 or 35 681 710 suggesting that epitopes in the regions of these peptides are excellent correlates of protection to complications from exposure to . When used in groupings including other epitopes encompassed in other predefined regions excellent prediction can be made as to the presence of sufficient protection conferred by prior vaccination. For example a subject with antibodies to epitopes in peptides 3 7 16 21 28 29 and 33 as well as absence of an antibody to an epitope in peptide 35 indicates high likelihood of sufficient vaccine protection. These correlates of protection are independent of the number of times a subject has been vaccinated and may be used to determine if subsequent vaccination is necessary.
