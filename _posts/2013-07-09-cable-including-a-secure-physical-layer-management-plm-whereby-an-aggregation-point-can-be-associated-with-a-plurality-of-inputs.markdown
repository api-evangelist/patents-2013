This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 670 237 filed on Jul. 11 2012 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Conventional physical layer management PLM systems are typically designed to track connections that are made at a patch panel. That is historically conventional PLM systems have been patch panel centric and have not included functionality to track connections that are made at other types of devices and systems in a network. For example such PLM systems typically do not automatically track connections that are made at a switch router hub gateway access point server computer end user computer appliance computers such as network attached storage NAS devices and nodes of a storage area network SAN or other types of devices also referred to here as host devices devices or just hosts . Although there are management systems that are used to manage and collect information about such hosts such management systems are typically separate from the PLM systems used to track connections made at a patch panel.

One embodiment is directed to a communication media including one or more communication paths extending from a first end to a second end and a first connector assembly terminating the first end of the one or more communication paths. The first connector assembly includes a physical layer management PLM interface that is isolated from signals on the one or more communication paths. The first connector assembly also includes a programmable processor coupled to a storage device and coupled to the PLM interface. The programmable processor is configured to perform secure communications with another device coupled to the PLM interface to communicate physical layer information regarding the communication media to the other device. The communication media also includes a second connector assembly terminating the second end of the one or more communication paths. An aggregation point can associate a first port on the other device to which the first connector assembly is inserted with the first connector assembly or the communication media using the physical layer information.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific illustrative embodiments. However it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical mechanical and electrical changes may be made. Furthermore the method presented in the drawing figures and the specification is not to be construed as limiting the order in which the individual steps may be performed. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense.

Each segment of physical communication media is attached to a respective port . Each port is used to connect a segment of physical communication media to the network entity of which the port is a part to another physical communication media e.g. in a rack mounted connector assembly or wall mounted connector assembly . Examples of network entities include for example rack mounted connector assemblies such as patch panels distribution units and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media wall mounted connector assemblies such as boxes jacks outlets and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media and inter networking devices such as switches routers hubs repeaters gateways and access points .

Each physical communication media is a cable comprising one or more communication paths. The one or more communication paths can be formed by one or more fiber optics or one or more copper wires. As an example the physical communication media can be implemented using a simplex cable a hybrid cable a multi channel cable etc. Each physical communication media includes a first connector terminating a first end of the one or more communication paths and a second connector terminating a second opposite end of the one or more communication paths. In examples where the one or more communication paths are fiber optics the connectors can be a corresponding passive optical connector or an active optical module for converting between optical signals and electrical signals. In examples where the one or more communication paths are copper wires connectors can be a corresponding electrical connector. As a cable each physical communication media is a connectorized media segment. As used herein a connectorized media segment is a segment of physical communication media that includes a connector at at least one end of the segment. The connectors are used to facilitate the easy and repeated attachment and unattachment of the media segment to a port .

Examples of connectorized media segments include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables having modular connectors or plugs attached to both ends or optical cables having SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors. The techniques described here can be used with other types of connectors including for example BNC connectors F connectors DSX jacks and plugs bantam jacks and plugs and MPO and MTP multi fiber connectors and adapters.

Example physical communication media include duplex fiber optic cable including one or more optical fibers. The one or more optical fibers can include single mode or multi mode fibers. The fiber optic cable can include a simplex cable duplex cable 12 fiber cable 24 fiber cable and other fiber optic cables such as hybrid fiber copper cables . Other example physical communication media include coaxial cable. Still other examples include multiple fiber cable including a multi fiber connector for example a suitable MPO or MTP connector at each end of such cable.

At least some of the network entities are designed for use with segments of physical communication media that have identifier and attribute information also referred to herein as PLM information stored in or on them. The identifier and attribute information is stored in or on the segment of physical communication media in a manner that enables the stored information while the segment is attached to a port to be read by a programmable processor associated with the network entity . Examples of PLM information that can be stored in or on a segment of physical communication media include without limitation an identifier that uniquely identifies that particular segment of physical communication media similar to an ETHERNET Media Access Control MAC address but associated with the physical communication media and or connector attached to the physical communication media a part number a plug or other connector type a cable or fiber type and length a serial number a cable polarity a date of manufacture a manufacturing lot number information about one or more visual attributes of physical communication media or a connector attached to the physical communication media such as information about the color or shape of the physical communication media or connector or an image of the physical communication media or connector and other information used by an Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system or inventory control system. PLM information can also include testing or media quality or performance information which for example can be the results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured. In other embodiments alternate or additional data is stored in or on the media segments .

Also as noted below in some embodiments the PLM information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated. For example the PLM information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated to include the results of testing that is performed when a segment of physical media is installed or otherwise checked. In another example such testing information is supplied to an aggregation point and stored in a data store maintained by the aggregation point . In another example the PLM information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media includes a count of the number of times that a connector attached to a segment of physical communication media has been inserted into port . In such an example the count stored in or on the segment of physical communication media is updated each time the connector is inserted into port . This insertion count value can be used for example for warranty purposes for example to determine if the connector has been inserted more than the number of times specified in the warranty or for security purposes for example to detect unauthorized insertions of the physical communication media .

In the particular embodiment shown in each of the ports of the network entities comprises a respective PLM interface via which the respective programmable processor is able to determine if a physical communication media segment is attached to that port and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information PLM information stored in or on the attached segment if such information is stored therein or thereon . The programmable processor associated with each network entity is communicatively coupled to each of the PLM interfaces using a suitable bus or other interconnect.

Each programmable processor is configured to execute software or firmware that causes the programmable processor to carry out various functions described below. Each programmable processor also includes suitable memory that is coupled to the programmable processor for storing program instructions and data. In general the programmable processor determines if a physical communication media segment is attached to a port with which that processor is associated and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information PLM information stored in or on the attached physical communication media segment if the segment includes such information stored therein or thereon using the associated PLM interface.

Each programmable processor is also configured to communicate physical layer information to devices that are coupled to the IP network . The physical layer information PLI includes information about the network entities associated with that programmable processor also referred to here as device information as well as information about any segments of physical media attached to the ports of those network entities also referred to here as PLM information The device information includes for example an identifier for each network entity a type identifier that identifies the network entity s type and port priority information that associates a priority level with each port. The PLM information includes identity and attribute information that the programmable processor has read from attached physical media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on it. The PLI may also include information about physical communication media that does not have identifier or attribute information stored in or on it. This latter type of PLI can be manually input at the time the associated physical media segments are attached to the network entity for example using a management application executing on the programmable processor that enables a user to configure and monitor the network entity .

The system includes functionality that enables the physical layer information that the network entities capture to be used by application layer functionality outside of traditional physical layer management application domain. That is the physical layer information is not retained in a PLM island used only for PLM purposes but is instead made available to other applications. In the particular embodiment shown in the system includes an aggregation point that is communicatively coupled to the network entities via the IP network .

The aggregation point includes functionality that obtains physical layer information from the network entities and other devices and stores the physical layer information in a data store.

The aggregation point can be used to receive physical layer information from various types of network entities that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media . Examples of such network entities are noted above. Also the aggregation point and aggregation functionality can also be used to receive physical layer information from other types of devices that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media . Examples of such devices include end user devices such as computers peripherals such as printers copiers storage devices and scanners and IP telephones that include functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media.

The aggregation point can also be used to obtain other types of physical layer information. For example in this embodiment the aggregation point also obtains information about physical communication media segments that is not otherwise automatically communicated to an aggregation point . One example of such information is information about non connectorized physical communication media segments that do not otherwise have information stored in or on them that are attached to a network entity including for example information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network as well as media information about the segment . Another example of such information is information about physical communication media segments that are connected to devices that are not able to read media information that is stored in or on the media segments that are attached to their ports and or that are not able to communicate such information to the aggregation point for example because such devices do not include such functionality because such devices are used with media segments that do not have media information stored in or on them and or because bandwidth is not available for communicating such information to the aggregation point . In this example the information can include for example information about the devices themselves such as the devices MAC addresses and IP addresses if assigned to such devices information indicating which ports of the devices are connected to which ports of other devices in the network for example other network entities and information about the physical media attached to the ports of the devices. This information can be provided to the aggregation point for example by manually entering such information into a file such as a spreadsheet and then uploading the file to the aggregation point for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. Such information can also for example be directly entered using a user interface provided by the aggregation point for example using a web browser .

The aggregation point can also obtain information about the layout of the building or buildings in which the network is deployed as well as information indicating where each network entity and physical media segment is located within the building. This information can be for example manually entered and verified for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. In one implementation such location information includes an X Y and Z location for each port or other termination point for each physical communication media segment for example X Y and Z location information of the type specified in the ANSI TIA EIA 606 A Standard Administration Standard For The Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructure .

The aggregation point can obtain and maintain testing media quality or performance information relating to the various segments of physical communication media that exist in the network. The testing media quality or performance information for example can be results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured and or when testing is performed when a particular segment of media is installed or otherwise checked.

The aggregation point also includes functionality that provides an interface for external devices or entities to access the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point . This access can include retrieving information from the aggregation point as well as supplying information to the aggregation point . In this embodiment the aggregation point is implemented as middleware that is able to provide such external devices and entities with transparent and convenient access to the PLI. Because the aggregation point aggregates PLI from the relevant devices on the IP network and provides external devices and entities with access to such PLI the external devices and entities do not need to individually interact with all of the devices in the IP network that provide PLI nor do such devices need to have the capacity to respond to requests from such external devices and entities.

The aggregation point in the embodiment shown in implements an application programming interface API by which application layer functionality can gain access to the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point using a software development kit SDK that describes and documents the API.

The IP network is typically implemented using one or more inter networking devices. As noted above an inter networking device is a type of network entity and can be configured to read PLM information that is stored in or on the segments of physical media that are attached to its ports and to communicate the PLM information it reads from the attached segments of media as well as information about the inter networking device itself to the aggregation point like any other network entity described here.

The aggregation point can be implemented on a standalone network node for example a standalone computer running appropriate software or can be integrated along with other network functionality for example integrated with an element management system or network management system or other network server or network element . Moreover the functionality of the aggregation point can be distribute across many nodes and devices in the network and or implemented for example in a hierarchical manner for example with many levels of aggregation points .

Moreover the aggregation point and the network entities are configured so that the aggregation point can automatically discover and connect with the network entities that provide PLI to an aggregation point that are on the network . In this way when network entities that are able to provide PLI to an aggregation point are coupled to the IP network an aggregation point is able to automatically discover the network entities and start aggregating physical layer information for that network entity without requiring the person installing the network entity to have knowledge of the aggregation points that are on the IP network . Similarly when an aggregation point is coupled to the IP network the aggregation point is able to automatically discover and interact with devices that are capable of providing PLI to an aggregation point without requiring the person installing the aggregation point to have knowledge of the devices that are on the IP network . Thus the physical layer information resources described here can be easily integrated into the IP network .

In the example shown in the programmable processors in the network entities are communicatively coupled to the network by including a respective management or non service port that is separate from the service ports . However one or more of the programmable processors in the network entities can be communicatively coupled to the network using one or more of the service ports . In an example the switches can communicate with the aggregation point using a suitable communication protocol such as the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP .

The aggregation point can aggregate the PLI from the network entities and physical communication media to associate ports of network entities e.g. patch panels with physical communication media. For example the PLI can be used to associate a given port of a network entity with a given physical communication media and or a particular connector of the physical communication media. Aggregating the PLI can include aggregating multiple such associations to determine physical layer connections between devices.

More information about physical layer information and the aggregation point can be found in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 152 624 filed on Feb. 13 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS AND METHODS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 705 497 filed on Feb. 12 2010 titled AGGREGATION OF PHYSICAL LAYER INFORMATION RELATED TO A NETWORK both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The IP network can include one or more local area networks and or wide area networks including for example the Internet . As a result the aggregation point need not be located at the same site as the network entities .

Various conventional IP networking techniques can be used in deploying the system of . For example conventional security protocols can be used to secure communications if they are communicated over a public or otherwise unsecure communication channel such as the Internet or over a wireless communication link .

In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each network entity each port of each network entity and each media segment is individually addressable. Where IP addresses are used to individually address each network entity a virtual private network VPN dedicated for use with the various network entities can be used to segregate the IP addresses used for the network entities from the main IP address space that is used in the IP network .

In the particular embodiment shown in the system also supports conventional physical layer management PLM operations such as the tracking of moves adds and changes of the segments of physical media that are attached to the ports of the network entities and providing assistance with carrying out moves adds and changes. PLI provided by the aggregation point can be used to improve upon conventional guided MAC processes. For example information about the location of the port and the visual appearance for example the color or shape of the relevant physical media segment or connector attached thereto can be communicated to a technician to assist the technician in carrying out a move add or change. This information can be communicated to a computer or smartphone used by the technician. Moreover the PLI functionality that resides in the system can also be used to verify that a particular MAC was properly carried out by checking that the expected physical media segment is located in the expected port . If that is not the case an alert can be sent to the technician so that the technician can correct the issue.

The PLM functionality included in the system can also support conventional techniques for guiding the technician in carrying out a MAC for example by illuminating one or more light emitting diodes LEDs to direct a technician to a particular network entity and or to a particular port or by displaying messages on a liquid crystal display LCD included on or near the network entity . Other PLM functions include keeping historical logs about the media connected to the network entity .

In addition to network entities the techniques described here for reading PLM information stored in or on a segment of physical communication media can be used in one or more end nodes of the network. For example computers such as laptops servers desktop computers or special purpose computing devices such as IP telephones IP multi media appliances and storage devices can be configured to read PLM information that is stored in or on the segments of physical communication media that are attached to their ports and to communicate the media information read from the attached segments of media as well as information about the devices themselves to an aggregation point as described here.

Each port comprises a first attachment point and a second attachment point . The first attachment point is used to attach one or more communication paths to the port and the second attachment point is used to attach a segment of physical communication media to the port . The one or more communication paths can be part of a network entity and connected to appropriate components within the network entity .

In the particular embodiment shown in the first attachment point is located near the rear of the port . As a consequence the first attachment point is also referred to here as the rear attachment point . Also in this embodiment the rear attachment point is configured to attach the one or more communication paths to the port in a semi permanent manner. As used herein a semi permanent attachment is one that is designed to be changed relatively infrequently if ever. This is also referred to sometimes as a one time connection. Examples of suitable rear connectors include punch down blocks in the case of copper physical media and fiber adapters fiber splice points and fiber termination points in the case of optical physical media .

In the embodiment shown in the second attachment point is located near the front of the port . As a consequence the second attachment point is also referred to here as the front attachment point . In the embodiment shown in the front attachment point for each port is designed for use with connectorized media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. The front attachment point is implemented using a suitable connector or adapter that mates with the corresponding connector on the end of the media segment . The connector is used to facilitate the easy and repeated attachment and unattachment of the media segment to the port . Examples of connectorized media segments include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables having modular connectors or plugs attached to both ends in which case the front attachment point is implemented using compatible modular jacks or optical cables having SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors in which case the front attachment point is implemented using compatible SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors or adapters . The techniques described here can be used with other types of connectors including for example BNC connectors F connectors DSX jacks and plugs bantam jacks and plugs and MPO and MTP multi fiber connectors and adapters.

Each port communicatively couples the respective rear attachment point to the respective front attachment point . As a result one or more communication paths attached to the respective rear attachment point are communicatively coupled to any media segment attached to the respective front attachment point . In one implementation each port is designed for use with one or more communication paths and a media segment that comprise the same type of communication path s in which case each port communicatively couples the one or more communication paths attached to the respective rear attachment point to any media segment attached to the respective front attachment point at the physical layer level without any media conversion. In other implementations each port communicatively couples the one or more communication paths attached to the respective rear attachment point to any media segment attached to the respective front attachment point in other ways for example using a media converter if the rear one or more communication paths and the media segment comprise different types of communication paths .

As shown in the port is configured for use with media segments that include a PLM interface that while the corresponding connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to a front attachment point of the port communicatively couples a storage device or other component s to a corresponding media reading interface so that the associated programmable processor can obtain PLM information from the storage device or other component s . In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each connector itself houses the storage device or other component s and the PLM interface can be implemented by incorporating appropriate electrical contacts in the connector .

In another implementation of such an embodiment the storage device and other component s are housed within a housing that is separate from the connector . In such an implementation the housing is configured so that it can be snapped onto the media segment or the connector with the PLM interface positioned relative to the connector so that the PLM interface will properly mate with the media reading interface when the connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to the front attachment point .

Various examples of PLM interfaces are described in United States Patent Publication No. US 2011 0116748 filed Oct. 15 2010 and titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY IN FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS AND METHODS THEREOF U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 025 841 filed on Feb. 11 2011 titled MANAGED FIBER CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 025 750 filed on Feb. 11 2011 titled COMMUNICATIONS BLADED PANEL SYSTEMS U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 152 624 filed on Feb. 13 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS AND METHODS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 705 497 filed on Feb. 12 2010 titled AGGREGATION OF PHYSICAL LAYER INFORMATION RELATED TO A NETWORK all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In some of these examples a four line PLM interface is used where the interface includes a single data line for reading and writing data a power line for providing power to the storage device a ground line for providing a ground level and an extra line reserved for future use. Also in these examples a storage device that supports the UNI O bus protocol is used where the UNI O bus protocol is used for communicating over the single data lead. One example of such a storage device and PLM interface are the storage devices and interfaces used in the QUAREO family of physical layer management products that are commercially available from TE Connectivity.

The programmable processor can be configured to communicate with a network entity over the PLM interface . The PLM interface while the corresponding connector is inserted into a front connector of a port communicatively couples the programmable processor to the corresponding media reading interface so that the programmable processor in the corresponding network entity can communicate with the programmable processor .

The programmable processor can be secured to restrict unauthorized access to the PLM information on the storage device . This can include restrictions on reading from the storage device as well as restrictions on storing data to the storage device . In an example access to the storage device and or firmware of the programmable processor by an outside entity such as the programmable processor can be subject to providing a security code. In some examples the firmware of the programmable processor can be configured to implement an encryption algorithm to encrypt information sent over the PLM interface . The programmable processor on a corresponding network entity can be configured to provide such a security code and to perform encrypted communications with the programmable processor in order to support such secure operation. Some information on the storage device can be non secure and can be provided by the programmable processor without a security code in an unencrypted form.

In an example the programmable processor is configured to communicate with external entities such as programmable processor using a bidirectional serial communication link using Manchester coding. In other examples other communication schemes can be used.

In Example 2 the physical communication media that is used differs from the physical communication media used in Example 1. The physical communication media that is used in Example 2 is shown in . It is to be understood that in practice physical communication media and physical communication media may be used within the same network and possibly at the same network entity .

Similar to Example 1 the connector comprises a contact portion in which eight generally parallel electrical contacts are positioned although other contact portions having other numbers of contacts and or optical coupling components can be used. The connector also comprises or is attached to a programmable processor and storage device that can be implemented in a similar manner to programmable processor and storage device described with respect to Example 1. The programmable processor can include any suitable programmable processor such as a microprocessor. The storage device can include for example an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM or other non volatile memory device. The programmable processor and the storage device can be on the same die separate dies or can be incorporated into chip scale package. The PLM information described above for the communication media is stored in the storage device. The storage device includes sufficient storage capacity to store such information.

The programmable processor can be configured to communicate with a network entity over the PLM interface . The PLM interface while the corresponding connector is inserted into a front connector of a port communicatively couples the programmable processor to the corresponding media reading interface so that the programmable processor in the corresponding network entity can communicate with the programmable processor . The programmable processor can be secured to restrict unauthorized access to the PLM information on the storage device similar to that described with respect to Example 1.

In this Example the connector also includes a pressure transducer that is communicatively coupled to the programmable processor . The pressure transducer can be configured to sense the pressure in the hermetic enclosure and communicate such readings to the programmable processor . The connector can also include a gas port and a release valve for adding and removing gas from the hermetical enclosure . A corresponding port on a network entity can include a corresponding gas port and release valve port.

Movement of the media can cause changes in the pressure within the hermetic enclosure . This pressure change can then be sensed by the pressure transducer and provided to the programmable processor . The programmable processor can monitor such pressure readings from the pressure transducer to detect possible intrusion events on the media . The programmable processor can then provide an indication of such intrusion events to the network entity over the PLM interface . The network entity can then provide the indication to the aggregation point for monitoring. In an example the pressure readings themselves can be provided to the network entity as the indication. In other examples the programmable processor can determine based on the pressure readings when a possible intrusion event has occurred and provide such information to the network entity .

In an example while the connector is inserted into port pressurized media gas can be flowed into the hermetic enclosure from the network entity . Once the hermetic enclosure reaches the desired pressure the system can be initialized by measuring the initial pressure condition over a defined period of time and storing the initial readings in the storage device and or providing the initial readings to the aggregation point . The programmable processor and or aggregation point can then compare the initial readings with subsequent readings to determine whether a potential intrusion event has occurred. The initial readings can be used to identify normal variations in the pressure in order to reduce false positives.

In an example a pressure system in the network entity can periodically increase and decrease the pressure to form pressure pulses in the hermetical enclosure. The pressure pulses can be a form of signaling. The pressure transducer can detect the periodicity and or magnitude of the pressure pulses to determine whether a potential intrusion event has occurred. In an example the pressure transducer connected to the other end of the media i.e. the end of the media that is opposite the end which is connected to network entity can sense the pulses sent by the network entity and information indicative of the pulses can be provided to a network entity to which the other end of the media is connected. This network entity can determine whether the media is still properly connected and or to determine whether an intrusion event has occurred based on these pulses being properly sensed by the pressure transducer . The periodic pressure pulsing can be used to protect against the media being artificially held at a constant pressure during an intrusion event.

The pressure relief valve can be used to periodically release pressure and then re pressurize the hermetic enclosure as an added security and maintenance check and to enable the network entity to check operation of the pressure transducers .

In Example 3 the physical communication media that is used differs from the physical communication media used in Example 1 and the physical communication media used in Example 2. The physical communication media that is used in Example 3 is shown in . It is to be understood that in practice physical communication media physical communication media and physical communication media may be used within the same network and possibly at the same network entity .

The programmable processor can be configured to communicate with a network entity over the PLM interface . The PLM interface when the corresponding connector is inserted into a front connector of a port communicatively couples the programmable processor to the corresponding media reading interface so that the programmable processor in the corresponding network entity can communicate with the programmable processor . The programmable processor can be secured to restrict unauthorized access to the PLM information on the storage device similar to that described with respect to Example 1.

In this Example the media also includes a wire e.g. copper loop disposed adjacent the one or more communication paths and extending at least partially from the connector towards the other end of the media . In some examples the wire loop is connected to a terminating impedance. The programmable processor can be coupled to the wire loop and configured to send a sinusoidal test signal through the wire loop . The programmable processor can then sense the wire loop and measure the amplitude and phase of the received test signal. Movement of the media will cause a phase change indicating a possible intrusion event. In an example the programmable processor can change e.g. rotate the frequency of the test signal for example randomly or periodically. Rotating the frequency can make it more difficult for an intruder to generate an external signal that will match the test signal and apply such external signal to the wire loop to mask an intrusion.

In an example the wire loop can extend from the connector to a connector at the other end of the media . In an implementation of such an example a programmable processor on one end of the media can provide a signal on the wire loop and a programmable processor on the other end of the media can sense the signal to detect possible intrusion events. The programmable processors on opposite ends of the media can alternate in sending such a signal. In another example the media can include two wire loops each wire loop coupled to a programmable processor on a respective end of the media .

In another example the media can include a double shielding disposed adjacent e.g. surrounding the one or more communication paths and extending at least partially from the connector towards the other end of the media . The programmable processor can be coupled to the double shielding and configured to send a signal e.g. sinusoidal through the double shielding. In some examples the programmable processor can then sense the signal on the double shielding and measure the amplitude and phase of thereof. Movement of the media can cause a capacitance change and subsequent phase change which can be measured by the programmable processor to determine an intrusion event. In an example the double shielding can extend from the connector at one end of the media to a connector on the other end of the media . In an implementation of such an example a programmable processor on one end of the media can provide a test signal on the double shielding and a programmable processor on the other end of the media can sense the signal to detect possible intrusion events. The programmable processors on opposite ends of the media can alternate in sending such a signal. In another example the media can include two distinct double shields each double shield coupled to a programmable processor on a respective end of the media . In some examples the programmable processor can change e.g. rotate the frequency of the test signal for example randomly or periodically. Rotating the frequency can make it more difficult for an intruder to generate an external signal that will match the test signal and apply such external signal to the double shielding to mask an intrusion.

In some examples in addition to or instead of using such double shielding as a means for detection of intrusion events the double shielding can be used to create an interference field to limit electromagnetic pickup on copper cables. In such an example the programmable processor can apply a sinusoidal voltage of sufficient magnitude to create an interference field to saturate low level receivers used for signal pickup. In some examples the sinusoidal frequency can be changed e.g. rotated on a random algorithm to make filtering of the interference signal using FFT or DSP methods difficult.
