This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 693 167 filed Aug. 24 2012 the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

As technology has advanced us into the information age vast amounts of information including location data are stored in devices and servers around the world. Location information is a critical component of mobile applications today and can provide location aware applications with more contextual relevance for consumers application developers and marketers. As such user connectivity and social networking are growing at unprecedented levels. However while the sheer amount of data has rapidly increased technological advancements by way of control over such data have lagged. As a result people feel like they have less control than ever over their personal information.

In certain embodiments a computer implemented method includes providing a user interface on an internet protocol IP connected mobile device the user interface configured to receive a user input corresponding to one or more data privacy parameters for geo location data and controlling a transferring of geo location data to and from each of a plurality of mobile applications on the mobile device based on the user input. A change in one or more of the data privacy parameters can affect how geo location data is provided to each of the plurality of applications.

In some embodiments data privacy parameters can affect one or more of location data accuracy location data reporting frequency or geofunctions including geofencing geocoding geotriggers geoenrichment geocloaking and more. The controlling of transferring geo location data can include selectively disabling location tracking for one or more mobile applications for a predetermined period of time or controlling a granularity or resolution of personal data associated with the geo location data. In some instances personal data can be anonymized aggregated or a combination thereof. The user interface can be configured to allow a user to view manage configure and delete a personal location history. Furthermore one or more profiles can be associated with one or more of the plurality of mobile applications where each of the one or more profiles is assigned individual data privacy parameters.

In certain implementations a computer implemented system includes one or more processors and one or more non transitory computer readable storage mediums containing instructions configured to cause the one or more processors to perform operations including providing a user interface on an internet protocol IP connected mobile device the user interface configured to receive a user input corresponding to one or more data privacy parameters for geo location data and controlling a transferring of geo location data to and from each of a plurality of mobile applications on the mobile device based on the user input.

In some embodiments a non transitory computer program product embodied in a machine readable non transitory storage medium including instructions configured to cause a data processing apparatus to provide a user interface on an internet protocol IP connected mobile device the user interface configured to receive a user input corresponding to one or more data privacy parameters for geo location data and control a transferring of geo location data to and from each of a plurality of mobile applications on the mobile device based on the user input.

Embodiments of the invention relate to a system and method of managing privacy and controlling user and third party access to location data in the context of internet protocol IP connected devices.

In certain embodiments a computer implemented method includes providing a user interface on an internet protocol IP connected mobile device the user interface configured to receive a user input corresponding to one or more data privacy parameters for geo location data and controlling a transferring of geo location data to and from each of a plurality of mobile applications on the mobile device based on the user input. A change in one or more of the data privacy parameters can affect how geo location data is provided to each of the plurality of applications. In some embodiments systems and methods are configured to manage location data whereby end users as well as other data stakeholders are afforded the ability to set permissions control privacy and opt into systems requiring the use of geolocation data from an IP connected device. This level of control can help reduce the liability of third parties when handling or accessing end user data while increasing end user privacy and awareness of how their location related data is accessed and used by others. In some implementations location data can be shared with and accessed by friends and other social actors to facilitate communication of sensitive personally identifiable information PII including location data with other individuals and groups of users as well as with third parties. Some types of personally identifiable information can include geo location information at a granular or non granular level. For example this can include sharing raw latitude longitude coordinates city country county specific place names future or past locations and any other significant location update at a resolution defined by the user. This information can be shared at will scheduled in advance and or triggered by a set of user entered rules or code.

A user interface e.g. control panel can be used to set and manage the permissions for PII on web mobile and IP connected devices. In some embodiments a privacy provisioning portal e.g. task manager or control panel may include a server architecture for permissioning deleting and or forwarding on permissions powered by a back end private interface and or cloud platform. In such cases stored user information e.g. on a server changes according to the specifications of the privacy management system. Permissioning can include viewing storing consuming responding to and modifying privacy considerations on an IP connected device.

The location privacy framework used to implement and manage privacy management can include a user facing framework that enables consumers to better manage the privacy of their location data across applications and providing users control of location data accuracy reported to specific applications control of a frequency for reporting location data to approved entities an ability to selectively disable location tracking for ad hoc or prescheduled periods of time viewing and deleting personal location history and more. Certain implementations may utilize a set of APIs exposing user privacy parameters to application developers such that the application may abide by the rules set by the end user. In such cases if the API s are pre installed on all devices by a carrier they can offer a Telco Certified application program that provides end user with a comfort level that apps bearing that certification will abide by their data privacy parameters.

Privacy management framework privacy framework functions as a gateway for which geo location data is regulated filtered and or managed to control how data is delivered to and from device . Privacy framework can include a user interface not shown configured to receive a user input corresponding to one or more data privacy parameters for geo location data and controlling a transferring of geo location data to and from each of a plurality of mobile applications on mobile device based on the user input. The user interface can be a control panel task manager or other suitable interface to allow a user to manage data privacy parameters for geo location data. Furthermore privacy framework can manage other data types that can be parameterized as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Privacy framework can be reside and operate on the IP connected device . In certain embodiments privacy framework and the user interface is implemented on device as a mobile application configured to manage the flow of geo location data and related data types. In some embodiments device provides a user interface for managing data privacy parameters but operates as a privacy provisioning portal with the functional implementation of management operations moved to a back end offboard server architecture or cloud platform. There are many possible implementations and hybrid manifestations of a privacy management framework as described herein and would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure.

In some implementations privacy framework not only operates to control and regulate the flow of geo location data to and from mobile applications residing on device but also to mobile applications or other destinations residing on other devices. For example in a machine to machine M2M communication a first user on a first mobile device may wish to track the location of a second mobile device. By leveraging the functions of privacy framework the second mobile device may be configured to limit the access of the first user by changing the resolution of the location accuracy changing the frequency of the location report out or preventing location access altogether among other settings. Similarly the first mobile device can be configured to control how the location is used and received using privacy framework . For example the first mobile device can be configured to only request location information from the second mobile device during certain times of the day. Some of the myriad implementations or privacy management are further discussed below.

Privacy framework can sit at the frontend of a multi input multi output system that includes components for data storage archive and retrieval data analysis geo processing geo enrichment and other tasks corresponding to the inhalation of location data its contextualization with data of other types and the exhalation of some combined product. In such a system the components can obey a flexible schema of rules for how they interoperate on the basis of user inputs into the Privacy Management Framework. The sample interfaces included here are intended to demonstrate the sorts of inputs and outputs a user might expect to see on a smartphone based PMF application interface. They are also suggestive of the underlying schema of rules for how the system handles data inhalation storage and output to recipients other than the user e.g. social media contacts of the user or a mobile ad exchange . Each interactive field GUI button etc. can correspond to the backend operation of one or more components of the system involved in the collection aggregation analysis geo enrichment and identification de identification of consumer location data and its contextualization cartographic or otherwise with other data types.

Referring back to Privacy Management Framework PMF can be an interface that connects into but is not limited to the following items IP connected devices e.g. owned by ESRI Inc. end users third party devices owned by customers e.g. organizations developers and individuals GIS services online on behind the firewall servers remote servers on site servers mobile devices and individual services running on those systems. PMF can be configured to connect across any existing and new e.g. ESRI Inc. services including but not limited to maps places real time mobile signals data and data and other systems provided by third party providers including but not limited to Telco information advertisers risk assessors geoenrichment providers data providers and more e.g any existing and future ESRI partners and partners of ESRI partners . This can include real time and historical data. In some aspects a PMF s objective is to offer a user interface for a variety of audiences from but not limited to internal administrators e.g. from ESRI sales marketing and developers distributors third party providers and partners customers end users organizations and developers and data consumers. Said parties can use the full functionality of the PMF or a subset thereof to manage data privacy permission and other actions relating to how data is stored accessed etc. in systems owned by ESRI third parties customers organizations developers and end users and the like.

In some implementations the user interface can be used to control the length of time that data is stored e.g geolocation data PII data etc. what type of data is stored and the levels of permissions associated therewith. The user interface can connect into back end systems and data storage layers irrespective of infrastructure ownership e.g. whether owned by ESRI or external parties . PMF can be modularized so that parties may use all or some of the components for their specific solution. In some embodiments PMF can be exposed through internal services external services or packaged so that organizations developers and third parties can expose it to their own group or to end users. PMF components can be exposed on any IP connected device including mobile or as a library added to an existing or new mobile application server stack web app hardware system sensor or other device as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure.

In certain embodiments profiles can be associated with individual users groups organizations or other entities that have access to geolocation data. For example an owner or user of an IP connected device may utilize the user interface of privacy management framework to create a profile for herself assigning unlimited access to geo location data generated by that particular device. The owner may create a second profile for a third party with limited access to geolocation data by allocating the appropriate values to the data privacy parameters associated with a third party. Other methods in addition to or in lieu of user profiles may be used as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

System further includes geolocation based platforms which are accessible by IP connected device through privacy management framework . Geolocation based platforms can include Location as a Service LaaS platform and geoenrichment platform . LaaS can perform services such as geocoding establish geotriggers perform navigation and routing generate maps and tiles perform indoor mapping manage notifications e.g. push SMS URL callback perform geo enrichment functions provide user analytics applications and more. LaaS platform may include additional modules for maps and places real time mobile signals data and historical data e.g. location history . LaaS can include any suitable configuration of networks servers and infrastructure to perform its various functions as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. In some embodiments LaaS can perform some or all of the geolocation based functions described herein wherein the extent that the geolocation data is utilized and or accessible is controlled by privacy management framework .

Geolocation based platforms can further include geo enrichment platform which may include modules to implement geo enrichment solutions e.g. geo enrichment solution which are further described below. Geo enrichment platform includes a data processing and storage module enterprise content management ECM module a geo database module GDB telecommunications company Telco data geo enrichment solution module and data consumers . The operation architecture and processes involved in LaaS and geoenrichment systems would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. In some embodiments the LaaS platform and geolocation based platform are operated and maintained by Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. ESRI of Redlands Calif.

In certain embodiments the Privacy Management Framework functions as a permission management interface and dashboard for a Location Based Services LBS Platform. A cloud based Location as a Service or LaaS is one implementation scenario for this Platform. Others can include implementations for desktop computing server side computing private clouds data appliances or any hybrid thereof. In any implementation a shared Geo Service product e.g. APIs SDKs Geocoding Map Tiles etc can be managed by the Privacy Management Framework interface. This interface can be applied to multiple owners users and third parties affiliated with the LBS platform services.

As discussed above privacy management framework can be used to manage data privacy parameters to control the sharing of geo location data. Privacy parameters can be configured to control aspects of geo fencing geocoding geotriggers geoenrichment geocloaking location data accuracy location data reporting frequency selective disabling location granularity personal location history pattern recognition and more as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. An employee third party customer administrator end user or company can use the dashboard to manage privacy at the individual organizational or group level. An end user could use Privacy Management Framework interface to determine which advertisers have access to what parts of their PII data at what points in time and at what level of detail or opt out entirely. Privacy Management Framework can connect through the LBS LaaS etc. platform so that rules set up in the interface can affect how data is processed or stored how a service functions and how a low level data source such as Telco data or a service add on such as Geoenrichment can be used stored or discarded or affiliated with end user organization or group data.

Geofencing can be virtual perimeters applied to a real world geographic area. For example geo fences can be configured as a predefined set of boundaries such as at school attendance zones restricted areas neighborhood boundaries and the like. Geo fences can also be dynamically generated and may be defined by a given radius around a store vehicle or point location etc. Conventionally when a location aware computing device e.g. IP connected device of a location based service user enters or exits a geo fenced area the computing device typically receives a generated notification e.g. push messaging e mail SMS messaging twitter feed etc. that may provide information about the location of the computing device information related to the location of the computing device or other type of message cue or indication as would be known by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example some applications may include commercial services e.g. alerting the user to an on going sale at a nearby department store emergency or security services or any desired application. Alternative embodiments can include generating notifications when a computing device leaves the geo fenced area e.g. alerting parents when a child leaves a designated area etc. . In some cases geo fences can be customizable allowing users of the geo fencing systems to establish zones around places of work customer s sites secure areas and the like. In some embodiments privacy management framework can be accessed by IP connected device to set privacy parameters to control how geolocation data is used in creating accessing manipulating and managing geo fences by a user or third party entity.

Geocoding can include the process of finding associated geographic coordinates often expressed as latitude and longitude from other geographic data such as street addresses or postal codes. With geographic coordinates the features can be mapped and entered into Geographic Information Systems GIS or the coordinates can be embedded into media such as digital photographs via geotagging. In one non limiting example geocoding includes address interpolation which include the use of data from a street GIS where the street network is already mapped within the geographic coordinate space. Each street segment is attributed with address ranges e.g. house numbers from one segment to the next . Geocoding takes an address and matches it to a street and specific segment such as a block in towns that use the block convention . Geocoding is then used to interpolate the position of the address within the range along the segment. In certain embodiments privacy management framework can be accessed by IP connected device to set privacy parameters to control how geolocation data is used in creating accessing manipulating and managing geo coding by a user or third party entity.

Geotriggers can include geographic boundaries based on temporal distances. Geo trigger transmission systems typically broadcast e.g. delivers distributes etc. data and or messages e.g. SMS email alerts data files etc. to GPS enabled computing devices e.g. IP connected device or trigger an action e.g. telematics via computing device as they cross and enter geo trigger boundaries. A geo trigger boundary may represent a travel time e.g. 5 minutes via motor vehicle from the boundary to a reference point. In some implementations privacy management framework can be accessed by IP connected device to set privacy parameters to control how geolocation data is used in creating accessing manipulating and managing geo triggers by a user or third party entity.

Geoenrichment is the process of adding additional context to geographic points shapes or zones. Geoenrichment can provide access to a wealth of information about people places and businesses in the geographic areas that may be important to a person business or organization. Some examples of geoenrichment includes enriching maps with demographic and lifestyle layers describing income age market potential consumer behavior and more. For example demographic and lifestyle data variables attributes can be appended to spreadsheet data or other working documents and interactive infographics can be added to maps to show demographic and lifestyle characteristics for a particular area. In some embodiments privacy management framework can be accessed by IP connected device to set privacy parameters to control how geolocation data is used in creating accessing manipulating and managing aspects of geoenrichment by a user or third party entity.

Geocloaking allows users defined user groups e.g. including families work groups etc. and or some other defined social unit or network to modify hide disguise scramble or otherwise alter the past present or projected location of an IP connected device or devices. In some implementations privacy management framework can be accessed by IP connected device to set privacy parameters to control how geolocation data is used in creating accessing manipulating and managing aspects of geocloaking by a user or third party entity.

Location data accuracy can control the accuracy of a reported location of e.g. and IP connected device . For example a person may want to allow a spouse to pinpoint their exact location i.e. location of IP connected device at any time but limit their location information to County or city level resolutions for friends and extended family. Thus through the user interface of privacy management framework the person can individually manage and or limit how their location information is delivered to each person group or organization that is granted access.

Location data reporting frequency can control how often location data or derivatives thereof e.g. location history are reported to a person e.g. device or group e.g. multiple devices . Thus through the user interface of privacy management framework a person can individually manage and or limit how frequent their location information is delivered to each person group or organization that is granted access.

One aspect of selective disabling of location tracking includes limiting access to a user s location data for predetermined period of time. For example a person may wish to allow a spouse to track their location at any time of the day but limit an employers access to his location data during normal work hours.

Geo location information can be presented at a granular or non granular level. For example this can include sharing raw latitude longitude coordinates city country county specific place names future or past locations and any other significant location update at a resolution defined by the user. This information can be shared at will scheduled in advance and or triggered by a set of user entered rules or code e.g. through a user interface of privacy management framework . A user can further opt to render personal data anonymous or anonymize and aggregate it.

In some embodiments privacy management framework can be used to manage a user s personal location history derived from geolocation data. User s and third parties granted access can visual location history through a user interface on an IP connected device which allows users to search through location history modify the location history download the location history in bulk and export the modified location history to a third party service together with a transaction history. Users can set privacy parameters that limit how much access third parties have to this data.

In certain embodiments privacy management framework can be configured to manage geolocation data to enable limit or disable pattern recognition capabilities based on a personal location history. To illustrate a deviation from a typical location behavior over time constitutes location intelligence. Location intelligence can include location analysis and or behavioral analysis. Location intelligence may be useful in the areas of health alerting intelligence and the like. Pattern recognition is further discussed below.

At method begins with providing a user interface on an internet protocol IP connected device. The user interface can be part of the privacy management framework . In some cases the user interface can be a control panel used to set and manage data privacy parameters e.g. permissions for geolocation data and or PII data on web mobile and IP connected devices. In some embodiments a user interface e.g. privacy provisioning portal can function as a task manager or control panel which may include a server architecture for permissioning deleting and or forwarding on data privacy parameters powered by a back end private interface and or cloud platform. In such cases stored user information e.g. on a server changes according to the specifications of the privacy management system. Permissioning can include viewing storing consuming responding to and modifying privacy considerations for geolocation data on an IP connected device.

In some embodiments the user interface is a control panel operated by privacy management framework . Aspects of privacy management framework can be operated on an IP connected device on a remote server network e.g. LaaS platform or a combination of both. IP connected devices can include a mobile phone notebook computer tablet computer netbook computer personal digital assistant PDA or any suitable IP connected device. Mobile applications are installed on device and operate to initiate the geo location functions e.g. navigation geoenrichment geocoding etc. described herein.

At the user interface receives a user input corresponding to data privacy parameters. As described above data privacy parameters can be set by a user to control how certain geolocation data is transferred and or shared with third parties. For example location data accuracy may be limited for third parties where the user wishes to grant access to their general location without precise coordinates. Data privacy parameters can be set by a user by guests i.e. other users with granted access e.g. by the user or they can be automated e.g. presets or computer controlled settings .

At the user interface of privacy management framework controls a transferring of geo location data to and from mobile applications on IP connected device based on the user input. As described above once the data privacy parameters are defined by the user via the user interface of privacy management framework the data privacy parameters are applied to geo location data traffic to from and within IP connected device . In some aspects a change in one or more of the privacy parameters affects how geo location data is provided to each of the plurality of applications. Data privacy parameters can affect myriad geolocation functions including but not limited to location data accuracy location data reporting frequency geofunctions including geofencing geocoding geotriggers geoenrichment or geocloaking the granularity of personal data associated with geo location data personal history data and more as further discussed above.

It should be appreciated that the specific steps illustrated in provides a particular method of managing data privacy parameters e.g. permissions for geo location data access geo cloaking settings etc. according to an embodiment of the present invention. Other sequences of steps may also be performed according to alternative embodiments. In certain embodiments method may perform the individual steps in a different order at the same time or any other sequence for a particular application. For example alternative embodiments may include additional steps to define data privacy parameters include additional functionality of privacy management framework or incorporate multiple IP connected devices. In some methods the privacy management framework may be controlled by software on the IP connected device but operated on remote infrastructure e.g. remote servers cloud computing etc. . Moreover the individual steps illustrated in may include multiple sub steps that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual step. Furthermore additional steps may be added or removed depending on the particular applications. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize and appreciate many variations modifications and alternatives of the method.

In certain embodiments reminder application can use a customer user organization third party or group s location in a pre defined or user defined zone to send a pre defined or user defined note or action when the user enters a pre defined or user defined trigger zone. The term pre defined can mean being of or related to any of the aforementioned parties or entities. A trigger zone can be defined by an address by choosing from a third party list of locations or by performing a search of user defined and third party defined lists of locations points of interests or brands. In some implementations a trigger zone can also be determined by the user or pre defined by the application developer as a category of place. A trigger zone can be limited by the user third party or application developer as a single location defined by a address category or point of interest POI in a pre defined or user defined Level of Detail. The Level of Detail can be set by the user third party or app developer at the neighborhood level city state country or global level in the Privacy Management Framework settings exposed to the end user organization developer or third party.

A note or message can be delivered to an entity party of the kind listed in the first sentence by any means including but not limited to push message SMS email physical mail alert other device or web app server third party organization group or other user. Additional places can be added or access can be revoked per user preference or through a bulk import by the application developer organization third party or other user provided that the end user has opted into or subscribed to these options alerts or pieces of data. The editable data privacy parameters on the user interface allow a user to indicate which locations may access the users geolocation data to determine when they enter a given zone. On the back end the service can query for local store based on an external store database or third party data or use the user s stored address data to deliver the reminder message. More generally applications of this form can be built so that a user can add an address to the system choose an address from a third party database and get any kind of notification when arriving at any location or category of place in a given neighborhood city state country or globally.

Tourism application sends location based notifications to the user based on a current location according to some embodiments of the invention. Examples of location based information can include civic private social or public information including but not limited to parks buildings points of interest art and history. Additional information types can be added or access can be revoked per user preference. Frequency can be modified based on user preferences as well as Level of Detail options addressed above.

Automation application accesses a user s location for the purposes of modifying turning on or off a network connected device including but not limited to an appliance or light switch according to certain embodiments of the invention. For instance the user company organization or group could set an address or set of addresses that can define a place such as home or work. Once a user enters or leaves this location or pre defined set of locations an action may be applied to the network connected device. The editable data privacy parameter includes a user selectable box that gives permission and grants access to the application for accessing the user s geolocation data to determine when to turn on and off the lights at the selected location e.g. home . The applications depicted are for illustration purposes only. The function of each application and the extent of their access and use of geolocation data may vary as required.

The user interfaces described herein enable the tracking and or controlling of what individuals each get to see. For example during the hours of 6 p.m. 7 p.m. embodiments can be configured to allow a spouse child and good friend to track the location of person i.e. IP connected device in real time. During 9 AM 5 PM other individuals can see whether person is at work. Similarly a user can see when his her child is at school real time location of child between school and home and or real time location of spouse between work and home. In addition a user can simply choose the option of notify me when spouse is 10 minutes away from home via SMS push etc.

As described above geocloaking allows users defined user groups e.g. including families work groups etc. and or some other defined social unit or network to modify hide disguise scramble or otherwise alter the past present or projected location of an IP connected device or devices. In some embodiments a user or user group can select a privacy setting so that blind spots or privacy zones are defined on a per application basis for applications gathering location data from an IP connected device. However the application continues to gather location data i.e. its location tracking is not turned off but will fail to report these blind spots or privacy zones. Instead the application can either interpolate between two non blind spots or privacy zones with a spoofed route and report it out or will report the location prior to entering the blind spot until the user has traveled back out of it. In some embodiments the privacy settings for geocloaking can be set by a user interface and controlled by a privacy management framework.

In some implementations user groups can create a Temporary Autonomous Zone TAZ a dynamically generated blind spot or privacy as defined above produced for two or more IP connected devices predefined as members of a TAZ. The TAZ can be initiated when the devices signal their proximity to one another and lasts as long as the devices maintain that proximity. The user can temporarily cache location data in an IP connected device before it is reported to applications authorized to use it. This temporary cache operates analogously to a tape delay. Within the defined delay timeframe the user can access the stored location data by means of an interface and edit or delete it before it is reported. The user by means of an interface can clear all cookies and other tracking tools associated with a geofence or other location. The user can be alerted to the presence of geofences before crossing through them and may be offered the option of disabling location tracking of an IP connected device or devices before doing so. A user can deny contextual location data about ingress or egress to or from a geofence so that an application on an IP connected device authorized to communicate with a second party within a geofence is prevented from reporting the location of the device before or after its authorized geofence specific interaction.

In further embodiments a user can spoof false or incomplete location data from an IP connected device or devices so as to prevent human or automated location tracking e.g. including ad network tracking cookies etc. or other forms of location intelligence gathering. This includes geoventriloquism whereby an IP connected device is made to be observed by automated or human trackers at an apparent location other than its actual one including the location of a different IP connected device. In some cases a user group can define and implement a randomized peer to peer exchange of location data so as to inhibit human or automated location tracking or other forms of location intelligence gathering.

Battery life can be significantly reduced in electronic devices e.g. IP connected device utilizing GPS technologies which may include sending receiving geolocation data. Applications with frequent GPS tracking may tend to consume more power than applications with more infrequent use. For instance grocery app only tracks your location i.e. requests access to geolocation data when a user enters a specified grocery store thus having minimal battery use. In contrast Wikipedia app tracks your location anytime a Wikipedia article relevant to your local area is available thus presumably having more frequent battery use.

Privacy rating indicates how much relative geolocation data and or personally identifiable information is utilized with respect to other applications. With grocery app the application may only request a user s location when they enter into one or more specified grocery stores. Thus requests are infrequent and the amount of personal data associated with the request is relative low since very specific geo location data is required and PII information can be low e.g. shopping habits etc. . With the Wikipedia app location data is requested more frequently depending on the number of local articles and more user behavioral data e.g. PII data may be gleaned as a result including more frequent access to a user s location and whereabouts information regarding a user s news and reading preferences as well as demographic information that than be gleaned therefrom.

In some embodiments graphs can display a history of information gathered by the system for a user. User can opt in or opt out at will which can include opting out of third party or social location sharing at a user defined set of places for geofences times of the day speeds or other user defined variables. User can hide themselves or record location history only for personal use when at a set of user defined places including points of interest cities and user defined locations times or other user defined variables or when other criteria are met.

In further embodiments a user can trigger location sharing to automatically occur when sufficient criteria have been met such as a user defined trigger zone place point of interest city time limit schedule and or other user defined data. In one non limiting example a user can share their location when they arrive at an airport with a pre defined group of people publically or privately and still be stored in user history to a third party and or to a wider social network. Alternatively or in addition to fulfilling certain criteria can allow one s location to be shared in real time with others when a user is a certain amount of time away from a given location such as home or work.

Various embodiments of the invention can utilize GIS and or geolocation based services with a privacy management framework for IP connected devices can use location as a contextual input for determining pattern recognition including significant location behavior and behavioral analysis. For example deviation from regular location behavior i.e. established pattern recognition over time can constitute location intelligence. Location intelligence may include or otherwise be referred to as location analysis and or behavioral analysis. Location intelligence can be useful in the areas of health alerting intelligence economic social behavior and the like.

Location intelligence can be provided either to the user specifically by means of export output application programming interface API or other database query or can be provided to a third party. There is a social analysis of location behaviors which could be used for but not limited to advertising purposes. In some embodiments a back end interface e.g. server based interface accessible by an IP connected device via a privacy management framework can be configured for gathering location intelligence which can be routed to pertinent parties health related organizations etc. In one non limiting example a user device may have a certain trigger for movements which can be indicative of physiological behaviors e.g. Alzheimer s dementia schizophrenia. This may be determined by a change in movement or behavior over time thereby allowing a third party to see the person s location and then report it to an appropriate party. In another example an amount of time spent in a particular place may signal a physiological condition such as depression for certain individuals or alternatively a 25 change in behavior over time may provide early indicators of psychological conditions. Location intelligence can provide these indicators and more across any number of fields interests and disciplines as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.

In some embodiments includes a Personal Location Information Model PLIM upon which historical location profiles granular to the scale of individuals are built. The PLIM can be used to inform location searches with temporal parameters behavioral analytics geocontextual advertising and other location sensitive operations which require the use of stored data. It should be noted that the PLIM is only an information model. The availability of such data its degree of anonymity and or aggregation its frequency of expiration and so forth can determined by end user inputs to the Privacy Management Framework and is enforced by rules governing the system s components.

Processing unit s can include a single processor multi core processor or multiple processors and may execute instructions in hardware firmware or software such as instructions stored in storage subsystem . The storage subsystem can include various memory units such as a system memory a read only memory ROM and permanent storage device s e.g. magnetic solid state or optical media flash memory etc. . The ROM can store static data and instructions required by processing unit s and other modules of system . The system memory can store some or all of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime.

In some embodiments storage subsystem can store one or more software programs to be executed by processing unit s such as user interface controls data privacy parameter management functions and the like as further described above with respect to . As mentioned software can refer to sequences of instructions that when executed by processing unit s cause computer system to perform certain operations of the software programs. The instructions can be stored as firmware residing in read only memory and or applications stored in media storage that can be read into memory for processing by processing unit s . Software can be implemented as a single program or a collection of separate programs and can be stored in non volatile storage and copied in whole or in part to volatile working memory during program execution. From storage subsystem processing unit s can retrieve program instructions to execute in order to execute various operations e.g. user interface operations described herein.
