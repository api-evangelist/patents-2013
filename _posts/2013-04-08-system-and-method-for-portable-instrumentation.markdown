title: System and method for portable instrumentation
abstract: A system and method for portable instrumentation is proposed, comprising a server computer and a portable instrument that is wirelessly connectable to the server computer. The portable instrument comprises sensors for performing respective physical or electrochemical measurements, and a hand-held computer that is operably connectable to the sensors. The hand-held computer is configured to record and transmit the measurements to the server computer. The hand-held computer evaluates a real-time wireless connection quality between the portable instrument and the server computer. When the wireless connection quality shows a declining trend, the hand-held computer determines a spatial boundary where the portable instrument reaches a dead zone with wireless connection quality below a predetermined threshold. The hand-held computer then requests pre-recorded data from the server computer to be forwarded to the portable instrument before the portable instrument reaches the spatial boundary. The efficiency and reliability of the measurements are thus improved.

Portable instruments for physical or electrochemical measurements such as pH oxidation reduction potential or electrical conductivity are widely used for monitoring industrial processes quality control environmental protection and the like. Such measurements are meaningful only when their corresponding locations the circumstances and the conditions are known. The conventional methods of capturing the measured information in the field include for example using portable instruments and then manually noting resultant readings along with observed details followed by later entering this information into a log book computer system or other record. Some portable instruments may be equipped with data loggers which electronically record the readings for uploading later to a computer system.

The present invention provides an improved system and method for recording and distributing measurements made by portable instruments along with observations to serve as reference guidelines for real time measurements with portable instruments. In particular the proposed system and method relate to physical and electrochemical measurements along with the support of audio recording video recording still photography measurements with the global positioning system and the like. The system and method improves the reliability and efficiency of the real time measurements. The measurements may be made for analyzing quality of a water body or soil or any other investigative site.

The forgoing summarizes the principal features of the invention and some of the optional embodiments. The invention may be further understood by the description of the preferred embodiments in conjunction with the drawings which now follow.

In the case where there is no previous history to show the dimensions of the dead zone the server computer and the hand held computer may negotiate the size of the pre recorded data to be forwarded. In doing so the system may calculate the number of measurements that can be taken in a standard time period and limit the forwarding of the pre recorded data to that. For example it may be considered that the standard data collection time is limited to 4 hours and knowing that the collection rate is 10 samples per hour the server computer and the hand held computer may negotiate a total pre recorded data for the 40 most likely records. In practice the requested pre recorded data will always be larger and to account for uncertainty in the locations the user may select. Typically a multiple of 2 or 3 is used so in this example 80 or 120 pre recorded data would be sent. The hand held computer may be configured to determine a derivate of the wireless connection quality over distance to determine the spatial boundary B . The predetermined threshold may be selected so as to allow the portable instrument to receive a predetermined amount of data from the server computer . The pre recorded data is prioritized based on criteria such as the cost for data transmission the amount of data capable to be transmitted to the portable instrument over a wireless connection of declining quality the memory size on the hand held computer the time stamps of data to be transmitted with more recent data being given higher priority and relevance of the pre recorded data to the measurements. The server computer attempts to provide the most relevant pre recorded data by considering the proximity of the recorded points to the user s path of travel the time required for the user to reach the point the number of previous recordings taken at that point the relative dispersion of values at that point and the availability of meta data for those measurements. These factors become the coefficients in a weighting algorithm to select the order or the pre recorded data to transmit.

The server computer selects the pre recorded data to be sent in order determined by WA. Knowing that records with certain types of meta data such as photographs are more important to the user the WA may be adjusted.

The types of the measurements may be global positioning system GPS measurement compass measurement temperature measurement pH measurement conductivity measurement oxidation reduction potential ORP measurement video recording audio recording and the like. The pre recorded data may be audio video text and multimedia or combinations thereof.

The pre fetching algorithm in the calculate quality module is run periodically. Each time the connection quality is calculated the hand held computer records the Q value with the time and location of the hand held computer . If the declining module assesses that there is no decline in the signal quality the function loops back to the calculate quality module . If the declining module assesses that there is decline in the signal quality and finally the signal is lost as shown by the lost signal module this location is recorded as shown by the record position module . Until the signal is regained as shown by the regained signal module the lost signal location is recorded in the record position module . Each time the hand held computer detects a point with zero connectivity the location is recorded as in the record position module . Once the signal is regained the hand held computer will transmit to the server computer the locations of all points with no signal as shown by the transmit dead zone to server module . The server computer adds these points to a dead zone table not shown which is used in future calculations. Once the signal is regained the function again loops back to the calculate quality module . If the declining module shows the signal declining but not lost as in the lost signal module the boundary B where the signal would be lost is calculated as shown by the calculate boundary B module . As shown by the integrate capacity to boundary module the capacity for transmitting and receiving the data by the portable instrument is evaluated. If sufficient capacity is available even with the declining signal strength as shown by the sufficient capacity module the function loops back to the calculate quality module . The hand held computer compares the available bandwidth to the amount of related pre recorded data on the server computer for the area past the spatial boundary B . If the available bandwidth is well in excess of the total pre recorded data that could be sent no action is required. However if the sufficient capacity module detects insufficient capacity the pre fetch data module is activated for forwarding the pre recorded data from the server computer to the hand held computer . Herefrom the function again loops back to the calculate quality module . If the connection quality as in the calculate quality module is decreasing an evaluation is made of the position at which the connection will be lost. The hand held computer communicates this estimated position spatial boundary B to the server computer . At the server computer this information is compared with inputs from other hand held computers which are or were in the vicinity by calculating the signal drop vectors for every other pair of points. These are added to the list of points that form the signal loss boundary to increase the definition. Optionally the hand held computer may send its location to the server computer and the server computer will look up a table of known boundaries B or dead zones from the past and in the vicinity of the hand held computer and advise the user accordingly. Each time a hand held computer passes through a dead zone it sends a list of all known positions without signal to the server computer for updating the tables. This historic information is used in preference to the real time calculations except in the case where the real time calculation shows that the dead zone boundary B may be closer than the known dead zone stored in the server computer . The hand held computer may be configured to determine how much time it is going to take before the portable instrument reaches the spatial boundary B and to determine an amount of data to be sent to the portable instrument within said time taking into account declining wireless connection quality. This is executed by the integrate capacity to boundary module based on the user s speed and direction. Optionally where the server computer has dead zone records defining the extents of the area without signal the available pre recorded data may be calculated to be only those falling within the defined geometry of the dead zone . In the case that the available transfer capacity is less than the volume of data available the hand held computer may request a reduced data set. The volume of data transmitted may be reduced by such methods as cutting the resolution of images and video files.

The predetermined threshold may be selectable so that to allow the portable instrument to receive a predetermined amount of data from the server computer . The system in real time may identify and optimize measurement locations for obtaining the physical or electrochemical measurements by computing the gradient of the measurement records between selected locations. More measurement locations may be identified between the selected locations if the gradients are steeper than a predetermined gradient value to determine the linearity or non linearity of the measurement records. Similarly if the gradients between the pairs of the selected locations are in random order more measurements may be required in between the selected locations to determine further details on the patterns between them.

The hand held computer in real time updates the respective user with the locations and times of the related pre recorded data available in the server computer for avoiding repetitive measurements unless the user decides otherwise.

Extrapolation or interpolation of said pre recorded data may also be used in the server computer for modeling and computing danger levels and alerting the users by the hand held computers for action.

The capabilities of the server computer may be embedded into the hand held computers themselves. Thus any user s hand held computer may act as the server computer for any other user s hand held computer . This feature is useful for example in cases where two or more users are in a remote location without access to a central server computer . The user s hand held computers may then exchange readings and transfer those readings to other users who come in the range or to a central server computer when one becomes available. Such hand held computer may then notify the others within range that it has transmitted the data on their behalf so that redundant communication is eliminated.

These values are stored in a newly created measurement record with other variables known to the hand held computer such as latitude longitude current user serial numbers and the like. Next the calculate values module is run converting the signal values into measured values by performing a mathematical calculation. The calculations used to convert the electrical signal values into measured values are well established and generally published by the manufacturers of the sensors. In some embodiments within range module is executed which compares the measured values with the pre recorded data of the server computer and taken at the same location or under similar circumstances. By comparing with the average and standard deviations of the pre recorded data the probability that the current measurement is out of range is determined. If the measurements are outside of a range for pre recorded data the hand held computer is further configured to generate an alert message not shown for the user and asked to confirm and accept the measurement at the user accepts module . Because of limited capacity in the hand held computer not all the related pre recorded data will be contained. In such a case the hand held computer will send a message to the server computer indicating the time location and value of the measurement taken. The server computer then executes an algorithm to determine which readings should be used for the comparison. The server computer may use a database of geographical information to determine if the position is contained within a closed polygon that defines a measurement body. Where the reading position lies within such a body other measurements taken in the same body are given increased weights than the anomalous readings. In this system the measurement body database is maintained on the server computer which defines the boundaries of such bodies as a list of coordinate points. Each time a measurement is sent for verification the measurement body database is searched to determine if this point lies within the boundaries of a previously measured body. If this measurement point is within the previously measured body of water a weighted average is calculated where the weights are determined by the inverse of the distance those points are from the current point. The maximum and minimum values of each previous measurement are also calculated. The alert message is on the display of the hand held computer when the value is outside the normal ranges. Thus the user can be alerted to a possible bad reading even if that user has never taken a measurement previously in that location. If the reading is accepted by the within range module and the user accepts module the generate UUID module creates an identification number for this measurement which is unique across all the portable instruments and all measurements under the system . Thus measurement records generated by different portable instruments can be safely combined in a single database without a risk of duplicating the identification numbers. The identification number may be generated in accordance with the international standard termed as generation and registration of universally unique identifiers UUIDs and their use as ASN.1 Object Identifier components. Other methods may also be used which assure virtually zero chance of collision. This UUID is stored in the measurement record. Based on the capabilities of the hand held computer and the user input the attach A V module decides whether or not one or more audio visual files need to be attached to the measurement record such files being such as digital photographs video records audio records or any other files. If audio visual files are needed the capture A V module is executed as many times as required to capture an audio visual file such as from an embedded camera and or microphone in the hand held computer followed by executing the store A V with UUID module to store the captured files indexed by the measurement record s UUID to the local storage. Based on the user input the attach notes module decides whether or not the user s notes need to be added to the measurement record. If the user s notes are required the capture user text input module is executed to capture input from a keypad touch screen or any other input device. The user text may include several fields for notes descriptions location observations or other data as required by the specific application. The add to record module adds all the captured notes to the measurement record in the local storage. Based on the capabilities of the hand held computer and the user s notes the attach scan module decides whether or not scans of one or more bar code quick response QR code or radio frequency identification RFID code need to be attached to the measurement record. If one or more scans are needed the capture scan module is executed which will use either a camera of the hand held computer or an integrated bar code reader or RFID reader to scan a code followed by the add to record module to add the captured scan data to the measurement record. Some embodiments of the invention may allow more than one scanned code to be attached to the measurement record. The store record module is called to complete the process of recording the measurements to the local storage on the hand held computer .

Referring to a sequence of steps is shown illustrating the transmittance of measurement records that have been captured by the hand held computer and saved in a local storage. First the connect to server module determines if a system connection can be established to the server computer . If no connection is available the try later module is executed. Once a connection to the server computer has been established the transmit record module is executed sending one measurement record to the server computer . If the connection method is high bandwidth and low cost the supporting audio and digital files are included in their entirety. If the connection bandwidth is low or the connection method is high cost such as over a cellular system then reduced resolution versions may be sent. The acknowledged module examines the response from the server computer to determine if the measurement record was successfully received and stored. If not the process loops back to retry the connect to the sever module . If the measurement record was successfully stored in the server computer the hand held computer is updated by the mark record module to indicate this so that it will not resend. The more records module examines the contents of the local storage on the hand held computer to determine if there are any more measurement records that need to be transmitted to the server computer . If there are more measurement records with the yes command the process loops back to the beginning to the connect to server module . If there are no measurement records that need to be sent to the server computer with a no command from more record module the process ends at module .

Referring to a sequence of steps is shown illustrating the retrieval of the pre recorded data from the server computer by the hand held computer . The hand held computer executes the connect to server module . The hand held computer notes the type and speed of the connection available and stores this information in a memory for later decisions. If the connection is not available the procedure is terminated at module for attempting to connect again at a later time. Once a connection has been established the identify module is executed. The hand held computer exchanges authentication information with the server computer such as a user name and password combination. The server computer determines by lookup into an authorized user table whether or not this user is entitled to access the server computer . Based on the response from the server computer the authorized module is executed. If the user credentials are not valid the inform user module is executed to display a message to the user in his hand held computer explaining the reason for denial of access and the procedure is terminated at module . When the authorized module in the server computer determines that the user is entitled to access the server computer the inquire available module is run in the server computer . An inquiry message is sent to the server computer from the hand held computer requesting the number and type of the pre recorded data in the server computer that are available to this user. The server computer determines the available pre recorded data based on the group membership of the current user and responds with an indication of the numbers available the date ranges measurement types geographies included and the like. The receive and locally store module sends requests to the server computer for all measurement records that the hand held computer can store locally. The function then ends at the done module . The number and order of the requests for the pre recorded data are based on the connection speed as determined when the connection was established the capacity of the storage on the hand held computer and preferences as set by the user. The retrieval process may start with the most recent record with coordinates at or near the user s current location followed by the corresponding older records. Thereafter the retrieval process may be followed by recent records from more distant locations followed by the corresponding older records. To allow the user to review relevant records among the many pre recorded data a method of yet another embodiment of the invention may be used to detect the user s manner of measurement and automatically suggest the relevant pre recorded data. The time intervals of previous measurements at this location may be considered to detect patterns. If the current time and date falls within the error margins of the next measurement time according to the time interval pattern the display may show the user the most recent regularly scheduled readings at this location with the time intervals displayed. Next the geographic position may be considered. If the most recent measurements taken follow a curve at regular distances the algorithm may determine that the user is currently taking samples at regular geographic spacing and show the distance and direction from previous measuring locations. The method monitors the positional changes from the GPS integrated in the hand held computer . When the user comes within a defined distance of a previously measured point and the type of sensor connected to the interface is the same as the one previously used a screen window is opened on the hand held computer to show the user the notes or photographs taken the last time another user measured with a similar sensor at this location. Alternatively in many cases there may be such a quantity of users and measurements that it is necessary to limit the data that is sent to each user. Therefore an algorithm needs to be used within the server computer and or the hand held computer to determine which readings should be sent to each user.

User A has taken a chlorine measurement at a geographic coordinate location . Upon transmission of this measurement record to the server computer the server computer looks up a geographic database location table and determines that location is a swimming pool maintained by company Y. By executing the rate of change algorithm the server computer decides that the chlorine level at location will drop to an unsafe level before the next scheduled maintenance. A lookup is performed on a user position table of the current user positions and the server computer determines that User B is the closest available employee of company Y to location that has the capability of delivering the required chemicals. The server computer sends a message to user B requesting delivery of the calculated quantity of chemical to location . User B has a sufficient quantity of the required chemical and can make the delivery hence replies to the server computer acknowledging that the delivery will be made. The server computer adds this pending delivery to the maintenance schedule table . At some time later user B has delivered the required quantity of the chemical to the pool at location . User B now sends a complete message to the server computer . The server computer updates the maintenance schedule table to show that the delivery has been made. The hand held computer may also retrieve the associated audio visual files with each pre recorded data the decision being based on the current connection bandwidth and cost. The received pre recorded data may be displayed to the user on the hand held computer in the form of a map table or chart. If the audio visual files have been retrieved from the server computer these may be displayed to the user of the hand held computer . The retrieval process continues until all identified pre recorded data have been received from the server computer .

Referring to the server computer comprises a processor and a memory having computer readable instructions stored thereon for execution by the processor forming the following modules control program module network interface module database module and file system module . Access to the control program module may be through an application programming interface module or a web interface module or both. The database module may be a structured query language module SQL database or any other relational database. It may be on the same computing system as the server computer or may be separate and connected by a system connection. The database module comprises at least a measurements table module into which the measurement records acquired from the portable instruments are stored. The measurements table module holds fields such as for time date and measured values and optionally fields for coordinates user identification scanned codes user text serial numbers of the equipment used in taking the measurement and the like. In one embodiment of the invention the database module also comprises a user table module that contains one folder for every user authorized to access the server computer . Each such folder comprises fields for user identifier user name and password. It will be apparent that the passwords stored in the user s table module should be encrypted in accordance with security standards in effect at the time the server computer is deployed. Each measurement record in the measurements table module will have a pointer to one folder in the user s table module . Thus a database query may be used to identify the user for a particular pre recorded data or to identify all the pre recorded data created by a single user. In one embodiment of the invention the database module also comprises a group member s table module . The group member s table module has a multiple relationship network with the users table module such as in that every user may belong to any number of groups and every group may have any number of users. Optionally a group description table module not shown may contain folders for each group providing fields for the group name description and rules for membership. Where a group table module exists each pre recorded data includes a folder indicating the corresponding group module and these memberships are used to determine the available folders to each user for retrieval. In one embodiment of the invention a group may be identified as a public group indicating that pre recorded data assigned to that group are accessible to any user. The control program module may be a web server application or other program capable of responding to requests received through the system interface module and accessing the database module and file system module to respond to those requests. Upon receiving a request to store a measurement record sent by the transmit record module the control program module determines if the current user is authorized by instructing the database module to look up the users table module and confirm that the requesting user is listed in the database module with a corresponding password. Having identified and authorized the user the control program module instructs the database module to create a new record in the measurements table module . This record will have as identifier the UUID that was generated by the hand held computer executing generate UUID module . If the measurement received includes audio visual A V files the control program module stores those files in A V files module in the server s file system module identifying those files by the measurement record UUID. This A V files module may accommodate digital photos audio records video records or other files digitally representing observations made with the pre recorded data. Upon receiving a request to identify available pre recorded data by the inquire available module on the hand held computer the control program module directs the database module to report the number of pre recorded data available to the current user by date range coordinates group or other supplied parameters. The control program module returns the numbers of available pre recorded data to the hand held computer . Upon receiving a request to retrieve a pre recorded data from the receive store module on the hand held computer the control program module queries the database module for the identified record and transmits the record to the hand held computer module . The control program module then examines the file system module to determine if there is any A V files module with a UUID that matches the measurement record. The control program module informs the hand held computer of the availability type and sizes of these files. The receive store module decides whether or not to download the A V files module based on their sizes current connection bandwidth and cost and user settings. In the case where the hand held computer does not retrieve all supporting files a note is made in the local storage of the hand held computer so that the A V files module can be retrieved when a higher bandwidth and or lower cost connection is available. The web interface module helps the users to interact with the server computer over a system using a web browser or other web access program. The inclusion of a web interface module provides users the means to review the pre recorded data without the requirement of the hand held computer .

In a simplified example two measurement locations are considered A and B where a positive coefficient of correlation between the values measured at A and B exists. In order to know the expected value at a third point P somewhere between A and B where no measurement has been previously taken.

Cbeing the concentration of the contaminant at point A and Cbeing the concentration of the contaminant at point B.

The update model module uses the contamination calculations to build a matrix model of the body of water being tested. Consulting the waterway table to obtain the geography of the body a model is generated by dividing the body of water into N number of sections of approximately equal volume. The number of sections N is chosen based on the level of precision needed. For example in a simple case the body of water is a square and all points are known to correlate with each other from previous measurements. The body has been divided into 16 sections. Three measurements are taken at points A B and C and compared with the expected measurements at those points. The results show that A is 4 standard deviations from the average B is 2 and C is 3. These values are arranged in a matrix having 3 known points and 13 unknown. The unknown points are filled with the value 1 indicating that they are all equally likely to contain the source of contamination.

Since the contamination signal is higher at A than at B or C the method excludes all points that are not closer to A than B or C by reducing the probability by the historic coefficient of correlation between the known points and the points in question. In an example all points are known to correlate with each other thus the probabilities are reduced to zero.

Three unknown sections remain that could contain the source of the contamination. The next step excludes all points that are not closer to C than to B as the contamination signals indicate a higher value at C than B.

As there is one remaining point which has a much higher probability than any other point this is considered to be the most likely source.

The calculate next position module is used to calculate the next best position to measure if the preceding step left more than one possibility. The calculation of the next position is made by examining the model as described and generating a list of the points which would remove the most uncertainty from the greatest volume of water. In the preceding example the unknown point with probability 1 would remove the uncertainty and determine if the source is at point A or the point directly below. Next points are eliminated from the list based on accessibility. For land based testers the points that are not on the perimeter of the body of water are eliminated. For each point where a measurement is still on the list of target points the time to reach is calculated based on each user s current position and their rate of travel. The calculate next position module is then run again using the model with the selected target points already filled with simulated values to calculate the likely measurement positions for the following iteration. This process may be repeated to predict any number of steps based on the computing power of the server computer or hand held computer making the calculations. The sequences of measuring points are examined and sorted preference being given to those paths that provide the greatest change in overall model certainty in the least amount of travel time. Additional penalties may be applied to certain paths for example paths in which a user reverses direction. Some paths may also be given preferences for example adding to the score of paths that bring all users back to their starting points when the analysis is complete. This calculation is made by a best path routing algorithm not shown such as is used in a navigation system. In some embodiments the path routing algorithms will be provided as a built in component of the operating system of the hand held computer . Having solved the problem of the next positions to take measurements a comparison is made in the accuracy reached module . The improvement in the expected overall model accuracy by taking the current measurements is examined and a decision is made on whether or not to continue. The decision may be made by the users through the statistics presented or may be automatically based on a set of conditions defined by the needs of the analysis. The direct user s module sends the target point coordinates to the hand held computer of each user. The hand held computer then displays to the user a direction and distance value guiding the user to the next measurement point. Based on the capabilities of the hand held computer this may be presented as a path on a map. When the desired level of accuracy and certainty has been reached the display results report module presents the collected data to the users. The presentation may be a simple table of values a graphical display or other format as appropriate. The results may also be used to generate a report which can be sent from the hand held computer or the server computer to other users as needed. The display results module may also be used to display the ongoing partial results to the users while the measurements are being taken along with feedback on the level of completion of the analysis.

The weighting factors Wd and Wt are determined by calculating the differences from each other in previous measurements as available in the history table module and then performing a linear regression to determine the coefficients for the distance squared and the time squared on the differences.

The coefficients from the model module and the color information collected from the camera color sensor module are fed to the calculation module . The output from the calculation module is an estimated value as shown by the estimated value module which predicts a property of the body of water being tested. The estimated value from the estimated value module is written into the history table module for later comparison with known values when the water in the vicinity is tested by an appropriate sensor. The difference between the estimated value in the estimated value module and the current value are used to improve the accuracy of the model in the model module generated for future samples. The overall accuracy of the estimated values can be improved by having one or more chemical sensors as shown by the chemical sensors module included in the calculation even though these chemical sensors as shown by the chemical sensors module are not measuring the intended property of the water. For example the user may be equipped with a pH sensor but the desired output is a conductivity value. In the case where a sensor of a different type is available the model module is built taking into account not only the correlations to color but also the signals from the attached chemical sensors module . In the case where the signals from the chemical sensors module are used they take the place of the environmental sensor values for S in the above equations.
