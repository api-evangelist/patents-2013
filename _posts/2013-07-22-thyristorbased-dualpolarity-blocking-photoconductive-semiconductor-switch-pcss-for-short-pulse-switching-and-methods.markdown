abstract: A system and method utilizing thyristor-based Photo-Conductive Semiconductor Switches (PCSS) for short pulse switching in high power microwave and/or broadband electromagnetic pulse generation is disclosed. The PCSS consists of thyristor-type NPNP structure having multiple emitter regions enclosed by the base region and multiple emitter shorts to divert leakage currents for voltage holding. The PCSS also includes an optical aperture comprised of patterned metallic grids for light illumination and current collection. The device structure is so constructed that there is only one single bevel around the peripheral. The thyristor-based PCSS have dual polarities of voltage blocking and have better efficiency for light requirement to operate at longer pulse duration compared to diode-based and bulk-semiconductor-based PCSS.

This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. N41756 06 C 5521 awarded by the U.S. Department of the Navy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

This Application claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. application Ser. No. 61 674 421 filed 23 Jul. 2012 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments are generally related to high power Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS . Embodiments are also related to high power Photo PCSS used in pulse power applications. Embodiments are additionally related to a method and system utilizing thyristor based Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS for short pulse switching in high power microwave and or broadband electromagnetic pulse generation.

Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS have become important in high speed optoelectronics and the generation and reshaping of ultrafast high power electromagnetic pulses. PCSS are able to switch tens of kilovolts in sub nanoseconds resulting in extremely high peak powers and are significantly advantageous over other voltage switches in easy fabrication zero device to device jitter for multiple elements and complete electrical isolation of the trigger.

PCSS are mostly based on either diode structure or bulk semiconductor. The diode based PCSS more specifically P i N consists of low doping semiconductor of high resistivity as the starting materials and then P type and N type impurities are introduced on both sides to P i N doping profile. and illustrates cross sectional views of a diode based PCSS . The PCSS includes doped regions and with junctions and metallic electrodes or terminals and an optical aperture on one of the electrodes and a single bevel profile around the peripheral. The voltage holding is accomplished through the un doped drift T region from the junction near P type region and only in reverse bias. That is diode based PCSS can only have one blocking polarity.

For certain circuit implementation PCSS with dual blocking polarity are desired to simplify the circuit layout and reduce the number of component types. Bulk type PCSS use lightly doped bulk semiconductor of high resistivity and often additional doping of the same type is added near one or two electrodes such as N i N type PCSS. The bulk type PCSS is symmetric and can hold voltage in both polarities in general. However the leakage current of bulk type PCSS depends on the resistivity of starting material and is typically larger compared to those with junctions.

A need therefore exists for a new PCSS that can operate in dual polarities of voltage blocking and of less leakage. Also new PCSS should improve the stability of the devices while keeping the same form factor as its diode based counterparts without complicate bevels for edge termination.

The following summary is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the disclosed embodiment and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein can be gained by taking the entire specification claims drawings and abstract as a whole.

It is therefore one aspect of the present invention to provide for high power Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS .

It is another aspect of the disclosed embodiment to provide for high power Photo PCSS used in pulse power applications.

It is a further aspect of the disclosed embodiment to provide to a method and system utilizing thyristor based Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS for short pulse switching in high power microwave and or broadband electromagnetic pulse generation.

The present invention utilizes thyristor based Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS for short pulse switching in high power microwave and or broadband electromagnetic pulse generation. The PCSS consists of thyristor type NPNP structure having multiple emitter regions enclosed by the base region and multiple emitter shorts to divert leakage currents for voltage holding. The PCSS also includes an optical aperture comprised of patterned metallic grids for light illumination and current collection. The device structure is so constructed that there is only one single bevel around the peripheral. The thyristor based PCSS have dual polarities of voltage blocking and have better efficiency for light requirement to operate at longer pulse duration compared to diode based and bulk semiconductor based PCSS of prior arts.

Thyristor based photoconductive switches block both polarities of applied voltage and more importantly the present invention will improve the stability of the devices while keeping the same form factor as its diode based counterparts without complicate bevels for edge termination. For the same voltage rating capability the present invention can have higher doping and thinner blocking layer for the same voltage rating capability in turn the devices of the present invention will need less light to achieve large current conducting state. With internal gain and regenerative action the thyristor based photoconductive switches can be used for long pulse duration without additional light illumination.

The particular values and configurations discussed in these non limiting examples can be varied and are cited merely to illustrate at least one embodiment and are not intended to limit the scope thereof.

The present invention is related to high power Photo Conductive Semiconductor Switches PCSS especially used in pulse power applications. Further the operation of a PCSS is to have fast rise time and large peak current that is large switching power.

AG. illustrates a top view of a thyristor based PCSS with multiple emitter regions . The cross sectional views of the thyristor based PCSS depicted in are shown in . The PCSS comprises of alternatively doped regions and with junctions and metallic electrodes or terminals and on each side an optical aperture on one of the electrodes and a single bevel profile around the peripheral. A PCSS has multiple emitter regions enclosed in the base region . Multiple emitter shorts or cathode shorts are distributed with metallic links between the base region and emitter regions .

A PCSS is a two terminal semiconductor device with an optical aperture as shown in on one of its electrodes . The optical aperture consists of patterned metallic grids which admit light illumination and collects current to one of electrodes connected to the external circuit. The metallic grid pattern of an optical aperture can be of any form suitable for high power applications and is not limited to the embodiment shown in .

The PCSS device is then fabricated through the diffusion metallization and photolithography bevel and passivation. The purpose of bevel and passivation as a scheme of edge termination is to prevent surface breakdown especially at the voltage holding junction where the electric field is high. After bevel one side is wider and the optical aperture can be introduced in the electrode on the wider side of the device for larger aperture and ease of integration to circuit.

The patterned metallic grids are designed to be the optical aperture and at the same time are collecting current from illuminated semiconductor regions. Since the emitter regions are enclosed by the base region the bevel around the peripheral does not expose the emitter base junction and the thyristor base PCSS of have similar form factor of diode base PCSS except opposite nomenclature of electrodes.

Note that diode based devices are only blocking voltage in one single direction i.e. reverse blocking. On the other hand thyristor based devices can be so design that they can block both directions of applied bias forward and reverse blocking. However the blocking capability of both directions is typically not symmetric and depends on the doping profile and edge termination schemes.

In a typical thyristor design there are several emitter shorts created to bypass the leakage current during OFF state to prevent pre mature turn ON through current gain especially in the forward blocking. The emitter shorts are distributed in array such that the leakage current can be bypassed without triggering injection from cathode the emitter of NPN transistor. The emitter shorts will not impede the ON state current gain .
