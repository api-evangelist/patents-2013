The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 507 363 entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR SECURE KEY ENTRY VIA COMMUNICATION NETWORKS and filed Jul. 22 2009 which claimed priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 082 553 entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR SECURE KEY ENTRY VIA COMMUNICATION NETWORKS filed on Jul. 22 2008. The entire contents of those applications are incorporated herein by reference.

In some cases it is necessary to authenticate an entity via a communication network or computing device. For example a bank might want to ensure that only an appropriate account owner will be able to access confidential information about a financial account or a mobile phone user wants to access information stored on their device or via the Internet. To provide such authentication an entity is often asked to remember and provide an alphanumeric key through a communication network. For example a person might be asked for his or her user name and password or Personal Identification Number PIN before being allowed to receive and or transmit sensitive information on a web site via the Internet.

Such an approach however can have a number of disadvantages. For example if an unauthorized party is able to view the password as it is entered by the entity that party will later be able to impersonate the entity e.g. by providing the same password . Similarly an unauthorized party might install a key logging program on a computer that secretly records a password when it is entered. This risk may be especially significant when an entity is using a shared or public computer or network.

To avoid such results an entity might be asked to use a specific physical item e.g. a keychain fob or smart card able to transmit an identifier to a receiving device to provide authentication. Once again an unauthorized person might be able to intercept the identifier and later impersonate the entity. By way of example a signal from a Radio Frequency Identification RFID chip or an electronically readable magnetic strip card might be intercepted. In addition an entity might lose the item and be unable to provide authentication. Other approaches involve determining biometric information e.g. by reading a person s fingerprint . Note that whenever special hardware is needed to implement an authentication technique the cost required may be prohibitive.

According to some embodiments a member authentication or unlock request may be received at a security server from a client server or directly from a native application stored on a computing device PDA Smartphone Netbook Laptop Desktop ATM etc. The member authentication request may be for example associated with a member attempting to access confidential information from the client server or information stored on the computing device. A secure key associated with the member may be determined at the security server and data associated with the secure key may be transmitted from the security server to the member. Secure key information may be received from the member and validated at the security. Based on the validated secure key information it may be arranged for the member to receive the confidential information from the client server.

Other embodiments include means for receiving at a security server from a client server a member authentication request associated with a member attempting to access confidential information from the client server means for determining at the security server a secure key associated with the member means for transmitting data associated with the secure key from the security server to the member means for receiving from the member secure key information means for validating the secure key information at the security server and based on the validated secure key information means for arranging for the member to receive the confidential information from the client server.

In some embodiments a communication device associated with security server exchanges information with one or more remote devices or via information stored on the device. The information may be exchanged for example via public and or proprietary communication networks.

A technical effect of some embodiments of the invention is an automated ability to authenticate an entity via one or more communication networks. With this and other advantages and features that will become hereinafter apparent a more complete understanding of the nature of the invention can be obtained by referring to the following detailed description and to the drawings appended hereto.

A number of terms are used herein. For example the term member is used to refer to a user who interacts with features of the present invention to securely access information or computing device users. For example a member may be a bank customer who uses features of the present invention to login to a bank Website to view their bank account information or to auto lock their computing device when not in use and therefore unlocks their device using the invention. A member may also be a person who belongs to a social website and who uses features of the present invention to securely login to their account.

As used herein the term confidential information is used to refer to protected information or services that are accessed using a password or other security means. For example as used herein the term confidential information may refer to access to an account access to a service access to data or the like.

According to some embodiments a person or member exchanges information using one or more devices coupled to one or more communication networks. The devices could comprise for example a Personal Computer PC a portable computing device such as a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a wired or wireless telephone or any other appropriate storage and or communication device. As used herein devices including the member devices may exchange information via any communication network such as a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN a Wide Area Network WAN a proprietary network a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN a Wireless Application Protocol WAP network a Bluetooth network a wireless LAN network and or an Internet Protocol IP network such as the Internet an intranet or an extranet. Note that any devices described herein may communicate via one or more such communication networks.

While the term computer or PC may be used to describe some embodiments those terms are meant to include any of a number of different kinds of computing or communication devices. For example features of some embodiments may be used with desirable results on PDAs cellular telephones including telephones with keypads such as BlackBerry devices as well as telephones or other devices with touch screen data entry devices such as the Apple iPhone etc. .

According to some embodiments a member uses a first device in an attempt at A to access confidential information from a client server . For example a person might use a PC to attempt to access a web page that contains financial information from his or her bank. As another example a user might use a Web browser to attempt to log in to an email account or an Internet membership or social Website. As another example a user might attempt to log in to a computer such as a home or office computer . Those skilled in the art will appreciate upon reading the disclosure that any of a number of types of information services or resources may be securely accessed using features of the present invention.

At B a request to authenticate the member may be transmitted from the client server to a security server and a secure key may be obtained by the security server at C from a database . The secure key might for example be a string of alphanumeric characters and or images that were previously selected by or assigned to the member.

A limited use matrix may be transmitted at D from the security server to the member. For example a single or one time use matrix might be automatically generated and transmitted from the security server to a second device associated with the member. The limited use matrix might include a number of columns each column containing alphanumeric characters and or images. The limited use matrix might be randomly generated by the security server such that all elements of the secure key determined at C are included within the matrix. One example of a limited use matrix is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 428 349 entitled Nondisclosing Password Entry System the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In some cases the member selects the columns or rows of a pseudorandom alphanumeric matrix display containing the characters of his or her memorized password and only those column or row selections are transmitted over a communication channel. Moreover the identical matrix may be re created at a host from the common secure key and each column or row selection can be tested with the character of the stored version to verify it contains the correct characters in the proper sequence.

Note that the second device might exchange information out of band as compared to the first device e.g. via a different communication network or through a different communication path within the same network . Consider for example a member who uses his or her PC to communicate with a bank server. In this case the security server might transmit a one time use matrix to the member s wireless telephone.

If the member is properly authenticated the security server may provide an indication of approval to the client server at E . The client server may then provide access to the confidential information e.g. by transmitting a web page to the first member device .

Note that some or all of the elements described with respect to the present invention might be automatic or automated. As used herein these terms indicate that at least some part of a step associated with a process or service is performed with little or no human intervention.

Although a single client server and security server are shown in any number of such devices may be included. Similarly any number of member devices a and any other devices described herein may be included and or combined according to embodiments of the present invention. For example in some embodiments the client server and security server might be co located and or may comprise a single apparatus.

At a member authentication request is received. For example a security server might receive a member authentication from a client server when a member attempts to exchange e.g. attempts to receive or provide confidential information with the client server. According to some embodiments a client server might perform an initial authentication procedure before forwarding a request to the security sever. For example the client server might require that a member provide a primary key associated with that member and then validate the primary key at the client server. Such an approach might provide an initial layer of security for the confidential information.

At a secure key associated with the member may be determined. For example the security server might retrieve a secure key associated with the member from a database. According to some embodiments the secure key comprises an ordered sequence of symbols including numbers letters pictures and or logos. The secure key might have been previously established via interactions between the member and the client server and or the security server.

At data associated with the secure key is transmitted to the member. Note that the data associated with the secure key might not be the key itself and further the secure key might not be determinable from the data. For example the security server might determine a one time plurality of symbol sets wherein the ordered sequence of symbols is included within the plurality of symbol sets. Consider for example a matrix of symbols randomly generated by the security server based at least in part on the secure key with each column in the matrix representing one of the symbol sets. In this case the all symbols in the actual secure key might be located somewhere within the matrix.

At secure key information is received from the member. For example the secure key information might comprise an ordered list of column identifiers. Note that information provided to and or received from the member may be accomplished using more than one communication band. For example the member might initially attempt to access confidential information via a first band receive a one time use matrix via a second band and provide a list of column selections via a third band. In some cases the third band may be the same as the first band. For example the member might communicate with client server via i the Internet using a web browser application executing on a personal computer and ii the security server via a wireless telephone network using a wireless telephone.

At the secure key information may be validated. For example the security server might compare the ordered list of columns identifiers received from the member the symbol sets associated with those columns and the ordered sequence of symbols representing the secure key. If the column identifiers were provided in the correct order such that each symbol in the secure key was correctly identified in order the security server might determine that the member was in possession of the correct secure key. Note that this may be accomplished without exchanging information to and or from the member that could be used by an unauthorized third party to re create the key. For example even if an unauthorized third party visually or electronically intercepted the information and or keys activated by the member the secure key could not be re created.

At based on the validated secure key information it may be arranged for the member to receive the confidential information from the client server. For example the security server might indicate to the client server that the member has provided sufficient information to verify his or her identity.

Consider for example a member who has selected 123RED as his or her secure key. In this case the security server might transmit a one time use 5 by 5 matrix of symbols to his or her wireless telephone as illustrated in . Referring now to another illustrative display this time on another style of wireless telephone is shown. In the wireless telephone displays a 4 by 5 matrix of symbols. The user interacts with the matrix using the data entry features of the wireless telephone . Still another illustrative display is shown in . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a wide variety of different matrix sizes and displays may be used with features of the present invention.

Note that all characters in the secure key are included within the matrix . As another example a matrix might be displayed on a PC or notebook computer monitor as illustrated in . Note that either matrix display could be used by the member to select an ordered list of matrix columns that correspond with his or her secure key. In the present example the member would select columns 1 5 3 2 5 1 as being associated with 123RED. Note of course that other arrangements of symbol sets could be used instead e.g. a member might select column row identifiers .

The processor is also in communication with an input device . The input device may comprise for example a keyboard a mouse or computer media reader. Such an input device may be used for example to enter information about members and or clients. The processor is also in communication with an output device . The output device may comprise for example a display screen or printer. Such an output device may be used for example to provide reports and or display information associated with members and attempts to access confidential information.

The processor is also in communication with a storage device . The storage device may comprise any appropriate information storage device including combinations of magnetic storage devices e.g. magnetic tape and hard disk drives optical storage devices and or semiconductor memory devices such as Random Access Memory RAM devices and Read Only Memory ROM devices.

The storage device stores a program for controlling the processor . The processor performs instructions of the program and thereby operates in accordance any embodiments of the present invention described herein. For example the processor may receive via the communication device a member authentication request associated with a member attempting to access confidential information from the client server. The processor might also determine a secure key associated with the member and transmit data associated with the secure key e.g. a matrix to the member. The processor may also receive from the member secure key information validate the secure key information and arrange for the member to receive the confidential information.

As used herein information may be received by or transmitted to for example i the security server from participant devices document conversion systems review systems and or claim processor devices or ii a software application or module within the security server from another software application module or any other source.

As shown in the storage device also stores a member database . An example of a database that may be used in connection with the security server will now be described in detail with respect to . The illustration and accompanying description of the database presented herein is exemplary and any number of other database arrangements could be employed besides those suggested by the figure.

The member identifier may be for example an alphanumeric code associated with a member who has enrolled with a client or a security service. The member information could represent for example information about the member such as his or her name address communication identifier and or associated client or client account number. The secure key may be a password defined by the member and might include numbers letters images e.g. img1 etc. The single use matrix identifier could comprise for example a pointer indicating where a matrix randomly generated based at least in part on the secure is stored. According to some embodiments the single use matrix might instead be stored directly within the database . The matrix information might indicate for example when the matrix was generated and or whether or not the member has been successfully authenticated using the matrix.

Thus the security server and member database may be used to provide strong access authentication technology affording an online web user with an enhanced login security feature. Such a one time password authentication method may moreover avoid clumsy and or cost prohibited attributes associated with physical hardware fobs tokens biometrics and or smart cards.

In addition the approaches described herein may give members and or clients a secure marketable economical and easy to use packaged solution. Through the use of a customized keypad a member or user may act as the encryption point while selecting their secure key from a randomized Graphical User Interface GUI display such as the displays illustrated in system of . This mechanism may convey to users that they are not just more secure but they are involved with the security instrument itself.

According to some embodiments the secure key approach described herein may transform the user s password characters into column numbers during the login keying and safely sends it over the web with reduced worry of having the password being trapped copied or captured via hidden key logging software or hidden cameras over the user s shoulder. It may also prevent or impede the progress of phishers that attempt to lure Internet users via e mails to counterfeit Web sites disguised as trusted companies in order to get sensitive data such as their user identifier password and or credit card information.

As illustrated by way of example in the system of some embodiments described herein may be implemented using Microsoft .NET web service technology that is installed inside a client s firewall and or that executes alongside a client s online application web server that is locally or remotely hosted. Only minor adjustments might be required to the client s existing users interface system. For example the adjustment might include adding just one PHP script to the client s web server folder and is called after an initial primary login is authenticated. A web service may comprise for example a collection of protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems and software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can communicate with the web services described herein. An advantage of web services may be ubiquity across platforms and languages. A PHP script running on Linux might for example communicate with an Internet Information Server IIS server on a Windows box using Active Server Pages ASP without any communication problems. When the server switches over to Solaris Apache and Java Server Pages JSP everything may transition with limited problems.

Some embodiments described herein may be implemented using Service Oriented Architecture Protocol SOAP web service format for passing messages across a network and calling functions on remote computers. The use of such web services may let the system share data across many platforms and hardware configurations. For example a Java web service may be created and used by another element using a .NET client.

The following describes one example of software coded logic that could be employed by the secure key web service Application Programming Interface API according to some embodiments of the present invention. This is an illustrative example and those skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure will realize that other keypad sizes and different combinations of icons text or images or the like may be used.

A client s server may call a Yourkey.PHP Script that then calls a Web Service API function to perform certain action required to process a member s login. The web service may for example determine if the member s email address calling is a normal or pre verified member. This might be noted or indicated in the member s database row or column during an initial registration process e.g. when the member might have been prompted for a mobile phone number and wireless carrier name . In order to send a text message for example the system might use an email address type format like 2035551212 vtext.com where vtext.com is the short name for Verizon Wireless Carrier. If the member is a non verified member or the transaction being performed by the member doesn t require extra security then the member s normal icon keypad may be randomized scrambled and transmitted back to the calling server requesting the secure service login keypad. If it truly is a pre verified or two factor type member then the following logic flow might executed to handle the security service.

The web service program may randomly create a keypad that implements a cryptographic Random Number Generator RNG using the implementation provided by the .NET Cryptographic Service Provider CSP to create 20 random icons of 4 columns and 5 rows consisting of the following set of icon types selected in the order shown below 

As a result a total of 20 icons may be determined to create the Random Generated Keypad. After the program randomly picks the 20 icons from the above types the system may then store the image icon names with folder prefixes into an array. This string array may then be passed to a special function that will randomize scramble the entire array of 20 entries using for example the following pseudorandom number generator provided by the Microsoft .NET Library 

The 20 entry string array may now be ready to be converted to standard html code and transmitted by the security server back to the caller s browser for display on the member s monitor with all the necessary text input boxes and control buttons required to enter the column numbers that match the member s computer generated password and column numbers sent to their mobile device as a short text message. The actual sending of a keypad to member and calling the member s mobile device may be performed microseconds apart within the web service function. In many cases and depending on the carrier s Short Message Service SMS the text message may take up to 20 seconds to be transmitted to member s mobile device.

The last part of the two factor function logic may be to randomly select a password of 5 to 8 characters long from the 20 entry icon array that makes up the members keypad being displayed back on the callers browser. Using the pseudorandom number generator provided by the Microsoft .NET Library System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider the system may request a random number between 1 and 20 minus any duplications of the random number and then using this random number compute the column number that matches the icon number and save for sending to the member s mobile phone later in the process.

After the system has created the 5 to 8 character password it may use the 20 icon array and newly created password to update the member s database table row with the newly generated keypad and password.

The web service function may now create a small html text message to send to the member s mobile device. The system may get the mobile phone number and carrier name from the member s database table row and format a text message to transmit to the mobile device e.g. as illustrated in . The member will see the mobile text message on their mobile device s display with a normal transmit time being for example 20 to 40 seconds along with the instructions to enter or click the column numbers on the keypad to complete their secondary password login to the client s web site.

The member must enter the correct column numbers according to some embodiments on the first attempt or they will receive another text message and a whole new keypad will be generated . Note this requirement to be valid on first attempt might represent an additional security measure that prevents an unauthorized party from having the opportunity to try and guess the correct columns on three or more attempts as is often done with typical keypad login methods . Thus the above logic may be repeated all over again if the member doesn t enter the correct column numbers on the first attempt from their mobile device. If the member cannot correctly enter the column numbers after a pre determined number of attempts they may be asked to answer a challenge question. If the challenge question is answered correctly the member might be allowed to attempt login again or reset the registration method. If the challenge question is not answered correctly the member might need to call or email a customer support for further assistance.

Note that elements of may help let a client determine directly from a web service that a member has completed the registration and or login process on a security server.

In this manner a system may be provided that allows for the secure authentication of members via communication networks. Moreover authentication may be achieved without having a member explicitly enter his or her secure key.

The matrix and user interface pursuant to the present invention may be used to promote market or advertise goods or services. For example in some embodiments one or more of the images in the limited use matrix of the present invention may be an image such as an advertising logo or icon. In some embodiments one or more advertising icons logos or images may be selected by a member or user when selecting a password. For example referring now to a display is shown which represents an illustrative display that may be presented to a member when setting up or changing a password for use with embodiments of the present invention. As shown a series of graphical images such as advertising icons logos or images are displayed along with alphanumeric characters . The member may thus incorporate one or more graphical images in a password. In this manner embodiments may be used to reinforce the brand recognition or marketing messages of one or more advertising partners. Pursuant to some embodiments the graphical images may include one or more company logos photos special images or the like. In some embodiments the graphical images may be supplied directly by advertising partners such as the advertisers themselves ad agencies or third party ad serving networks.

Note that the graphical images may be stored in different places according to different embodiments and or different types of icons. For example English alphanumeric characters and control characters might be stored at the user device e.g. wireless telephone along with a security application or program. As another example corporate logos or icons might reside a security server and after installation may further be stored on the user device. As still another example custom icons might be downloaded by users onto their device e.g. either for free or in exchange for a small purchase fee and may or may not be part of the device s password or PIN. Still other embodiments might be associated with advertisements personal movies photographs and or audio files e.g. mp3 files stored at the user s device. Moreover note that according to some embodiments the key or PIN might be stored only in the user s device e.g. a PIN might never be transmitted to a security back end database or server . In this case a process may be implemented to unlock the device when the user has forgotten his or her PIN.

In some embodiments one or more graphical images may be uploaded onto a server such as for example the server of and automatically resized or proportioned for use with the matrix of the present invention. In some embodiments one or more graphical images are static images e.g. they are not hyperlinked to any other pages . In some embodiments one or more graphical images are dynamic or clickable links. For example in some embodiments one or more graphical images are associated with one or more URLs that are either specified by the advertiser e.g. the URLs point to a location on an advertiser controlled website or by an entity operating or controlling the system of the present invention e.g. the URLs point to a location on server of or some other location . In this manner members using features of the present invention may be presented with advertising during a sign in process and may click on a graphical image to find out more information about a product or service.

An illustrative example of one embodiment of the present invention in which graphical icons are used which are dynamic or clickable is shown in where a user interface is shown having a matrix in which a dynamic graphical icon representing the Coca Cola brand is shown. When a user mouses over or clicks on the graphical icon a window is generated with further details about the brand. In the illustrative user interface a simple brand image is shown however those skilled in the art will appreciate that any type of marketing material may be presented including for example targeted offers discounts coupons product details etc. In some embodiments an option such as Remember This or Send More Information or the like may be presented in the window. By selecting or opting into the option a member may receive further details regarding the marketing presentation or material e.g. a member may receive an email or other communication about the offer . In this manner the overall use of the matrix remains simple and uncluttered and the log in process is not disrupted by overly intrusive marketing offers. Those skilled in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure that other advertising techniques may be used in conjunction with the present invention including for example the presentation of contextual ads e.g. presented on the side top or bottom of the matrix . The contextual ads may be selected based on demographics or preferences associated with each member so that each member enjoys targeted advertising that is relevant to their interests or preferences.

Pursuant to some embodiments one or more of the graphical icons such as the icons of may be or include animated images. For example in some embodiments graphical icons used pursuant to the present invention may include animated images. For example in some embodiments one or more images may be animated graphics interchange format GIF images. In this manner a single location of the matrix may be used to display several different images by cycling through different images in the single GIF. As a more specific illustrative example again referring to the Coca Cola image in the matrix may be an animated GIF image that cycles through a series of different images. For example the animated GIF may cycle through three different Coca Cola brand images to reinforce the Coca Cola brand to users. As another example the animated GIF may cycle through three different brand images e.g. the GIF may loop through a display of a Coca Cola image a BMW image and an NBA image . In this manner each matrix location may be used more efficiently allowing a large number of brand or image impressions during a typical login sequence. The term animated GIF is used to refer to any image format that allows the animation cycling of images in a single file e.g. such as Flash or other formats . In some embodiments multiple image files may be used and the images may be cycled through using code that automatically refreshes or cycles through the image e.g. using Javascript PHP or the like .

Thus systems may use advertisements to enhance brand loyalty in connection with a security application. illustrates one advertising management system according to some embodiments. The system may include a mobile user device that exchanges information with an advertising manager web server . For example a mobile user might download a security application to his or her device . The advertisement manager web server might then receive a new user registration email message. In response the advertisement manager web server might transmit a welcome email message with more registration details to the mobile user device . The mobile user may then complete installation by selecting a new PIN. The mobile user may further register by entering his or her personal information via an advertisement manager web service application.

The advertisement manager web server may also exchange information with an employee e.g. an employee of a security provider . For example the employee may create a schedule via an advertisement manager web application using information from a client. The information might for example be downloaded to mobile user devices once a day or whenever the schedule is updated.

The advertisement manager web server may also exchange information with a corporate client e.g. a client who advertises via the system . For example the client might upload advertisement images to the web server . The client might also select a schedule budget and or place an order via the web server . The advertisement web server may store information in one or more advertisement databases e.g. associated with a MICROSOFT SQL server and or an images pool having a server director structure.

Some or all of the elements of the advertising network might be associated with a high availability physical architecture including a combination of environmental process software and computing hardware enhancements that help reduce the time that the security application and system are not available. For example the servers may comprise a Windows or Linux server that is designed and managed to operate with only a small amount of planned and unplanned downtime. Moreover clusters of networked and grouped e.g. two or more highly available servers and shared disk drives may be used to support each other in the event of failure of one server or a network component.

Similarly highly available packages e.g. one or more applications and or database instances grouped together by some logical method may be utilized such that both a primary node for the package the node the package will run on under normal conditions and one or more adoptive nodes for the package may be used as nodes the package will run on if the primary node has failed. According to some embodiments each package will have an IP address assigned. This address may move from one node to another during failover so that users will always connect and re connect to the same address. Note that that this IP address may be different than the IP address of the node.

According to some embodiments each package may have a separate group of disks associated with it containing data needed by the package s applications. The group of disks may be taken from a shared disk pool for a cluster. Note that two packages might not share the same group of disks. Each file system created from this group of disks may also have unique mount points directory structures . If two packages are sharing the same directory structure one package may not be able run when these two packages try running on the same machine. Moreover each package may have monitors and services. As used herein a service may refer to an application program or resources that are needed by the package to run properly. A monitor may refer to a program that is keeping up with the health of the package components. If a service fails or a monitor senses a problem the package may be halted or restarted on another server within the cluster.

According to some embodiments the system of may be used to deliver a security application to the wireless telephone via an over the air download. Initial seeding for the security application may be provided for example via a website associated with a corporate center.

The initial seeding may also be provided via an advertising manager web server e.g. in connection with a Get Security Application For Your Phone selection . In this case the user may provide a mobile phone number to the advertising manager web server and the system may send an SMS message that includes an appropriate URL to the mobile. The user may then click on the link to launch his her mobile browser or type it on his her browser and download the security application.

According to some embodiments different security application versions are installed in different network devices based in different make and or model versions of the devices. For example a first wireless network might not want a logo associated with another wireless network to appear in connection with the security application. As another example some phones may use a 15 button configuration while others support 16 buttons.

According to some embodiments a current security application user may select a Send security application to a Friend option to send an SMS to a friend who may then download the security application. According to other embodiments a current security application user may activate a security application web application s Send security application to a Friend to send an SMS to a friend who may then download the security application. According to some embodiments referring a friend in these ways could result in a reward e.g. points themes or free ringtones .

According to some embodiments the security application product is delivered and installed as a Home Screen Replacement. The standard behavior for this type of application may be that after installation for example the next time the user encounters the standard home screen he or she is instead first asked whether they would like to proceed to the standard telephone home screen or the security application home screen. This may be a system supplied prompt e.g. not under the security application s control . The user can choose either home screen and also have the option to set one or the other as the default home screen. If he or she sets the security application as the default the user will no longer be presented with the home screen choice they will instead launch directly into the security application PIN entry screen. At this point once he or she has chosen the security application as their default the user has effectively locked down their phone such that the system will always force the user to enter their security application PIN prior to accessing any functionality on the phone. If the phone user decides they no longer wish to use security application they can reset their home screen default from within the Settings application of the telephone.

A user might submit registration information for a security application in any of a number of different ways. For example the user registration might be initiated at the security application web site or a manufacturer s site. In this case the mobile user might connect via the device s browser to a GOOGLE Android web site or to web pages associated with wireless service providers. As another example user registration might be initiated via an SMS send to the device e.g. from a friend s phone or via a web page request .

In order to request advertisements from the server the security application may first register with the server. This may be done for example as a single http request. Knowing its network and its device s make model may be helpful for getting the appropriate version of the security application and the right schedule for advertisement .

The user may then be prompted to enter information on the device s security application. The information might include for example a user ID representing a security application unique user ID. This user ID might also be defined and used in other instances e.g. it may be the security application user s primary email address it may be used by an algorithm to generate a security application Identification Code it may be passed as a unique identifier for any subsequent Application to Server http requests and or it may be the security application backend system s primary communication method to the security application mobile user . According to some embodiments a second email address might be requested e.g. to facilitate resolving lost PIN situations .

The user may also be asked to provide his or her primary telephone number. In some cases this number cannot be used for receiving the Identification Code since the device would be locked while the user is trying to recover his email. However the user may still receive an SMS on this phone confirming that an Identification Code has been sent and his her security application PIN may have been changed. According to some embodiments a secondary mobile phone number may be requested e.g. a secondary mobile phone that supports SMS . This mobile phone might be owned by a person that is trusted by the user e.g. the user s mother or spouse and may be designed to be used as an option when required to communicate via SMS the Identification Code to the user when he or she forgets a PIN . According to some embodiments the user also indicates or selects the name of his or her wireless carrier e.g. AT T or T Mobile .

The information provided by the user might be updated for example via the mobile security application. According to some embodiments process is available for updating the above information from the advertising manager web server application. The updates are then pushed by the security application to the security application database over the network. Such an approach may provide improved security. Note that the information may be used in subsequent http requests made by the security application to the server.

By way of example the following is one XML format for the security application user initial registration 

If there is a registration error the error code might be returned in the response along with a description of the error 

If the security application registration fails the security application may attempt a registration on the user s behalf the next time it runs. If registration continues to fail the application might not be able to obtain any advertising schedule from the server or submit tracking information. Please note that advertisements might not be returned in response to the registration request this may instead be a standalone http request specifically designed to handle security application registration. It may be the case that the user s downloaded and installed version of the security application itself provides the user with a satisfactory pre installed set of keypad images including sponsored advertisements.

According to some embodiments the security application may be associated with two different screen configurations or formats based on the number of buttons that a user device can display simultaneously . For example a 16 button security application screen format might be appropriate for an Android type user device while a 15 button security application screen format might be appropriate for a Blackberry type user device. Moreover according to some embodiments a maximum number of log in attempts e.g. 10 attempts might be allowed before locking a user out. After lock out the security application may require an identification code to unlock the device.

Both a 16 button and 15 button security application screen format might require a five symbol long PIN and at least one of the symbols may need to be an icon. The screen configurations may remain static e.g. the buttons might not be randomized at a press of a button . However the security application may randomize the buttons every time the user turns the device on and successfully enters his her PIN. If the user doesn t enter his her PIN successfully the same buttons may be display at the same screen locations until security application unlocks.

According to some embodiments a highlight option can be turned on off by the user via a security application menu. The highlight option may for example draw a user s attention to one of the symbols on the entry pad by making the symbol larger than other symbols flashing the symbol rotating or otherwise animating the image and or by have the size and or brightness of the symbol pulsate in size or brightness on the display e.g. a heartbeat effect . By way of example only illustrates a display including a highlighted icon . According to some embodiments only one icon has the highlight effect at a time and a security application server or advertisement scheduler may determine which symbol should currently have the highlight. In some cases a highlighted icon might indicate that a special offer is available to the user in connection with that company.

Some user devices may have a hard keyboard instead of a touch screen. In this case entering a security application PIN e.g. via a trackball may require a different procedure. For example a user might either use the device s trackball to select and enter an icon for his her PIN or the device s keyboard to enter his her security application PIN including one or more icons. In some cases a user could use the trackball and the hard keyboard in combination. For example a user might use the device s trackball to select and enter his her security application PIN. He or she might then either press the trackball or the device s spacebar button to select an icon or a character button. Each time the user highlights a button or an icon the icon may pop up and stays this way until the user moves to another button.

According to some embodiments each security application character or number links to an appropriate hard button on the device s hard keyboard. For example the hard keyboard Y button may link to the security application s Y icon the 4 to 4 the b to b etc. According to some embodiments an icon could be linked to a character or number by the user. At the new PIN setup screen and after the user selects an icon as a part of his her PIN a screen with all of the keyboard s characters and numbers might be displayed to assist the user linkage to the recently selected icon to a character or number. For example the user might select the following PIN J G E where and represent graphical logos . Assuming he or she assigned the character P for the Pepsi icon and the character W for the BMW icon. The user may then use the following PIN on his her Blackberry hard keyboard to unlock his her device J G E P W. According to some embodiments the user can also use the device s trackball in addition to the hard keyboard. This may be for example useful when the user forgets his or her personally defined links between keys and icons.

According to some embodiments an authentication screen may be presented to a user each time he or she starts the security application. The screen may consist of rows and columns of numbers letters and images which are buttons that can be tapped by the user to enter their PIN. The numbers letters and icons presented to the user may be chosen from a predefined set of images which includes the user s actual PIN images plus a random selection of letters numbers and images which are not part of the users PIN.

The set of keys initially displayed may include the characters in the user s PIN placed at random locations in the grid. After each button press by the user the buttons on the screen may according to some embodiments be randomly redrawn. After the user has pressed the buttons in the sequence representing their PIN pressing an accept button will attempt to authenticate the PIN against one stored in connection with the user. If there is a match the user proceeds into the application. If there is no math the user may retry or exit the application.

Upon successfully entering a security application PIN on the keypad the security application home screen application may launch the original devices home screen launcher providing the user with full access to their applications and data. When the user powers off the device the next time it is powered on he or she will be required to re enter the security application PIN. Similarly if the device goes into inactivity sleep mode upon waking the user will be required to enter their PIN.

Note that one or more rules may need to be satisfied before a user selected PIN is accepted. For example a valid PIN might need to be at least keys long and might need to include at least one graphical image e.g. it could be his or her four digit ATM code plus one additional icon .

Upon program launch a security application may determine if a PIN has already been set. If one has not been set the user may be presented with the security application PIN creation screen . The PIN creation screen may present the user with a simple screen that allows him her to enter a PIN using a combination of alphanumeric characters and one or more icons. When a user enters his her security application PIN he she may then tap a Done button to save it.

He she will be asked to confirm his her PIN by now entering it in a security application authentication screen before storing it. Note that the security application PIN might only be stored in the device and never transferred to the backend database. The security application may offer users a way to recover their security application PIN and thus their data in the case where their security application PIN is lost or forgotten. Information about the new user e.g. his or her name and email address but not including the PIN may be transmitted from the user device to a server . The server may then arrange for the user to complete the registration process online via a web page .

To help a user recover a forgotten PIN the security application may utilize a user specific identification code. For example the identification code may be generated by an algorithm based on the user s User ID e.g. his or her primary email address and the current date. The same algorithm code may run in both the security application advertisement manager server and the security application mobile application. The security application identification code may for example have a one day life span. After that the user may need to request another identification code.

Upon receiving the identification code from a web page the device first compares it with the identification code that was compiled in the device with today s date. If authentication fails it compares it with another one that was compiled on the device with tomorrow s date. If this also fails it compares it with the one that was compiled on the device with yesterday s date. If still not a much then it displays an error message to the user. The reason for running the multiple date procedure is because of calendar time setup differences between the device s date keeper and the web server and time zone issues.

To comply with regulation a security application may provide an emergency call icon on the initial 6 button and the 15 button screen configurations. When the user presses the emergency call button the phone s dial up screen may be displayed without enable other phone features e.g. contacts and call logs would not be enabled . When the user is finished with his her emergency call the security application screen may be re displayed.

According to some embodiments an advertising area or bar may be provided on a security application display. For example illustrates a display including an advertising bar . The advertising bar might be for example associated with the Google AdSense service to provide an efficient way for publishers to increase revenue by displaying targeted unobtrusive advertisements. The bar might also let the security application provide search functionality for the users.

In some cases users like to customize their mobile device by establishing different types of ringtones in connection with various functions. In a similar way a security application might let a user establish customized backgrounds or wallpapers for his or her display. For example illustrates a display including a user selected background theme. According to some embodiments theme features may be offered as an incentive for the users to register their personal information. The user might for example need to register his her personal information in order to receive free theme packages. According to other embodiments a user may be able to purchase a particular background e.g. associated with a favorite sports team . Still other themes might reflect real time local weather conditions or his or her daily horoscope.

Thus embodiments have been described wherein a user may interact with a mobile device and or a web page to exchange information via a security application. Note however that other devices may also be associated with the security application. For example an Automated Teller Machine ATM device might display a randomized keypad including icons in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. illustrates a system wherein a user completes an online registration form to provide information to a security server . Information might also be synchronized with NYCE banking servers and or networks. When the user presents an identification card to an ATM device e.g. his or her bank credit or debit card the ATM may provide a display that lets corporate icons be entered as part of his or her PIN. According to some embodiments standard ATM devices may be utilized e.g. column buttons may be used to scroll through and select PIN icons . Moreover a user might opt to view additional advertising information such as special offers or promotions or such information might be displayed after the user has completed his or her normal banking transaction.
