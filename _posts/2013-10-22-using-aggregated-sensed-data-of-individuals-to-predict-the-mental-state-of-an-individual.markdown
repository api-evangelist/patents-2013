Vast resources have been devoted to the sequencing of the human genetic code and to cataloging the influence of genes and other physiological traits. However a major component of health and wellness can be attributed to the interactions of subjects with their environment including their lifestyles. Despite the widely accepted view that lifestyle activities such as those related to diet exercise sleep habits and the like affect health and wellness efforts to catalog those effects to date have been limited. A need exists for methods and systems that systematically catalog the effects of various human lifestyles on a wide range of outcomes that is a need exists to sequence the human lifestyle. The low cost and ready availability of sensors has reduced costs of collecting data. In addition improved data integration and processing methods have allowed for use of existing data sources. However this wealth of data has not yet led to a better overall understanding of the influence of particular lifestyles instead the wealth of data has overwhelmed existing systems and methods.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

Humankind has sequenced the human genetic code resulting in the identification of sequences of genes that are related to particular conditions outcomes or the like. Thus a certain genotype can be associated with outcomes allowing the prediction of outcomes for individuals or groups that share that genotype. However despite a wealth of information collected about lifestyles similar efforts have not been undertaken to sequence data related to the human lifestyle in order to allow the drawing of the same kinds of inferences about individuals or groups that share the same lifestyle. The low cost and ready availability of sensors has reduced costs of collecting data. In addition improved data integration and processing methods have allowed for use of existing data sources. The availability of this wealth of data creates a unique opportunity for data analytics and data processing which may be used to analyze and parse the wealth of human lifestyle information. Importantly methods and systems are disclosed herein for organizing data about lifestyles into meaningful sequences of information allowing analysis and drawing of inferences about the effects of human lifestyles. Among other advantages data processing and data analytics applied to life bits life bytes life byte sequences and lifotypes may also allow for the creation or identification of new surrogate measures sensors and vital signs as well as predictors of certain conditions.

Thus the concept of a lifeotype encompasses classifying human state data or other data concerning a population or sub population of individuals into types that correspond to certain combinations of traits or aspects of human lifestyle human status and or human condition. In embodiments the concept of a lifeotype may also be applied to other organisms. By analyzing patterns within and across the lifeotypes one can draw conclusions make inferences and make predictions about each type that apply to the members of the type or to groups of individuals of that type. The possible types may be composed of combinations of individual data types which may be measured continuously over time or at discrete intervals.

Referring to the concept of a lifeotype may be further understood by analogy to bits and bytes of information in the data world. Information may be organized into bits bits may be organized into bytes bytes may be organized into sequences and any of the foregoing may be organized into or provide actionable information. Actionable information may be composed of any number including none of bits and or bytes. The inclusion of bit and byte in illustrates that it is possible that there are no bits and or bytes in a particular embodiment. That is it is possible that the information itself is a byte or that a bit is actionable information that the information itself is actionable and the like.

By analogy to the bits and bytes of a life bit may be a bit of data for a trait or aspect at a point in time. A life byte may be a collection of life bits. In an embodiment the bits may be values of certain parameters with bits of certain types such as derived from certain data sources including the ones described herein being arranged in a predetermined way to form a byte. The byte may be an aggregate of the bits which may for example correspond to a particular type of information such as a type of file a message a command or the like in the same way that a particular type of life byte may correspond to a particular type of information collected about a human state. The bytes may be sequenced or otherwise combined to form actionable information such that a higher level system such as an operating system application program service or the like can take a byte or series of bytes and perform an operation based on the nature of the byte or sequence of bytes and in particular the bits that populate that byte.

Referring to the concept of a lifeotype may be further understood by analogy to genetics. Genetic information may be organized in base pairs or genetic sequences and in their totality comprise the genotype. Life bits can be thought of as analogous to genes which are organized according to the sequence of the genotype but may or may not be expressed in a given individual or may be expressed to a different extent in a particular individual. Particular genes or sequences of genes that are expressed including in some cases expressed to a particular extent and that taken together are of interest may be assembled into genotypes in the same way that life bytes or sequences of life bytes that are of interest may be assembled into lifeotypes. The genotypes in turn through the interaction with the environment in some cases may present as an overall phenotype analogous to actionable information. As with the inclusion of the subscript zeros in indicates that a particular level of the hierarchy may be absent in certain embodiments.

The entire range of data collected about an individual may be analogous to the entire genotype of an individual and particular combinations in the data patterns may be analogous to genes or collections of genes that code for particular traits. As with a particular genotype a particular lifeotype may code for or represent a particular set of traits. A lifeotype may change over time including reasons such random change reasons due to therapy such as behavior modification therapy reasons due to other changes in an individual s behavior how the individual interacts with his environment and vice verse and due to modifications or additions to the amount and type of information being collected about an individual. This process may be analogous to gene mutations and gene therapy in genetics. Regarding therapeutics the therapeutics process may be intentional or non intentional and or prescribed or self administered. The pool of data may be less than the total pool of data which may be analogous to sequencing less than all of the genetic code of an individual in genetics. Referring again to it may be possible to move in both directions in the hierarchies depicted in the figures. For example in the data or life bits may be determined from a life byte or lifeotype. In it may be possible to work from actionable information back to information.

In an embodiment a life bit may be body positional data such as sitting or standing. A related life byte may be standing more than sitting. This life byte may contribute to the determination of a lifeotype which may be characterized as one relating to the condition of varicose veins. In another embodiment the data may include financial and transaction data. The related life bits may include certain transactions and financial data. These life bits may be aggregated into a financial status life byte.

In another embodiment a particular lifeotype may be that of a depressive. The data on which this lifeotype is based may include survey data financial data transaction data medical data and sensor data. Sensors such as the type described in United States patent applications incorporated herein by reference provide sensed data from which a derivation could be made regarding an individual s activity level food intake mood and interaction with others. All of such sensed data in each patent application incorporated herein by reference is relevant to this and all other embodiments described herein. A relevant life bit may be composed of credit card purchases and a relevant life byte may reveal that the majority of purchases were online and few were at point of sale terminals thus revealing that the individual tends to stay in one location. The survey data may result in a life byte that indicates the individual is depressed. The sensor data may show that the individual spends most of his time in one location due to low levels of activity and that the individual has limited interaction with others. These factors together may be a lifeotype or marker for a depression analogous to a genetic marker or the genotype of an individual that is depressed.

In another embodiment a lifeotype may be a hypertensive diabetic runner. The data on which this lifeotype is based may include survey data medical data and sensor data. Certain of the relevant life bytes may include age related information bone density related information and a diabetic life byte. The values of these life bytes may indicate a high likelihood of hypertension and low bone density. The Platform may suggest additional data that should be collected for further investigation. A sensor may provide many activity life bits which may indicate an overall active life byte. The Platform may sequence the life bytes to find the lifeotype to be a runner with low bone density hypertension and diabetes.

In another embodiment a particular lifeotype may be that of an active diabetic. This lifeotype may be a 4 byte lifeotype where life byte is a glucose reading life byte is a pancreas function measurement of some kind life byte is total calories consumed in a day and life byte is total calories burned in exercise. Each byte may be composed of several life bits. In an embodiment total calories burned may be determined from life bits including activity level data as determined by sensor data and food intake data as determined from a survey or any of the systems devices or methods described in the patent application which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain of the life bytes may originate directly from the data such as glucose readings determined directly from a glucose meter. The resulting life bits and life bytes may be packaged into their own data structures such as a packet header

In an embodiment a lifeotype may be a pattern of behavior and sensed values that indicates that an individual is at a very high risk of becoming diabetic later in life. In an embodiment the lifeotype may be defined by four lifebytes. The first life byte may be composed of sensed health data life bits such as yearly blood pressure readings administered at a doctor s office and extracted from the individual s electronic medical record or personal health record. The second life byte may be residence data revealing that the individual lives in an urban area that is not conducive to year round exercise and that is characterized by very long commute times. The third life byte may consist of data from a medical record and may indicate that the individual is Mexican American and that two of the individual s four grandparents were diabetic before they died. The fourth life byte may consist of survey data and may indicate that the individual exercises very vigorously but only occasionally with a frequency of 1.2 times per week and only for average of 75 minutes each time. In an alternative embodiment a life byte may be that an individual is at a very high risk of becoming diabetic later in life and the life bits may be sensed health data residence data medical record data and survey data. In another embodiment the lifeotype may be related to diabetes hemorrhagic shock or hypertension. The data bits may related to genetic markers diagnoses plans for therapy sensed data regarding physical activity such as from a wearable device energy expenditure nutritional data and the like.

A genotype may be conceived of as an encoding of what may happen to a person through the process of developmental biology similar to a blueprint for a house. This genetic blueprint may also be thought of as the gold standard for the house the platonic house or the default house based on all of which variation will occur. The genotype may also set the basic rules for how that physical body will function in response to particular kinds of changes to that body. By analogy this may be like the house having a built in furnace and thermostat and being set to turn on the heat when the thermostat drops below a particular temperature.

A genotype may have various levels of abstractions that are useful to understand about the way that encoding that blueprint is translated into a physical system or the basic rules of operation of that physical system. A genotype in a human is made up of atoms but that is often too fine grained a level of detail and is not usually considered a useful way to talk about the genotype. The lowest level of abstraction normally used for a genotype are the base pairs that make it up A T C and G .

The state of your body at some point in the future may not entirely be determined by its genetic make up. Genetics may have over time only a minority impact on the state of a person s body. The other relevant elements may be the things that happen to a body. A simple illustrative example is as follows if a car side swipes a person and breaks the person s leg the body has changed dramatically and not because of genetics although genetics may affect the extent of the break the time to heal and the like . Similarly if a person eats too much over a long period of time and becomes obese this was not a fact solely related to the person s blue print genotype but of the complex web of cause and effect interactions that the person has with the world as the person lives his life although genetics may affect that person s interaction with the world such as by determining at least in part the effects that food has on the person s body . In one particular embodiment this data collected about a person that corresponds to the series of things that happens to a person or because of a person s choices which determines to a large extent what will happen to a person in the future can be thought of as a lifeotype. In certain embodiments a lifeotype may also include or be based on genetics related information as bits bytes life byte sequences etc. as well as any of the other information discussed herein.

Referring to in one particular embodiment like the human genotype the human lifeotype may have various levels of abstraction. In this particular embodiment at the lowest level the equivalent to the base pairs are all the facts of what happened to a person expressed in their raw sensed values. An example is as follows each key stroke that a person made at his her computer each acceleration a person s body experiences as it moves about daily life a person s heart rate at each minute of the day and the like. In this particular embodiment the equivalent to the alleles and their relative importance intron vs. extron may be the notion of a continuum from derived data through patterns of data. So for example thinking about many of the sensed values about a person s body not in isolation but taken together in a model of energy expended may be a derived lifeotype fact in this particular embodiment. In this particular embodiment at a higher level of derivation or pattern finding might be that over a period of time energy expenditure is high enough to qualify as an active person. And in this particular embodiment up at the level by analogy of a chromosome for a lifeotype may be the notion of the implication of major patterns of the data of your life upon the future state of your body. For example being an active person makes obesity diabetes depression and heart disease all some what less likely to occur to you. In this particular embodiment just like gene therapy is an attempt to improve a person s body in the future by changing some of the genetic blue print an individual could also receive a suggested change to his lifeotype that would tend to improve his body s future state as well. For example a person may not be an active person and if he was to exercise an additional 60 minutes per week raising him into the state of being an active person he is less likely to develop the following diseases within the next two decades . . . This type of suggested action may be an action type or A type. depicts a particular embodiment of a statistical model involving lifeotypes. In this embodiment conditional probabilities may be determined based on lifeotypes. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the analogies described herein are for illustrative purposes and should not serve to limit the meaning of terms described herein. None of the usages of the terms in the analogies or examples herein are intended to contradict the meaning of any term in this disclosure but rather as alternate meanings or nuanced meanings of the terms.

Referring to the data may include continuous or discrete data or any form of data that may be found along this spectrum. In an embodiment the data may be continuous temperature data and or a discrete measure such as a voltage. The data may include raw or derived data or any form of data that may be found along this spectrum. The raw data may be unprocessed. The derived data may be derived from the raw data other derived data or a combination of both. The data may be sensed by a body monitor and or a sensor which may be stationary wearable or implantable or any form that may be found along this spectrum. A stationary sensor may be housed in an item of fitness equipment such as a treadmill. A wearable sensor may be included as part of an arm band shirt or shoe. In an embodiment an implantable sensor may be a heart rate sensor implanted near the heart. Referring to a lifeotype may or may not be constructed from at least one item of discrete or continuous data raw or derived data and or data sensed by a body monitor and or sensor which may be stationary wearable or implantable. The inclusion of the subscript zeros in indicates that a particular level of the hierarchy may be absent in certain embodiments.

A lifeotype may be static or dynamic or may exist in a form found along this spectrum. That is a lifeotype may consist of data that is more static over time or data that is more dynamic over time. A lifeotype may be high resolution or low resolution or may exist in a form along this spectrum. That is a lifeotype may consist of a variety of life bytes life bits and data which would make it a lifeotype of a higher resolution when compared to a lifeotype that is based on relatively few life bytes life bits and data instances. A static lifeotype and a high resolution lifeotype may respond in similar ways to changes in the data on which each is based. This behavior similarity may be due to a greater number and variety of life bytes life bits and data instances being involved so it requires a greater change in the underlying factors and data to produce a change at the lifeotype level. A dynamic lifeotype and a low resolution lifeotype may respond in similar ways to changes in the data on which each is based. This behavior similarity may be due to a lower number and low variety of life bytes life bits and data instances being involved so it requires only a change in one or a few values of the underlying factors and data to produce a change at the lifeotype level. In embodiments a low resolution and or dynamic lifeotypes or the life byte sequences life bytes life bits and or data upon which they are based may include angry aroused tired fatigued current spending location restless stressed and the like. In embodiments a high resolution and or static lifeotypes or the life byte sequences life bytes life bits and or data upon which they are based may include depressed addict diabetic type I and II insomniac cardiac condition and the like. In certain embodiments a high resolution lifeotype may change rapidly over time and a low resolution lifeotype may change more slowly over time. Lifeotypes can be true or representative at specific points or ranges of time in a person s life. Lifeotypes may reflect different time scales.

The Platform may be able to determine and or display the direction of a lifeotype. In this way the direction of trend of a lifeotype and or group of lifeotypes can be determined. This information may be useful for identifying and or predicting changes in high resolution and or static lifeotypes. In an embodiment due to the possibly variable nature of a low resolution and or dynamic lifeotypes such lifeotypes may be conceived of or reported with a tolerance band based on related trend information and predictions. In another embodiment the trend information and predictions may be useful in predicting emergencies in connection with low resolution and or dynamic lifeotypes and disease states in connection with high resolution and or static lifeotypes. Lifeotype trend information including trend directions may be useful for treating certain conditions for which certain parameters need to be kept in a certain range. In an embodiment certain lifeotypes of bipolar individuals may need to be kept within a certain range for a certain parameter such as mood or endorphin levels. Using the trend direction functionality it may be possible to affect the trend as the lifeotype value approaches the boundary of the range.

Identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying parameters that may be sensed. This may largely be determined by what is available. Identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying parameters that may be derived. This will be determined at least in part by what is useful for other applications. Identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying patterns in the derived data. In an embodiment the pattern may be many nights of low sleep as a pattern of prolonged sleep deprivation. In an embodiment the pattern may be many exercise events per week being called an active person. In an embodiment the pattern may be more than 4 hours of exercise per day being identified as an exercise bulimic. In an embodiment the steps for identifying lifeotypes may involve identifying what is it about the world that is desired to be understood or predicted. For example information concerning prolonged sleep deprivation. The next step may be determining if there are patterns in the derived data that can be discovered through human intervention and description automatic discovery by a computer or both. The relationship of the patterns in the derived data to the topic to be understood may then be assessed. If there is a strong relationship the analysis may be sufficient. If there is not a strong relationship the analysis may involve determining if there are new derivable parameters that would be of assistance. If the data is available these parameters may be added and the steps repeated. If this data is not available it may be requested or surrogates may be identified. If this can not be done or the raw data is not available then the question may be asked what could be added to the raw data pool i.e. what new parameters could be directly sensed or calculated or gathered in some way such that the analysis can be performed If such a set of new raw values in would help and could be gathered then either add them or do what it takes i.e. adding the sensors to new body monitors so that at some point in the future the data will have these new values and the process can be repeated.

In an embodiment lifeotypes may be created identified discovered and the like by a lifeotype discovery module. The lifeotype discovery module may utilize a novelty detector for example in the domain where physiological data is collected and a large body of such data exists for many individuals. Any variable that for some subset of individuals is statistically outside the norms for the population could be of interest. In an embodiment for a large dataset an infinite number of features may be defined of varying complexity. This continuum can be thought of as starting with single variable reports about an individual e.g. their average daily physical activity is low to relative measures e.g. their average daily physical activity is low for their age to complex pattern based interactions e.g. their daily physical activity after a night of poor sleep is high for their age . The Platform may determine which lifeotypes have utility. In one embodiment the lifeotypes selected may be those that have some predictive power with respect to other lifeotypes as determined by an analysis module.

In an embodiment feature discovery may proceed by starting with the simplest single variable features e.g. total values per day of sleep energy expenditure or physical activity and the like and examining whether statistically significant relationships exist to other measures of interest e.g. health outcomes disease states weight loss stress level and the like . The user may set up these different classes of lifeotypes e.g. input and output or the Platform may try all pairs. In this example only features that are sufficiently strongly correlated would become true or saved lifeotypes.

In this way the Platform can make specific predictions about individuals from specific sources and types of data which the Platform itself has determined to be optimal.

In an embodiment the analysis may include identifying high value lifeotypes. The Platform may examine a library of lifeotypes as a model of the world with probabilistic outcomes and perform behavior learning using any of a number of techniques to produce an optimal strategy to obtain a desired outcome. As an example for a particular individual say a 35 year old smoker who also exercises vigorously three times a week and eats poorly the system may analyze the particular lifeotype and determine that the most useful and likely to be successful strategy would be to cut back on smoking by 50 and eat better rather than quitting smoking entirely. The system may determine this by considering many different action strategies using the stored data to simulate the effects and searching over the action space to find an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning and the class of program search strategies may also allow the solution of this behavior optimization strategy.

Lifeotypes may be based on relative measures. There may be relative lifeotypes relative life bytes and relative life bits.
