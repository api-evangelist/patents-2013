title: Method of matching hedge funds and investors and apparatus therefor
abstract: A method for matching a hedge fund and a hedge fund investor, and apparatus therefore, may utilize databases that may be searched by search engines. The databases and the search engines may be accessed using a website. Information regarding the investor may be stored in one database and information relating to the hedge fund may be separately stored in the other database. An investor may access the search engine associated with the database containing hedge fund information to identify hedge funds that may be relevant to that investor. Likewise, a hedge fund may access the search engine associated with the database containing investor information to identify qualified investors that may be interested in the hedge fund.

This Application is a Continuation of application Ser. No. 11 915 253 filed on Dec. 12 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 468 078 which is a National Stage of Application PCT US2006 019910 which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60 683 586 filed on May 23 2005 the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.

The present invention is directed to the hedge fund industry. More particularly the invention is directed to a method and associated apparatus that may allow direct interaction and information flow between hedge funds or types of investment vehicles or entities and investors in those funds or types of investment vehicles or entities . The method may use dual search engines one of which may permit a hedge fund to review a database of qualified investors and identify investors that match certain criteria. The other search engine may enable a qualified investor to review a database of hedge funds and identify a hedge fund that matches the investor s criteria. Therefore the method may permit hedge fund agents direct access to investors and may also permit qualified investors to gain access to detailed hedge fund information and agents.

A hedge fund is a form of investment vehicle that may be used by certain individuals and institutions to engage in aggressive and or speculative investment activity not open to ordinary mutual funds. Indeed the offering memorandum of many hedge funds allows those funds to use a combination of sophisticated investment strategies such as taking both long and short positions using leverage and derivatives and investing in many markets in an effort to secure a higher return on investment. However in return for the ability to adopt these aggressive investment positions hedge funds are made subject to significant oversight and regulation. For example hedge funds are not permitted to advertise and hedge fund investors must meet certain legal requirements. These investors must also be able to establish certain financial criteria and are presumed to be sufficiently knowledgeable to understand the risks related to hedge fund investing. Many hedge funds also have extremely high minimum investment amounts ranging from 250 000 to well over 1 million and the managers of hedge funds may charge significant fees and commissions for their services.

Investor participation in hedge funds appears to be growing however the rate of such growth could be increased. One factor that may be holding back growth in the hedge fund market may be current market conditions wherein there exists a wide variety of available funds but a relatively small group of available qualified investors. Stated differently the market presently features an array of different hedge funds from which an investor may choose. However the high minimum dollar amounts required to invest in hedge funds will generally mean that the pool of qualified investors available to participate in any given hedge fund is relatively small. Accordingly to simulate growth in hedge fund investing means need to be developed whereby this finite group of investors can be matched with appropriate hedge fund opportunities.

Past methods of connecting eligible investors with funds of interest to those investors may be unfruitful and are typically very expensive. These prior methods included the hedge funds retaining third party marketing firms to find qualified investors. Indeed hiring such a firm may be critical to a funds success since as mentioned above hedge funds are not permitted to advertise. However these third party firms are extremely expensive with some charging up to 20 in perpetuity of all fee on money raised by the firm. Therefore it would be desirable to provide a method to match hedge funds and hedge fund investors that is controlled discrete and allows for an easy exchange of ideas and information in a confidential and secure environment at a low cost.

Concerning potentially related art Published U.S. Patent Application Nos. 2002 0087506 2002 0087446 2002 0087450 and 2003 0101115 are directed to methods for matching inventors with entrepreneurs. Further U.S. Pat. No. 7 013 291 is directed to a Financial Instrument Filtering System and Method Therefor and describes a method wherein a user first selects certain filter criteria including an investment parameter . This filter criterion is then matched against a database of financial instruments. Once matched the user receives a histogram based on the output data.

The method concerns the hedge fund industry where investors may desire access to a broad range of investment opportunities and hedge funds may desire more efficient and effective access to investors and investor capital without the help of expensive intermediaries. Specifically the method may allow direct interaction and may provide subject to certain safeguards unobstructed flow of information between a hedge fund s and an investor s . In the method a hedge fund may be charged a fee to gain access to an investor s in a manner that may also result in no commission on the back end. The method may also permit investors to gain access to detailed information on hedge funds. The method may be implemented using dual search engines or the like that may allow hedge funds to contact a database of qualified investors that match the fund search criteria. The method may also use the search engines to enable investors to search for hedge funds that match the investor s specific parameters. The search engines databases and related information may be stored on one or more computer servers. Access to the search engines and databases may be provided though a single website or other form of communication portal that may itself be accessed globally via the Internet or like global computer network

A method for matching or otherwise connecting hedge fund s and hedge fund investor s may utilize two databases that may be searched by two separate search engines each search engine being associated with one of the databases. Further the databases and the search engines may be accessed using a single website or other communication portal. The search engines databases and website may reside on one or more computer servers. Information concerning the investor s may be stored in one database and information relating to the hedge fund s may be stored in the other database. An investor or agent thereof may access the search engine associated with the database containing hedge fund information to identify a hedge fund s that may be of interest to the investor. Likewise a hedge fund or agent thereof may access the search engine associated with the database containing investor information to identify a qualified investor s that may be interested in the hedge fund. An investor s may be permitted access to the hedge fund information database for a fee or at no cost. Hedge funds may also be permitted to access to the investor information database for a fee or at no cost.

Referring now to a method for matching or otherwise connecting a hedge fund s and agents thereof with a hedge fund investor s or agents thereof may include two databases that may be searched by two search engines each search engine being associated with one of the databases . The databases and the search engines may be accessed though a single website or communication portal. However it will be appreciated that two separate websites or portals may be used with each website being associated with one of the search engines . Information concerning an investor may be stored in one database and information relating to the hedge fund may be separately stored in the other database . Notably while the information in the other database will be generally described herein a specifically directed to hedge funds and hedge fund entities it will also be appreciated that information on other alternative or additional investment vehicles and entities may also be stored in the other database . For example the other database may include information on hedge funds Fund of Funds Commodity Trading Advisor CTA and other types of financial entities. An investor or agent thereof may use the search engine associated with the database containing hedge fund information to identify a hedge fund that may be of interest to the investor. Likewise a hedge fund or agent thereof may access the search engine associated with the database containing investor information to identify a qualified investor that may be interested in the hedge fund.

The search engines the databases and the website or communication portal may be resident on a computer server not shown that may be accessed remotely via an intranet Internet or a global computer network. These elements may also be resident on a handheld electronic device e.g. a PDA or handheld computing device a laptop computer or other manner of portable electronic device such that they may be directly accessed by a user on an as needed basis. Further the website search engines the databases may be accessed by investors investor agents and hedge fund agents using PCs computer servers handheld devices and the like via an intranet or a global computer network.

Referring now to the method may included a step whereby upon visiting the website or other manner of communication portal participating investors and hedge funds are first prompted to 

Further if the investor or hedge fund has already entered hedge fund or investor information into the appropriate database or the hedge fund or investor may be permitted use of an appropriate search engine to perform a search of the hedge fund or investor information on the database according to pre selected parameters.

More specifically and still referring now to investors and hedge funds may each access the website or portal wherein if the participant is previously registered participant is prompted to log in using a username and password. All registered participants may also be required to agree to a user or service agreement each time they access the website or portal. If the participant has not previously registered with the website the participant may be required to register or otherwise indicate if they are an investor or a hedge fund. For example separate pull down menus not shown may be provided for investor participants and hedge fund participants. Next for first time participants a questionnaire or template for the entry of data screens may be provided again through the use of dropdown menus. Upon being presented with a template the investor or hedge fund may be prompted to enter the information required for registration.

For example in the case of an unregistered investor the investor may be prompted to enter the following information categories are shown in capital letters and potential selections for each category are provided under each category 

Alternatively in the case of a new hedge fund participant the agents thereof may be prompted to enter the following information categories are shown in capital letters and possible selections for each category are provided under each category 

Still referring now to a third party service provider may be provided to establish the authenticity reliability or trustworthiness of the information entered into either the hedge fund template or the investor template . Examples of service providers include in house review personnel and outside agencies such as law firms financial investment firms and credit agencies. A system administrator may also be provided to monitor use of the website search engines and databases and control access thereto. Alternatively the service provider and the system administrator may combined into a single entity. The Administrator may hide i.e. render unsearchable or remove hedge fund and or investor profiles from a database on an as needed basis.

Still referring now to following an investor s entry of information into a questionnaire or template the investor may be required to consent to the terms of service provider agreement. Then the template information may be forwarded to a service provider who may then determine whether the investor is legally or otherwise qualified to invest in a high risk investment such as a hedge fund. If the service provider determines that an investor is not a qualified investor the investor is not permitted access hedge fund database and may be exited denied entry or otherwise removed from the system. The investor may also be notified why they were rejected. If the investor is a qualified investor the investor may be prompted to enter investor contact information and investor profile information. The investor profile information may include the information previously provided by the investor in the questionnaire or template . Alternatively the investor profile may include a combination of questionnaire or template information and additional information requested by the administrator . Once the investor contact information is entered the administrator may receive notice that there is a pending investor. The administrator may then contact the investor and review the investor s profile information to discern whether the investor will be granted access to the system i.e. further access website or to the hedge fund search engine . For security the administrator may issue an approved investor a temporary user name and password for entrance to the website or search engine . The investor may then use the temporary user name and password to gain access to a personal page for the investor that contains all the information that the investor has entered and allows access to the hedge fund information database. All contact and template information entered by the investor may also be transferred into the database of investor information to function as the profile for that investor.

Still referring now to regarding the hedge fund following entry of information into the questionnaire or template the hedge fund may select a level of service . These levels of service may include limitations on the number of investor profiles a hedge fund may access over a given period of time. For example depending on the level of service a hedge fund may be granted the ability to review a total of 180 investor profiles or more depending for example on the number of investor profiles in the database . However the hedge fund may also be restricted or otherwise capped to between 10 20 investor reviews per month. Further examples of hedge fund service levels are set forth below 

The number of available investor profile views may be rolled over each month or may be non cumulative. Investor profile views may also be time sensitive such that any the views are cancelled after a period of time if not used e.g. annually .

Further the hedge funds may also be provided with additional services depending on the level of service . For example the hedge funds may be provided with the ability to contact one or more investors quickly using a virtual business card VBC . A VBC is an e mail message containing the hedge fund contact information the fund logo and a short personal note prepared by the hedge fund. The VBC may be sent directly to an inbox provided for the investor as part of the investor s personal page . Additional features may also include customizable investor searches book marking of targeted investors customization of a marketing page that is viewable by investors with company logo and website link the ability to upload marketing materials to a hedge fund personal page or the marketing page the ability to post and update performance statistics on a personal page the ability to participate in capital introduction events depending upon the level of service and the use of a customer relationship management CRM system. Using the CRM a hedge fund may create electronic folders on its personal page. The folders may permit the hedge fund to store information on investors the hedge fund has sourced and the ability to write notes related to each investor. Accordingly the CRM may allow for very efficient sorting and organizational processing for the hedge fund.

After the hedge fund selects a level of service the hedge fund may be asked to consent to a service agreement if available and undergo review related to the use of the website search engine and database . If the hedge fund agrees to accept the service agreement it is prompted to provide contact information specific details about the fund and then to enter payment information to pay for any fees. For example the hedge fund may be accessed a weekly monthly or annual subscription fee to access the website etc.

Still referring to as with a new investor following entry of the above information and payment information the hedge fund information may be forwarded to a service provider for legal approval and then to an administrator for further personal contact and information review. If approved the hedge fund may be issued a temporary user name and password and permitted access to the website etc once the service period begins. Further similar to the investors all contact and template information entered by the hedge fund may also be transferred into the database of hedge fund information to function as the profile for that hedge fund.

Still referring to and turning again to investors once admitted to the website and provided with a personal page the investor may access the search engine associate with the hedge fund database . Specifically the investor may initiate a search of the above described hedge fund template information . Following each search the investor may be provided with a list of applicable hedge funds. The investor may then designate a particular hedge fund profile on the list to obtain basic information about the fund and may also access the hedge fund s virtual marketing page. The investor may also open and view the hedge fund s uploaded marketing materials on the hedge fund marketing page and may add the fund to a list of book marked funds on the investor s personal page .

Still referring to an investor may be permitted free use of the search engine to search through the hedge fund database and to screen hedge funds profiles before contacting hedge funds using intra system email or other contact information provided in the hedge fund profile bookmark hedge funds create a personal watch list of potential future investments perform due diligence on hedge funds in a discrete manner post investment criteria about the investor for hedge funds to see. Investors may limit the number of hedge funds that may view their full investor profile on any given day week or month. For example the investor s profile may include a code whereby that profile may be view no more than five 5 times per day. Finally investors may also be granted complementary and priority access to capital introduction cap intro events sponsored by hedge funds. Notably these cap intro events may be recorded and made available on the hedge fund marketing page for review investors. However it will be appreciated that access to the recording of a cap intro event may be restricted to only certain investors.

Still referring to the hedge fund is permitted access to a search engine that allows it to input data regarding the investor type about which the hedge fund would like information. The search engine may then select investor profiles according to the search criteria and may also provide a hedge fund agent with an initial list of annotated investor profiles. An annotated investor profile may include a limited about of information concerning the investor as a means of informing the hedge fund if that investor is worth a full review. For example an annotated profile may include the investor entity type information i.e. institution type or individual and basic information concerning that investor s manner or style of investing e.g. long short only . For purposes of privacy and or security the investors name or other contact information may be omitted from the annotated investor profile. The hedge fund may then review the list of annotated investor profiles that were identify from the search and the search and the search criteria and select specific investor profiles for a full review. When the hedge fund agent accesses a full investor profile that selection may be counted against the hedge funds total number of investor profile views per month. Further in those instances wherein a hedge fund agent is provided with a large under of annotated investor profiles the hedge fund may store a link to selected annotated profiles or otherwise highlight or identify selected annotated profiles for subsequent review. Accordingly when the hedge fund agent is presented with a large number of annotated investor profiles potentially relevant profiles from the larger list may be set aside during an initial review of the larger list into a virtual radar screen or database for a later analysis.

As mentioned above the hedge fund may be permitted to access a limited number of full investor profiles depending upon the level of service selected. For example each time a hedge fund agent accesses a full investor profile to obtain specific information a record of that access is recorded stored and compared to the number of investor profile review permitted by the service level selected by the hedge fund. Capping the number of full investor profiles that a hedge fund may review on for example a monthly basis functions as a barrier to a hedge fund being able to copy or otherwise download all the investor profiles in the database . Investor privacy is thereby reinforced.

Once a hedge fund accesses a full investor profile the hedge fund may then be permitted to send a virtual business card to the investor s e mail address and write a personal message. In response to a VBC the investor may receive a picture of the virtual business card along with the personal message by e mail. The hedge Fund may also save its search criteria or begin new searches with different criteria.

Regarding further operation of the CRM discussed above when a hedge fund accesses an investor profile an electronic link hyperlink or like electronic connection or tag to that profile may be stored in a My Investors file on the hedge fund personal page . Additionally or alternatively in response to the hedge fund accessing an investor s profile an electronic link or record etc. of that access may be stored on in log file on the investor s personal page . Thus the method of the present invention particular the CRM function may assist investors and hedge funds to organize the information each participate in sourcing.

Finally both hedge funds and investors are permitted access to list of outside service providers. These outside service providers may include Attorneys Compliance Conference Planners Consultants Internet Services Marketing Services Prime Brokers Research Providers and Soft Dollar Brokers who may list their services on the website for a monthly fee. For example the outside services providers may be access using a dropdown menu from the home page. When registering with the website to become a listed outside service provider the outside service provider may be prompted to register the business by entering information about the business to make payment for the listing. The service provider may then provide with a username and password that allows them to access the information that is stored on the website and displayed so that they can edit the information.

Thus is described a novel business method of allowing hedge funds to search for investors and investors to search for hedge funds. The business method provides a safe secure and confidential way of sourcing hedge fund investors at a very low cost.

Having thus described the method of the present invention various other embodiments while not identical to the embodiment s described above will become apparent to those of skill in the art that are nevertheless within the scope of the several claims.
