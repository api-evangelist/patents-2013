Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly configure and control gaming contests.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.

This description of the embodiments is divided into six sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example embodiments while the fifth section describes additional example operating environments. The sixth section presents some general comments.

A casino is interested in providing any type of feature that makes their establishment unique or preferred. For instance in an attempt to promote good will and to entice player loyalty some casinos provide complimentaries or comps to some patrons. Complimentaries are free items that the casino gives to its customers as a reward for their business. Complimentaries are typically funded by a casino s promotional budget. Complimentaries typically include promotional or marketing items such as free hats and pens. Complimentaries may also include free food free room free beverages etc. Some casinos also provide contests such as raffles which are funded by promotional dollars.

Casinos however are cautious about giving complimentaries or having promotional contests that are funded directly from gaming wagers. Many jurisdictional rules and regulations as well as accounting complexities or tax implications arise when funding a casino contest directly from game wagers. Some types of wagering games called progressives create a contest that takes a portion of wagers and puts the portions into a pot that a player can win as a jackpot. However casinos do not themselves fund those games but rather the funds that are taken from the wagers are held in trust for a game player and must be paid out to a player according to many jurisdictional rules and regulations. Therefore a casino s options for providing its own funds for a contest or promotion are limited to giving away complimentaries having a raffle etc.

Some embodiments of the inventive subject matter however provide a way for casino operators to calculate a projected or theoretical amount of money a virtual expected value that the casino would have earned from game wagers for a given period of time withdraw an amount of money equivalent to the virtual expected value from a source of funds that are not funded by game wagers e.g. from a promotional account and utilize the amount of money as a prize for a gaming contest. Further some embodiments utilize features of wagering games and wagering game machines e.g. gaming displays gaming elements gaming events etc. for the gaming contest but do not extract money from wagers made for the wagering games or from the wagering game machines to fund the gaming contest.

The gaming contest controller receives input from a casino operator e.g. an administrative user . The input can include various values that relate to variables of a gaming contest. For example the variables can be used to determine a theoretical amount of money virtual EV that could be accumulated if portions or contributions of wagers were to be taken from one or more wagering games played in a casino e.g. from wagering games played on the wagering game machines and . In other words the virtual EV is a projected value that a casino would have earned via game play from wagers placed at the wagering game machines or the values of the variables. The variables may include a duration that a gaming contest runs a theoretical percentage of money taken from the wagers specific gaming contest parameters past gaming conditions etc. The past gaming conditions may be for example an average amount of bets placed per machine for a past time period an average number of active machines for a past time period etc. The specific gaming contest parameters may include wagering game events that trigger a winning outcome for the gaming contest. The triggers or events occur via the wagering game machines or e.g. events that occur as a result of activity from the wagering game machines events associated with games played on the wagering game machines events that are presented using the wagering game machines etc. .

At stage A using the values for the variables described above the gaming contest controller can calculate a value for the virtual EV and initiate a gaming contest that has a prize value equivalent to the value for the virtual EV. The gaming contest controller can utilize a virtual EV calculator to calculate the virtual EV. The prize value for the gaming contest however is not taken from wagers of wagering games. Instead the gaming contest controller allocates an amount of promotional funds from a promotional account equivalent to the virtual EV. below illustrate further examples of calculating a virtual EV.

At stage B the gaming contest controller tracks and analyzes gaming activity that occurs on the wagering game machines or for the specific triggers or events associated with the gaming contest. The gaming contest controller can also at stage B present indications on a display of a presentation device . The indications on the display indicate wagering game players for or to which one or more of the triggers of the gaming contest occurred via the wagering game machines or . For example the gaming contest controller can track some minor win events or count a number of events that occur before a big win event occurs. For instance the gaming contest controller can specify as a condition of the gaming contest that the fifth player to receive pair of pocket aces during poker games played at any of the wagering game machines or other wagering game machines in a casino network will win the gaming contest. The gaming contest controller can post on the display the players that attain that pocket aces in order. As each player receives pocket aces the system can provide minor win prizes that are also funded by the promotional account . The value of the minor prizes can be subtracted from the virtual EV. For instance the EV calculator may have projected a virtual EV of 150 and allocated the 150 from the promotional account as the prize for the gaming contest. The gaming contest controller can divide the 150 and award portions of the 150 in cash or other prizes e.g. the first player to get pocket aces wins a cap a second player to get pocket aces wins five game credits a third player to get pocket aces wins ten entries for a long standing bonus game the fourth player to get pocket aces wins 10 and the fifth player will win 100 where the cap the five game credits the ten entries the 10 and the 100 have an equivalent value of 150 .

At stage C the gaming contest controller can verify that a final trigger or event e.g. a major winning trigger occurs to or at one of the wagering game machines or . For example a player that plays at the wagering game machine is the fifth player since the gaming contest began to get a pair of pocket aces i.e. the two Ace cards assigned to the player of the primary wagering game during one hand of poker . The gaming contest controller presents a message e.g. congratulatory message that indicates that a player at the wagering game machine just won the gaming contest.

At stage D the gaming contest controller debits or withdraws an amount of funds from the promotional account and credits or deposits the amount of the funds into a player account for the winner of the gaming contest e.g. withdraws one hundred dollars 100 from the promotional account and deposits the amount into the player account that belongs to the player M. Miller logged in to the wagering game machine . The gaming contest controller may also withdraw smaller amounts or provide other prizes to other player accounts from the promotional account for the minor prizes i.e. for the first to fourth occurrences of the pocket aces since the gaming contest began . The wagering game machine can update a credit balance for the player account as indicated by the credit meter .

Further even though the funds for the gaming contest are not from game wagers the gaming contest controller can utilize features of wagering game applications wagering game machines or other gaming network elements. For example at stage C the gaming contest controller detected that a gaming element e.g. the cards presented in the primary wagering game presented a specific value or configuration. Further at stage C the gaming contest controller presented the congratulatory message via the display on the wagering game machine . The display may be a graphical user interface a window a shared display area etc. associated with the primary wagering game or the secondary wagering game . Further the gaming contest controller updated the credit meter that shows the account balance for the player account . The game elements for the primary wagering game the display and the credit meter are all part of or integrated with the primary wagering game or the wagering game machine .

Further some embodiments of the inventive subject matter describe examples of configuring and controlling gaming contests in a network wagering venue e.g. an online casino a wagering game website a wagering network etc. using a communication network such as the communications network in . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network that provides access to wagering games such as a public network e.g. a public wide area network such as the Internet a private network e.g. a private local area network gaming network a file sharing network a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. .

Further in some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling. 

Although describes some embodiments the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.

This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a wagering game server configured to control wagering game content provide random numbers and communicate wagering game information account information and other information to and from a wagering game machine . The wagering game server can include a content controller configured to manage and control content for presentation on the wagering game machine . For example the content controller can generate game results e.g. win loss values including win amounts for games played on the wagering game machine . The content controller can communicate the game results to the wagering game machine . The content controller can also generate random numbers and provide them to the wagering game machine so that the wagering game machine can generate game results. The wagering game server can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the wagering game machine . The wagering game server can also include an account manager configured to control information related to player accounts. For example the account manager can communicate wager amounts game results amounts e.g. win amounts bonus game amounts etc. to the account server . The wagering game server can also include a communication unit configured to communicate information to the wagering game machine and to communicate with other systems devices and networks. The wagering game server can also include a gaming contest controller configured to compute a virtual expected value for a gaming contest and fund the contest via a non wager source of funds.

The wagering game system architecture can also include the wagering game machine configured to present wagering games and receive and transmit information to coordinate present and control portions of a gaming contest according to some embodiments. The wagering game machine can include a content controller configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the wagering game machine . The wagering game machine can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the wagering game machine . The wagering game machine can also include an application management module configured to manage multiple instances of gaming applications. For example the application management module can be configured to launch load unload and control applications and instances of applications. The application management module can launch different software players e.g. a Microsoft Silverlight Player an Adobe Flash Player etc. and manage coordinate and prioritize what the software players do. The application management module can also coordinates instances of the server applications in addition to local copies of applications. The application management module can control window locations on a wagering game screen or display for the multiple gaming applications. In some embodiments the application management module can manage window locations on multiple displays including displays on devices associated with and or external to the wagering game machine e.g. a top display and a bottom display on the wagering game machine a peripheral device connected to the wagering game machine a mobile device connected to the wagering game machine etc. . The application management module can manage priority or precedence of client applications that compete for the same display area. For instance the application management module can determine each client application s precedence. The precedence may be static i.e. set only when the client application first launches or connects or dynamic. The applications may provide precedence values to the application management module which the application management module can use to establish order and priority. The precedence or priority values can be related to tilt events administrative events primary game events e.g. hierarchical levels etc. secondary game events local bonus game events advertising events etc. As each client application runs it can also inform the application management module of its current presentation state. The applications may provide presentation state values to the application management module which the application management module can use to evaluate and assess priority. Examples of presentation states may include celebration states e.g. indicates that client application is currently running a win celebration playing states e.g. indicates that the client application is currently playing game starting states e.g. indicates that the client application is showing an invitation or indication that a game is about to start status update states e.g. indicates that the client application is not playing but has a change of status that should be annunciated such as a change in progressive meter values or a change in a bonus game multiplier idle states e.g. indicates that the client application is idle etc. In some embodiments the application management module can be pre configurable. The system can provide controls and interfaces for operators to control screen layouts and other presentation features for the configuring the application management module . The application management module can communicate with and or be a communication mechanism for a base game stored on a wagering game machine. For example the application management module can communicate events from the base game such as the base game state pay line status bet amount status etc. The application management module can also provide events that assist and or restrict the base game such as providing bet amounts from secondary gaming applications inhibiting play based on gaming event priority etc. The application management module can also communicate some or all financial information between the base game and other applications including amounts wagered amounts won base game outcomes etc. The application management module can also communicate pay table information such as possible outcomes bonus frequency etc.

In some embodiments the application management module can control different types of applications. For example the application management module can perform rendering operations for presenting applications of varying platforms formats environments programming languages etc. For example the application management module can be written in one programming language format e.g. JavaScript Java C etc. but can manage and communicate data from applications that are written in other programming languages or that communicate in different data formats e.g. Adobe Flash Microsoft Silverlight Adobe Air hyper text markup language etc. . The application management module can include a portable virtual machine capable of generating and executing code for the varying platforms formats environments programming languages etc. The application management module can enable many to many messaging distribution and can enable the multiple applications to communicate with each other in a cross manufacturer environment at the client application level. For example multiple gaming applications on a wagering game machine may need to coordinate many different types of gaming and casino services events e.g. financial or account access to run spins on the base game and or run side bets transacting drink orders tracking player history and player loyalty points etc. . The wagering game machine can also include a gaming contest module configured to receive gaming contest control information from the gaming contest controller present gaming contest content and receive user input related to the gaming contest.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a secondary content server configured to provide content and control information for secondary games and other secondary content available on a wagering game network e.g. secondary wagering game content promotions content advertising content player tracking content web content etc. . The secondary content server can provide secondary content or content for secondary games presented on the wagering game machine . Secondary in some embodiments can refer to an application s importance or priority of the data. In some embodiments secondary can refer to a distinction or separation from a primary application e.g. separate application files separate content separate states separate functions separate processes separate programming sources separate processor threads separate data separate control separate domains etc. . Nevertheless in some embodiments secondary content and control can be passed between applications e.g. via application protocol interfaces thus becoming or falling under the control of primary content or primary applications and vice versa. In some embodiments the secondary content can be in one or more different formats such as Adobe Flash Microsoft Silverlight Adobe Air hyper text markup language etc. In some embodiments the secondary content server can provide and control content for community games including networked games social games competitive games or any other game that multiple players can participate in at the same time. In some embodiments the secondary content server can control and present an online website that hosts wagering games. The secondary content server can also be configured to present multiple wagering game applications on the wagering game machine via a wagering game website or other gaming type venue accessible via the Internet. The secondary content server can host an online wagering website and or a social networking website. The secondary content server can include other devices servers mechanisms etc. that provide functionality e.g. controls web pages applications etc. that web users can use to connect to a social networking application and or website and utilize social networking and website features e.g. communications mechanisms applications etc. . The secondary content server can also be configured to compute a virtual expected value for a gaming contest given user inputs and fund the contest via a non wager source of funds. For example the secondary content server may include the gaming contest controller in addition to or instead of the wagering game server . In some embodiments the secondary content server can also host social networking accounts provide social networking content control social networking communications store associated social contacts etc. The secondary content server can also provide chat functionality for a social networking website a chat application or any other social networking communications mechanism. In some embodiments the secondary content server can utilize player data to determine marketing promotions that may be of interest to a player account. The secondary content server can also analyze player data and generate analytics for players group players into demographics integrate with third party marketing services and devices etc. The secondary content server can also provide player data to third parties that can use the player data for marketing.

Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via a communications network . However some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example the wagering game server can also be configured to perform functions of the application management module the secondary content server and other network elements and or system devices. Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices as in the configurations shown in or other configurations not shown. For example the account manager and the communication unit can be included in the wagering game machine instead of or in addition to being a part of the wagering game server . Further in some embodiments the wagering game machine can determine wagering game outcomes generate random numbers etc. instead of or in addition to the wagering game server .

The wagering game machines described herein e.g. wagering game machine can take any suitable form such as floor standing models handheld mobile units bar top models workstation type console models surface computing machines etc. Further wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games or can include non dedicated devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants personal computers etc.

In some embodiments wagering game machines and wagering game servers work together such that wagering game machines can be operated as thin thick or intermediate clients. For example one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the wagering game machines client or the wagering game servers server . Game play elements can include executable game code lookup tables configuration files game outcome audio or visual representations of the game game assets or the like. In a thin client example the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets while the wagering game machines can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user e.g. player . In a thick client example the wagering game machines can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player s account.

In some embodiments either the wagering game machines client or the wagering game server s can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally e.g. by the wagering game server s or locally e.g. by the wagering game machines . Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management presentation of advertising software or firmware updates system quality or security checks etc.

Furthermore the wagering game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the wagering game machines servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable storage media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

Returning momentarily to the flow continues at processing block where the system detects data for gaming activity that occurred during a past time period on a wagering game network. For example in the contest duration controls and specify a value of one hour for a duration of the gaming contest the sampling period controls and specify a sampling period of gaming activity over the last 30 minutes and the rake percentage control specifies a rake percentage value of two percent 2 . The system detects gaming activity for the past time period i.e. for the last 30 minutes . Examples of gaming activity may include for instance 1 an average bet per game for the sampling period e.g. average bet of 0.60 per game and 2 an average rate of play for the sampling period e.g. 10 games per minute .

The flow continues at processing block where the system computes a virtual EV of a contest prize based on the values for the variables and based on the data for the gaming activity. In for instance the system that presents the graphical user interface controls a virtual EV calculator calculator that can compute the values of the previously mentioned variables using data for specific gaming activity conditions for the given sampling period. A calculation button initiates the calculation. In one embodiment the system may utilize the formula specified in where a value of an average dollar amount per bet e.g. 0.60 bet is multiplied by a value of an average number of games per minute e.g. 104 games per minute which is multiplied by a value for the contest duration period e.g. 120 minutes which if further multiplied by a value for the virtual rake percentage e.g. 0.02 or 2 which produces a value for the virtual EV of approximately 150.

The system can initiate the gaming contest immediately based on projected values. For example in the system calculates the value of the virtual EV and modifies the calculation button to be a start button which a casino operator can utilize to initiate the gaming contest. In some embodiments the system can automatically run the gaming contest when the variable settings are satisfied. In other words the system can wait and initiate the gaming contest when the value of the virtual EV would have been earned attained if funded by the games e.g. wait for 120 minutes and check to see whether the value of the virtual EV was earned before initiating the gaming contest .

Further the second section of the graphical user interface includes additional controls to specify values of contest parameters that indicate events in wagering games that trigger one or more results of the gaming contest. The additional controls in the second section for example include an event type control and a game type control . The event type control can specify one of multiple types of events that result in a winning outcome of the gaming contest. The types of events may be for example one or more of the following 

Referring still to the second section also includes a game type control . The game type control receives user input that will expand the gaming contest across multiple types of games. The system can be programmed with math models and theoretical probabilities of a probable occurrence of a triggering event that could be used to determine an outcome for the gaming contest. As a result the system can utilize the theoretical probability values and cater the contest to different players playing different games but that may both be competing for the same prize in the gaming contest. For example a first player may be playing a slot game and a second player may be playing a poker game. The gaming contest begins and the objective or goal of the gaming contest is for the first player to experience a first event in their respective game before the second player experiences a second event in their respective game. However the respective events are not the same. Rather the probability of either occurring in either of the games is the same. For instance in the slot game when the gaming contest begins the system may incorporate the first player and the second player into the gaming contest. The objective is for either 1 the first player to have a specific number of a specific slot reel combinations occur within a specific amount of time e.g. have five two cherry groupings occur on a five symbol slot reel within 25 minutes or 2 the second player to have a specific number or type of poker hand e.g. have 4 pocket pairs within 25 minutes . The system sets the different objectives for the first player and second player because the system knows that based on game math models for a standard rate of play for either game the probability of either objective occurring within the 25 minutes is equivalent.

The second section also includes a game element configuration section with a game activity control to specify a specific activity or configuration of gaming elements to occur during the gaming contest and a game condition control to specify a condition about the specific activity or configuration of gaming elements. Using the game element configuration section a casino operator for example could configure the wining event s that signify an outcome s to the gaming contest e.g. specify that the fifth person to get pocket aces wins the gaming contest .

Furthermore if the additional parameters are not selected in the second section e.g. the controls in the second section are left blank the system can show specific winning events parameters that could be played on specific machines for given types of games etc. that would generate the proper virtual expected value etc. For instance if all of the values for the variables were entered in the first section the second section can sort event criteria parameter given the values of the variables in the first section .

In some embodiments the additional parameters entered in the second section may affect a calculation of any of the variables in the first section . For instance the values selected in the second section may add one or more factors into the formula indicated in . For example given the probabilities of occurrence of the event s specified in the second section the system may automatically generate adjust or limit one or more of the vales of the variables in the first section . In other words depending on the uncertainty of the occurrence of specific events for winning criteria i.e. depending on uncertainty of occurrence of events specified in the second section the system may have difficulty computing a duration for the gaming contest e.g. based on the uncertainty one of the variables may become irrelevant incalculable biased or misleading to a calculation formula such as the formula in . . As a result the system may deactivate the contest duration controls and enforce minimum maximum values or maximum values via the contest duration controls and etc. The gaming contest could then for instance run without a specified duration until the expected value was met and once met would trigger a winner. In another embodiment instead of making an indeterminate duration for the gaming contest the expected prize value could be indeterminate so that after the set duration for the gaming contest the gaming contest would only award a portion of money that would actually have been accumulated. In another embodiment the system could award back to back contests for the same or different amounts of durations that keep giving away portions of the prize value until all of the prize value has all been given out. The system could have a lock in feature before running any calculations to lock in certain variables. The system could notify if one of the contest duration or the virtual EV value is indeterminate and then run the calculation excluding the indeterminate variable.

The system may also modify a format for entering a value. For example in the second section may have specified a random winning event that causes a graphic of an object e.g. a moose to pop up on players displays as they play primary and or secondary wagering games. As the players touch the graphic on their respective displays the system counts down the number of touches until one player is the final person to touch the graphic e.g. the 25player to touch the moose graphic thus winning the contest. However because the event is specified as being random the system may not be able to accept a contest duration because the timing of the presentation of the moose object may not be known i.e. randomly appears . Thus in some embodiments the system deactivates e.g. grays out removes etc. the contest duration controls and and instead specifies additional controls e.g. radio buttons and that indicate whether to award a prize as soon as the virtual EV is actualized e.g. as soon as the virtual EV is actually earned given the values for the variables and the gaming conditions or whether to stagger portions of the prize until the virtual EV is actualized. In other embodiments however the system can leave the contest duration controls and active and the system can instead carefully time the presentation of the appearances of the moose objects to appear within the allotted time period e.g. the 25appearance of the moose object occurs at the expiration of any value indicated in the contest duration controls and . In some embodiments the value in the contest duration controls and can modify the value in the second section e.g. can modify the amount of people to touch the moose object to comport with the duration value specified via the contest duration controls and or vice versa e.g. can modify the duration value specified via the contest duration controls and to comport with the amount of people required to touch the moose object .

The flow continues at processing block where the system funds the contest with an amount of money equivalent to the virtual EV from a source of money other than from wagers of wagering games played on the wagering game network. The system can fund the game directly from the source of money when the gaming contest begins ends or throughout the duration of the gaming contest. In some embodiments the source of money is a promotional or marketing account owned or controlled by a casino s administrative user s . The promotional account can be linked to the system and directly accessed by the system.
