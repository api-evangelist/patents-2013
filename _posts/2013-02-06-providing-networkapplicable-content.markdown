The present disclosure relates to computer implemented methods non transitory computer readable media and computer systems for providing network applicable content to a client.

Enterprise portals provide frameworks for integrating information people and processes across organizational boundaries providing a centralized and secure access point to an enterprise. Current enterprise portals allow multiple client types to interface with the enterprise portal. These enterprise portals can allow users in different locations to access the central site and its information. Portal pages may have differing levels of complexity presentations content portions and content types. For some network connections and devices particular portal pages may be difficult or inconvenient to load.

The disclosure generally describes computer implemented methods software and systems for providing network applicable content to a client. One example method includes identifying a first set of content requested by the client the first set of content associated with a default set of components for presentation performing a network capability check associated with the client determining based on the capability check of the client whether the default set of components associated with the first set of content is applicable for use with the client providing the default set of components associated with the first set of content for presentation where the default set is determined to be applicable with the client and responsive to determining that the default set is not applicable with the client identifying at least one alternative component associated with the first set of content for presentation and providing the least one alternative component associated with the first set of content for presentation.

The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter of the present disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of the subject matter will be apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

The present disclosure relates to computer implemented methods non transitory computer readable media and computer systems for providing network applicable content to a client.

In particular the present disclosure describes a content providing mechanism. The content providing mechanism can include adjustments of the content so that the content provided to a client is applicable with the client s capabilities. The content providing mechanism can improve user experience for example by solving latency issues of users waiting a long time for heavy content while using a low bandwidth network and or by improving the content quality when the users are in a highly capable network. The network applicable content includes the content that is not only presentable given a network capability associated with the client but also provides a preferred view for the client. In some instances the determination of whether the content is applicable or inapplicable can be made based on for example whether the content is compatible with the current network capability whether the content will cause issues in being presented i.e. data allowance data throughput etc. whether the content complies with the administrative settings the user s settings or any other suitable criteria. In some examples the network applicable content can be of a low quality but can be presented to the client within a short time or can be of high quality if the network capability allows.

Generally a portal server can receive a request for content from a client. The portal server and the client may be connected through a network. To provide network applicable content to the client the portal server may identify the network capability associated with the client for example by checking a network type 3G 4G Wi Fi etc. a device type modem type processing capability etc. and a current connection quality such as signal strength bandwidth and or data rate etc. . After identifying the network capability the portal server may adjust the content and send the appropriate content for creating a relatively smoother and better experience for the user based on the determined capabilities. The device type may provide further information including but not limited to an actual device name e.g. iPhone 4s iPad 3 etc. an operating system type and or version e.g. Mac OS X 10.8 Microsoft Windows 8 etc. .

In some implementations the network applicable content can be made in two manners responsive identification and administrative definitions. Responsive identification can include a runtime assessment of bandwidth capabilities and then based on the assessment corresponding adjustments to the content appropriate for the assessed capabilities. For example the portal server can determine whether to present complex content full application basic content removing Cascading Style Sheet CSS files images etc. or some combination thereof. Some example options include but are not limited to 

Administrative definitions may include an administrative user s settings related to content components of the content applications and or network capabilities. For example an administrative user may be able to give multiple applications as possibilities for strong and weak networks and at runtime the appropriate version or selection can be presented based on the determined network capability. As another example an administrative user may be able to tag parts of application as more important or less important then less important parts might be omitted when necessary or when the network capabilities dictate.

The EPS is a server computer or plurality of servers or computers capable of performing functions associated with creation modification execution and provision of network appropriate content to a client . The EPS may be part of an end to end enterprise resource planning ERP system or an analytics system while in some instances the EPS may be a dedicated system for providing network appropriate content. In some instances the EPS may be a cloud based system providing services to a plurality of systems.

In some implementations the EPS includes a content provider manager and a network test module . The content provider manager manages various functions associated with the content including content generation access modification deletion or any other appropriate functions. The network test module can identify a network capability associated with a particular client at runtime. Based on the determined network capability the content provider manager may adjust the content and prepare network applicable content for presentation.

At a high level the EPS comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive transmit process store or manage data and information associated with the environment . Specifically the EPS illustrated in is responsible for receiving application requests such as requests for specified portal content from one or more client applications described below associated with the client of the example distributed computing system for responding to the received requests by processing said requests in the content provider manager described below and for sending the appropriate response content from the content provider manager back to the requesting client application . In addition to requests from the client requests associated with the content provider manager may also be sent from internal users external or third party customers other automated applications as well as any other appropriate entities individuals systems or computers.

As used in the present disclosure the term computer is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example although illustrates a single system as encompassing the EPS environment can be implemented using two or more servers or computers as well as computers other than servers including a server pool to implement the EPS . Indeed the EPS may be any computer or processing device such as for example a blade server general purpose personal computer PC Mac workstation UNIX based workstation or any other suitable device. In other words the present disclosure contemplates computers other than general purpose computers as well as computers without conventional operating systems. Further illustrated EPS may be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux UNIX Windows Mac OS Java Android iOS or any other suitable operating system. According to one implementation the EPS may also include or be communicably coupled with an e mail server a Web server a caching server a streaming data server and or other suitable server. Similar flexibility and variation may be associated with the other components illustrated in including clients each of which may be comprised of different components component types and operating systems in different implementations.

In some implementations any and or all components of the EPS both hardware and or software may interface with each other and or the interface using an application programming interface API and or a service layer . The API may include specifications for routines data structures and object classes. The API may be either computer language independent or dependent and refer to a complete interface a single function or even a set of APIs. The service layer provides software services to the example distributed computing system . The functionality of the EPS may be accessible for all service consumers using this service layer. Software services such as those provided by the service layer provide reusable defined business functionalities through a defined interface. For example the interface may be software written in JAVA C or another suitable language providing data in extensible markup language XML format or other suitable format.

While illustrated as an integrated component of the EPS in the example distributed computing system alternative implementations may illustrate the API and or the service layer as stand alone components in relation to other components of the example distributed computing system . Moreover any or all parts of the API and or the service layer may be implemented as child sub modules or portions of another software module enterprise application or hardware module without departing from the scope of this disclosure.

The EPS includes an interface a processor and a memory . The interface is used by the EPS for communicating with other systems in a distributed environment including within the environment connected to the network for example one or more clients as well as other systems communicably coupled to the network not illustrated . Generally the interface comprises logic encoded in software and or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically the interface may comprise software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network or interface s hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .

Generally the EPS and other components within environment may be communicably coupled with a network that facilitates wireless or wireline communications between the components of the environment as well as with any other local or remote computer such as additional clients servers or other devices communicably coupled to network including those not illustrated in . In the illustrated environment the network is depicted as a single network but may be comprised of more than one network without departing from the scope of this disclosure so long as at least a portion of the network may facilitate communications between senders and recipients. In some instances one or more of the components associated with the system may be included within the network as one or more cloud based services or operations.

The network may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network while in another instance at least a portion of the network may represent a connection to the Internet. In some instances a portion of the network may include a portion of a cellular or mobile data network or other network capable of relaying short message service SMS or multimedia messaging service MMS messages as well as other suitable mobile data messaging. In some instances a portion of the network may be a virtual private network VPN . Further all or a portion of the network can comprise either a wireline or wireless link. Example wireless links may include IEEE 802.11a b g n 802.20 WiMax 3G 4G e.g. LTE LTE Advanced and or any other appropriate wireless link. In other words the network encompasses any internal or external network networks sub network or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various computing components inside and outside the illustrated environment . The network may communicate for example Internet Protocol IP packets Frame Relay frames Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM cells voice video data and other suitable information between network addresses. The network may also include one or more local area networks LANs radio access networks RANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs all or a portion of the Internet and or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations.

As also illustrated in the EPS includes a processor . Although illustrated as a single processor in two or more processors may be used according to particular needs desires or particular implementations of the environment . Each processor may be a central processing unit CPU a blade an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or another suitable component. Generally the processor executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the EPS . Specifically the processor executes the functionality required to receive process and respond to requests from the client s particularly the functionality required to provide network applicable content to a client for presentation as well as to perform the operations associated with other modules such as a network test module described below inside the EPS as well as other components related modules and functionality including communicating and working with the one or more clients and or other systems not illustrated in the environment .

Regardless of the particular implementation software may include computer readable instructions firmware wired and or programmed hardware or any combination thereof on a tangible medium transitory or non transitory as appropriate operable when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein. Indeed each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any appropriate computer language including C C Java Visual Basic assembler Perl any suitable version of 4GL as well as others. While portions of the software illustrated in are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects methods or other processes the software may instead include a number of sub modules third party services components libraries and such as appropriate. Conversely the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate.

The EPS as illustrated also includes a network test module . The network test module performs network capability checks of a client . In some implementations the network capability check includes a device type check a network type check and or a connection quality check at runtime as well as any other suitable checks. The network capability associated with the client can be derived based at least in part on one or more of the above three check results. The device type can provide information about a modem used in the client which can reflect the device s capabilities in receiving transmitting and or processing data as well as processing capabilities and other device specific information. As an example a smartphone is typically equipped with a more advanced transceiver and processor than a regular cellphone thus the smartphone may have a greater network capability than the regular cellphone given the same other conditions. Similarly different models or versions of a particular device may have different capabilities. One version of a particular smartphone may only be capable of 3G speeds while another may be capable of 4G type speeds and transmissions. Further certain devices and their operating systems may not be applicable with some content types such that alternative formats may be needed for some content to be presented. The device type check may provide further information regarding the device including but not limited to an actual device name e.g. iPhone 4s iPad 3 etc. an operating system type and or version e.g. Mac OS X 10.8 Microsoft Windows 8 etc. and other information and device definitions. In some instances a user agent received from or included in the request for the device may be used to provide information on the device. The user agent can be a string in HTTP that provides a list of product tokens keywords and optional comments. The user agent for instance can include information defining the device type a browser type and version a layout engine and version system details rendering engine compatibilities browser platforms and related details and available functionality.

The network type can provide information about general network related information such as supportable downlink uplink data rate bandwidth spectral efficiency and any other useful information related to the network s general ability in providing communication service. For example an LTE LTE Advanced network is able to support a higher data rate than a GSM GPRS network and hence a client connected to an LTE LTE Advanced network may be considered to have greater network capability than a device connected to a GSM GPRS network given the same other conditions. With the same device type and network type a user may experience different connection qualities depending on for example currently available resources bandwidth time slots single or multiple antennas etc. current transmission schemes modulation types coding algorithms etc. location or mobility of the client and or traffic load in the entire network. The connection quality check can identify a current connection quality such as signal strength download upload speed service latency and or any other appropriate connection quality indicator associated with the client at the current time a request is received or alternatively at a recent time relative to the received request. The identified device type network type and the current connection quality and combinations thereof can provide a more realistic assessment of the network capability associated with the client at runtime.

The EPS also includes a memory that holds data associated with the portal and the related functionality of the EPS . Although illustrated as a single memory in two or more memories may be used according to particular needs desires or particular implementations of the example distributed computing system . While memory is illustrated as an integral component of the EPS in alternative implementations memory can be external to the EPS and or the example distributed computing system . The memory may include any type of memory or database module and may take the form of volatile and or non volatile memory including without limitation magnetic media optical media random access memory RAM read only memory ROM removable media or any other suitable local or remote memory component. The memory may store various objects or data including caches classes frameworks applications backup data business objects jobs web pages web page templates database tables repositories storing business and or dynamic information business object universes database and data source connection related information product information customer information and any other appropriate information including any parameters variables algorithms instructions rules constraints or references thereto associated with the purposes of the EPS . Additionally the memory may include any other appropriate data such as VPN applications firmware logs and policies firewall policies a security or access log print or other reporting files as well as others. As illustrated in memory includes information associated with one or more instances of administrative definitions content and user settings .

The content sets may include among other things text images sounds videos animations and or other suitable content. While illustrated as integrated with memory of the EPS in the example distributed computing system in alternative implementations the content can be external to the EPS and or the example distributed computing system for example associated with external content providers not illustrated . The content may include basic content and complex content . While the complex content may refer to for example a full application that includes all available text images sounds videos animations CSS files and or other content possibly with rich format the basic content may refer to a simplified application where one or more of text images sounds videos animations CSS files and or the like are removed or modified so that the size of the basic content is smaller than its complex content counterpart or otherwise applicable with particular clients . The content may be managed by the content provider manager . In some implementations the complex content or the basic content may be converted to an alternative content type by the conversion module .

The administrative definitions are data associated with and defined by an administrative user. The administrative definitions may include among other things configurations rules and or priority information as defined by the administrative user. The administrative definitions are illustrated as including tag information and default selections . The tag information can include the administrative user s classification of a plurality of components of a set of content. The tag information can further include corresponding processing rules such as priorities associated with the classified components. For example an administrative user may be able to tag parts of application as more important or less important. The parts with greater importance may be preserved and or prioritized while parts with less importance may be omitted compressed or substituted by other versions if necessary. For example a higher priority part may be served in a limited network connectivity situation while the lower priority part may be omitted or otherwise modified within the presented page to improve the viewing experience for the user. The default selections can include the administrative user s configurations related to the content applications and the network capability among others. For example the default selections may define the default size type format quality and or any other property of the components included in a content set . In some instances the default selections may include a set of default content formats application types and or the like with respect to different network capabilities. For example an administrative user may be able to identify multiple applications as possibilities for strong and weak networks respectively and at runtime the EPS can determine the appropriate content to be presented based on a determined network capability.

The user settings are data associated with an EPS user. The user settings data may include the user s preferences related to the content such as user s tolerable latency total data plan preferred properties of the content priorities associated with different content components preferred presentation orders of different content components and or any other appropriate information. In some instances a portal or related configuration page not shown may be presented in which an EPS user can configure one or more preferences and or rules to be used when receiving portal pages associated with the present disclosure. By configuring these preferences at a central location and at one time users may experience a more consistent presentation avoiding the system asking the user repetitive questions during the entire interaction. The configuration may be changed in some implementations at any time to allow users freedom to modify their experience. One example user setting may allow the user to choose to get a particular quality X for a component when using network Y. Alternatively the user may choose to always get quality X for all components regardless of the network quality or particular network. The quality X may be the best quality available or it may be a lower quality. In some instances users may set a minimum quality they will accept. In many instances this may be relevant for users with limited data packages from their carrier providing them the ability to choose and select data and component presentations that match or support their data allowance e.g. when on 3G always asking for a relatively lower quality and or amount of content. 

In some implementations the administrative definitions and the user settings can be overwritten by each other for example depending on system configurations.

The EPS is illustrated as including a content provider manager itself including several additional applications modules and other software to be executed by the processor . The content provider manager as well as its components can be any application program or other software for managing and performing operations associated with the content . The content provider manager represents any suitable software or combination of software that manages network capability based content related functions. To perform these operations the content provider manager is illustrated as including a conversion module . This component and any other or alternative components assist the content provider manager in creating modifying and executing the content . Specifically the content provider manager can provide network applicable content to the client for presentation.

In some implementations upon a receipt of the particular content request by the client the content provider manager may check with the network test module for the current network capability associated with the client . Based on the network capability associated with the client the content provider manager can determine whether content adjustment is needed. If the request content is compatible with the network capability associated with the client the content provider manager can access the requested content in the memory and prepare the content for presentation. If the request content is not compatible with the network capability associated with the client the content provider manager may pass the requested content to the conversion module for processing so that a network applicable content may be generated. The content provider manager can then prepare the generated network applicable content for presentation at the client .

In some implementations the processing of the conversion module includes identifying at least an appropriate alternative component associated with the requested content that is compatible with the network capability. In some instances there may be multiple alternatives to a set of components of the requested content e.g. videos with different levels of resolution available in the memory of the EPS . The conversion module may be able to select a set of network applicable alternative components associated with the request content. For example the conversion module may choose a high resolution video over a low resolution one when the network capability is good while selecting a low resolution video over a high resolution video when the network capability is poor. In some instances if no appropriate alternative is available the EPS may suggest the client accept a conversion of the requested content . The suggested conversion may include substituting the requested content with another version such as a lower higher resolution version an excerpt of the original content adjusting the compression compression ratio compression algorithm etc. of the content changing the way of presentation of the content instead of presenting all content components at the same time present the components step by step and or any other suitable adjustments. For example the conversion module may instruct the content provider manager to first prepare the body of a web page with text and blank images for presentation and then present available images animations video etc. afterwards.

In some implementations the conversion module may identify the appropriate alternative component based at least in part on the administrative definitions and or the user settings . For instance the content provider manager may check user preferences in using at least one alternative component for presentation. In some instances the alternative components may be provided to the client only if the client approves use of the alternative components. In some other implementations the content provider manager may conduct conversion based on dynamic user preferences. In these cases the content provider may coordinate with the interface and or the processor to send a request to the client at runtime when a content conversion is needed. As an example the request may appear as a popup window in the GUI e.g. described below of the client. The user may select or input his her preferences with such user preferences being sent back to the EPS . The conversion module can then convert the requested content based at least in part on the dynamic user preferences. In the above mentioned example after presenting the body of a web page with text and blank images the content provider manager may give the user a choice if he wants to load the remaining components of the webpage such as images flashes . A particular remaining component or an alternative to the particular remaining component may be presented only if the user chooses to load it. In some implementations the dynamic user preferences can overwrite the default settings of the administrative definitions and the user settings .

The client may be any computing device operable to connect to or communicate with at least the EPS using the network . In general the client comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive transmit process and store any appropriate data associated with the example distributed computing system . The client includes a processor a client application a memory and or an interface .

The client application is any type of application that allows the client to navigate to from request view edit delete and or manipulate content on the client . In some implementations the client application can be and or include a web browser. In some implementations the client application can use parameters metadata and other information received at launch to access a particular set of data from the EPS . Once a particular client application is launched a user may interactively process a task event or other information associated with the EPS . Further although illustrated as a single client application the client application may be implemented as multiple client applications in the client . In some implementations the client application may act as a GUI interface for the memory and or other components of EPS and or other components of the example distributed computing environment .

The interface is used by the client for communicating with other computing systems in a distributed computing system environment including within the example distributed computing system using network . For example the client uses the interface to communicate with the EPS as well as other systems not illustrated that are communicably coupled to the network . The interface may be consistent with the above described interface of the EPS or other interfaces within the example distributed computing system . The processor may be consistent with the above described processor of the EPS or other processors within the example distributed computing system . Specifically the processor executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the client including the functionality required to send requests to the EPS and to receive and process responses from the EPS . The memory may be consistent with the above described memory of the EPS or other memories within the example distributed computing system and can store objects and or data associated with the purposes of the client . Memory is also shown to contain user settings . User settings may be consistent with the above described user setting and can contain data associated specifically with the purposes of the client . In some implementations user settings may be kept wholly and or partially consistent with user settings by the EPS and or the client . In some implementations the user settings may be updated or modified based on for example user s responses to the dynamic requests on using alternative components for presentation.

Further the illustrated client includes a GUI . The GUI interfaces with at least a portion of the example distributed computing system for any suitable purpose including generating a visual representation of a web browser. The GUI may be used to view and navigate various web pages located both internally and externally to the EPS . In particular the GUI may be used to perform functions for providing assisted portal navigation and crowd based feedback consistent with this disclosure.

There may be any number of clients associated with or external to the example distributed computing system . For example while the illustrated example distributed computing system includes one client communicably coupled to the EPS using network alternative implementations of the example distributed computing system may include any number of clients suitable to the purposes of the example distributed computing system . Additionally there may also be one or more additional clients external to the illustrated portion of the example distributed computing system that are capable of interacting with the example distributed computing system using the network . Further the term client and user may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover while the client is described in terms of being used by a single user this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer or that one user may use multiple computers.

The illustrated client is intended to encompass any computing device such as a desktop computer laptop notebook computer wireless data port not shown tablet computing device smartphone personal data assistant PDA one or more processors within these devices or any other suitable processing device. For example the client may comprise a computer that includes an input device such as a keypad touch screen or other device that can accept user information and an output device that conveys information associated with the operation of the EPS or the client itself including digital data visual and or audio information or a GUI as shown with respect to the client .

While is described as containing or being associated with a plurality of elements not all elements illustrated within environment of may be utilized in each alternative implementation of the present disclosure. For example one or more of the elements described herein may be located external to environment while in other instances certain elements may be included within or as a portion of one or more of the other described elements as well as other elements not described in the illustrated implementation. Further certain elements illustrated in may be combined with other components as well as used for alternative or additional purposes in addition to those purposes described herein.

At a request from a client for a set of content is received. The set of content could be a portal document a webpage a video clip a movie stream or other suitable content. The set of content may include a plurality of components. For example a webpage may be requested by the client. The webpage may include text images flashes video or any other possible components.

At a default set of components associated with the request set of content is identified. In some implementations the default set of components can be identified based on the administrative definitions. For example components of particular sizes qualities and or formats can be identified as the default set of components associated with the requested set of content.

At a network capability check may be determined to be needed. The determination that the network capability check is needed can be based on among other things receiving a request for network capability check from the client identifying a session length exceeded a predefined session length and or identifying a delay or error such as a 404 message a Not Found error message or a request failure in communication with the client during operations. In some instances when and how to perform the network capability check may be application specific. For example implementing system may be configured to check the network capability every few minutes for some applications and every few seconds for some other applications.

At a network capacity check is performed. In some implementations the network capability check can be performed by for example the network check module illustrated in . The network capability check may include one or more of a network type check a device type check and a connection quality check as well as other suitable checks and tests. Based on at least one of the network type the device type the connection quality and combinations thereof the status of the network capability associated with the client can be identified and the implementing system can adapt the content for presentation at the client.

The network capability check can be performed in various ways. Some information may be derived from the request received from the client and related data. For example the device type information can be obtained from a request header such as User Agent field when the implementing system receives the client s request for content. The network type information may be obtained for example by using JavaScript in a hybrid container in an HTML application. The connection quality may be obtained from a cookie check when a session is active. In some implementations the connection quality check may be performed by for example a bandwidth test identifying a current bandwidth used by the device and or a data rate test identifying a current downloading uploading speed of the device. In some instances the connection quality may be derived based at least in part on a delay and or an error rate of the communication during operations. For example the implementing system may record the delay or the error rate of a service provided on this connection at runtime. If the service experiences severe delay or packet loss the connection quality can be considered as poor.

In some implementations the implementing system such as the EPS illustrated in may explicitly request network related information from the client and or the network. For example the implementing system may send a request to and receive a response from the client with information such as the device type the network type current bandwidth speed. Based at least in part on the client s response the implementing system can identify the current network capability associated with the client.

At a determination as to whether the default set of components are applicable for use with the client is made. In some instances the determination can be made based on whether the default set of component is compatible with the network capability associated with the client. In some implementations the determination can be made based on whether an available download speed meets a minimum speed requirement and whether the client is capable of presenting each of the default components associated with the requested set of content. In some implementations the determination is based on a set of administrative settings defined for at least a portion of the default components based on the identified capability associated with the client. For example the set of administrative settings defined for the portion of the default components can include priority assignments to particular default components where the lower priority of an assignment to a particular default component relative to another default component can result in the lower priority default component being substituted with an alternative component where the default components are determined not to be applicable with the capability associated with the client.

At if the default set of components is determined to be applicable with the client the default set of components are prepared and or provided for presentation.

At if the default set of components are determined to be inapplicable with the client at least one alternative component associated with the requested set of content may be identified. The alternative component may include at least one of the following content at a different resolution than the corresponding default component content at a different compression ratio than the corresponding default component and or content in a different format than the corresponding default component. In some instances one or more alternative components associated with the requested set of content may be readily available at or by reference to the implementing system. For example the system may have both a high definition version and a low definition version of a video as alternative components to a standard definition version video identified as the default component for a particular page. In some instances if there is no available alternative component associated with the requested set of content the alternative component set can be regarded as blank. 

At a determination is made as to whether the at least one alternative component is applicable with the network capability associated with the client. The determination can be made similarly to the determination of the default component at . In some implementations the determination of the applicability of the alternative component may be further based on the preferences of a user of the client such as whether to allow using alternative components for presentation. As an example if the user does not allow using alternative components associated with the request set of content for presentation method may proceed to where the default set of components are prepared for presentation not illustrated . The user preferences may include one or more of default user settings such as as illustrated in stored in the EPS s memory or dynamic user selections. In the case of dynamic user selections the user preferences may be requested or otherwise identified at runtime not illustrated . For example the implementing system may send a request to the client where the request appears as a pop up window in the GUI of the client. The user may select or input his preferences on the size quality and formats among others of a content component that he would like to view. Based at least in part on the dynamic user preferences the implementing system can then determine whether the alternative component is applicable for use with the client.

At if the alternative component is applicable for use with the client the alternative set of components is prepared and or provided for presentation.

If the alternative component is not applicable with the network capability associated with the client a further check to determine if any content conversion can be made to generate network applicable content can be made. At a check if any appropriate compression method is available is made. If available the compression can be performed at to generate an applicable alternative component and the applicable alternative component can be prepared for presentation at . Otherwise method proceeds to where the default set of components are prepared for presentation. In some implementations before a conversion is made a further request for approval from the client regarding converting at least a portion of the default components to an applicable format may be made at runtime not shown . After receiving the approval the conversion of the portion of the default components to an applicable format can be made.

When a request for the particular set of content is received the default set of components namely A Default B Default C Default and D Default can be identified. If a portion of the default set of components is determined to not be applicable with the current network capability determined for example by one or more of the network checks described above the administrative settings the user s settings or any other suitable criteria suitable adjustments can be made by an implementing system such as the EPS of to provide network applicable content to a client for presentation.

For example the two alternative components A Alternative and A Alternative of the default component A Default can be identified. The implementing system may identify A Alternative as a network applicable component based on the current network capability the administrative settings related to the component A the user s settings or any other suitable criteria.

For component B Default no alternative component is available in the illustrated example. The implementing system may convert the default component to a network applicable form. As an example the implementing system may perform a suitable compression algorithm to compress component B Default into a component B Compressed . In some instances such a conversion can be conducted only if the user agrees to compress the particular component.

For component C Default the alternative component C Alternative may be identified. In some instances component C Alternative may also not be compatible with the current network capabilities. Since the component C Default is tagged as relatively lower priority than the other components in component table component C Default and its alternatives may be omitted for presentation such as when the network capability is determined to be poor. In some implementations the component C Default may be replaced with for example a blank image or empty border on the presented page . The omitted component may be prepared for presentation if the user requests to view it after initial presentation of the presented page such as by clicking or otherwise activating the area associated with the omitted component a button within the omitted area or any other suitable UI element. When components are omitted certain default UI elements e.g. buttons may be provided in around or to indicate the omitted items allowing users to easily identify the missing components.

Component D Default is illustrated as being tagged with a relatively higher priority . Thus the D Default can be preserved for presentation even in situations where it may otherwise be omitted compressed replaced or otherwise changed where appropriate.

As a result after the adjustments the example presented page contains A Alternative B Compressed D Default and a blank image for the omitted component C. Depending on the determined network capabilities and any administrative and or user settings any suitable combination of components may be used such that the presented page is optimized for its intended client.

Particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations alterations and permutations of the described implementations are within the scope of the following claims as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results.

Accordingly the above description of example implementations does not define or constrain this disclosure. Other changes substitutions and alterations are also possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
