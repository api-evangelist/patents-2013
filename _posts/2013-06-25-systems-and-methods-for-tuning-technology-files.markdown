This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 781 294 filed on Mar. 14 2013 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The disclosed system and method relate to semiconductor integrated circuits ICs and more particularly to electronic design automation EDA and simulation tools for tuning technology files such as RC techfiles.

Integrated circuits ICs are incorporated into many electronic devices and the design process for a new IC includes several steps by using for example automated electronic design automation EDA tools. The design process can include 1 determining an initial design of the IC 2 generation of a layout of the design and 3 verification of the design. During the initial design a user of the EDA tool or designer can identify a set of functions to include in the design along with their standard delays. The user can also use computer implemented tools to perform functional simulation to ensure that the design performs a pre simulation. If the design meets circuit performance requirements in the pre simulation the user can then initiate floorplan and layout phases to generate an actual layout. For example the user can generate at least one GDS file that includes the layout of the IC.

Following the layout process the user can verify the design by using the EDA tools to perform design rule checks DRC layout versus schematic LVS checks and RC extraction. In cooperating with RC technology file the RC extraction tool takes into account the layout of the conductive e.g. metal lines of the interconnecting layers generated by the router and computes parasitic resistance and capacitance elements associated with each conductive line. Then a post simulation verifies circuit performance. The accuracy of post simulation requires an accurate RC technology file.

In at least some known RC technology file accuracy tuning processes the user can conduct accuracy tuning of the 2.5 dimensional RC technology file. In at least some known RC techfile tuning methods the user may tune up the input profile used for RC technology file generation. For example the user may change actual parameters such as the vertical height width or dielectric constant of the newly designed IC and or of the components therein. However such a method is very time consuming for application programming interface API RC techfile generation flow because a three dimensional characterization on every tuned up profile can take up to approximately one day for each change. Moreover tuning of a three dimensional profile of for example a Fin field effect transistor FinFET can be complex because of the number of parameters involved. Further such a method can be difficult to model or take into account silicon effects.

The exemplary system and method described herein speed up the known tuning methods by providing an efficient mathematical approach to characterizing shift parameters of a lookup table of patterns that are characterized by 3D RC extraction tools. More specifically some embodiments described herein generate at least one 2.5 dimensional RC technology file. During the generation a plurality of layers for an IC are created and being characterized by 3D RC extraction tool. The three dimensional patterns include a plurality of layer combinations from the layers for the IC. The layer combinations are arranged into a plurality of groups such that each of the layer combinations is assigned to at least one group. Parameter shift s for each of the groups are identified and a shifting analysis is performed for each of the groups based at least in part on the identified corresponding parameter shift. A plurality of tuning vector values are calculated for the groups based at least in part on the shifting analysis performed for each of the groups wherein each tuning vector value corresponds to a separate group. Each of the groups is then shifted by the corresponding tuning vector value. Thus based on the results of the calculations the lookup table are updated tuned and the 2.5D RC technology file now have a more accurate extraction results. By using this modeling technique an actual input profile change such as a change to the vertical height width or dielectric constant of the IC is not necessary. Moreover this modeling technique can even be used to account for silicon effects.

Moreover in the exemplary embodiment system includes a presentation interface that presents information such as input events and or validation results to the user. In the exemplary embodiment presentation interface includes a display adapter that is coupled to at least one display device .

The term processor refers generally to any programmable system including systems and microcontrollers reduced instruction set circuits RISC application specific integrated circuits ASIC programmable logic circuits PLC and any other circuit or processor capable of executing the functions described herein. The above examples are exemplary only and thus are not intended to limit in any way the definition and or meaning of the term processor.

Included within processor is an electronic design automation EDA tool and an RC extraction tool that is included within EDA tool . EDA tool and RC extraction tool each comprise one or more software modules that are executed within processor . In one embodiment EDA tool can include software such as IC COMPILER sold by Synopsis Inc. of Mountain View Calif. which can include a place and route tool not shown such as ZROUTE also sold by Synopsys Inc. Other EDA tools can be used such as the VIRTUOSO custom design platform not shown or the Cadence ENCOUNTER digital IC design platform not shown along with the VIRTUOSO chip assembly router not shown all sold by Cadence Design Systems Inc. of San Jose Calif.

Moreover in the exemplary embodiment communication interface can be coupled to for example a remote terminal not shown such as a desktop computer laptop mobile device thin client or other similar device. As such the remote terminal can be capable of displaying applications running inside system to an end user using the remote terminal.

During operation of system as explained in more detail below with respect to EDA tool generates a 2.5 dimensional RC technology file that is stored by memory device . During the 2.5D RC technology file generation EDA tool generates a plurality of three dimensional patterns shown in for 3D model pre characterization. In the exemplary embodiment three dimensional patterns include a plurality of layer combinations shown in of the layers . In one embodiment three dimensional patterns can be created systematically such as by a combination of the layers and their physical dimensions. For example as shown in the layer combinations can be 3 2 3 which includes 18 layer combinations. The dimensions considered for patterns can include for example combinations of spacing between each of the layers and the width of each of the layers .

EDA tool arranges the layer combinations into a plurality of groups shown in such that each of the layer combinations is assigned to at least one of the groups . In one embodiment as shown in three groups Group 1 Group 2 and Group 3 can be established. Groups can be established based on the types of layers and or the components disposed on layers . For example Group 1 includes the layers where there is no M0 or M1 patterns formed over a diffusion region where M1 is the first interconnect conductive line layer and M0 is a conductive layer at the height of the gate electrode below the height of the M1 layer . The NGate and the PGate means the device could be an N type or a P type respectively. Group 2 includes the layers with M0 or M1 M0. Group 3 is for the gate to ground components on the layers. Such components can be included on all the three dimensional patterns.

After layer combinations have been arranged into groups EDA tool identifies whether at least one parameter shift occurs for each of the groups . For example EDA tool can identify whether a capacitance shift occurs for each of the groups . More specifically in the exemplary embodiment EDA tool identifies whether there is a capacitance shift that occurs in Group 1 Group 2 and Group 3. The shifting can be identified by using a known look up table shown in for capacitance values stored in memory device . Look up table can be presented to the user as an output via presentation interface . As such the user is enabled to identify the shifting. While the parameter shift shown in the exemplary embodiment includes a capacitance shift other parameters can be contemplated and used for the analysis. For example signal timing shifts for the IC can also be considered.

When the parameter shift s such as the capacitance shift s have been identified EDA tool can perform a shifting analysis for each of the groups based at least in part on the identified corresponding parameter shift s . More specifically as explained in more detail below the shifting analysis enables the identification of at least one tolerance threshold for at least one benchmark circuit. As explained in more detail below the results of the shifting analysis including the identified tolerance threshold s facilitates the calculation of a plurality of tuning vector values for each of the groups wherein each tuning vector that is calculated corresponds to a separate group. EDA tool can then shift each of the groups by the corresponding tuning vector value.

This technique facilitates an efficient approach to updating a lookup table i.e. tuning the lookup table and the 2.5D RC technology file will now have substantially accurate extraction results. More specifically by using this approach the values in lookup table can be changed or shifted based on the identified shifting patterns discussed above. Moreover an actual input profile change such as a change to the vertical height width or dielectric constant of the IC is no longer necessary. This technique can even be used to account for a silicon effect.

During the 2.5 dimensional RC technology file generation EDA tool generates a plurality of three dimensional patterns shown in that include a plurality of layer combinations shown in of layers shown in for an IC in operation . Three dimensional patterns can be created systematically such as by a combination of the layers and their physical dimensions. For example as shown in the layer combinations can be 3 2 3 which includes 18 layer combinations. The dimensions considered for patterns can include for example combinations of spacing between each of the layers and the width of each of the layers .

In operation EDA tool arranges the layer combinations into a plurality of groups shown in such that each of the layer combinations is assigned to at least one of the groups . In one embodiment as shown in three groups Group 1 Group 2 and Group 3 can be established. Groups can be established based on the types of layers and or the components disposed on layers . For example Group 1 includes the layers where there is no M0 or M1 patterns formed over a diffusion region. The NGate and the PGate means the device could be an N type or a P type respectively. Group 2 includes the layers with M0 or M1 M0. Group 3 is for the gate to ground components on the layers. Such components can be included on all the three dimensional patterns.

EDA tool in operation identifies whether at least one benchmark circuit s accuracy is out of criteria. If yes the proposed RC techfile accuracy tuning technique is applied.

EDA tool calculates a shifting impact value or vector on each benchmark circuit in operation wherein the calculation is based at least in part on the identified parameter shift s . More specifically in the exemplary embodiment EDA tool calculates the shifting impact vectors by executing a matrix that incorporates the identified parameter shift s . An exemplary matrix that can be used to calculate the shifting impact vectors is shown in Table 1 below.

In the exemplary embodiment EDA tool inputs the pertinent data obtained into the above referenced matrix shown in Table 1. More specifically as shown in Table 2 below the data incorporated into the above referenced matrix would include the identified capacitance shift values. In Table 2 Ckt 1 and Ckt 2 are each benchmark circuits.

While continuing to perform the shifting analysis EDA tool uses the shifting impact values to identify at least one tolerance threshold value or vector for each of the two benchmark circuits Ckt 1 and Ckt 2 in operation . For example in the exemplary embodiment upper and lower tolerance or criteria threshold vectors are identified for each of the benchmark circuits Ckt 1 and Ckt 2. The lower criteria threshold vector can be calculated by using Equation 1 below. 12 Eq. 1

In the exemplary embodiment based on the identified parameter shift s 3 is used for Ckt 1 and 2 is used for Ckt 2. The silicon target values of 1 is used for Ckt 1 and 1 for Ckt 2. The results obtained are shown in Table 3 below.

After the shifting analysis has been completed EDA tool in operation calculates a plurality of tuning vector values for each of the groups based at least in part on the results of the shifting analysis performed for each of the groups such that each tuning vector value correspond to a separate group. For example in the exemplary embodiment tuning vector value will correspond to Group 1 tuning vector value will correspond to Group 2 and tuning vector value will correspond to Group 3. In one embodiment EDA tool can calculate the tuning vectors values by executing a matrix that uses each of the criteria threshold vectors identified above. An exemplary matrix using the upper criteria threshold vectors is shown in Equation 3 below.

In the exemplary embodiment EDA tool inputs the data obtained from the shifting analysis into Equations 3 and 4 which is shown below in Equations 5 and 6 respectively.

When the tuning vectors values and have each been calculated then in operation EDA tool will use one of the tuning vectors to shift each of the groups i.e. Group 1 Group 2 and Group 3 by the corresponding tuning vector value and regenerate a 2.5D RC techfile. While the exemplary embodiment shows EDA tool performing the shifting of each of the groups the shifting can also be done manually. For example after EDA tool calculates the tuning vector values and system can present the values as a textual output to a user via presentation interface . Based on the values the user can then manually input commands via user interface shown in to perform the necessary shifting.

A plurality of tuning vector values are calculated for the groups based at least in part on the shifting analysis performed for each of the groups wherein each tuning vector value corresponds to a separate group. Each of the groups is then shifted by the corresponding tuning vector value. Thus based on the results of the calculations the lookup table are updated tuned and the 2.5D RC technology file now have a more accurate extraction results. By using this modeling technique an actual input profile change such as a change to the vertical height width or dielectric constant of the IC is not necessary. Moreover this modeling technique can even be used to account for silicon effects.
