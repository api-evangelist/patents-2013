This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Patent Provisional Application No. 61 810 666 filed on Apr. 10 2013 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This disclosure relates to the field of content sharing networks and in particular to content sharing platform playlists and subscriptions based on user history.

On the Internet social networks allow users to connect to and share information with each other. Many social networks include a content sharing aspect that allow users to upload view and share content such as video content image content audio content and so on. Other users of the social network may comment on the shared content discover new content locate updates share content and otherwise interact with the provided content. The shared content may include content from professional content creators e.g. movie clips TV clips and music videos as well as content from amateur content creators e.g. video blogging and short original videos.

A social network with content sharing capabilities such as a content sharing platform may provide centralized locations for a content owner to showcase their content. These centralized locations are sometimes known as a channel. The channel may be presented by the content sharing platform via one or more channel pages. The channel may be used by a content owner to convince new viewers to subscribe to content of the content owner. Furthermore a channel may be used by a content owner as a central location for subscribed viewers to comment on content find the latest updates and discover new content from the channel owner.

Similar to a television or radio experience when users identify a favorite channel they typically prefer to watch or listen to that channel without interruptions or having to decide what to watch next. Some content sharing platforms allow users to create playlists that allow the user to create a list of favorite media items to automatically play without interruption. However generation of such playlists is a manual process that can take time and resources to understand and enable. Moreover these playlists quickly get repetitive and outdated as channels continually release new material.

The following is a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate any scope of the particular implementations of the disclosure or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In one implementation a method for generating content sharing platform playlists and subscriptions based on user history is disclosed. The method includes identifying one or more entities of a content sharing platform to which a user is not subscribed providing a user interface UI associated with the user the UI displaying the identified one or more entities as recommended suggestions to the user receiving by the user via the UI an indication of a selection of an entity of the identified one or more entities generating a subscription to the selected entity for the user on the content sharing platform using content items associated with the subscribed entity to originate a playlist for the user and providing the playlist on the UI associated with the user.

In one implementation the identified one or more entities are identified based on at least one of current channel subscriptions of the user or an activity history of the user on the content sharing platform. In addition the identifying the one or more entities of the method may further include determining entities associated with activity history content items that occur in the activity history of the user at least one of more than a predetermined number of occurrences over a time interval or more than a predetermined frequency of occurrences over the time interval. In some implementations each of the one or more entities uploads content items to the content sharing platform for users of the content sharing platform to access. In other implementations each of the one or more entities is associated with at least one of a user channel of the content sharing platform or a topic channel of the content sharing platform.

Furthermore the playlist described above may include a plurality of content items that stream to the user without interruption. Furthermore the playlist may include one or more other content items that are not associated with the subscribed entity. The identifying feature of the method may also include determining content items viewed by the user for each content item viewed by the user determining other content items with a co occurrence of views across users of the content sharing platform and selecting the one or more entities with a number of the other content items that exceeds a threshold.

In one implementation the determining the other content items with the co occurrence of views further comprises accessing a data structure of co occurrences to identify the other content items wherein the data structure comprises an entry for each content item of the content sharing platform that comprises a list of the other content items for the entry having the co occurrence of views for the entry. In addition the user may also be a member of a social network separate from the content sharing platform and wherein connections of the user on the social network are used to identify the one or more entities.

In additional implementations computing devices for performing the operations of the above described implementations are also disclosed. Additionally in implementations of the disclosure a computer readable storage media stores methods for performing the operations of the above described implementations.

Implementations are described for content sharing platform playlists and subscriptions based on user history. In one implementation a content sharing platform utilizes subscriptions and activity history of a user to originate an automatically generated playlist for the user. This playlist can be promoted to the user on a homepage of the user or any other user interface e.g. a GUI presented by a mobile application . The user is presented with a list of entities e.g. content artists such as music artists based on the user s subscriptions and activity history. When the user selects one of these listed entities the user receives an automatically generated playlist originated by that selected entity as well as a connection e.g. subscription friending liking etc. to the entity that is automatically generated without the user s interaction. In one implementation the playlist includes content items from the entity as well as content items from similar entities.

In one implementation a method of the disclosure includes identifying one or more entities of a content sharing platform to which a user is not subscribed via at least one channel and providing a user interface UI associated with the user the UI displaying the identified one or more entities as recommended suggestions to the user. The method further includes receiving by the user via the UI an indication of a selection of an entity of the identified one or more entities. In addition the method includes generating a subscription to a channel associated with the selected entity for the user on the content sharing platform. The method may also include using content items associated with the selected entity to originate a playlist for the user wherein the playlist comprises one or more other content items that are not associated with the selected entity and providing the playlist on the UI associated with the user.

Implementations of the disclosure have a different layer of granularity than previous solutions for finding and consuming content on content sharing platforms. Previously a user could play content from their subscribed channels one at a time and the user had to make a decision after each content item finished about which content item to watch next. This resulted in a high frequency of decisions and interactions in a short period of time with the content sharing platform creation of friction and discontentment in the content sharing platform experience for the user. Implementations of the disclosure overcome these disadvantages by removing the need to make such frequent decisions by generating an automatic playlist for the user based on the user s subscriptions and activity history and also providing automatic subscriptions for the user to increase user integration with the content sharing platform.

Content sharing platform is a social network that allows users to connect to and share information and content items with each other. Many social networks include a content sharing aspect that allow users to upload view tag and share content such as video content image content audio content and so on. Other users of the social network may comment on the shared content discover new content locate updates share content and otherwise interact with the provided content. The shared content may include content from professional content creators e.g. movie clips TV clips audio clips and music videos as well as content from amateur content creators e.g. video blogging and short original videos. In some implementations the shared content is stored in content data store of content sharing platform .

As illustrated content sharing platform includes front end server a recommendation engine a playlist generation module a user data store a content data store and a co occurrence data store . A data store may include but is not limited to a table a database a directory a repository and one or more files to name a few examples.

Content sharing platform is capable of operating within a single server device or on multiple server devices. For example although each of front end server recommendation engine playlist generation module user data store content data store and co occurrence data store are depicted in as single disparate components these components may be implemented together in a single device or networked in various combinations of multiple different devices that operate together. Examples of devices may include but are not limited to servers mainframe computers networked computers process based devices and similar type of systems and devices.

One or more client devices may be in communication with the front end server over the network . The client device may be any type of computing device for example a device including a processor a computer readable medium and a memory. The client device may be for example a personal computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular telephone other mobile devices etc. In some implementations the client device may be executing a browser application or other application adapted to communicate over Internet related protocols e.g. TCP IP and HTTP and or display a user interface. While only a single client device is shown in network architecture may support a large number of concurrent sessions with many client devices .

During operation of network architecture a user may access content sharing platform via client device over network . The front end server receives communications from the client device and processes and or directs these communications accordingly. In one implementation the front end server comprises a processing device and a computer readable memory.

In one implementation the client device may run an operating system not shown that manages hardware and software of the client device . A browser not shown may execute on the client device e.g. on the OS of the client machines . The browser may be a web browser that can access content served by a content sharing platform by navigating to web pages provided by the content sharing platform e.g. using the hypertext transport protocol HTTP . The browser may issue queries and commands to the content sharing platform such as commands to access a specific content item commands to share a content item commands to optimize the content item and so forth.

In some implementations client device includes applications that are associated with a service provided by content sharing platform . Examples of a client device that may use such applications apps include mobile phones smart televisions tablet computers and so forth. The applications or apps may access content provided by content sharing platform issue commands to content sharing platform receive content from content sharing platform and so on without visiting web pages of content sharing platform .

Via an app or a browser the client device may access content items provided by content sharing platform . In one implementation the content items are provided as a channel or other content source that clients may subscribe to. Users may select content items for viewing via the app or browser. The app or browser of the client device may then receive content items that are maintained by content sharing platform . Additionally the client device may also upload content items to the content sharing platform for storage in a repository such as content data store via the app or browser.

In general functions described in one implementation as being performed by the content sharing platform can also be performed on the client device in other implementations if appropriate. In addition the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The content sharing platform can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces and thus is not limited to use in websites.

In one implementation content sharing platform provides a centralized location for a user to showcase objects related to the user such as information and content pertaining to the user. In one implementation an object includes a post a content item e.g. audio video image a comment a message an email message a status update a favorability indication e.g. a like a subscription event a tagging event a viewing event e.g. click and so on. The centralized location is sometimes known as a user page or a channel. In addition the representation of the user on the content sharing platform may sometimes be referred to as an entity .

As discussed above a channel can be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic or theme. The data content can be media content chosen by a user media content made available by a user media content uploaded by a user media content chosen by a content provider media content chosen by a broadcaster etc. In some implementations a channel is created and owned by a user of the content sharing platform and may be referred to as a user channel. In other implementations a channel may be generated and owned by the content sharing platform to be used as a central location for all content related to a certain topic and may be referred to as a topic channel.

Front end server is communicably coupled to recommendation engine and playlist generation module which each may reside on the same machine as front end server or a different machine. Each of recommendation engine and playlist generation module may be implemented in hardware software firmware or any combination of the above.

In implementations of the disclosure recommendation engine identifies and provides content recommendations to a user of the content sharing platform for use in generating a new connection e.g. subscription friend etc. for the user to an entity associated with the content recommendations and originating e.g. seeding initializing etc. a playlist for the user. A playlist can be defined as a collection of one or more content items from entities of the content sharing platform that can be viewed in sequential or shuffled order without interaction from the user. In one implementation recommendation engine includes a recommendation module a UI generation module and a subscription module .

When a user accesses the content sharing platform they are directed to a home page of the user or another GUI representing a home page of the user. The home page may include a recommendation UI generated by recommendation engine . In one implementation this recommendation UI includes one or more entities of the content sharing platform that are identified by recommendation module based on current subscriptions of the user and or an activity history of the user. Subscriptions may include a connection between the user and another entity on the content sharing platform. In some implementations a subscription includes friending an entity liking an entity following an entity and so on. Although the description herein references the term subscription other terms denoting a connection between a user and an entity of the content sharing platform are also encompassed.

Recommendation module may access user subscription data store to identify all subscriptions of a user. The subscriptions of the user may include subscriptions to user channels and subscriptions to topic channels of the content sharing platform . In addition an activity history which may be maintained in the user data store may be accessed to identify content interests of the user. The activity history may include a history of content items previously viewed by the user content items liked by the user playlist manually generated by the user connections from other social networks external to the content sharing platform indicating interests of the user and so on.

Based on one or both of the existing user subscriptions and the activity history of the user the recommendation module may determine entities of the content sharing platform represented by the subscriptions and or activities. Then the recommendation module may select one or more of these entities to provide to UI generation module for presentation as a recommendation to the user. For example the identified entities may be ranked according to quantity and frequency of interaction by the user and the top X number of entities in this list selected. In one implementation if a user is subscribed to both the user channel for an entity and the topic channel for the entity then the entity is not selected as one of the recommendations by recommendation module .

UI generation module may then generate a UI for display on the home page of the user to present these selected entities to the user for the user s selection purposes. In one implementation a UI includes a document a portion of document or a set of documents rendered in HyperText Markup Language HTML .

When the user selects one of the recommended entities from the UI the recommendation engine performs two actions. The first action is for the subscription module to subscribe the user to the topic channel and or user channel for the entity. The second action is to pass the subscribed channel to the playlist generation module for use as a source to generate and or initialize a new playlist for display on the homepage of the user.

With respect to the first action the subscription module receives the indication of the user s selection via the provided UI of one of the recommended entities. The subscription module may then determine which of the channels i.e. user and or topic they user does not have a subscription to for the entity. Then the subscription module creates a subscription for the user to the topic and or user channel that the user is not subscribed to for the selected entity. This subscription is then displayed to the user on the home page of the user as one of the user s current subscriptions. The subscription information may also be stored in the user data store .

With respect to the second action the recommendation engine for example via the subscription module may pass the selected entity to the playlist generation module . In one implementation the playlist generation module may be an application programming interface API or servlet configured to access the content data store to select one or more content items associated with the entity to use as a source to initialize a playlist. In other implementations the playlist generation module may be a server device configured to perform those tasks. The playlist may include content items generated by the entity as well as content items generated by entities that are similar to the entity. For example playlist generation module may reference co occurrence data store to identify one or more content items with a high co occurrence rate to content items of the entity used to initialize the playlist and select these identified one or more content items for inclusion in the generated playlist.

Once a playlist is generated the playlist generation module may provide the playlist to the user via a UI on the homepage of the user. In one implementation the playlist generation module may work in conjunction with the UI generation module to provide this playlist. In other implementations the playlist generation module provides the playlist utilizing its own UI generation logic. During viewing of the content items of the generated playlist the user may access and subscribe to other entities associated with the content items of the playlist. For example when a content item of playlist is shown during performance of the playlist an icon or link to subscribe to the entity associated with the content item may be provided in the UI next to an icon and or description of the currently playing content item of the playlist.

In some implementations the generated playlists e.g. a playlist object comprising the source content item identifier s user identifier number of videos etc. may be associated with an identifier and stored in a data store not shown of the content sharing platform . As a result the generated playlist may be persisted on the homepage of the user for any subsequent visits by the user.

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

For simplicity of explanation the methods of this disclosure are depicted and described as a series of acts. However acts in accordance with this disclosure can occur in various orders and or concurrently and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methods in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In addition those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methods could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally it should be appreciated that the methods disclosed in this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computing devices. The term article of manufacture as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or storage media. In one implementation method may be performed by recommendation engine of content sharing platform as shown in .

Referring to at block method begins when the recommendation engine determines that user is accessing a home page or other GUI associated with the user on the content sharing platform. In one implementation a front end server may send a signal to the recommendation engine of such access by the user. Then at block entities of current subscriptions of the user are identified. In one implementation a user data store maintaining user subscription information for each user may be referenced to identify the subscriptions and their associated entities on the content sharing platform. A subscription to an entity may include both a user channel subscription that is generated and owned by the entity and a topic channel subscription that is generated by the content sharing platform to collect all content on the content sharing platform that is associated with the entity but not necessarily generated by the entity .

Then at block one or more entities are identified from an activity history of the user. The activity history may include a history of content items previously viewed by the user content items liked by the user playlists manually generated by the user connections from other social networks external to the content sharing platform indicating interests of the user and so on. The entities associated with these content items may be determined for example via a lookup of the content item and its associated originator. In some implementations a filter may be applied to these determined entities to return those entities whose occurrences in the activity history of the user exceed a predetermined number of occurrences and or exceed a predetermined frequency of occurrences. This filter may be applied over the entire span of the user s activity history or during a predetermined interval of the user s activity history. In one implementation a system administrator of the content sharing platform may establish the configuration for identifying entities from the activity history.

At block the identified entities that the user is subscribed to via the user channel and or the topic channel associated with the entity are removed from consideration. Subsequently at block the remaining identified entities are ranked according to at least one of a quantity and or a frequency of access by the user. Then at block a predetermined number of the highest ranked entities are selected by the recommendation engine. If the number of ranked entities is less than the predetermined number then the entire set of ranked entities may be selected.

Lastly at block the selected entities are displayed as suggested recommendations for a playlist for the user. These selected entities may be displayed in the GUI associated with the user e.g. a homepage of the user on the content sharing platform. In one implementation a thumbnail image of each of the selected entities is used as a representation of the entity in the suggested recommendation UI. In other implementations different combinations of description and images may be utilized in the suggested recommendations UI.

Referring to at block method begins when a selection of suggested recommended entity is received from a user. In one implementation the selection is received via a UI provided one or more suggested recommendations of entities for which the user could select from to generate a playlist. For example the user may select an entity from the UI generated at block of .

At block the recommendation engine determines whether the user already has either or both of a user channel subscription to the selected entity and or a topic channel subscription to the selected entity. In some cases a user may have one or the other of the channel subscriptions while in other cases the user may have neither of the channel subscriptions. At block for the channel subscriptions to the entity that the user does not have the recommendation engine creates an associated channel subscription for the user to the entity channel. In one implementation the recommendation engine adds the channel subscription to a user data store maintaining the subscriptions associated with the user.

At block an indication of the subscription is displayed on a home page of the user on the content sharing platform. Then at block one or more content items associated with the channel s of the selected entity are used as source s to initialize a playlist generated for the user. In one implementation the one or more content items may be accessed from a content data store of the content sharing platform. For example content item IDs associated with the entity may be used as the source for initialization of the playlist.

Then at block the playlist is generated using the source content item s . In one implementation a co occurrence data store is referenced with the content item IDs of the source items to select one or more other content items that are related in terms of co occurrence views across the content sharing platform to the source items and these selected content items may be used to populate the playlist. As a result content items associated with the selected entity as well as related content items associated with other entities may be provided to the user as part of the playlist without other interaction from the user.

Lastly at block a UI for the generated playlist is displayed on the homepage of the user on the content sharing platform. In one implementation the playlist UI includes a description of the selected entity used to originate the playlist as well as a list of the content items populating the playlist and optionally a description associated with each content item .

The GUI may also include items such as side bars and page content that are controlled by the content sharing platform and personalized based on the user. The side bars may provide menus for navigation and shortcuts to the overall content sharing platform. In some implementations these side bars are not specific to the GUI . In one implementation the page content may include activity feed information specific to the user.

Referring to the GUI of is shown after the user has selected entity from recommended suggestions section of . As illustrated entity has been removed from recommended suggestions section and a new recommended suggestion entity has taken its place. In addition the new subscription to entity is shown in side bar as subscription . For example entity may be added as a user subscription according to the description above with respect to and method of .

Referring to the GUI of is shown after the subscribed selected entity is used as a source to initialize a playlist shown in playlist section . As shown playlist section includes an identifier e.g. thumbnail and title of the selected and subscribed entity and at least a portion of a list of content items that populate the generated playlist.
