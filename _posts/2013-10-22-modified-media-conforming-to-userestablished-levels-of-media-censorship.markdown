title: Modified media conforming to user-established levels of media censorship
abstract: User defined controls for media censorship may define values for content of the media for a user. Controls can be specific to nudity in the media, sexuality of the media, language offensiveness of the media, and/or violence in the media. When a user requests a media instance, a default version can be checked for default artifacts that violate the controls. Replacement artifacts can be created for each violating default artifact. Modified media can be created that replaces the default artifacts with the replacement ones. The modified media can be provided to the user in response to the user request.

This application claims the benefit of Utility application Ser. No. 13 152 329 entitled Altering Embedded Digital Media content Responsive to User or Provider Customization Selections filed Jun. 3 2011 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Utility application Ser. No. 13 152 329 claims priority to provisional application 61 359 518 filed on Jun. 29 2010.

The field of the invention is the field of digital media more specifically to modified media conforming to user established levels of media censorship.

Digital media video and audio such as movies contain product placement and are accountable to various levels of consumer ratings for example movies can be rated G PG 13 R etc. depending on the level of various content such as violence language nudity and the like . Such categories and their corresponding ratings vary internationally and few digital media is released as both clean i.e. G or PG 13 as well as uncensored i.e. rated R versions. These consumer ratings are utilized globally as guidelines for culturally accepted or suggested behavior and cultural attitude norm towards given subjects covered by the consumer ratings. There currently exists no facilitator to post production alter media content to quickly switch from one level of consumer rating to another.

With regard to the product placement component of media artifacts a disadvantage lies in the fact that currently product placement embedded within the digital media artifact for example a character holding a can of beer is frozen at time of distribution and cannot be altered post production for example the same character holding a can of beer cannot post production be shown holding a can of soda instead should a user or media provider prefer the soda to the beer at any given point in time post production . Furthermore product placement is targeted for a general audience for which the artifact is geared towards rather than for specific individuals or consumers.

The disclosure presents a solution for manipulating digital content based on user or provider customization selections. Enabling customization of embedded digital content and manipulation of product placement post production has key advantages Among these advantages is that the disclosed solution allows providers to capitalize on further marketing financing gives users the opportunity to receive targeted product placement that is tailored to their individual preferences and provides a means of efficiently and appropriately adapting media artifacts in accordance with various desired consumer rating levels.

For example in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure incorporating parental controls may allow for a quick and user friendly way of switching between a version of a specific movie that is rated R to a PG 13 version of the particular movie in question by utilizing the system to alter the audio and or video stream accordingly. In another embodiment the media provider may select to manipulate the digital media artifact to utilize embedded product placement for user specific targeted marketing rather than being confined to tailor marketing with embedded product placement for a general target audience profile.

The disclosure recognizes that different user audiences of media react to sensitive situations differently. For example one audience may find a certain sexual situation offensive while another will find the same content non offensive and entertaining. Factors for determining appropriateness of media include viewer age cultural norms time based norms personal preferences and religion beliefs. For example derogative ethnic based language included in media produced one hundred years ago which was acceptable by the standards of that age may be unacceptable by more modern standards.

Despite a wide range of perspectives on content appropriateness a one sized fits all approach is often taken for consumable media. For example the Motion Picture Association of America establishes guidelines like G PG PG 13 R and the like for movies. This may or may not be a valid guide for a specific viewer. For example a conservative parent may not find excessive drinking or sexual innuendo un suitable for their teenage child yet a movie may be rated PG. The present disclosure permits end users to control media ratings at a relatively low level of granularity and to even modify media content to suit their personal censorship preferences.

For example a user specific set of preferences can be established for media. These preferences can establish a set of user defined controls for media censorship. The controls may define content of the media. A violence control a nudity control a sexuality control and an offensive language control may be included. Each control can permit a user to establish censorship values for future media. The values may specify a level high medium low a specific type of censorship or an enumerated list of what is acceptable and what is not for any censorship category.

When a user requests media after the controls are established the media can be checked or analyzed. During this process a default version of a media instance can be examined for default artifacts those present in the default version that violate one or more of the user controls. For example a scene where nudity violates a nudity control can be detected and flagged as a default artifact in violation of a censorship control. A set of replacement artifacts can be determined for the default artifacts where the replacement artifacts do not violate any of the censorship controls. A replacement artifact for a nudity violating one may use digital signal processing DSP techniques to generate clothes over an otherwise exposed body part of a video. In another less sophisticated embodiment a region may be obscured via an overlay or substitution region so an exposed and offensive to the nudity control body part is not viewable. A modified version of the media instance is created where the replacement artifacts have been substituted for the default artifacts in violation of the censorship controls. This modified version can be provided to the requesting user in response to the request.

The innovation described herein works with a variety of different media types which include video audio and text based media. The substitutions may sanitize the media so that it satisfies more stringent censorship standards which are defined by a specific user. Conversely one type of user may utilize the disclosure s techniques to produce a modified version of a media instance having more lax censorship standards. The modified media may have a level of censored content per user specific customizations which no production version of the media instance has. Thus a modified version of a television show can be cleaner than an aired production version . Similarly a modified version of a movie may be if the censorship controls incited that the user s preferences are for especially profane language in his her movies less clean than any production version. As an example of a less clean adjustment if an end user wanted Mary Poppins to talk in language that would make a drunken sailor blush a high level of profanity settings can be adjusted so that the modified version of the media instance will be delivered to the end user to suit this desire.

The present innovation can be implemented for a specific device DVD BLURAY player television computer for a specific media platform AMAZON MOVIES NETFLIX GOOGLE PLAY etc. or for any media provided to a specific end user. Advertisements may be selected or adjusted to conform to the user defined censorship settings in one embodiment. Further these settings may even be conveyed to advertisers to help target direct marketing campaigns based on a user s censorship preferences which may be indicative of type of products that are best targeted for that individual .
