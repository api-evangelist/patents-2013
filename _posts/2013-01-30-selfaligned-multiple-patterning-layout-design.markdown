Electronic design tools allow designers to layout simulate and analyze electrical components such as standard cells and integrated circuits. In an example a designer may create a design layout for a standard cell. Once the design layout is complete complex post processing is used to make the design layout self aligned multiple patterning SAMP compliant. For example the design layout is adjusted using mandrel pattern and passive fill pattern. During fabrication a trim mask or a cut mask is used to either retain a portion of the design layout corresponding to the electrical component or to remove a portion of the design layout that does not correspond to the electrical component.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One or more techniques and systems for performing design layout are provided herein. In some embodiments the design layout corresponds to an electrical component such as a standard cell configured to provide logic based functionality or storage functionality. The electrical component can be designed using at least one of a mandrel pattern or a passive fill pattern. Because the design layout can conflict with physical limitations of a cut mask used to remove unwanted portions of the design layout during fabrication a design rule violation such as a violation of a sizing constraint associated with the cut mask may be identified and resolved for verification of the design layout as self aligned multiple patterning SAMP compliant as provided herein. It is appreciated that the techniques described herein are not limited to a cut mask used to remove unwanted portions of the design layout but also apply to a trim mask used to retain desired portions of the design layout.

In some embodiments an initial design layout associated with an electrical component is received. The initial design layout comprises a first pattern associated with a first pattern process such as one or more polygons corresponding to a passive fill pattern process and a second pattern associated with a second pattern process such as one or more polygons corresponding to a mandrel pattern process that represents polygons as mandrel surrounded by spacer. For example a multiple patterning technology MPT compliant layout is decomposed into one or more pattern groups such that a first pattern group is assigned to the first pattern process and one or more additional pattern groups are assigned to the second pattern process. An initial cut pattern is generated for the initial design layout. The initial cut pattern corresponds to one or more portions of the initial design layout that are to be removed during formation of the electrical component. One or more sizing constraints such as a minimum width constraint a minimum length constraint etc. are used to identify whether the initial cut pattern has a design rule violation.

Responsive to identifying a design rule violation associated with the initial cut pattern the initial design layout is modified to generate a modified initial design layout. In an example a shape size or configuration of the first pattern such as a first polygon of the first pattern is modified. In another example a shape size or configuration of the second pattern such as a second polygon of the second pattern is modified. In another example an assist mandrel such as a dummy mandrel is inserted into the design layout. In this way the modified initial design layout is generated.

An updated cut pattern is generated based upon the modified initial design layout. Because of the modifications within the modified initial design layout the updated cut pattern does not result in the design rule violation. In an example the updated cut pattern is modified based upon at least one of a lithography aware optimization or an electrical rule aware optimization. In another example a first portion but not a second portion of the updated cut pattern is selectively used to generate a final cut pattern based upon an electrical isolation rule between polygons associated with the modified design layout. That is the final cut pattern provides electrical isolation between one or more polygons representing the electrical component using passive fill pattern for isolation. The updated cut pattern or the final cut pattern is applied to the modified initial design layout to generate a final design layout. In an example the final design layout is verified as self aligned multiple patterning SAMP compliant. In some embodiments the updated cut pattern or the final cut pattern are used to generate a trim pattern that is applied to the modified initial design layout to generate the final layout.

The initial design layout comprise a second pattern associated with a second pattern process such as one or more polygons that are to be formed by a mandrel formation pattern process. In an example the second pattern is associated with one or more mandrel pattern masks such that a first portion of the second pattern is formed using a first mandrel mask and a second portion of the second pattern is formed using a second mandrel mask. A stitch is used to combine the first portion and the second portion . In an example of receiving the initial design layout a multiple patterning technology MPT compliant layout is received. The MPT compliant layout is decomposed into two or more pattern groups such as groupings of one or more polygons. A first pattern group is assigned to the first pattern process to generate the first pattern . One or more additional pattern groups are assigned to the second pattern process to generate the second pattern . In this way the initial design layout is generated.

In some embodiments the second pattern comprises mandrel that is surrounded by spacer . In some embodiments the layout compliance component in example of defines the spacer within the initial design layout . During fabrication the spacer is grown relatively uniformly around the mandrel portion of the second pattern . Unwanted portions of the initial design layout that are not used for the electrical component such as a region that is not associated with the first pattern the second pattern or the spacer are designated by a cut pattern for removal by one or more cut masks.

At an initial cut pattern is generated for the initial design layout . In some embodiments the layout compliance component in example of generates the initial cut pattern . In an example the initial cut pattern is used to remove regions of the initial design layout that are not used to form the electrical component during fabrication.

An eighth design rule violation is identified based upon a sizing constraint corresponding to a minimum surface area connecting two portions of the cut mask. A ninth design rule violation is identified based upon other constraints corresponding to the physical formation or use of a cut mask.

In this way the modified initial design layout is generated. In some embodiments the layout compliance component in example of is configured to update the spacer of the initial design layout based upon the modified initial design layout to generate updated spacer for the modified initial design layout . In an example a first updated spacer is added to the spacer based upon the first mandrel pattern addition . In another example a second updated spacer is added to the spacer based upon the second mandrel pattern addition .

In this way the updated cut pattern of is generated such as by the layout compliance component in example of . In an example the updated cut pattern corresponds to one or more cut masks such as a first cut mask and a second cut mask used during fabrication.

At the updated cut pattern is applied to the modified initial design layout to generate a final design layout . In an example the final design layout in example of illustrates the second pattern such as a mandrel pattern of the modified initial design layout and the updated cut pattern . In this way the final design layout corresponds to one or more mandrel pattern masks and one or more cut masks used to fabricate the electrical component but does not illustrate spacer or passive fill that is used to form the electrical component. In some embodiments the layout compliance component in example of is configured to generate the final design layout .
