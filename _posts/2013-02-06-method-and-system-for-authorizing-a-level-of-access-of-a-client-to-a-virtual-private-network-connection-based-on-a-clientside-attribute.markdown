The present application claims priority and is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 465 915 titled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR AUTHORIZING A LEVEL OF ACCESS OF A CLIENT TO A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK CONNECTION BASED ON A CLIENT SIDE ATTRIBUTE filed on Aug. 21 2006 all of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to a method and system for authorizing a level of access of a client to a virtual private network connection based on a client side attribute.

Before an endpoint gains access to corporate enterprise network infrastructure and resources it is increasingly becoming necessary to determine that the endpoint has undergone host security checks and audits to verify that it meets corporate information technology policies. Examples of such checks include without limitation verifying that the anti virus software on the endpoint is up to date that the latest operating system patches have been installed and that no malicious software is executing on the endpoint. Performing these checks minimizes the infection of other connected corporate assets by a compromised endpoint.

Conventional methods of access control typically require receipt and evaluation of authentication credentials from a client prior to granting access. The credentials are typically presented to an access infrastructure or other security gateway which determines what types of access may be provided to the client. Methods for requesting and receiving these credentials typically generate additional administrative burdens. For example if a user is entering the credentials into a user interface the request for the required credentials must be translated into a format understandable the user for example from the expression in which the policy was added to a request identifying the explicit credentials required for evaluation of the policy. When the credentials are received from the user in some methods a policy engine applies a policy to the credentials in making an access control decision. This typically requires transmission from a component receiving the credentials to the component making the access control decision generating additional delay in situations where the components are remotely located from each other and from the client.

A method minimizing administrative burden in requesting user credentials by transmitting an expression of a policy to a client without modifying the format of the expression would be desirable. A method for evaluating such an expression by the client minimizing the number of components required to reach an access control decision would also be desirable.

In one aspect a method for authorizing a level of access of a client to a virtual private network connection based on a client side attribute includes establishing by an appliance a control connection with a client upon receiving a client request to establish a virtual private network connection with a network.

In still another embodiment the client identifies a client side attribute identifying a version of one of the following antivirus software personal firewall software anti spam software and internet security software.

In one embodiment the appliance evaluates a second clause of the security string. In another embodiment the client evaluates a clause of the security string comprising one or more logical operations. In still another embodiment the appliance transmits the response comprising the result of the evaluation to a policy engine. In yet another embodiment the appliance assigns the client to the authorization group responsive to an application of a policy by the policy engine to the result of the evaluation.
