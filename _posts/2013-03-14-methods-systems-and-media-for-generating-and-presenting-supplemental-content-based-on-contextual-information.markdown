Methods systems and media for generating and presenting supplemental content based on contextual information are provided.

Many viewers are interested in interacting with the media content that they are viewing. In response some content providers or other third parties have created applications for mobile devices that provide a viewer with a poll a quiz or other content relating to the programming provided by a particular content provider. For example upon downloading an application corresponding to particular piece of media content e.g. a particular television program a viewer can use a mobile device to launch the content specific application which provides a quiz or other related content. This related content is often generated by a person that develops content for the content specific application relating to the particular content provided by the content provider.

However generating content using these approaches can be costly and time consuming. In addition some content does not have any associated supplemental content. This may disappoint some viewers and in some cases may cause certain viewers to cease watching the content that lacks associated supplemental content. Moreover new content is constantly being distributed to viewers and as such it can be difficult to constantly generate new supplemental content.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter mechanisms for generating and presenting supplemental content based on contextual information are provided.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a method for presenting content to a user is provided the method comprising identifying using a hardware processor a program based on first media data identifying using the hardware processor one or more keywords associated with the program determining using the hardware processor a popularity score associated with each of the one or more keywords obtaining using the hardware processor one or more properties associated with a particular keyword of the one or more keywords based on the popularity score associated with each keyword generating using the hardware processor supplemental content for the program based on the one or more properties receiving using the hardware processor a request for supplemental content and second media data from a computing device and upon determining that the second media data corresponds to the program causing using the hardware processor the generated supplemental content to be presented by the computing device.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a system for presenting content to a user is provided the system comprising a hardware processor that is configured to identify a program based on first media data identify one or more keywords associated with the program determine a popularity score associated with each of the one or more keywords obtain one or more properties associated with a particular keyword of the one or more keywords based on the popularity score associated with each keyword generate supplemental content for the program based on the one or more properties receive a request for supplemental content and second media data from a computing device and upon determining that the second media data corresponds to the program causing using the hardware processor the generated supplemental content to be presented by the computing device.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a non transitory computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method for presenting content to a user is provided. The method comprising identifying a program based on first media data identifying one or more keywords associated with the program determining a popularity score associated with each of the one or more keywords obtaining one or more properties associated with a particular keyword of the one or more keywords based on the popularity score associated with each keyword generating supplemental content for the program based on the one or more properties receiving a request for supplemental content and second media data from a computing device and upon determining that the second media data corresponds to the program causing the generated supplemental content to be presented by the computing device.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter a system for presenting content to a user is provided. The system comprising means for identifying a program based on first media data means for identifying one or more keywords associated with the program means for determining a popularity score associated with each of the one or more keywords means for obtaining one or more properties associated with a particular keyword of the one or more keywords based on the popularity score associated with each keyword means for generating supplemental content for the program based on the one or more properties means for receiving a request for supplemental content and second media data from a computing device and upon determining that the second media data corresponds to the program means for causing the generated supplemental content to be presented by the computing device.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for receiving an audio fingerprint representing audio data that corresponds to the program means for comparing the received audio fingerprint with a plurality of audio fingerprints relating corresponding to media content and means for identifying the program based on the comparison.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for receiving a channel corresponding to the program means for retrieving at least one of subtitle data video data and metadata associated with the program based on the received channel and means for using an image recognition technique on the subtitle data the video data or the metadata to identify the one or more keywords associated with the program wherein the image recognition technique is selected from at least one of optical character recognition image recognition and facial recognition.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for obtaining popularity information associated with each of the one or more keywords wherein the popularity information includes at least one of search popularity information relating to the keyword social network popularity information relating to the keyword and a number of web pages containing the keyword means for assigning a weight to each piece of obtained popularity information and means for generating the popularity score based on the assigned weight.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for ranking the one or more keywords associated with program based on the popularity score and means for selecting the particular keyword based on the ranking.

In some implementations the supplemental content includes at least one of a quiz question and a poll question.

In some implementations the system further comprises means for causing the generated supplemental content to be presented on a mobile device associated with the computing device in response to receiving the request for supplemental content from the computing device.

In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter mechanisms for generating and presenting supplemental content based on contextual information are provided.

In some implementations media data related to various programs can be captured and used to generate keywords associated with the program. For example video data audio data electronic program guide data and or subtitle data related to a program can be retrieved and or captured. In a more particular example an audio fingerprint of the audio data provided by the program can be generated where the audio fingerprint is compared with audio fingerprints of known programs to determine the channel that a user is currently tuned. The channel information can then be used to retrieve video data audio data electronic program guide data subtitle data and or other data relating to the program presented on the channel which can analyzed to extract one or more keywords.

In some implementations various keywords can be extracted from the media data using any suitable techniques such as facial recognition image recognition optical character recognition or any other suitable techniques. For example actors and actresses associated with a program can be extracted as keywords. As another example landmarks e.g. the Eiffel Tower included in video data associated with a program can be extracted as keywords. It should be noted that extracted keywords can include any suitable entities topics characteristics and or features relating to the media data.

In some implementations a popularity score can be determined for each keyword that is extracted from the media data associated with the program. Additionally keywords with a relatively low popularity score can be discarded and properties of the keywords with a relatively higher popularity score can be found. Such properties can include popular information about each of the keywords such as height of a tall building or landmark net worth of a well known wealthy person birthplace of a person population of a city etc.

In some implementations supplemental content such as a quiz or a poll can be generated based on a particular property of a particular keyword. In some cases the most popular property of a keyword e.g. a property that is searched for most often in association with a particular keyword can be used as the basis for supplemental content. For example if a keyword chosen to be used as the basis for a question is the Statue of Liberty a property used to generate a question may be the name of the artist that designed the statue. Additionally a quiz question can be generated that asks a user who designed the Statute of the Liberty and incorrect answers to the question can be generated based on other properties of the keyword e.g. properties related to the Statue of Liberty or based on properties of the correct answer. For example the correct answer to the question Who designed the Statue of Liberty is Frederic Bartholdi who is a French sculptor. Incorrect answers can be generated by determining the names of other people associated with the statue of liberty such as other artists associated with the Statue of Liberty other French people other French artists other sculptors that lived during the time when the Statue of Liberty was built etc.

It should be noted that the popularity score can be based on any suitable popularity information such as search popularity information that provides an indication of the popularity of a given keyword in search queries e.g. search engine data social network popularity information that provides an indication of the occurrence of a given keyword in one or more social media sources e.g. social messaging sources and the number of times a given keyword occurs within a set of webpages.

In some implementations supplemental content can be requested by a user using a computing device such as a television a smart television a digital media receiver a digital video recorder a set top box a personal computer a game console a smartphone a tablet computer or any other suitable media device. In response the user can be presented with supplemental content such as a poll or a quiz that is based on a current program. Alternatively in response to the computing device being associated with a second screen device e.g. a tablet computer connected with the computing device over a suitable communications network the computing device can transmit the request for supplemental content associated with the current program and the second screen device can receive the supplemental content for presenting to the user.

These mechanisms can be used in a variety of applications. For example these mechanisms can be used to generate supplemental content for any program that is captured using the mechanisms described herein. As another example these mechanisms can be used to generate interactive content that keeps viewers of a program engaged with the program. As yet another example these mechanisms can be used to generate relevant or topical supplemental content in real time during a program s original run or when a user chooses to playback content e.g. over the top content recorded content etc. . As still another example these mechanisms can generate supplemental content for a program without requiring a person to know what will be relevant to the program or spend time assembling information or writing supplemental content.

Turning to an illustrative example of a process for generating and presenting supplemental content based on contextual information is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. In some implementations a content generation application for generating and or presenting supplemental content can receive media data at . This media data can be related to one or more programs and can include any suitable media data. For example in some implementations media data can include video data audio data electronic program guide EPG data subtitle data metadata any other suitable data or any suitable combination of such data. In a more particular example media data can include an audio fingerprint that is generated by an application executing on a mobile device based on captured audio data. The audio fingerprint can be transmitted from the mobile device to the content generation application for determining the program being watched by the user or other further processing.

In some implementations the content generation application can record signals related to one or more programs from various sources such as programs broadcast over the air programs broadcast by a cable television provider programs broadcast by a telephone television provider programs broadcast by a satellite television provider on demand programs over the top programs Internet content streaming programs etc.

Using the recorded signals the content generation application can extract media data that can include for example audio fingerprints from audio data corresponding to known programs subtitles information from programs screenshots and or video clips from video information corresponding to known programs media guidance information etc. For example audio fingerprint data can be extracted from audio data associated with a program using any suitable techniques for extracting an audio fingerprint from the audio data. As another example subtitle data can be extracted from closed captioning information associated with the recorded signal of a program or can be generated based on audio data using any suitable techniques for generating subtitle information from audio data. As yet another example screenshots can be extracted from video data associated with a program using any suitable techniques for extracting a screenshot from the video data. As still another example guidance data such as program title episode title season number episode number cast a plot summary running time original air date and or time or any other suitable information provided in an electronic program guide can be extracted from electronic program guide information associated with a program using any suitable techniques. As a further example metadata e.g. information about the program associated with a signal recorded by the content generation application can be extracted from the recorded signal of the program using any suitable techniques. It should be noted that any suitable media data can be extracted from the signals recorded by the content generation application. In particular any media data that can be used to identify a program and or identify keywords associated with a program can be extracted from the recorded signal.

In some implementations media data can be extracted from signals related to one or more programs by a third party and the media data can be received by the content generation application in addition to or instead of the content generation application recording the signals and extracting media data from the signals.

At the content generation application can identify a program that the media data is associated with using any suitable techniques. For example the content generation application can determine an identity of the program based on a title of the program provided in an electronic program guide. As another example the content generation application can identify the program based on matching a fingerprint extracted from the audio of the program to a fingerprint of audio associated with a particular program e.g. from a database of program audio fingerprints or the like . As yet another example the content generation application can identify the program based on a date and time when the signals related to the program were captured. It should be noted that any suitable techniques for identifying a program can be used at . It should also be noted that in some implementations an identity of the program can be received in association with media data related to the program.

In some implementations the identity of the program can be recorded and associated with the media data received at . For example the content generation application can maintain a database containing the entry for each identified program and media data received at can be stored in association with an entry for the program that the media data is related to. As another example a file can be maintained in a memory for each identified program and media data related to the program can be stored in the file that corresponds to that program.

At the content generation application can identify one or more keywords associated with the program identified at . In some implementations keywords can correspond to and represent entities from the program. For example keywords can include people places events objects creatures logos characteristics features or any other suitable entity related to the program. These keywords can be associated with the program in various ways. For example an image of a person or a landmark can be included in a video signal associated with the program. As another example a person or an event can be discussed in the program e.g. the names of people or words identifying an event can be included in an audio signal or subtitles associated with the program . As yet another example a place can be identified in a program through text included in a video signal associated with the program or through audio associated with the program. As still another example keywords can be included in text associated with the program such as metadata electronic program guide data subtitles or the like. It should be noted that the preceding are merely examples and it is recognized that keywords can be associated with a program in many different ways.

Any suitable techniques can be used to identify keywords associated with the identified program. For example in some implementations keywords associated with the program can be identified based on a cast of the program extracted from metadata based on electronic program guide data or found by searching a database of cast information for programs that can be searched using the title of a program. As another example keywords associated with the program can be identified based on facial recognition techniques to identify people included in one or more screenshots from video data associated with the program. As yet another example keywords associated with the program can be identified based on image recognition techniques to identify landmarks included in one or more screenshots extracted from video data associated with the program. As still another example keywords associated with the program can be identified based on optical character recognition techniques to identify keywords included in one or more screenshots extracted from video data associated with the program.

In some implementations keywords can be associated with a particular time in a program. For example an identity of a person that appears in the program can be a keyword and the times when the person appears in the program can be associated with that person. If that same person is also a cast member of the program the keyword for the person can also be associated with the program as a whole with no particular time connected to it. As another example keywords that appear in metadata or electronic program guide data can be associated with the program without also being associated with a particular time. As yet another example text that appears in a program can be associated with a time when the text appears in the video data audio data subtitle data etc.

At the content generation application can determine a popularity score for each of the keywords identified in . The popularity score can be determined using any suitable techniques. For example in some implementations the popularity score can be based on search popularity information that provides an indication of the popularity of the keyword in search queries e.g. a number of times the keyword is used as a search term . As another example the popularity score can be based on social popularity information that provides an indication of the popularity of the keyword in social media sources e.g. a number of times the keyword occurs in one or more social media platforms . As yet another example the popularity score can be based on a number of web pages that include the keyword or a number of results that are returned for a search of the keyword. It should be noted that the preceding are merely examples and it is recognized that the popularity of keywords can be determined in many different ways.

In some implementations the popularity score of keywords can be weighted based on relevance to the program that the keywords are associated with. For example a popularity score for a keyword that corresponds to a cast member of a program can be increased. In another example a popularity score for food related keywords associated with a program in a food category e.g. cooking shows can be increased. In yet another example a popularity score for a keyword that is found to be unrelated to a category or topic of the program can be lowered. In a further example search popularity information can be assigned a higher weight than social network popularity information.

At the content generation application can obtain one or more properties associated with a particular keyword based on the popularity score of the keywords determined at . In some implementations properties can be obtained for keywords with high popularity scores relative to other keywords associated with a program. For example keywords with a relatively low popularity score can be discarded based on a threshold. In another example keywords can be ranked based on the popularity score of the keywords determined at and a predetermined number of keywords can be kept from the ranked list e.g. top five keywords in the ranked list . In yet another example multiple lists of ranked keywords can be generated based on different popularity information such as a ranked list of keywords where the popularity score is based on search popularity information and a ranked list of keywords where the popularity score is based on social network popularity information.

In some implementations properties of a keyword can include information related to the keyword. For example if a keyword is a well known wealthy individual a property for such a keyword can be the net worth of that individual. In another example if the keyword is a landmark such as the Eiffel Tower or the Space Needle a property for such a keyword can be the height of the landmark. In yet another example if the keyword is an object of interest such as the Liberty Bell a property can be a year that the object was made. In a further example if the keyword is a publicly traded company a property can be a recent stock price of that company. In a further example if the keyword is an ingredient used in cooking a property can be dishes that the ingredient is used in preparing. As a still further example if a keyword corresponds to a contestant on an elimination based reality program a property can be whether the contestant has been eliminated from the elimination based reality program.

In some implementations properties of a keyword can be based on the popularity of the properties in association with the keyword. For example search terms that correspond to properties and that are used more often with the keyword can be determined to be more popular properties. Returning to an example described above users that search for a particular well known wealthy person may be interested in the net worth of the person. Consequently net worth of the wealthy person may be a more popular property associated with the wealthy person than the individual s birthday or spouse. Similarly the height of a tall landmark may be more interesting to users of a search engine than other properties of the landmark such as a date when the landmark was built or an architect of the landmark. As another example if a keyword is a place such as a city town country etc. the population may be a more popular property of the place than other properties such as the average rainfall or the head of government of the place.

In some implementations a specified number of properties can be associated with each keyword or all properties over a certain popularity threshold can be associated with each keyword. Additionally or alternatively certain properties can always be associated with a keyword based on a category of the keyword. For example a date of birth if known can always be included for a keyword that corresponds to a person especially a real person e.g. not a fictional character . As another example an address can always be included for a keyword that corresponds to a building or landmark.

In some implementations properties associated with keywords and the relative popularity of the properties can be stored in a database of keywords. In a more particular example the database of keywords can group particular keywords or entities with various properties of interest. In such an example the content generation application can access the database and retrieve a particular number of properties e.g. the first property and the second property associated with a particular keyword . Such a database can be maintained by the content generation application by another application or by a third party. In cases where the database is not maintained by the content generation application the content generation application can access the database using any suitable techniques such as through an application programming interface API . Additionally or alternatively properties and or popularity scores for properties can be generated for keywords on an as needed basis when the keyword is identified using any suitable techniques.

At the content generation application can generate supplemental content for the program identified at based on the one or more properties associated with the keywords or based on the keywords themselves. In some implementations any suitable supplemental content can be generated for the program. For example factual content related to the keywords can be generated such as biographical information about people appearing in the program information about a place where the program takes place and the like. Factual content can also include posts articles web pages etc. related to the keywords. As another example interactive content related to the keywords can be generated such as a poll or a quiz related to the one or more properties. In a more particular example upon identifying an object in an image screenshot of a program as the Eiffel Tower and determining that the first property associated with the keyword Eiffel Tower is the height of the Eiffel Tower the content generation application can generate a quiz question that asks the viewer What is the height of the Eiffel Tower and provide multiple answers for selecting using a user input device e.g. a remote control .

In some implementations the type of supplemental content to generate can be determined based on various factors such as the genre of the program the keyword s which form the basis of the supplemental content a previous type of supplemental content that was generated etc. For example factual content can be generated with more frequency for news programs or documentary programs than for scripted programs or reality programs. As another example if the supplemental content that was previously generated for a program by the content generation application was a quiz the content generation application can be less likely to generate quiz type supplemental content. As yet another example if the keyword is a contestant on an elimination based reality program the content generation application can be more likely to generate a poll about whether that contestant should be eliminated or whether that contestant will win.

The determination of which type of supplemental content is to be generated can be passed to . If the type of supplemental content to be generated is a poll POLL at the content generation application can generate a poll as supplemental content at which is described further in connection with . If the type of supplemental content to be generated is a quiz QUIZ at the content generation application can generate a quiz as supplemental content at which is described further in connection with . If the type of supplemental content to be generated is factual content FACTUAL at the content generation application can generate factual supplemental content at . For example as described above the content generation application can generate factual information based on the properties and or keyword to be presented as supplemental content.

At the content generation application can determine whether the program is an elimination based or contest based program. If the program is not elimination based or contest based NO at the content generation application can generate a poll about the content of the program at . For example a poll can be generated that asks users to pick their favorite segment of the program their favorite guest on the program e.g. if the program is a talk show or the like their favorite recipe from the program e.g. if the program is a cooking show etc.

Otherwise if the program is elimination based or contest based YES at the content generation application can generate a poll about the outcome of the program. For example a poll can be generated that asks users to pick who they think will be eliminated from the program who they think will win who they think should be eliminated from the program whether they think a particular person will be eliminated in a particular episode e.g. Will Bill be eliminated this week .

At the content generation application can determine whether to generate a time sensitive poll based on keywords associated with a particular point in time of the program or a poll that is not time sensitive and is based on keywords associated with the program as a whole and not necessarily associated with any particular time. If the content generation application determines that a time sensitive poll will be generated YES at the content generation application can proceed to .

At the content generation application can generate a time sensitive poll about the outcome of the program based on time sensitive keywords. As described above keywords that are identified from time based data such as audio data video data subtitle data etc. can be associated with a time when the keyword appeared in the data. For example when a contestant on an elimination based program appears on screen or is discussed in audio a keyword associated with the contestant such as their name or a team name can be associated with these times.

In some implementations a poll question about a particular keyword can be presented when that keyword is relevant. For example when a contestant on an elimination based program appears on screen or is discussed for a certain proportion of a period of time e.g. 50 of the last three minutes 25 of the last ten minutes or any other suitable proportion or time period a poll question about that contestant can be generated and or presented. In order to facilitate the generation of time sensitive poll questions in some implementations a running tally can be kept for keyword regarding how much time the each keyword has appeared. This can allow the content generation application to generate time sensitive questions that are relevant.

If the content generation application determines that a non time sensitive poll will be generated NO at the content generation application can proceed to . At the content generation application can generate a poll that is not time sensitive. In some implementations a non time sensitive poll can be generated based on global keywords that are applicable to the program in general and not to any particular period of time in the program. For example in some implementations keywords used to generate a non time sensitive poll can be keywords that are extracted from metadata or electronic program guide data that is applicable to the program generally.

In some implementations content based polls such as those described in connection with can be generated for contest based or elimination based programs and outcome based polls such as those described in connection with and can be generated for other types of programs where the program has an outcome e.g. crime shows where users can be polled to ask who they think is the killer or the like .

In some implementations time sensitive polls such as those described in connection with can be generated for programs that do not have a particular outcome and that are not elimination based or contest based programs. For example for a talk show program a poll can be generated when a particular guest appears on screen for a certain proportion of a period of time a poll can be generated based on a keyword that is being discussed such as project that is being discussed e.g. a movie a book etc. or about a keyword that is a property of the guest e.g. a recently released movie an upcoming book etc. .

Additionally or alternatively the type of poll generated can be based on a previously generated poll. For example if a most recently generated poll was a poll asking which contestant should be eliminated a different type of poll can be generated or a follow up poll can be generated asking who users think should win or not be eliminated.

In some implementations the content generation application can generate choices for the poll using any suitable techniques. For example when asking about a particular contestant on an elimination based reality program the content generation application can determine that yes and no are appropriate choices for the poll. As another example when asking about which contestant should win a contest the content generation application can determine that the names of the other contestants on the show are appropriate choices for the poll. As yet another example when asking about users favorite segment of a program the content generation application can determine that keywords associated with each segment are appropriate choices for the poll.

In some implementations poll questions can be generated based on user generated content. For example the content generation application can identify user generated content related to a program such as posts on social media sources comments to posts related to the program etc. The content generation application can determine whether any of the user generated content contains a question about the program e.g. through analysis of the language used in the user generated content through the presence of punctuation that indicates a question such as a question mark etc. . The content generation application can then choose a question from the user generated content to use as the basis for a poll or quiz using any suitable techniques such as choosing a question based on the popularity of the poster the popularity of the question the frequency with which similar questions are asked by user s in the user generated content or any other suitable techniques. Finally the content generation application can generate possible answers to the question using for example the techniques described above and can cause the question to be presented to users.

In some implementations the keywords that are obtained can be associated with the program as a whole a program that represents a particular episode of a related series of programs or a particular time within a program. For example the keywords can be relevant to the entire program to a particular time in the program or both. Additionally as described above in connection with a list of keywords relevant to particular periods of time can be maintained and updated periodically.

At keywords that have relatively low popularity scores associated with them can be discarded. Any suitable techniques can be used to determine which scores to keep and which to discard. For example a most popular keyword can be kept and any other keywords obtained can be discarded. As another example keywords over a threshold popularity score can be kept and any below the threshold discarded. As yet another example keywords that are relevant to a particular time can be kept and any that are not relevant can be discarded. As still another example keywords that have already been used or have recently been used e.g. used in the last ten minutes to generate a poll can be discarded. As a further example a combination of such techniques can be used to keep and discard keywords. It should be noted that in some implementations all keywords can be kept with no keywords being discarded e.g. one or more keywords can be randomly or pseudo randomly selected from the obtained keywords .

At the content generation application can choose a keyword from the remaining keyword s as the basis for a quiz. The keyword can be chosen using any suitable techniques. For example a keyword can be chosen randomly. As another example a keyword can be chosen based on previously chosen keywords e.g. a keyword that was used recently can be avoided a type of keyword such as person place etc. used recently can be avoided etc. .

At the content generation application can retrieve the properties associated with the keyword chosen at and can choose a property on which to base a quiz question. As described above in connection with of properties can be obtained from any suitable source. The property can be chosen using any suitable techniques. For example a property having a highest popularity can be chosen. As another example a property can be chosen randomly. As another example a property can be chosen based on previously chosen keywords e.g. a property that was used recently can be avoided a type of property such as birthplace height net worth etc. used recently can be avoided etc. .

At the content generation application can generate correct and incorrect answers for the quiz question. The correct and incorrect answers can be generated using any suitable techniques. For example in some implementations where the property that is used as the basis for the answer is a numerical quantity the incorrect answers can be generated as a fraction or multiple of the correct answer. In a more particular example if the Eiffel Tower is chosen as a keyword and the property that is chosen is height the correct answer can be the height of the Eiffel Tower and the incorrect answer can be fractions or multiples of the height of the Eiffel Tower. In some implementations the amount that the correct answer is multiplied by can be chosen at random from a set range such as from 25 to 200 or any other suitable range. It should be noted that the correct and incorrect answers can be formatted in a similar fashion e.g. can be presented in similar units and or with a similar number of decimal places.

In some implementations where the property that is used as the basis for the answer is text the incorrect answers can be generated based on other properties of the same type that are related to the keyword or other keywords that are related to the correct answer in some way and are of the same type as the correct answer. In such implementations the related properties can be related to the answer directly as being another property associated with the keyword chosen at a property of another keyword that was not chosen related to the property information and or related in any other suitable way. For example for a quiz question based on a birthplace property for the keyword Elvis Presley the correct answer is Tupelo MS. Incorrect answers can be based on other location type properties associated with Elvis Presley such as the location where Elvis Presley died Memphis Tenn. . Another incorrect answer can be based on a location type property related to the answer itself. For example Jackson MS can be used as an incorrect answer because it is the capital of the state where Tupelo MS is located.

In some implementations the location of the correct and incorrect answers within a list of possible answers to a quiz can be randomized. It should be noted that the location of the answers can be randomized once when the quiz is generated or each time the quiz is presented to a user.

In some implementations the answers to the quiz can be fixed such that if the quiz question is presented to a user more than once e.g. by the property being used to generate more than one question by the user refreshing a question etc. the answer is not given away by presenting the correct answer with different incorrect answers.

Returning to at the content generation application can receive a request for supplemental content and second media data from a computing device. In some implementations the second media data can include any suitable data for identifying a program that the supplemental content is being requested in connection with. For example the second media data can be an identification of a program e.g. a title a channel identification and air time etc. being presented by the computing device or a device coupled to the computing device e.g. the computing device is a set top box a television etc. . As another example the second media data can include a portion of audio data of the program e.g. one second of audio five seconds of audio etc. that can be fingerprinted and matched to audio data recorded by the content generation application e.g. the computing device is a tablet computer a smartphone a wearable computer etc. that can record and transmit audio information of the program . As yet another example the second media data can include an indication from a user of a program being presented to the user. As still another example the second media data can include a screenshot of the program being presented to the user captured by a user using a computing device e.g. a camera a camera of a tablet computer a camera of a smartphone a camera of a wearable computer etc. or from a stream of video e.g. by a set top box television etc. that is being used to present the program that can be matched to screenshots captured by the content generation application.

At the content generation application can cause the supplemental content generated for the program to be displayed to the user on a client device such as a computing device that requested supplemental content or a device coupled to the computing device that requested supplemental content. For example in some implementations if the computing device that requested the supplemental content is a set top box connected to a television the content generation application can cause the set top box to present supplemental content to the television. As another example if the computing device that requested the content is a set top box or smart television connected to one or more second screen devices such as a tablet computer smartphone wearable computer laptop computer etc. the supplemental content can be presented using the second screen device in addition to or instead of the computing device that requested the content. As still another example if the computing device that requested the content is a second screen device the supplemental content can be presented using the second screen device.

In some implementations a user can request supplemental content for a program that is being presented for a first time e.g. a live program an original broadcast a live streamed program etc. . In such implementations the supplemental content can be created while the program is being presented and can be presented to the user as the supplemental content is generated by the content generation application. In some implementations the content generation application can periodically receive audio fingerprints or channel identification information from a computing device and the content generation application can determine whether to continue providing supplemental content for a program.

In some implementations a user can request supplemental content for a program that is recorded in a storage medium and is being played to the user e.g. a program recorded on a digital video recorder DVR an on demand program an over the top program etc. or a program that is being presented additional times e.g. a rerun or repeat but is being displayed in real time e.g. the program is not a recorded program that the user can rewind pause fast forward etc. . In such implementations the supplemental content can be presented to the user based on a time in the program that is currently being presented to the user. For example supplemental content can be presented based on keywords that are associated with times that are at or before a time of the program that is currently being presented or keywords that are generally associated with the program. This can prevent supplemental content that might spoil an upcoming part of the program from being presented to a user.

In some implementations a current time being presented can be determined using any suitable technique. For example in some implementations the computing device that requested the supplemental content can transmit a current time of the program being presented. As another example a computing device that requested the content can periodically capture audio of the program and this audio can be matched e.g. by the content generation application to a particular time in the program e.g. using audio fingerprinting techniques .

In some implementations all supplemental content generated by the content generation application can be sent to the computing device that requested the supplemental content and the supplemental content can be associated with a time after which the supplemental content can be presented. In such implementations the computing device can determine when to present supplemental content and or whether to allow supplemental content to be presented.

Turning to an illustrative example of a television device displaying a program and a quiz as supplemental content is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. In the example of a television device is displaying a program or other suitable media content on one portion of a display and supplemental content is displayed on another portion of display . In the example program is reduced in size so that supplemental information can be displayed without covering any of the media content being presented in program .

In example information about the program such as might be displayed by an electronic program guide or the like is also shown. It should be noted that this is shown for explanation and is not otherwise necessary or required. As shown in information the program is identified as Travel Race Show Season 1 Episode 2 Race Through Paris . At the current time e.g. 00 12 01 into the program an image of the Eiffel Tower appears in video data related to program . As described above in connection with upon identifying the program the content generation application can extract screenshots from video data related to program and use one or more image recognition techniques to determine the keyword Eiffel Tower which may be a relatively popular keyword. The content generation application can then use the keyword Eiffel Tower to generate a quiz as described above in connection with for example . In example the quiz question can be presented as part of supplemental content along with four possible answers to quiz question . A user can then be prompted to select an answer to the question e.g. using a user input device such as a remote control or choose not to answer the question. In some implementations the user can be given the option of ignoring the question.

In some implementations quiz question can be presented for a predetermined time e.g. 10 second 15 seconds etc. and after the predetermined time has elapsed the content generation application can cause the correct answer to be displayed to the user as shown in connection with described below.

In some implementations the content generation application can cause text to appear to the user indicating a number of quiz answers that have been correctly answered so far a ranking compared to other users or any other suitable information such as a fact about the subject of quiz question e.g. when the Eiffel Tower was built the architect etc. .

As also shown in and as described above in connection with for example the answers shown in example are in a different order than the answer shown in example or . In particular answers and of are switched with respect to answers and of .

As shown in example a time sensitive poll can be presented on television at a time when the content generation application determines that an image of Joe is present in video data of program . The content generation application can then generate a poll question asking whether Joe and Bill e.g. Joe s teammate on the program will be eliminated from the program this week e.g. in a case where Travel Race Show is an episodic program that airs weekly . As described above in connection with such a time sensitive poll question can be presented at a time where Joe is detected as having been present in video data or other data such as text audio etc. of the program such that the poll question is relevant to the program.

In some implementations results can be displayed after a user has answered the question in a similar manner as described in connection with .

As shown in example a quiz question can be presented on second screen device where a user can answer question and or receive other supplemental information such as a correct answer to question poll questions factual information etc.

In some implementations second screen device can be any computing device suitable for presenting supplemental content to a user such as a smartphone a tablet computer a wearable computer a heads up display a laptop computer a personal computer PC a smart television etc.
