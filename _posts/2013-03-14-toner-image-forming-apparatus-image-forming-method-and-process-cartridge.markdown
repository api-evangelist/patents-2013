The present invention relates to a toner for forming an image through electrophotography and an image forming apparatus an image forming method and a process cartridge each of which uses the toner.

In recent years toners for use in electrophotography have been demanded to be fixed at lower temperatures. This demand results from energy saving achieved by reducing energy for fixing and also from requirements for increasing process speed and image quality of electrophotographic image forming apparatus.

In general as the process speed of electrophotographic image forming apparatus is increased the image quality thereof is degraded. The reasons why this phenomenon occurs depend on various factors. However among them the greatest factor is an effect of fixing failures in a fixing step of an image forming process.

In the fixing step a prefixed toner image on a recording medium typified by paper is fixed on the recording medium by heat and pressure to be a fixed toner image. In a rapid system speed a prefixed toner image cannot receive a sufficient amount of heat in the fixing step. As a result fixing failures occur to potentially roughen the surface of the finally obtained toner image or cause afterimage formation called cold offset leading to failure images. In one possible measure to avoid fixing failures a fixing temperature is increased in accordance with an increase in the system speed in order to keep image quality. Such an increased fixing temperature is not necessarily the best measure from the viewpoints of adverse side effects of leakage of heat from a fixing device on other processes in the image forming apparatus acceleration of abrasion speed of fixing members and increase in consumption energy.

In view of this particularly in high speed image forming apparatus improvements in fixing performance of toners themselves have been required. More specifically demand has arisen for toners exhibiting sufficient fixing property at lower temperatures in the fixing step.

Conventionally various attempts have been made to improve fixing property of toners. In one known method for improving fixing property of toners binder resins contained in toners are controlled in terms of thermal characteristics typified by glass transition temperature Tg and softening temperature T1 2 . However a resin having a lowered Tg causes degradation of heat resistance storageability and a drop in T1 2 of a resin which is attained by reducing its molecular weight raises problems such as occurrence of hot offset. Therefore only controlling thermal characteristics of a resin itself is not enough to obtain a toner satisfactory in all of low temperature fixing property heat resistance storageability and hot offset resistance.

In proposals of changing the kind of a binder resin for responding to fixing at lower temperature widely used conventional stryene acryl resins are changed to polyester resins excellent in low temperature fixing property and better in heat resistance storageability see Japanese Patent Application Laid Open JP A Nos. 60 90344 64 15755 02 82267 03 229264 03 41470 and 11 305486 . In another proposal a binder is supplemented with a specific non olefin crystalline polymer exhibiting sharp melt property at its glass transition temperature to improve low temperature fixing property see JP A No. 62 63940 . In these proposals however it cannot be said that resultant toners are optimized in molecular structure and molecular weight. There is a problem that they do not have sufficient low temperature fixing property.

In addition it has been proposed to use a crystalline polyester having sharp melt property similar to the above specific non olefin crystalline polymer in a toner in order to improve its fixing property see Japanese Patent JP B No. 2931899 and JP A No. 2001 222138 . In this proposal however the acid value and the hydroxyl value of the crystalline polyester used in the toner are as low as 5 mgKOH g or lower and 20 mgKOH g or lower respectively. The crystalline polyester has low affinity to paper raising a problem that the toner does not have sufficient low temperature fixing property.

In this proposal optimization is not made on the molecular weight of the finally obtained toner and the existing state of the crystalline polyester. Therefore toners obtained using the crystalline polyester of this proposal cannot sufficiently exhibit excellent low temperature fixing property or heat resistance storageability attributed to the crystalline polyester which is problematic. Also it does not respond to requirements on hot offset resistance raising a problem that a range of temperature for good image fixing cannot be ensured.

In one proposed method for controlling the existing state of the crystalline polyester a crystalline polyester resin and a non crystalline polyester resin which are not compatible are used to establish a sea island phase separated structure see JP A No. 2004 46095 . This proposal uses three different kinds of resins including a crystalline polyester resin as binder resins of toner. However trying to maintain the sea island structure of the crystalline polyester resin results in an increase in dispersion diameter of the crystalline polyester which raises problems of potentially leading to degradation of heat resistance storageability causing transfer failures in a transfer step due to excessively lowered electrical resistance and roughening the finally obtained image.

In still another proposal a toner is provided with low temperature fixing property and heat resistance storageability by defining the peak endothermic amount in a DSC curve measured with a differential scanning calorimeter to thereby control the existing state of a crystalline polyester resin for allowing the crystalline polyester resin to significantly exhibit its effects see JP A No. 2007 33773 . In this proposal however the crystalline polyester resin is supposed to be used in combination with a non crystalline polyester resin having a relatively high softening temperature. Therefore the crystalline polyester resin is responsible for development of low temperature fixing property which naturally increases the amount of the crystalline polyester resin. As a result the crystalline polyester resin and the non crystalline polyester resin become in a compatible state to impair heat resistance storageability.

It has been proposed to incorporate into a toner an ester bond containing crystalline polyester resin having a specific structure as a method for attaining low temperature fixing property heat resistance storageability and hot offset resistance at the same time see JP A No. 2005 338814 . In this proposal however since the amount of the crystalline polyester resin incorporated is quite large the crystalline polyester resin and the non crystalline polyester resin turn into a compatible state raising a problem that the heat resistance storageability is degraded.

In even another proposed method a toner is defined in terms of the peak and the half width of its molecular weight distribution and of the amount of its chloroform insoluble matter and two or more kinds of resins having different softening temperatures are used as a binder resin see JP B No. 4118498 . In this proposal however since a crystalline polyester resin is not used the low temperature fixing property is inferior to a toner formed using a crystalline polyester resin.

As described above at present there is not a toner that is satisfactory in all of low temperature fixing property hot offset resistance and heat resistance storageability at the same time and in a balanced manner.

The present invention aims to solve the above problems pertinent in the art and achieve the following object. That is an object of the present invention is to provide a toner that is satisfactory in all of low temperature fixing property hot offset resistance and heat resistance storageability in a balanced manner and can form a high quality image for a long period of time.

wherein the binder resin contains a crystalline polyester resin A a non crystalline resin B and a composite resin C where the composite resin C contains a condensation polymerization resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit 

wherein the toner has a molecular weight distribution having a main peak in a range of 1 000 to 10 000 and a half width of 15 000 or less where the molecular weight distribution is obtained through gel permeation chromatography GPC of tetrahydrofuran soluble matter of the toner and

wherein the toner has an endothermic peak in a range of 90 C. to 130 C. in measurement through differential scanning calorimetry DSC .

The present invention can provide a toner that is satisfactory in all of low temperature fixing property hot offset resistance and heat resistance storageability in a balanced manner and can form a high quality image for a long period of time. The toner of the present invention can solve the above problems pertinent in the art and can achieve the above object.

In recent years toners for use in electrophotography have been demanded to be fixed at lower temperatures. This demand results from energy saving achieved by reducing energy for fixing and also from requirements for increasing process speed and image quality of electrophotographic image forming apparatus. In addition as a result of diversification of usage purposes of electrophotographic image forming apparatus requirements for low temperature fixing have been being increasing.

A toner can be fixed at lower temperatures by decreasing its softening temperature T1 2 . However decreasing the softening temperature decreases its glass transition temperature to impair heat resistance storageability. In addition hot offset resistance is also impaired due to a drop in the lower limit fixing temperature i.e. the lower limit temperature at which fixing can be performed without problems on image quality and to a drop in the upper limit fixing temperature i.e. the upper limit temperature at which fixing can be performed . Therefore satisfying these three properties of low temperature fixing property heat resistance storageability and hot offset resistance in a balanced manner is a quite difficult proposition for designers of toners for forming an electrophotographic image.

Furthermore in recent years an image forming method using an intermediate transfer member has been proposed in order to improve responsiveness to various kinds of recording media responsiveness to paper . However an external additive tends to be embedded in the toner as the intermediate transfer member is improved in durability. Such an image forming method involves transfer failures more frequently than in an image forming method where an image is transferred directly from an electrophotographic photoconductor to a recording media paper raising a problem of roughening the finally obtained image.

Therefore establishing an image forming method that is satisfactory in all of low temperature fixing property hot offset resistance and heat resistance stability in a balanced manner as well as is excellent in transferability even when used for an image forming apparatus using an intermediate transfer member is a quite difficult proposition for designers of image forming apparatus.

The present inventors conducted extensive studies on the above proposition and have found out the following technical matters to arrive at solving the above problems.

Specifically use of a crystalline polyester resin A as a binder resin for an electrophotographic image forming toner can provide a toner with low temperature fixing property and heat resistance storageability by virtue of its sharp melt property.

However when the crystalline polyester resin A is used alone as a binder resin hot offset resistance becomes quite poor which narrows a fixable temperature range to an extent that the formed toner cannot be practically used.

In view of this the present inventors conceived that combining the crystalline polyester resin A with a non crystalline resin B containing chloroform insoluble matter can improve hot offset resistance and widen a fixable temperature range.

However when the amount of the non crystalline resin B is large in a toner containing the crystalline polyester resin A and the non crystalline resin B the obtained low temperature fixing property becomes poor. Meanwhile when the amount of the crystalline polyester resin A is large the crystalline polyester resin A turns into a compatible state with the other components than the chloroform insoluble matter of the non crystalline resin B when melt kneaded in the production process. As a result the entire binder resin is considerably decreased in glass transition temperature to degrade heat resistance storageability extremely.

In view of this the present inventors conducted further studies and have found that by making the toner have a molecular weight distribution having a main peak in a range of 1 000 to 10 000 and a half width of 15 000 or less where the molecular weight distribution is obtained through gel permeation chromatography GPC of tetrahydrofuran THF soluble matter of the toner the absolute amount of low molecular weight components is large the molecular weight distribution becomes sharp the amount of the crystalline polyester resin A is decreased to prevent compatibility and the hot offset resistance of the non crystalline resin B is not impaired while keeping the low temperature fixing property of the crystalline polyester resin A .

Still a risk to heat resistant storageability does not completely disappear. Even though compatibility of the crystalline polyester resin A is suppressed and decrease of the glass transition temperature of the binder resin as a whole is suppressed interfaces between the crystalline polyester resin A and the other binder resins tends to become a pulverization interface in a pulverizing step if the crystalline polyester resin A exists with its dispersion diameter remaining large. Also in the polymerization method as a result the crystalline polyester resin A tends to appear on a toner surface. The crystalline polyester resin A is a sharp melting material and it exhibits excellent heat resistance storageability as described above when it exists inside toner particles. However it slightly melts even at a temperature equal to or lower than the glass transition temperature and the slightly melt crystalline polyester resin A acts as a binder between toner particles when it exists on surfaces of the toner particles. As a result it degrades heat resistance storageability of the toner. Besides in an image forming apparatus using an intermediate transfer member an external additive tends to be embedded in the toner base particles as the intermediate transfer member is improved in durability easily causing transfer failures. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in a crystalline polyester resin having a low degree of crystallization.

Also in view of electrical characteristics of the toner a problem occurs with a toner formulated with the crystalline polyester resin A and the non crystalline resin B . Since a polyester resin with crystallinity has a relatively low electrical resistance a toner tends to have a low electrical resistance if the polyester resin with crystallinity exists in the toner with its dispersion diameter remaining large. When the electrical resistance decreases and exceeds its allowable range it causes poor image transfer in a transferring step during image formation. In particular when the compatibility of the crystalline polyester resin A is suppressed for the purpose of maintaining low temperature fixing property as described above the crystalline polyester resin A tends to maintain its large dispersion diameter. As a result the electrical characteristics of the crystalline polyester resin A are likely to be dominant in the toner and the electrical resistance tends to decrease to easily cause degraded transferability.

Also when a resistance adjusting agent hereinafter may be referred to as charge controlling agent is included as described below the resistance adjusting agent exists in the other resins than the crystalline polyester resin A at a relatively high concentration since it cannot enter domains formed by the crystalline polyester resin A . Thus it tends to be confined in the toner as aggregates and the resistance tends to decrease excessively. The problem may be solved by adjusting the amount of the resistance adjusting agent if it is used only for the purpose of decreasing the resistance. However if the resistance adjusting agent serves as a colorant also an example thereof being carbon black it is not necessarily possible to reduce the amount in view of coloring strength and it cannot be adjusted to appropriate electrical resistance.

The present inventors conducted extensive studies to solve these problems. As a result they have found that concerns of reduced heat resistance storageability and reduced electrical resistance which develop characteristically in a formulation of the crystalline polyester resin A and the non crystalline resin B may be solved simultaneously by formulating a composite resin C containing a condensation polymerization resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit to the formulation of the crystalline polyester resin A and the non crystalline resin B .

Also the present inventors conducted extensive studies to solve these problems. As a result they have found that concerns of reduced heat resistance storageability and reduced electrical resistance may be solved simultaneously even in an image forming method using an intermediate transfer member by externally adding an inorganic compound having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm to 160 nm to the toner containing the composite resin C containing a condensation polymerization resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit as well as the crystalline polyester resin A and the non crystalline resin B .

When the crystalline polyester resin A is melt kneaded together with the low molecular weight non crystalline resin B having a molecular weight distribution having a main peak in a range of 1 000 to 10 000 and a half width of 15 000 or less where the molecular weight distribution is obtained through GPC of THF soluble matter of thereof shear force cannot be very well applied to raw materials since the viscosity of the resins considerably decreases and thus the dispersion diameter of the crystalline polyester resin A tends to be larger. On the other hand when the crystalline polyester resin A and the non crystalline resin B are melt kneaded together with the composite resin C appropriate shear force is applied to the resins and fine dispersion of the crystalline polyester resin A is promoted.

When it is finely dispersed the crystalline polyester resin A appears on a toner surface less frequently during pulverization and the heat resistance storageability dramatically improves. Also it is possible to maintain appropriate electrical resistance since the crystalline polyester resin A is finely dispersed.

Furthermore the composite resin C tends to be a pulverization interface during pulverization since it is harder than the non crystalline resin B having a peak in a region of relatively low molecular weight of a molecular weight distribution. Thus it tends to be present relatively on the toner surface and effectively suppresses the non crystalline resin B having a low softening temperature appearing on the toner surface which contributes to improved heat resistant storageability.

In addition since hardness of the toner surface may be enhanced toner degradation is minimal when the toner is physically stressed. In particular since embedding of an external additive is improved variation in charging characteristics is reduced before and after stress is applied. Accordingly it is possible to provide stable image quality over a long period of time.

However even though a combination of the crystalline polyester resin A the non crystalline resin B and the composite resin C is used there may be cases where advantages coming from thermal properties of the raw material resins are not exhibited when melt kneading is performed in the pulverization toner production step. This is mainly because of change in the molecular weight due to breakage of molecular chains in the resins in the melt kneading step. In particular the molecular weight distribution of the toner as a whole becomes broad when a chain of chloroform insoluble matter included in the binder resin is broken. This negatively affects the thermal properties coming from the non crystalline resin B and low temperature fixing property is impaired.

The present inventors have found the following as a result of extensive studies. As described below for example by melt kneading raw material resins over a moderate temperature to optimize shear force on the raw material resins and to re crystallize the crystalline polyester resin A in a cooling step the obtained toner has a molecular weight distribution having a main peak between 1 000 and 10 000 and a half width of 15 000 or less where the molecular weight distribution is obtained by GPC of THF soluble matter of the toner. Such a toner has a large absolute amount of low molecular weight content and a sharp molecular weight distribution and can be excellent in low temperature fixing property heat resistance storageability and hot offset resistance at the same time and in a balanced manner while utilizing the characteristics of the crystalline polyester resin A the non crystalline resin B and the composite resin C respectively. Also by externally adding an inorganic compound having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm to 160 nm it is possible to obtain an image forming method that is satisfactory in all of low temperature fixing property hot offset resistance and heat resistance storageability in a balanced manner as well as is excellent in transferability even when used for an image forming apparatus using an intermediate transfer member.

A toner of the present invention contains at least a binder resin and a colorant and if necessary further contains other ingredients such as a charge controlling agent a fatty acid amide compound a releasing agent and an external additive.

The binder resin contains a crystalline polyester resin A a non crystalline resin B and a composite resin C containing a condensation polymerization resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit.

The crystalline polyester resin A is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from conventionally known ones depending on the intended purpose so long as it is a polyester resin having crystallinity. The crystalline polyester resin A preferably has an ester bond represented by the following General Formula 1 in a molecular backbone thereof. OCO R COO CH General Formula 1 

In General Formula 1 R represents a C2 C20 linear unsaturated aliphatic divalent carboxylic acid residue and n is an integer of 2 to 20.

The presence of the ester bond represented by the above General Formula 1 in the crystalline polyester resin A can be identified by solid CNMR for example.

The linear unsaturated aliphatic divalent carboxylic acid residue is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include linear unsaturated aliphatic residues derived from linear unsaturated divalent carboxylic acids such as maleic acid fumaric acid 1 3 n propenedicarboxylic acid and 1 4 n butenedicarboxylic acid.

The linear aliphatic divalent alcohol residue is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include residues derived from linear aliphatic divalent alcohol residues such as ethylene glycol 1 3 propylene glycol 1 4 butanediol and 1 6 hexanediol.

When an acid component of the crystalline polyester resin A is a linear unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid it is advantageously easier to form a crystalline structure as compared with a case of using an aromatic dicarboxylic acid making it possible for the crystalline polyester resin to exhibit its functions more effectively.

For example the crystalline polyester resin A can be produced through condensation polymerization reaction between I a polyvalent carboxylic acid component of a linear unsaturated aliphatic divalent carboxylic acid or a reactive derivative thereof e.g. an acid anhydride a C1 C4 lower alkyl ester or an acid halide and II a polyhydric alcohol component of a linear aliphatic diol.

A small amount of another polyvalent carboxylic acid may optionally be added to the above polyvalent carboxylic acid component. Examples of the another polyvalent carboxylic acid include i saturated aliphatic divalent carboxylic acids having a branched chain ii saturated aliphatic polyvalent carboxylic acids such as saturated aliphatic divalent carboxylic acids and saturated aliphatic trivalent carboxylic acids and iii aromatic polyvalent carboxylic acids such as aromatic divalent carboxylic acids and aromatic trivalent carboxylic acids.

The amount of these polyvalent carboxylic acids is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 30 mol or less more preferably 10 mol or less relative to all the carboxylic acids. They are appropriately added in such an amount that the obtained polyester resin has crystallinity.

Examples of the optionally added polyvalent carboxylic acids include divalent carboxylic acids such as malonic acid succinic acid glutaric acid adipic acid suberic acid cebacic sebacic acid citraconic acid phthalic acid isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid and tri or higher valent carboxylic acids such as trimellitic anhydrides 1 2 4 benzenetricarboxylic acid 1 2 5 benzenetricarboxylic acid 1 2 4 cyclohexanetricarboxylic acid 1 2 4 naphthalenetricarboxylic acid 1 2 5 hexanetricarboxylic acid 1 3 dicarboxyl 2 methylenecarboxypropane and 1 2 7 8 octanetetracarboxylic acid.

Furthermore to the above polyhydric alcohol component may be optionally added a small amount of an aliphatic branched dihydric alcohol a cyclic dihydric alcohol or a tri or higher hydric alcohol.

The amount of these polyhydric alcohols is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 30 mol or lower more preferably 10 mol or lower relative to all the alcohols. They are appropriately added in such an amount that the obtained polyester resin has crystallinity.

Examples of the optionally added polyhydric alcohols include 1 4 bis hydroxymethyl cyclohexane polyethylene glycol bisphenol A ethylene oxide adducts bisphenol A propylene oxide adducts and glycerin.

The molecular weight distribution of the crystalline polyester resin A is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The molecular weight distribution thereof is preferably sharp from the viewpoint of development of low temperature fixing property. Also the molecular weight of the crystalline polyester resin A is preferably relatively low.

Regarding the molecular weight of the crystalline polyester resin A preferably the weight average molecular weight Mw thereof is 5 500 to 6 500 and the number average molecular weight Mn thereof is 1 300 to 1 500 in a molecular weight distribution through GPC of its o dichlorobenzene soluble matter. The ratio Mw Mn of the weight average molecular weight to the number average molecular weight is preferably 2 to 5.

The GPC can be performed for example as follows. Specifically a column is conditioned in a heat chamber of 40 C. and then o dichlorobenzene as a solvent is caused to pass through the column of the same temperature at a flow rate of 1 mL min. Subsequently a separately prepared o dichlorobenzene solution of a resin sample concentration 0.05 by mass to 0.6 by mass is applied to the column in an amount of 50 L to 200 L. In the measurement of the molecular weight of the sample the molecular weight distribution is determined based on the relationship between the logarithmic value and the count number of a calibration curve given by using several monodispersed polystyrene standard samples.

The molecular weight distribution of the crystalline polyester resin A is based on a molecular weight distribution chart where the horizontal axis is log M molecular weight and the vertical axis is by mass. In the molecular weight distribution chart preferably the molecular weight peak of the crystalline polyester resin A is in a range of 3.5 by mass to 4.0 by mass and the half width of this peak is 1.5 or less.

The glass transition temperature Tga or the softening temperature T1 2a of the crystalline polyester resin A is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably lower in such a range that the formed toner is not degraded in heat resistance storageability. The Tga is preferably 80 C. to 130 C. more preferably 80 C. to 125 C. The T1 2a is preferably 80 C. to 130 C. more preferably 80 C. to 125 C. When the Tga or the T1 2a deviates from the above range the lower limit fixing temperature of the toner becomes high so that its low temperature fixing property may be degraded.

Here the glass transition temperature Tg of the binder resin can be measured by raising the temperature of the binder resin at 10 C. min from 20 C. to 150 C. using a differential scanning calorimeter e.g. DSC 60 product of Shimadzu Corporation Ltd. . Note that the endothermic peak and the glass transition temperature in the present invention are obtained from an endothermic curve at the first temperature raising.

The softening temperature T1 2 of the binder resin can be measured using an elevated flow tester CFT 500 product of Shimadzu Corporation Ltd. by melting and flowing a sample of 1 cmunder the conditions the diameter of a die hole 1 mm the pressure applied 20 kg cmand the temperature raising rate 6 C. min. The softening temperature T1 2 thereof is a temperature corresponding to the range between a flow start point and a flow end point.

In the present invention whether or not the polyester resin has crystallinity can be identified based on whether or not there is a peak in an X ray diffraction pattern thereof obtained with a powder X ray diffraction apparatus.

The crystalline polyester resin A preferably has at least one diffraction peak at 2 of 19 to 25 in its diffraction pattern more preferably has a diffraction peak at 2 of each of i 19 to 20 ii 21 to 22 iii 23 to 25 and iv 29 to 31 . Also when the melt kneaded and pulverized toner has a diffraction peak at 2 of 19 to 25 it means that the crystalline polyester resin A maintains crystallinity. In this case the crystalline polyester resin A can be allowed to exhibit its function assuredly which is preferred.

The measurement by powder X ray diffraction can be performed using for example powder X ray diffraction apparatus RINT 1100 product of Rigaku Corporation Ltd. under the following conditions vacuum tube Cu tube voltage current 50 kV 30 mA and goniometer a wide angle goniometer. As specific examples an X ray diffraction chart of crystalline polyester resin a6 used in Examples is given in and an X ray diffraction chart of a toner obtained in Example 1 24 which contains the crystalline polyester resin a6 and keeps its crystallinity is given in .

The amount of the crystalline polyester resin A contained in the toner is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 1 by mass to 15 by mass more preferably 1 by mass to 10 by mass.

The non crystalline resin B is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from conventionally known ones depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include polystyrenes polychlorostyrenes poly methylstyrenes styrene chlorostyrene copolymers styrene propylene copolymers styrene butadiene copolymers styrene vinylchloride copolymers styrene vinyl acetate copolymers styrene maleic acid copolymers styrene acrylic acid ester copolymers e.g. styrene methyl acrylate copolymers styrene ethyl acrylate copolymers styrene butyl acrylate copolymers styrene octyl acrylate copolymers and styrene phenyl acrylate copolymers styrene methacrylic acid ester copolymers e.g. styrene methyl methacrylate copolymers styrene ethyl methacrylate copolymers styrene butyl methacrylate copolymers and styrene phenyl methacrylate copolymers styrene resins including homopolymers and copolymers of styrene and styrene substituted products e.g. styrene chloromethyl acrylate copolymers and styrene acrylonitrile acrylic acid ester copolymers vinyl chloride resins styrene vinyl acetate copolymers rosin modified maleic acid resins phenol resins epoxy resins polyethylene resins polypropylene resins ionomer resins polyurethane resins silicone resins ketone resins ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers xylene resins petroleum resins such as polyvinyl butyral resins and hydrogenated petroleum resins. These may be used alone or in combination.

Methods for producing these resins are not particularly limited and may be any of mass polymerization solution polymerization emulsion polymerization and suspension polymerization.

The non crystalline resin B is preferably a polyester resin from the viewpoint of development of low temperature fixing property. The polyester resin usable is for example one generally obtained through condensation polymerization between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.

The alcohol is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include glycols such as ethylene glycol diethylene glycol triethylene glycol and propylene glycol ethylated bisphenols such as 1 4 bis hydroxymethyl cyclohexane and bisphenol A and other polyhydric alcohol monomers such as divalent alcohol monomers and tri or higher hydric alcohol monomers.

The carboxylic acid is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include divalent organic acid monomers such as maleic acid fumaric acid phthalic acid isophthalic acid terephthalic acid succunic acid and malonic acid and tri or higher valent carboxylic acid monomers such as 1 2 4 benzenetricarboxylic acid 1 2 5 benzenetricarboxylic acid 1 2 4 cyclohexanetricarboxylic acid 1 2 4 naphthalenetricarboxylic acid 1 2 5 hexanetricarboxylic acid 1 3 dicarboxyl 2 methylenecarboxypropane and 1 2 7 8 octanetetracarboxylic acid.

The polyester resin preferably has a glass transition temperature Tg of 55 C. or higher more preferably 60 C. or higher from the viewpoint of heat resistance storageability.

The non crystalline resin B preferably contains chloroform insoluble matter. In particular it is preferable that the formed toner contains chloroform insoluble matter in an amount of 1 by mass to 30 by mass since it is possible to ensure the amounts of the other resin than the non crystalline resin B while keeping hot offset resistance.

About 1.0 g of the non crystalline resin B is weighed and about 50 g of chloroform is added to the non crystalline resin B followed by thoroughly dissolving. The resultant solution is subjected to centrifugal separation and the resultant product is filtrated at normal temperature using a qualitative filter paper of class 5C of JIS P3801 . The residue on the filter paper is the insoluble matter. The amount of the chloroform insoluble matter is expressed as a ratio by mass of the mass of the residue on the filter paper to the mass of the binder resin or toner used.

The non crystalline resin B preferably has a molecular weight distribution having a main peak in a range of 1 000 to 10 000 and a half width of 15 000 or lower where the molecular weight distribution is obtained through gel permeation chromatography GPC of THF soluble matter of the non crystalline resin B . Since such non crystalline resin B exhibits excellent low temperature fixing property it can keep low temperature fixing property at a sufficient level even when the amount of the crystalline polyester resin A in the toner is reduced. As a result of the extensive studies conducted by the present inventors in a toner produced by combining the crystalline polyester resin A the non crystalline resin B and the composite resin C together it has been found that when the proportion of the non crystalline resin B is increased the best balance therebetween is obtained i.e. the respective resins effectively exhibit their functions with accompanying neither adverse side effects due to excessive crystalline polyester resin and or excessive THF insoluble matter nor adverse effects of the hardness of the composite resin C on a lower limit temperature of the toner so that the toner becomes good in low temperature fixing property heat resistance storageability and hot offset resistance.

The amount of the non crystalline resin B contained in the toner is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 60 by mass to 95 by mass more preferably 75 by mass to 90 by mass.

The composite resin C contains a condensation polymerization resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit. The composite resin C is a resin where the condensation polymerization resin unit and the addition polymerization resin unit are chemically bonded together hereinafter may be referred to as hybrid resin .

The composite resin C can be obtained by allowing a mixture containing a condensation polymerization monomer and an addition polymerization monomer serving as raw materials to simultaneously undergo condensation polymerization reaction and addition polymerization reaction in the same reaction vessel or to sequentially undergo condensation polymerization reaction and addition polymerization reaction in this order or to sequentially undergo addition polymerization reaction and condensation polymerization reaction in this order.

The condensation polymerization monomer serving as a raw material of the composite resin C is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.

These may be used alone or in combination.

Among them styrene acrylic acid n butyl acrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate methacrylic acid n butyl methacrylate and 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate are suitably used. When they are used in combination with at least styrene and acrylic acid dispersibility of a releasing agent is remarkably excellent which is particularly preferred.

If necessary a crosslinking agent for the addition polymerization monomer may be used in the production of the composite resin C .

The crosslinking agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include aromatic divinyl compounds diacrylate compounds having an alkyl chain as a linking moiety diacrylate compounds having as a linking moiety an alkyl chain containing an ether bond and polyester diacrylates.

Examples of the diacrylate compounds having an alkyl chain as a linking moiety include ethylene glycol diacrylate 1 3 butylene glycol diacrylate 1 4 butanediol diacrylate 1 5 pentanediol diacrylate 1 6 hexanediol diacrylate neopentyl glycol diacrylate and methacrylate compounds where the acrylates of the above listed compounds are changed to methacrylates.

Examples of multifunctional crosslinking agents include pentaerythritol triacrylate trimethylolethane triacrylate trimethylolpropane triacrylate tetramethylolmethane tetraacrylate oligoester acrylate methacrylate compounds where the acrylates of the above listed compounds are changed to methacrylates triallyl cyanurate and triallyl trimellitate.

The amount of the crosslinking agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 0.01 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass more preferably 0.03 parts by mass to 5 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the addition polymerization monomer used.

A polymerization initiator used in polymerizing the addition polymerization monomer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include azo polymerization initiators such as 2 2 azobisisobutylonitrile 2 2 azobis 4 methoxy 2 4 dimethylvaleronitrile and 2 2 azobis 2 4 dimethylvaleronitrile and peroxide polymerization initiators such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide acetylacetone peroxide 2 2 bis tert butylperoxy butane tert butyl hydroperoxide benzoyl peroxide and n butyl 4 4 di tert butylperoxy valeate.

These may be used alone or may be used in combination for the purpose of adjusting the resin in terms of molecular weight and molecular weight distribution.

The amount of the polymerization initiator is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 0.01 parts by mass to 15 parts by mass more preferably 0.1 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the addition polymerization monomer.

In order to chemically binding the condensation polymerization resin unit with the addition polymerization resin unit for example it is possible to use a monomer reactive in both condensation polymerization and addition polymerization i.e. a condensation addition polymerization reactive monomer .

Examples of the condensation addition polymerization reactive monomer include unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid maleic acid citraconic acid and itaconic acid and anhydrides thereof and vinyl monomers containing a hydroxyl group.

The amount of the condensation addition polymerization reactive monomer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 1 part by mass to 25 parts by mass more preferably 2 parts by mass to 20 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the addition polymerization monomer used.

When the composite resin C is produced in the same reaction vessel both the condensation polymerization reaction and the addition polymerization reaction are allowed to proceed and or complete at the same time. Alternatively both the reactions can be completed independently by selecting the reaction temperature and time for each of the reactions.

In one exemplary method a mixture of the addition polymerization monomer and the polymerization initiator is dropped to the mixture of the condensation polymerization monomer in the reaction vessel followed by mixing in advance. After that the addition polymerization is first completed through radical polymerization reaction and then the condensation polymerization is allowed to proceed by raising the reaction temperature.

In this manner when two independent reactions are allowed to proceed in the reaction vessel two different kinds of resin units can be effectively dispersed or bound together.

The composite resin C is preferably a composite resin containing a polyester resin unit as the condensation polymerization resin unit and a vinyl resin as the addition polymerization resin unit. The combination of these units allows the composite resin C to exhibit its function effectively.

The softening temperature T1 2c of the composite resin C is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 90 C. to 130 C. more preferably 100 C. to 120 C.

When the softening temperature T1 2c thereof is lower than 90 C. there may be degradation in heat resistance storageability and hot offset resistance. When it is higher than 130 C. there may be degradation in low temperature fixing property.

Also the glass transition temperature Tgc of the composite resin C is preferably 50 C. to 80 C. more preferably 55 C. to 70 C. from the viewpoints of fixing property storageability and durability.

The acid value of the composite resin C is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 5 mgKOH g to 80 mgKOH g more preferably 15 mgKOH g to 40 mgKOH g from the viewpoints of chargeability and environmental stability. Note that the acid value can be measured by the method according to JIS K 0070.

The amount of the composite resin C in the toner is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 3 by mass to 20 by mass.

The colorant is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from conventionally known dyes and pigments depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include carbon black lamp black iron black aniline blue phthalocyanine blue phthalocyanine green Hansa yellow G rhodamine 6C lake Calco Oil Blue chrome yellow quinacridone Benzidine Yellow rose Bengal and triallymethane dyes. These may be used alone or in combination.

The toner of the present invention can be used as a black toner or a full color by using the colorant.

Carbon black among the colorants has a particularly excellent black coloring ability and also has a good electroconductivity. Hence when the amount of carbon black is large or exists in an aggregated state in the toner the toner is decreased in electrical resistance to cause transfer failures in a transfer step. In particular when used in combination with the crystalline polyester resin A carbon black particles cannot enter domains of the crystalline polyester resin A . As a result when the crystalline polyester resin A present in the toner has a large dispersion diamete the carbon black particles exists in the other resins than the crystalline polyester resin A at a relatively high concentration. Therefore it is easy for the carbon black to be confined as aggregates in the toner so that the resistance of the toner tends to decrease excessively.

In the present invention since the composite resin C is used in combination dispersibility of carbon black becomes good making it possible to reduce the above described risks. When the toner is fixed on a recording medium carbon black can increase the viscosity of the melted toner. Thus when the non crystalline resin B is used in a large amount carbon black can exhibit an effect of suppressing hot offset occurring due to a decrease in viscosity.

The amount of the colorant is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is generally 1 by mass to 30 by mass preferably 3 by mass to 20 by mass relative to the amount of the resin components of the toner.

If necessary the toner of the present invention may further contain other ingredients such as a charge controlling agent a fatty acid amide compound a releasing agent and an external additive.

The charge controlling agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include nigrosine and its modified products with fatty acid metal salts onium salts e.g. phosphonium salts and lake pigments thereof triphenylmethane dyes and lake pigments thereof and metal salts of higher fatty acids diorganotinoxides such as dibutyltinoxide dioctyltinoxide and dicyclohexyltinoxide and diorganotinborates such as dibutyltinborate dioctyltinborate and dicyclohexyltinborate organometallic complexes chelate compounds monoazo metal complexes acetylacetone metal complexes aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acid metal complexes of aromatic dicarboxylic acids quaternary ammonium salts and salicylic acid metal compounds. Further examples include aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids aromatic mono or polycarboxylic acids metal salts thereof anhydrides thereof esters thereof and phenol e.g. bisphenol derivatives thereof. These may be used alone or in combination.

The amount of the charge controlling agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 0.1 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass more preferably 1 part by mass to 5 parts by mass relative to the amount of the resin components of the toner.

Among these charge controlling agents use of salicylic acid metal compounds alone or in combination is preferred from the viewpoint of improving hot offset resistance also. In particular a complex containing a tri or higher valent metal able to form a 6 coordinate structure reacts with a resin and a high reactive moiety of a wax to form a mild crosslinked structure to thereby greatly contribute to hot offset resistance. When used in combination with the composite resin C their dispersibility is improved to allow the charge controlling agent to exhibit its function of controlling charging polarity more effectively.

Here the tri or higher valent metal is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include Al Fe Cr and Zr.

The salicylic acid metal compounds usable are for example compounds represented by the following General Formula 2 . Examples thereof include BONTRON E 84 product of Orient Chemical Industries Ltd. where M is zinc in General Formula 2 .

In General Formula 2 R Rand Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom a linear or branched C1 C10 alkyl group or a linear or branched C2 C10 alkenyl group M is chrome zinc calcium zirconium or aluminum m is an integer of 2 or greater and n is an integer of 1 or greater.

When a crystalline polyester resin and a fatty acid amide compound are added to a pulverized toner produced through a process containing a melt kneading step recrystallization of the crystalline polyester resin which has melted in the kneading is promoted in the kneaded product upon cooling resulting in less compatibility with the resin. As a result it is possible to suppress a decrease in glass transition temperature of the toner and improve heat resistance storageability. When used in combination with the below described releasing agent the fatty acid amide compound makes it possible to stay the releasing agent in the surface of a fixed image. The fixed image can be increased in resistance to rubbing improvement in smear resistance .

The fatty acid amide compound is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include compounds represented by the following General Formula I or General Formula II . R CO NRR General Formula I 

Rrepresents a C10 C30 aliphatic hydrocarbon group and Rand Reach independently a hydrogen atom a C1 C10 alkyl group a C6 C10 aryl group or a C7 C10 aralkyl group.

In General Formula II Rand Reach independently represent a C5 C21 alkyl group or alkenyl group and Rrepresents a C1 C20 alkylnen group.

Among them particularly preferred is an alkylene bis fatty acid amide represented by General Formula II .

Here each of the alkyl group the aryl group and the aralkyl group represented by Ror Rin General Formula I may have a generally inert substituent such as a fluorine atom a chlorine atom a cyano group an alkoxy group or an alkylthio group but preferably have no substituent.

Examples of the compounds represented by General Formula I include stearic acid amide stearic acid methylamide stearic acid diethylamide stearic acid benzylamide stearic acid phenylamide behenic acid amide behenic acid dimethylamide myristic acid amide and palmitic acid amide. These may be used alone or in combination.

Examples of the alkylene bis saturated fatty acid amide represented by General Formula II include methylene bisstearic acid amide ethylene bisstearic acid amide methylene bispalmitic acid amide ethylene bispalmitic acid amide methylene bisbehenic acid amide ethylene bisbehenic acid amide hexamethylene bisstearic acid amide hexaethylene bispalmitic acid amide and hexamethylene bisbehenic acid amide. These may be used alone or in combination. Among them ethylene bisstearic acid amide is particularly preferred.

Examples of other usable alkylene bis fatty acid amide compounds include alkylene bis fatty acid amides of saturated or mono or diunsaturated fatty acids such as propylene bisstearic acid amide butylene bisstearic acid amide methylene bisoleic acid amide ethylene bisoleic acid amide propylene bisoleic acid amide butylene bisoleic acid amide methylene bislauric acid amide ethylene bislauric acid amide propylene bislauric acid amide butylene bislauric acid amide methylene bismyristic acid amide ethylene bismyristic acidamide propylene bismyristic acidamide butylene bismyristic acidamide propylene bispalmitic acid amide butylene bispalmitic acid amide methylene bispalmitoleic acid amide ethylene bispalmitoleic acid amide propylene bispalmitoleic acid amide butylene bispalmitoleic acid amide methylene bisarachidic acid amide ethylene bisarachidic acid amide propylene bisarachidic acid amide butylene bisarachidic acid amide methylene biseicosenoic acid amide ethylene biseicosenoic acid amide propylene biseicosenoic acid amide butylene biseicosenoic acid amide methylene bisbehenic acid amide ethylene bisbehenic acid amide propylene bisbehenic acid amide butylene bisbehenic acid amide methylene biserucic acid amide ethylene biserucic acid amide propylene biserucic acid amide and butylene biserucic acid amide.

Note that these fatty acid amide compounds can also play a role as a releasing agent on the surface of a fixing member when their softening temperature T1 2 is lower than the surface temperature of the fixing member upon fixing.

The releasing agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from conventionally known ones depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include low molecular weight polyolefin wax such as low molecular weight polyethylenes and low molecular weight polypropylenes synthetic hydrocarbon wax such as Fischer Tropsch wax natural wax such as beeswax carnauba wax candelilla wax rice wax and montan wax petroleum wax such as paraffin wax and microcrystalline wax higher fatty acids such as stearic acid palmitic acid and myristic acid metal salts thereof and amides thereof synthetic ester wax and various modified wax thereof. These may be used alone or in combination.

Among them preferred are carnauba wax and a modified wax thereof polyethylene wax and synthetic ester wax. Carnauba wax is particularly preferred since it is properly finely dispersed in a polyester resin or a polyol resin to make it easy to form a toner excellent in all of hot offset resistance transferability and durability.

When used in combination with a fatty acid amide compound the releasing agent results to have an increased effect of staying on the surface of a fixed image leading to further improvement in smear resistance.

The amount of the releasing agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 2 by mass to 15 by mass relative to the amount of the toner. When the amount thereof is less than 2 by mass there may be a case where hot offset preventing effect is not sufficient. When it is more than 15 by mass there may be a case where transferability and durability decrease.

The melting point of the releasing agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 70 C. to 150 C. When the melting point is lower than 70 C. the toner may be degraded in heat resistance storageability. When it is higher than 150 C. the releasing agent cannot sufficiently exhibit its releasing property in some cases.

Note that the melting point can be measured using for example a differential scanning calorimeter DSC 60 product of Shimadzu Corporation Ltd. .

The external additive is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably an inorganic compound having an average primary particle diameter of 40 nm to 160 nm.

The inorganic compound is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include inorganic oxides. Examples of the inorganic oxides include silica titanium oxide and aluminum oxide.

The average primary particle diameter thereof is preferably 40 nm to 160 nm more preferably 50 nm to 150 nm. When the average primary particle diameter thereof is less than 40 nm the external additive may tend to be embedded in the toner during intermediate transfer. When it is more than 160 nm the toner may be degraded in low temperature fixing property.

The average primary particle diameter can be determined as follows. Specifically the external additives are photographed with an electron microscope. The obtained image is used to calculate the average primary particle diameter from the particle diameters and the number of the external additives present in the image.

The amount of the external additive in the toner is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 0.2 parts by mass to 5.0 parts by mass.

The toner of the present invention contains chloroform insoluble matter in an amount of 1 by mass to 30 by mass preferably 2 by mass to 20 by mass more preferably 3 by mass to 20 by mass. When the chloroform insoluble matter thereof is less than 1 by mass there is a less degree of hot offset resistance attributed to the chloroform insoluble matter. When it is more than 30 by mass the amount of the binder resin that contributes to the low temperature fixing property is relatively low leading to degradation in low temperature fixing property.

About 1.0 g of the toner is weighed and about 50 g of chloroform is added to the toner followed by thoroughly dissolving. The resultant solution is subjected to centrifugal separation and the resultant product is filtrated at normal temperature using a qualitative filter paper of class 5C of JIS P3801 . The residue on the filter paper is the insoluble matter. The amount of the chloroform insoluble matter is expressed as a ratio by mass of the mass of the residue on the filter paper to the mass of the toner used. Note that since the residue on the filter paper contains solid products such as a pigment the chloroform insoluble matter of the toner is separately measured through thermal analysis also.

The toner of the present invention has an endothermic peak in a range of 90 C. to 130 C. in measurement through DSC. The endothermic peak is preferably an endothermic peak attributed to the crystalline polyester resin A . When the endothermic peak attributed to the crystalline polyester resin A falls within a range of 90 C. to 130 C. the crystalline polyester resin does not melt at normal temperature and the toner melts in a fixing temperature region which is a relatively low temperature range to be fixed on a recording medium so that it is possible for the toner to more effectively exhibit heat resistance storageability and low temperature fixing property.

The endothermic amount of the endothermic peak is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 1 J g to 15 J g. When the endothermic amount thereof is less than 1 J g the amount of the crystalline polyester resin A that effectively acts in the toner is so small that the crystalline polyester resin A may not exhibit its function sufficiently. When it is more than 15 J g the amount of the crystalline polyester resin A that effectively acts in the toner is so large that the absolute amount of the crystalline polyester resin A compatible with the non crystalline resin B and the composite resin C becomes larger. As a result the toner is decreased in glass transition temperature and hence may be decreased in heat resistance storageability.

The DSC for measuring the endothermic peak in the present invention is performed by raising the temperature of the toner at 10 C. min from 20 C. to 150 C. using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC 60 product of Shimadzu Corporation Ltd. .

In the present invention the endothermic peak attributed to the crystalline polyester resin is present in a range of 80 C. to 130 C. or thereabout within which the melting point of the crystalline polyester resin A falls. The endothermic amount is determined from the area of a range defined by a baseline and an endothermic curve. In general the endothermic amount in DSC is often measured by raising the temperature twice. However the endothermic peak in the present invention is determined from an endothermic curve at the first temperature raising.

When the endothermic peak attributed to the crystalline polyester resin A is overlapped with the endothermic peak of a wax the endothermic amount of the wax is subtracted from the endothermic amount of the overlapped peak. The endothermic amount of the wax is calculated from the amount of the wax in the toner and the endothermic amount of the wax alone.

The toner of the present invention has a molecular weight distribution having a main peak in a range of 1 000 to 10 000 and a half width of 15 000 or less where the molecular weight distribution is obtained through gel permeation chromatography GPC of tetrahydrofuran THF soluble matter of the toner. Preferably the molecular weight distribution obtained through gel permeation chromatography GPC of THF soluble matter of the toner has a main peak in a range of 1 200 to 9 000 and a half width of 14 000 or less.

The GPC is performed in the following manner. Specifically a column is conditioned in a heat chamber of 40 C. and then tetrahydrofuran THF as a solvent is caused to pass through the column of the same temperature at a flow rate of 1 mL min. Subsequently a separately prepared THF solution of a toner sample concentration 0.05 by mass to 0.6 by mass is applied to the column in an amount of 50 L to 200 L.

In the measurement of the molecular weight of the toner sample the molecular weight distribution is determined based on the relationship between the logarithmic value and the count number of a calibration curve given by using several monodispersed polystyrene standard samples.

The monodispersed polystyrene standard samples used for giving the calibration curve may be for example those available from Pressure Chemical Co. or Tosoh Co. each having a molecular weight of 6 10 2.1 10 4 10 1.75 10 5.1 10 1.1 10 3.9 10 8.6 10 2 10and 4.48 10. It is proper to use at least about 10 monodispersed polystyrene standard samples for giving the calibration curve. The detector to be used is a refractive index RI detector.

The particle diameter of the present invention is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. A volume average particle diameter of the toner is preferably 4 m to 10 m from the viewpoint of obtaining a high quality image excellent in for example thin line reproducibility. When the volume average particle diameter thereof is less than 4 m there are failures in cleaning property in a developing step and transfer efficiency in a transfer step so that image quality may be degraded. When the volume average particle diameter thereof is more than 10 m the formed image may be degraded in thin line reproducibility.

The volume average particle diameter of the toner can be measured by various methods. For example it can be measured using COULTER COUNTER TAII product of U.S. COULTER ELECTRONICS Co. .

The toner of the present invention is produced by for example a pulverization method or a polymerization method.

The polymerization method is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from conventionally known methods depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a suspension polymerization method a dissolution suspension method an emulsion aggregation method and an ester extension method.

The pulverization method includes at least a melt kneading step and a pulverizing step and if necessary further includes other steps such as a cooling step and a classifying step. Specifically it is a method where toner materials including the crystalline polyester resin A the non crystalline resin B the composite resin C and the colorant are mixed together in a dry process and the resultant mixture is melt kneaded using a kneader and pulverized to thereby obtain a pulverized toner.

The melt kneading step is a step of melt kneading a mixture of the above toner materials. Examples of the kneader used in the melt kneading step include uniaxial or biaxial continuous kneaders and batch kneaders using a roll mill. Specific examples thereof include a KTK type biaxial extruder product of KOBE STEEL Ltd. a TEM type extruder product of TOSHIBA MACHINE CO. LTD. a biaxial extruder product of KCK Co. Ltd. a PCM type biaxial extruder product of IKEGAI LTD. and a co kneader product of BUSS Company . Preferably the melt kneading is performed under appropriate conditions so as not to cleave the molecular chains of the binder resin. The temperature during the melt kneading is determined in consideration of the softening point of the binder resin. Specifically when the temperature is higher than the softening point cleavage of the molecular chains occurs to a considerable extent whereas when the temperature is lower than the softening point a sufficient dispersion state is difficult to attain.

The pulverizing step is a step of pulverizing the kneaded product obtained in the melt kneading step. In this pulverization the kneaded product is roughly pulverized and then finely pulverized. Examples of pulverizing manner preferably used include a manner in which the kneaded product is crushed against a collision plate under a jet stream for pulverization a manner in which the kneaded particles are crushed one another under a jet stream for pulverization and a manner in which the kneaded product is pulverized by passage through the narrow gap between a mechanically rotating rotor and a stator.

The classification step is a step of classifying the pulverized product obtained in the pulverization step. With this step the pulverized product toner is classified to prepare particles having a predetermined particle diameter. This classification is performed by removing microparticles using for example a cyclone a decanter or a centrifugal separator.

After completion of the above pulverization and classification the obtained pulverized product is classified in a gas flow by the action of centrifugal force whereby toner particles having a predetermined particle diameter can be produced.

The method of the present invention for producing a toner preferably includes a cooling step between the melt kneading step and the pulverizing step. The cooling step is a step of cooling the kneaded product obtained in the melt kneading step. In the cooling step when the average thickness of the kneaded product is 2.5 mm or greater the cooling rate of the kneaded product becomes slow extending the time for re crystallization of the crystalline polyester resin A which has been melted in the kneaded product. In order to promote re crystallization it is also effective to formulate a fatty acid amide compound as described above but the same effect may be achieved by adjusting the production process. An upper limit of the average thickness of the kneaded product is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The average thickness thereof is preferably 8 mm or smaller since the average thickness exceeding 8 mm considerably reduces efficiency in pulverization in the subsequent pulverization step. Note that a method for measuring the above average thickness is not particularly limited. Any conventionally known method for measuring a thickness may be used to measure the thicknesses of the kneaded product and then the obtained measurements may be averaged to determine the average thickness thereof.

In order to improve the toner in flowability storageability developability and transferability the method for producing the toner may further include an external additive mixing step of adding to and mixing with the above produced toner toner base particles an external additive such as hydrophobic silica powder.

The exposing step can be performed by the exposing unit. The developing step can be performed by the developing unit. The transfer step can be performed by the transferring unit. The other steps can be performed by the other units.

The charging step is a step of charging a surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor and is performed by the charging unit.

The charging unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long as it is a unit configured to charge a surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor. The charging unit is preferably a non contact type charging unit configured to charge the electrophotographic photoconductor in a non contact manner.

Examples of the non contact type charging unit include a non contact type charger utilizing corona discharge a needle electrode device a solid discharge element and an electroconductive or semielectroconductive charging roller disposed while keeping a microgap with respect to the electrophotographic photoconductor. Among them a charger utilizing corona discharge is particularly preferred.

The corona discharge method is a non contact charging method which gives positive or negative ions generated by corona discharge in an air to the surface of an electrophotographic photoconductor. Examples of the charger based on this method include a corotron charger having properties capable of giving a certain charge amount to an electrophotographic photoconductor and a scorotron charger having properties capable of giving a certain electrical potential.

The corotron charger is composed of a casing electrode which occupies a half space around a discharge wire and of a discharge wire placed near the center of the casing electrode.

The scorotron charger is the same as the corotron charger except that it further contains a grid electrode. The grid electrode is disposed at a position which is 1.0 mm to 2.0 mm away from the surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor.

The exposure can be performed by for example imagewise exposing the surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor to light using the exposing unit.

An optical system in the exposure is roughly classified into an analog optical system analog mode and a digital optical system digital mode . The analog optical system is an optical system in which a manuscript is directly projected on an electrophotographic photoconductor while the digital optical system is an optical system in which image information given as electrical signals is converted into light signals on which an electrophotographic photoconductor is exposed to light to form an image.

The exposing unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on intended purpose so long as it is configured to expose the charged surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor to light to thereby form a latent electrostatic image. Examples thereof include various exposing devices such as copying optical systems rod lens array systems laser optical systems liquid crystal shutter optical systems and LED optical systems. Among them the exposing unit is preferably a unit containing a semiconductor laser light emitting diode or both thereof and configured to digitally form a latent electrostatic image on the electrophotographic photoconductor.

In the present invention a rear light system which performs imagewise exposing from the back side of the electrophotographic photoconductor may be employed.

The developing step is a step of developing the latent electrostatic image with a toner or a developer to from a visible image.

The visible image can be formed by for example developing the latent electrostatic image with the toner or developer using the developing unit.

The developing unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long as it is configured to develop the latent electrostatic image with a toner to thereby form a visible image. Examples thereof include a developing unit housing the toner or developer therein and containing a developing device capable of applying the toner or developer to the latent electrostatic image in a contact or non contact manner.

The developing device may be one using a dry developing process or a wet developing process. Also the developing device may be a single color developing device or a multi color developing device. Examples of the developing device suitably used include a developing device containing a stirrer which charges the toner or developer by frictional stirring and a rotatable magnet roller.

In the developing device for example the toner and the carrier are mixed together under stirring and the toner is charged by friction upon mixing under stirring and is retained on the surface of the rotating magnet roller in a chain like form to thereby form a magnetic brush. Since the magnet roller is disposed in the vicinity of the electrophotographic photoconductor photoconductor a portion of the toner which constitutes the magnetic brush formed on the surface of the magnet roller moves to the surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor by an electrically attractive force. As a result the latent electrostatic image is developed with the toner to form a visible image made of the toner on the surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor.

The transferring step is a step of transferring the visible image onto a recording medium. In this step preferably the visible images are primarily transferred to an intermediate transfer member and the thus transferred visible images are secondarily transferred onto a recording medium. Also toners of two or more colors are used a full color toner is preferably used . More preferably the transferring step includes a primary transferring step of forming a composite image by transferring the visible images to the intermediate member and a secondary transferring step of transferring the transferred composite image to a recording medium.

For example the visible image can be transferred by charging the electrophotographic photoconductor with a transfer charger using the transferring unit.

The transferring unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long as it is a unit configured to transfer a visible image to a recording medium. Preferably the transferring unit includes a primary transferring unit configured to form a composite image by transferring the visible images to an intermediate member and a secondary transferring unit configured to transfer the transferred composite image to a recording medium.

Note that the intermediate transfer member is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected from known transfer members depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the intermediate transfer members suitably used include a transferring belt.

A material of the intermediate transfer member is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include polyethylene terephthalate PET ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer ETFE polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF and polyimides. Among them polyimides are preferred in terms of electroconductivity and durability.

The intermediate transfer member is preferably an intermediate transfer belt of a shape of belt in terms of layout.

A surface of the intermediate transfer member may be treated with for example a fluororesin or an acryl resin. Also the intermediate transfer member may contain for example carbon black and or titanium dioxide.

The transferring unit consisting of the primary and secondary transferring units preferably includes at least a transferring device which charges the visible images and transfers them from the electrophotographic photoconductor onto the recording medium. The number of the transferring units may be one or two or more. Examples of the transferring device include a corona transferring device employing corona discharge a transfer belt a transfer roller a pressing transfer roller and an adhesive transferring device.

The recording medium is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose so long as it can receive a developed unfixed image. Examples of the recording medium include plain paper and a PET base for OHP. Typically plain paper is used.

The fixing step is a step of fixing with a fixing device the visible image on the recording medium which has been transferred to the recording medium. The fixing step may be performed every after a toner image of each color is transferred onto the recording medium or may be performed at one time after toner images of all colors are superposed on top of one another on the recording medium.

The fixing unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a fixing unit containing a fixing device and a heat source for heating the fixing device.

Examples of the fixing unit include a combination of an endless belt and a roller and a combination of a roller and another roller. Preferred is a combination of an endless belt and a roller each having a small heat capacity from the viewpoints of shortening the warming up time realizing energy saving and extending a fixable range.

The charge eliminating step is a step of eliminating charges by applying a charge eliminating bias to the electrophotographic photoconductor and can suitably be performed by the charge eliminating unit.

The charge eliminating unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from known charge eliminating devices so long as it can apply a charge eliminating bias to the electrophotographic photoconductor. Preferably a charge eliminating lamp or a similar device is used.

The cleaning step is a step of removing the toner remaining on the electrophotographic photoconductor and can suitably be performed by the cleaning unit. Note that in one employable method without using a cleaning unit the charges of the residual toner are made uniform using a sliding member and the thus treated toner is recovered by a developing roller.

The cleaning unit is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from known cleaners so long as it can remove the electrophotographic toner remaining on the electrophotographic photoconductor. Examples of the cleaning unit suitably used include a magnetic blush cleaner an electrostatic brush cleaner a magnetic roller cleaner a blade cleaner a brush cleaner and a web cleaner.

Referring to the drawings the image forming method and the image forming apparatus of the present invention will next be described in detail.

In A denotes drive roller B denotes a driven roller denotes a photoreceptor belt denotes a charger denotes a laser writing unit A to D denote development units which accommodate yellow magenta cyan and black toners respectively denotes a paper cassette denotes an intermediate transfer belt A denotes a roller drive shaft for driving the intermediate transfer belt B denotes a driven shaft roller to support the intermediate transfer belt denotes a cleaning device denotes a fixing roller A denotes a pressure roller denotes a paper discharge tray and denotes a paper transfer roller.

In the color image forming apparatus the intermediate transfer belt which is flexible against a transfer drum is used the intermediate transfer belt as an intermediate transfer member is stretched over the roller drive shaft A and a pair of driven shaft rollers B and conveyed in a circular manner in a clockwise direction and a belt surface between the pair of driven shaft rollers B contacts the photoconductor belt at a circumference of the roller drive shaft A from a horizontal direction.

When a normal color image is printed toner images of respective colors formed on the photoconductor belt are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt every time they are formed and a color toner image is synthesized. This is transferred at once to a transfer paper conveyed from the paper cassette by the paper transfer roller . The transfer paper after transfer is conveyed between the fixing roller and the pressure roller A of the fixing apparatus fixed by the fixing roller and the pressure roller A and ejected to the paper discharge tray .

When the developing units A to E develop the toners the concentration of the toners in the developers contained in the developing units decreases. The decrease of the toner concentration in the developers is detected by a toner concentration sensor. When the decrease of the toner concentration is detected toner supplying apparatuses connected to the respective developing units are activated to supply toners and increase the toner concentration. Here the supplied toner may be a developer for a so called trickle developing system that a carrier and a toner are mixed provided that the developing units are equipped with a developer discharge mechanism.

In the toner images are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt to form an image but a system where transfer is performed directly from a transfer drum to a recording medium without using an intermediate transfer belt may be considered similarly as an electrophotographic image forming apparatus of the present invention.

In a developing apparatus arranged facing a photoconductor as a latent image bearing member is composed primarily of a developing sleeve a developer containing member a developer supply regulating member as a regulating member and a support case .

In the support case having an opening on a side of the photoconductor a toner hopper as a toner container which contains a toner is connected internally. A developer container which contains a developer including the toner and a carrier is equipped with a developer stirring mechanism for stirring the toner and the carrier to provide the toner with friction peeling charge.

The toner hopper is equipped internally with a toner agitator and a toner supplying mechanism as a toner supplying unit turned by a drive unit. The toner agitator and the toner supplying mechanism send the toner in the toner hopper to the developer container with stirring.

The developing sleeve is arranged in a space between the photoconductor and the toner hopper . The developing sleeve which is driven to rotate in a direction of an arrow in the figure by a drive unit includes a magnet as a magnetic field generating unit arranged internally position invariant relative to the developing apparatus to form a magnetic brush by the carrier .

The developer supply regulating member is integrally mounted on a side opposite to the side of the developer containing member attached to the support case . In this example the developer supply regulating member is disposed while maintaining a certain gap between its tip and an outer peripheral surface of the developing sleeve .

By employing such an apparatus in an unlimited way the image forming method of the present invention is accomplished as follows. That is with the above configuration the toner sent from an inside of the toner hopper by the toner agitator and the toner supplying mechanism is conveyed to the developer container and the toner is provided with desired friction peeling charge through stirring by the developer stirring mechanism . The toner and the carrier are supported as a developer by the developing sleeve and conveyed to a location opposite to the outer periphery of the photoconductor . Only the toner binds electrostatically with the latent electrostatic image formed on the photoconductor and a toner image is formed on the photoconductor .

A series of processes for forming an image may be described by a negative positive process. The photoconductor typified by a photoconductor OPC having an organic photoconductive layer is discharged by the discharge lamp and uniformly and negatively charged with the charging member such as charger or charging roller and a latent image is formed thereon by a laser beam irradiated from the image exposure system such as laser optical system in this example an absolute value of the potential at an exposed area is lower than an absolute value of the potential at a non exposed area .

The laser beam L is irradiated from a semiconductor laser and scans a surface of the photoconductor in a direction of the axis of rotation by for example a polygonal mirror polygons of a polygonal column rotating at a high speed. The latent image formed in this way is developed by a developer composed of a mixture of a toner and a carrier supplied on the developing sleeve as a developer bearing member in the developing apparatus and a toner image is formed. When the latent image is being developed from a voltage applying mechanism to the developing sleeve a developing bias of a suitable magnitude as a DC voltage or an AC voltage superimposed on the DC voltage is applied between an exposed area and a non exposed area of the photoconductor .

Meanwhile a recording medium paper for example is fed from a paper feeding mechanism. It is synchronized with a front edge of the image at a pair of upper and lower resist rollers and fed between the photoconductor and the transfer apparatus and the toner image is transferred on the recording medium. Here a potential of opposite polarity to the polarity of the charged toner is preferably applied as a transfer bias on the transfer apparatus . Thereafter the recording medium is separated from the photoconductor and a transfer image is obtained.

Also the toner remaining on the photoconductor is recovered by a cleaning blade as a cleaning member in a toner collection chamber in the cleaning apparatus .

The recovered toner may be conveyed to the developer container and or the toner hopper by a toner recycling unit and reused.

The image forming apparatus may be an apparatus equipped with a plurality of the above developing apparatus where a toner image is sequentially transferred on a transfer medium and sent to a fixing mechanism that fixes the toner by for example heat or where a plurality of a toner image is once transferred on an intermediate recording medium then collectively transferred on a recording medium and fixed in the same manner.

In the photoconductor is subjected to pre cleaning exposure from a side of the substrate the substrate is of course transparent in this case .

A process cartridge of the present invention includes an electrophotographic photoconductor and a developing unit configured to develop with a toner a latent electrostatic image formed on the electrophotographic photoconductor to thereby form a visible image and if necessary further includes appropriately selected other units.

The developing unit includes a developer container which houses the toner and a developer bearing member for bearing and conveying the developer housed in the developer container and if necessary may further include a layer thickness regulating member for regulating the layer thickness of a toner borne.

The process cartridge can detachably be mounted to various electrophotographic image forming apparatus. Preferably it is detachably mounted to the above described image forming apparatus of the present invention.

The present invention will next be described by way of Examples and Comparative Examples. Note that the present invention should not be construed as being limited to Examples.

FM20B and then melt kneaded at a temperature of 100 C. to 130 C. using a biaxial kneader PCM 30 product of IKEGAI LTD. . The resultant kneaded product was rolled to an average thickness of 2.8 mm then cooled to room temperature by a belt cooler and finally coarsely pulverized to 200 m to 300 m using a hammer mill. It was then finely pulverized using a supersonic jet mill LABOJET product of Nippon Pneumatic Mfg. Co. Ltd. and classified using a dispersion separator MDS I product of Nippon Pneumatic Mfg. Co. Ltd. while appropriately adjusting the opening of louvers so that the mass average particle diameter of the classified product was 5.6 m 0.2 m whereby toner base particles were obtained. Then each of the external additives in amounts presented in the following Table 6 1 and 100 parts by mass of the toner base particles were stirred and mixed together using HENSCHEL MIXER to produce toners 2 1 to 2 4.

A molecular weight distribution of the produced toners 2 1 to 2 4 was measured in the same manner as in Production Example 2 and a main peak of the molecular weight and a half width of the molecular weight distribution were determined. The results are presented in Table 7.

In addition using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC 60 product of Shimadzu Corporation Ltd. the DSC peak temperature and the endothermic amount in a range of 90 C. to 130 C. attributed to the crystalline polyester resin A of the toners 2 1 to 2 4 were determined from a DSC chart obtained when each of the toners 2 1 to 2 4 was raised in temperature from at 10 C. min from 20 C. to 150 C. The results are presented in Table 7.

Furthermore the amount of the chloroform insoluble matter in the toner was confirmed in the same manner as in Production Example 2. The results are presented in Table 7.

Next 5 by mass of each of the produced toners 2 1 to 2 4 and 95 by mass of a coating ferrite carrier were uniformly mixed using a TURBULA mixer product of Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik at 48 rpm for 5 min to thereby produce developers 2 1 to 2 4.

Using a modified machine of IMAGIO PRO900 product of Ricoh Company Ltd. an image was printed using each of the above produced developers.

Using the intermediate transfer member produced in the above Production Example thereof a solid image with a deposited amount of 0.4 mg cmwas printed on paper TYPE6200 product of Ricoh Company Ltd. through exposing developing and transfer steps. A linear velocity of fixing was set to 750 mm sec. Images were printed with a fixing temperature increasing in increment of 5 C. and a lower limit temperature lower limit fixing temperature low temperature fixing property where no cold offset occurs and an upper limit temperature upper limit fixing temperature hot offset resistance where no hot offset occurs were measured. An NIP width of the fixing device was 16 mm. Also a character chart having an image area ratio of 5 a character has a size of about 2 mm about 2 mm was printed out separately with the toner at a fixing temperature of the lower limit fixing temperature 20 C. and thin line reproducibility initial was visually evaluated. In addition a 100 image of about 15 mm about 15 mm was also printed out and solid image reproducibility initial was visually evaluated. The results are presented in Table 8 1. Note that the evaluation criteria for the evaluations are as follows.

After evaluation of the initial thin line reproducibility a character chart having an image area ratio of 5 a character has a size of about 2 mm about 2 mm was continuously printed out on 100 000 sheets at a fixing temperature of the lower limit fixing temperature 20 C. while the toner was supplied and its thin line reproducibility over time was visually evaluated. The same evaluation criteria as the initial thin line reproducibility were used.

After evaluation of the initial solid image reproducibility the character chart having an image area ratio of 5 was continuously printed out on 100 000 sheets. Then a 100 image of about 15 mm about 15 mm was printed out and the resultant image was visually evaluated for solid image reproducibility over time . The same evaluation criteria as the initial solid image reproducibility were used. The results are presented in Table 8 1.
