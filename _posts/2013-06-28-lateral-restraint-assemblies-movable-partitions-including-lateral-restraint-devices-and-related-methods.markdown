The present invention relates to movable partitions and more particularly to systems apparatuses and methods for preventing lateral displacement of one or more portions of such partitions.

Movable partitions are utilized in numerous situations and environments for a variety of purposes. Such partitions may include for example foldable or collapsible doors configured to close off an opening in order to enclose a room or to subdivide a single large room into one or more smaller rooms. The subdivision of a larger area may be desired for example to accommodate the simultaneous meeting of multiple groups. In such applications movable partitions are useful among other things for providing privacy and noise reduction.

Movable partitions may also be used to act as a security barrier a fire barrier or as both. In such a case the movable partition may be configured to automatically close upon the occurrence of a predetermined event such as the actuation of an associated alarm. For example one or more movable partitions may be configured as a fire door or barrier wherein each door is formed with a plurality of panels connected to each other by way of hinge mechanisms. The hinged connection of the panels allows the door to fold up in a compact unit on one side of the opening or it may be stored in a pocket formed within a wall and being designed to conceal the door and preserve the aesthetics of the room where the door is installed. When deployment of the door is necessary the door is driven by a motor along a track the track often being incorporated into the header above the door until the leading edge of the door often defined by a component called a lead post complementarily engages a mating receptacle. Such a mating receptacle may be referred to as a jamb or a door post when formed in a fixed structure such as a wall or as mating lead post when formed in another door or movable partition. The lead post when properly engaged with the door jamb or the mating lead post allows corresponding latching mechanisms to engage if desired and helps to provide a desired seal e.g. a seal with respect to airflow sound waves or both .

However even when a movable partition is properly closed the door seal may be broken for example if the lower edge of the door is laterally displaced relative to the top edge of the door. Such lateral displacement of the lower edge of the door can be caused for example by a draft created by a fire an improperly balanced HVAC system or simply by a person pushing on the door. When the seal is broken smoke and flames may intrude around the door if the door is being used as a fire barrier. If the door is being used in a security installation a person may sufficiently displace the door to enable that person or another to slide or crawl underneath the door. At a minimum displacement of the base of the door is unsightly and significantly reduces the door s effectiveness as a privacy screen and noise barrier.

One approach to preventing or controlling the lateral displacement of a door including the door s lower edge is to engage the lower edge of the door in a guide track that is either embedded in or otherwise attached to the floor. However the use of a track can present various issues. For example a track disposed in the floor can pose a safety issue regardless of whether it protrudes above the floor or is recessed within the floor potentially resulting in a person twisting an ankle or tripping and falling. Likewise such a track may act as a significant obstacle for wheeled conveyances. Additionally such a guide track being exposed when the associated door is in a retracted state is prone to damage and may act as a collection point for dirt and debris.

Some efforts have been made to prevent the lateral displacement of the lower edge of such a movable partition to prevent fluid flow beneath the movable partition without the use of a track in the floor. For example U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 796 325 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 740 046 issued Jun. 22 2010 entitled METHOD APPARATUS AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING A MOVABLE PARTITION U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 934 566 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 931 067 issued Apr. 26 2011 entitled MOVABLE PARTITIONS WITH LATERAL RESTRAINT DEVICES AND RELATED METHODS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 652 446 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 926 538 issued Apr. 19 2011 entitled LATERAL RESTRAINT FOR A MOVABLE PARTITION MOVABLE PARTITIONS INCORPORATING SAME AND RELATED METHODS the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties discuss various means of reducing or preventing the lateral displacement of the lower edge of a movable partition.

Nevertheless it is a desire within the industry to continually improve the operation of movable partitions. As such apparatuses and systems are provided herein to substantially secure a movable partition from lateral displacement. In certain embodiments methods apparatuses and systems are provided that substantially maintain the lateral position of a lower edge of a movable partition in order to maintain a seal formed by the partition without the need to employ a track or other structure disposed within a floor over which the partition traverses.

Embodiments of the present invention include movable partitions and devices methods and systems that help to limit or prevent lateral displacement of movable partitions. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a movable partition is provided that includes a first structure having a first plurality of panels each panel being hingedly coupled to an adjacent panel the first structure being supported from an overhead track at a first location. The movable partition further includes a second structure having a second plurality of panels each panel being hingedly coupled to an adjacent panel the second structure being supported from the overhead track from a second location the second location being laterally spaced from the first location. At least one lateral restraint device is supported from the overhead track at a location between the first location and the second location. The at least one lateral restraint device includes a trolley disposed in a channel of the overhead track and an elongated member coupled with the trolley and extending away from the trolley to a location proximate a lower edge of the first structure and a lower edge of the second structure.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention a method of restraining lateral movement of a movable partition is provided. The method includes suspending a first structure from a support structure wherein the first structure includes a first plurality of panels wherein each panel is hingedly coupled to an adjacent panel. A second structure is also supported from the support structure at a laterally spaced location relative to the first structure the second structure including a second plurality of hingedly coupled panels. At least one elongated member is supported from the support structure along an axis extending away from the support structure and between the first structure and the second structure. The elongated member is substantially restrained from being laterally displaced toward either the first structure or the second structure.

In accordance with yet another embodiment a device for preventing lateral displacement of one or more structures in a movable partition is provided. The device includes a trolley and an elongated member coupled with and extending from the trolley. The trolley includes a structural member and a first plurality of roller elements coupled with the structural member on a first side thereof. At least two roller elements of the first plurality have rotational axes lying in a first plane and at least one roller element of the first plurality has a rotational axis lying outside of the first plane. A second plurality of roller elements is coupled with the structural member on a second side thereof. At least two roller elements of the second plurality having rotational axes lying in the first plane and at least one roller element of the second plurality has a rotational axis lying outside of the first plane. The trolley further includes a third plurality of roller elements coupled with the structural member. The rotational axes of each of the third plurality of roller elements are angularly displaced relative to the rotational axes of each of the first plurality of roller elements.

Referring to an elevation view and a plan view are shown respectively of a movable partition . In the example shown in the partition may be in the form of folding door. In certain embodiments the partition may be used for example as a security door a fire barrier or as both. In other embodiments the partition need not be utilized as a fire or security barrier but may be used for example to subdivide a larger space into smaller rooms or areas or it may be used as a sound barrier.

The partition may be formed with a plurality of panels that are connected to one another with hinges or other hinge like structures in an alternating pattern of panel and hinge . The hinged connection of the individual panels enables the panels to fold relative to each other in an accordion or a plicated manner such that the partition may be compactly stored such as in a pocket formed in a wall A of a building when the partition is in a retracted or folded state.

When in a deployed state the partition may extend from one wall A to a second wall B to act as a barrier e.g. a fire or security barrier or to divide one area or room into multiple rooms A and B. When it is desired to deploy the partition from a stowed condition to an extended position for example to secure an area during a fire the partition may be motivated along an overhead track across the space to provide an appropriate barrier. When in a deployed or an extended state a leading edge of the partition shown as a male lead post may complementarily or matingly engage with a jamb or door post that may for example be formed in a wall B of a building.

As best seen in the partition may include a first barrier or structure A and a second barrier or structure B each including a plurality of panels coupled with one another by way of hinges or hinge like structures. The second structure B is laterally spaced from the first structure A. Such a configuration may be utilized for example as a fire door wherein one structure e.g. structure A acts as a primary fire and smoke barrier a space between the two structures A and B acts as an insulator or a buffer zone and the other structure e.g. structure B acts as a secondary fire and smoke barrier. Such a configuration may also be useful in providing an acoustical barrier when the partition is used to subdivide a larger space into multiple smaller rooms.

It is noted that the structures A and B are each individually suspended from the overhead track . In other words the track may have multiple elongated channels formed therein such that one structure A is suspended from and longitudinally displaced along a first channel while the second structure B is suspended from and longitudinally displaced along a second separate channel. Such an embodiment is shown and described in further detail below. In another embodiment multiple individual tracks may be located in or on the ceiling or other supporting structure.

Various means may be used to displace the partition from a stowed condition to a deployed condition and vice versa. For example depending on the intended use of the partition it may be displaced manually i.e. by an individual pushing or pulling it along the track . In another embodiment an appropriate actuator may be used to displace the partition .

For example a drive may be used to motivate the partition between a deployed and a retracted state or vice versa. In one embodiment such a drive may include an electric motor coupled to a pulley or gear configured to drive a transmission member such as a belt or chain . A portion of the belt or chain may be coupled to a trolley that is configured to ride along the track . The trolley may be coupled to a component of the partition such as for example the lead post . Thus actuation of the motor and belt or chain in a first direction results in displacement of the trolley and lead post so that the partition may be deployed. Actuation of the motor and belt or chain in a second direction results in displacement of the trolley and lead post so that the partition may be retracted.

Additionally while not specifically shown various sensors and switches may be employed in association with such a drive to assist in the control of the partition . For example as shown in the partition may include a switch or actuator sometimes referred to as panic hardware. Actuation of the panic hardware enables a person located on one side of the partition e.g. in room A to cause the partition to open if it is closed or to stop while it is closing so as to provide access through the barrier formed by the partition for a predetermined amount of time.

It is noted that while the above description has been directed more specifically to an embodiment including a single partition extending from one wall A to another wall B other configurations of movable partitions may be utilized. For example a two door or bi part partition configuration may be utilized wherein two similarly configured partitions extend across a space and join together to form an appropriate barrier as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. In other embodiments a multi part configuration may be employed wherein multiple partitions join at a central door post when each is in an extended state.

While the upper portion of the structures A and B are substantially restrained from lateral displacement due to their slidable coupling with the track or tracks the lower edges of the partitions if not properly restrained may be laterally displaced such that a substantial gap may be formed between the lower edges of the structures A and B and the floor or other surface over which they pass. As previously discussed such displacement may occur due to for example a draft from a fire an imbalanced HVAC heating ventilation and air conditioning system or from some other external force being applied to one of the structures A and B. To prevent or at least minimize such lateral displacement one or more lateral restraint devices may be associated with the movable partition .

Referring to with continued reference to a lateral restraint device is shown and described in greater detail. The lateral restraint device may include a trolley separate and distinct from the trolley described above having rollers or sliders coupled with a structural member . The rollers may be disposed in a central channel of the track and configured to roll or slide along the length of the channel . A bar or other elongated member is coupled with the trolley and extends downwardly from the trolley through an opening in the lower portion of the track such that the elongated member is positioned between the two laterally spaced barriers or structures A and B.

As previously discussed each of the laterally spaced structures A and B include hingedly connected panels that are supported from channels and of the overhead track by for example associated rollers or sliding elements. The elongated member may be coupled with a panel or a hinge of either or both of the structures A and B by an appropriate coupling member. For example in one embodiment a chain or a cable rope or similar component may be coupled between the elongated member and a hinge or panel of either or both of the structures A and B. In another embodiment a substantially rigid bracket shown in dashed lines may be coupled between the elongated member and a hinge or panel of either or both of the structures A and B. In one particular embodiment such a bracket may include or be similar to the brackets used in conjunction with the lateral restraint device described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 934 566 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 931 067 issued Apr. 26 2011 entitled MOVABLE PARTITIONS WITH LATERAL RESTRAINT DEVICES AND RELATED METHODS previously incorporated by reference.

The coupling of the elongated member with one or both of the barriers or structures A and B provides a motivating force to displace the lateral resistance device during opening of closing of the partition such that the lateral restraint device remains proximate associated panels and or hinges of the structures A and B. In other words during displacement of the partition i.e. during extension or retraction thereof as the panel or hinge to which the elongated member is coupled is displaced the elongated member will likewise be displaced along the track .

As may be seen in the trolley includes multiple roller elements on opposing sides of the trolley . More specifically the trolley is positioned generally along a centerline of the partition such that a plurality of roller elements are disposed on one side of the centerline and a plurality of roller elements are disposed on the opposite side of the centerline . In the embodiment shown in there are four roller elements disposed on each side of the trolley . However in other embodiments a different number of roller elements may be utilized.

As perhaps best seen in some of the roller elements on a given side of the trolley are offset relative to the other roller elements . For example roller elements A and C have rotational centers or axes lying within a first common plane represented by axis while roller elements B and D have rotational centers or axes lying along a second plane represented by axis that is offset vertically offset in the orientation shown in relative to the first axis . The roller elements on the opposing side of the trolley may be configured in a similar matter such that for example various roller elements have rotational axes that lie in the first plane and other roller elements have rotational axes that lie in the second plane .

It is noted that in such a configuration two of the roller elements i.e. A and C are in contact with and ride along a lower inside surface of the central channel . The use of multiple roller elements that are in contact with the lower inside surface of the central channel helps to stabilize the lateral restrain device from pivoting at or near the point of the trolley . In other words if only a single roller element were to maintain contact with the lower inside surface the lower portion of the elongated member could be easily angularly displaced in a direction along the path of the partition i.e. to the right or the left as viewed in .

Additionally it is noted that in the embodiment shown in two of the roller elements i.e. B and D do not contact the lower inside surface but rather are within a specified tolerance of or even contact an upper inside surface of the central channel as indicated by dashed lines . This helps to prevent or at least limit potential angular displacement of the elongated member in a direction substantially orthogonal to the path of the partition i.e. to the right or left as viewed in .

Additionally as seen best in additional roller elements or sliding elements may be coupled for example to a bottom portion of the structural member . In the embodiment shown the additional roller elements are orientated to lie in a plane that is substantially orthogonal to the other roller elements coupled to the trolley . Of course those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the various roller elements and may be angled canted or exhibit other orientations and still provide the desired functionality as is described with respect to the currently contemplated embodiment.

The additional roller elements are configured to abut and roll against opposing edge surfaces A and B of the central opening . One advantage of using the additional rollers is that they help avoid angular displacement of the elongated member in a direction substantially orthogonal to the path of the partition i.e. to the right or left as viewed in . In different embodiments the additional rollers may be used in addition to or in place of the upper roller elements i.e. B and D to help prevent or limit the angular displacement of the elongated member . However the use of the additional roller elements also helps to prevent the trolley and associated roller elements from being twisted e.g. about an axis extending substantially through the height as viewed in the drawings of the elongated member and helps prevent the trolley from becoming bound within the central channel of the track .

Thus the lateral displacement device provides a structural member e.g. elongated member positioned between the two laterally spaced structures A and B and which while displaceable along the track is substantially laterally constrained. In an embodiment where for example a chain is used to coupled a structure e.g. A with the elongated member when a force is applied to a structure e.g. A the structure will become displaced until it contacts the elongated member . The elongated member will then resist further displacement due to its coupling with the trolley the trolley being configured to prevent or limit angular displacement of the elongated member as described hereinabove. It is noted that while the barriers or structures A and B may be laterally displaced in such an embodiment until they contact the elongated member such displacement is minimal e.g. a few inches and does not substantially effect the ability of the partition to perform its intended function as a barrier.

In an embodiment where for example a bracket or substantially rigid coupling is formed between a structure e.g. A and the elongated member when a lateral force is applied to the structure e.g. A the force will be transmitted through the bracket to the elongated member which will resist the force and limit displacement of the structure e.g. A .

It is noted that the lateral restraint device prevents lateral displacement of the barriers or structures A and B primarily at the locations where the lateral restraint device is installed. In other words at a longitudinal distance i.e. along the pathway of the partition from the lateral restraint device a barrier or structure A or B will likely experience some lateral displacement. Thus to limit lateral displacement of the barriers or structures A and B along their entire lengths when in an extended state multiple lateral restraint devices may be installed at desired frequencies or distances from one another depending for example on the extended length of the partition as indicated in . In other words when using multiple lateral displacement devices the point of maximum potential lateral displacement of a barrier or structure A or B will be at a midpoint between two adjacent lateral restraint devices . By determining the maximum allowable lateral displacement of any portion of the partition one can design a partition with an appropriate number of longitudinally spaced lateral restraint devices .

In another embodiment the lateral restraint devices may be incorporated with a system such as is described in Ser. No. 11 652 446 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 926 538 issued Apr. 19 2011 entitled LATERAL RESTRAINT FOR A MOVABLE PARTITION MOVABLE PARTITIONS INCORPORATING SAME AND RELATED METHODS. In such a case a cable or other member may be disposed between the two barriers or structures A and B at a location proximate the bottom edges thereof and extend the length of the partition when in a deployed or extended state. In such an embodiment such a cable may be slidably coupled to or in another embodiment positioned adjacent to the elongated members effectively providing a collapsible framework within the partition between the laterally spaced barriers or structures A and B.

Referring back to the lateral restrain device may also include a roller assembly coupled to a lower end of the elongated structure . For example the roller assembly may include a wheel or other roller element configured to contact and roll along a floor or other surface over which the partition is disposed. The roller assembly may additionally include components that help the roller element to maintain contact with the floor as it rolls there across even though the floor may exhibit undulations or elevation changes. For example the roller assembly may include a constant force mechanism such as that which is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 796 325 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 740 046 issued Jun. 22 2010 entitled METHOD APPARATUS AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING A MOVABLE PARTITION and which has been previously incorporated by reference. Such a constant force mechanism may utilize linear actuators and sensors to maintain a desired force between the roller element and the floor even when the elevation of the floor deviates substantially along the pathway of the partition . In another embodiment such a constant force mechanism may include a biasing member such as a spring to continually bias the roller element against the floor with a substantially constant force.

Maintaining contact between the floor and the roller element provides additional support to the elongated member to keep it from being laterally displaced. In other words by application of a desired force between the roller element and the floor the elongated member essentially becomes wedged between the floor and the overhead track and will resist lateral displacement.

In some embodiments the roller assembly may include a caster or similar mechanism that enables the roller element to pivot or swivel relative to the elongated member such that the roller element may change directions concurrently with a change in direction of the partition e.g. from extension to retraction without binding. Additionally in some embodiments the roller assembly may include a directional control mechanism such as is described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 796 325. The directional control mechanism may be used for example to further help maintain the elongated member and the section of partition with which it is associated in a substantially plumb orientation again preventing or limiting the lateral displacement of the door.

While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein. However it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather the invention includes all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims.
