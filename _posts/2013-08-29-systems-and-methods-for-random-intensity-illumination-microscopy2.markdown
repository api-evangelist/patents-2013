Wide field microscopy provides images with short acquisition time and a wide field of view however its inability to resolve depth information limits it to near surface measurements or thin samples. In order to provide both lateral and axial information many techniques in microscopy have been explored. In particular confocal microscopy has gained popularity for its ability to section individual planes by passing the light through a pinhole and eliminating out of focus light. In particular confocal reflectance microscopy CRM has been used for imaging skin. However CRM requires the ability to scan individual points on an object leading to expensive and elaborate point scanning equipment. Other techniques for scanning a full 2D plane include the use of dual wedge scanners or 2D micro electrical mechanical scanners.

Apart from microscopy techniques that require lateral scanning other optical microscopy techniques have been introduced that capture an entire 2D image field in a single step. One such technique is known as structured illumination. This technique uses a known pattern typically at a constant spatial frequency projected onto a sample. Reflected light from areas conjugate to the pattern is modulated at that spatial frequency and can be separated from the out of focus regions. This technique requires that the spatial frequency of the pattern is known a priori such that an exact phase shift can be applied to resolve the entire image. An extension of this technique known as dynamic speckle illumination DSI uses a coherent laser source and a randomly distributed speckle pattern produced by a spatial light modulator that is decorrelated from image to image by either translation or randomization. This technique has been successfully utilized for optical microscopy however the number of images required to produce sectioning increases with depth reducing the quality of the sectioning when imaging deeper into the specimen. Also areas where speckles are correlated can result in streaking within the image causing undesired artifacts within the final image. Dynamic speckle illumination has also typically been utilized with fluorescence from a specimen as a means of providing depth information about the specimen. The use of fluorescence requires that light be absorped and re emitted by the specimen being imaged which often requires the staining of a specimen with a fluorescent material. Fluorescent stains may suffer from limitations in the potential wavelengths that can be emitted are subject to photobleaching and can potentially be harmful to a specimen being imaged in vivo.

Accordingly there is a need for optical microscopy systems and techniques that provide for rapid full field image acquisition high quality image sectioning at depth and safety for in vivo measurements all while being very cost effective to produce. Such systems and techniques will increase the range of environments and applications where optical microscopy can be utilized. When applied to biomedical and healthcare applications such systems and techniques can shorten diagnostic times reduce invasiveness of imaging procedures and improve the quality of patient care.

Still other aspects embodiments and advantages of these exemplary aspects and embodiments are discussed in detail below. Embodiments disclosed herein may be combined with other embodiments in any manner consistent with at least one of the principles disclosed herein and references to an embodiment some embodiments an alternate embodiment various embodiments one embodiment or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature structure or characteristic described may be included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of such terms herein are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Some of the aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are directed to apparatus and processes for optical microscopy utilizing the techniques of random intensity illumination RII and cascaded random intensity illumination CRII which are terms coined by the applicants of this disclosure. RII is an improvement and modification of the techniques utilized in dynamic speckle illumination DSI . RII utilizes a random or pseudorandom diffusion pattern when illuminating an object RII makes use of inexpensive incoherent light emitting diode LED sources and RII can adequately image a specimen using only light signals that have been reflected from a specimen. Unlike prior structured illumination methodologies RII does not require the use of fluorescence which makes this technique a suitable candidate for imaging human skin in vivo as an alternative to biopsy. The use of an LED source not only reduces cost and manufacturing complexity but eliminates the speckles associated with the use of lasers found in competitive microscopy techniques. Also since the system does not require a specific spatial frequency of modulation pattern the exact layout of the random or pseudorandom diffusion pattern can be and is completely arbitrary. Consequently low cost components can be utilized for the diffusers of the RII system. CRII is an extension of RII in which two or more random or pseudorandom diffusion patterns are cascaded in series when illuminating the specimen. These multiple diffusion patterns include both high and low spatial frequency speckle patterns that provide for imaging multiple light intensities and allow for enhanced sectioning capabilities.

As discussed in more detail below these techniques for randomized reflectance speckle illumination provide a novel method and apparatus of optical microscopy that uses inexpensive components provides high image quality and are non invasive for in vivo imaging applications. The herein described imaging methodology and apparatus utilize an incoherent light source and a set of random diffusion patterns are robust to manufacturing and alignment variations that may arise from the assembly of imaging system components as well as being more robust to variations in operational environments than previous techniques used for optical microscopy.

It is to be appreciated that embodiments of the methods and apparatuses discussed herein are not limited in application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The methods and apparatuses are capable of implementation in other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.

Some embodiments disclosed herein implement an optical microscopy apparatus utilizing an incoherent light source and a set of one or more spatially random diffusers to image a sample object using only light that has been reflected from that sample object. illustrates one embodiment of an optical microscopy system containing multiple optical elements aligned along axis and primary optical axis and comprised of three primary subsections and as shown in . In some embodiments the system can include an LED source capable of emitting an incoherent and relatively broadband incoherent optical signal in the direction of a focusing lens . The focusing lens can focus the focused incoherent optical signal on a spatially random or pseudorandom diffuser . The LED incoherent optical signal and focusing lens comprise the first primary subsection of the optical microscopy system . In some embodiments the spatially random or pseudorandom diffuser can be comprised of ground glass. In further embodiments the diffuser can be mounted such that it is rotatable about axis that is parallel to the primary optical axis of the imaging system. In some embodiments once the focused incoherent optical signal propagates through the diffuser the spatially random or pseudorandom pattern provided by the diffuser can be impressed upon the focused incoherent optical signal .

In various embodiments once the focused incoherent optical signal propagates through the diffuser the now diverging optical signal carrying the random or pseudorandom modulation provided by the diffuser can propagate from the diffuser to a collimating lens where the signal can be collimated. The now collimated optical signal propagates through a beam splitter to provide a first split signal to a microscope objective lens . In some embodiments the beam splitter can comprise two triangular glass prisms joined with an adhesive. In other embodiments the beam splitter can be comprised of a half silvered mirror or a dichroic mirrored prism. Upon reaching the microscope objective lens the first split signal can be focused by the microscope objective lens on to a sample object specimen . The second primary subsection of the optical microscopy system may be comprised of the diffuser the collimating lens the objective lens and the sample object specimen .

The reflected optical signal reflected from the sample object specimen can propagate back through the microscope objective lens and can be collimated by the objective lens to provide signal that travels towards the beam splitter . Upon arriving at the beam splitter a portion of the signal can be redirected perpendicularly. The redirected optical signal can propagate toward a second focusing lens . In various embodiments the second focusing lens can focus the optical signal on to an image capture device coupled to a computer processor capable of processing digital images. The optical signal reaching the image capture device can be comprised of incoherent radiation on which can be superimposed both the random or pseudorandom speckle pattern of the diffuser as well as an image of the sample object specimen . In some embodiments the image capture device can be a charge coupled device CCD array. In other embodiments the image capture device can be a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS device array. In further embodiments the image capture device can be any electronic or photonic device capable of capturing digital images as well as either communicating that digital image information to a processor such as the computer processor or writing the digital image information to a non volatile computer readable storage medium.

In some embodiments the image capture device is capable of collecting an optical signal based on the irradiance of light impinging on its surface. For the DRSI optical microscopy system a model describing the irradiance on the detector can be described as in the following equation right arrow over PSF right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over 1 where Iis the pattern irradiance is the reflectance of the object and PSFis the point spread function of the optical detection path. In performing the RII imaging process the goal is to maximize the change in Ito ensure that there is a strong fluctuation as the speckle pattern varies. In some embodiments to create this change in I multiple image frames can be captured by the image capture device and between each frame capture event the spatially random or pseudorandom pattern can be altered in such a manner that there is a random change in the imposed irradiance.

In an ideal setting the diffusion pattern imposed by the diffuser would be perfectly random from frame to frame. In a preferred embodiment of the present system a pseudorandom change in the imposed irradiance can be created through a rotation of the diffuser about an axis that can be parallel to the primary optical axis . By sufficiently rotating the diffuser all parts of the imposed diffusion pattern can be moved across the image plane at the specimen. A sufficient radial translation of the diffusion pattern ensures that no point in the imposed diffusion pattern is in the same location from frame to frame. In these embodiments a motor such as a servomotor can be used to perform a precisely controlled rotation of the diffuser .

When using a rotation of the diffusion pattern in the described manner the illumination pattern may still be radially correlated from frame to frame. These radial correlations of the RII technique can be improved upon through the use of diffusers incorporating multiple spatial frequencies as described below in regards to the CRII technique.

In some embodiments at a particular imaging depth of the specimen multiple image frames which on average could be about 40 frames can be captured to produce an image. Upon the capture of multiple frames a composite irradiance Ican be calculated as the root mean square RMS difference of frame irradiance values as follows square root over 2 where t is the interval between images during which the focused incoherent optical signal has been rotated by some distance. In some embodiments those areas where the contrast has changed due to the imposed diffusion pattern can result in large values of I. Those areas not in focus can have a blurred speckle pattern leading to a low value in I. In some embodiments rather than using consecutive image frames where t 1 decorrelation of the diffusion speckle pattern can be maximized by selecting a rotation t where the speckles have low correlation from frame to frame.

The correlation can be computed as a function of the diffuser rotation speed and the acquisition speed of the image capture device and can be represented by the following formula 

In some embodiments imaging the sample object specimen at separate depths within the sample object specimen can be accomplished by translation of the microscope objective lens using a motor . In other embodiments imaging the sample object specimen at separate depths can be accomplished by translation of the sample object specimen itself using a motor .

As depth increases for an object to be imaged by a RII imaging process and apparatus illumination contrast for the spatially random or pseudorandom pattern can be lost. According to some embodiments this loss of illumination contrast can be overcome by capturing additional image frames to make up for the loss in signal strength. However capturing additional image frames increases the overall time necessary to complete the imaging process. Accordingly according to aspect of some embodiments where it is desirable to provide a rapid imaging process there is provided a method and apparatus of maintaining this image contrast that leads to fewer required image frames per composite image and to a shortened total image capture process time.

When an illumination pattern is projected onto a specimen it is expected that the highest frequencies can be imaged with the least blurring at the surface of the object and can decay in contrast as function of depth. According to some embodiments this loss at depth at higher frequencies can be overcome with additional images measured in order to section a specimen further under the surface. In various embodiments CRII overcomes this issue by leveraging a lower spatial frequency which does not attenuate as quickly at depth. By using a lower spatial frequency to provide imaging capability at depth there can be a trade off between that depth capability and a loss in axial resolution that accompanies the use of a lower spatial frequency.

To illustrate the loss of resolution as a function of depth measurement are plots of the resolutions normalized amplitude for images of particular speckle patterns projected onto a mirror and captured using the RII and CRII techniques measured at separate depth values for each Figure. shows a graph depicting spatial distance across the image plane in micrometers plotted versus normalized amplitude at the surface a depth of 0 micrometers. Graph includes measurements for both the CRII broadband speckle and single speckle measured as a one dimensional cross section. shows a similar graph measuring one dimensional cross sections of spatial distance across the image plane in micrometers versus normalized amplitude for broadband speckle and single speckle at a depth of 0.5 micrometers. Similarly shows a graph plotting one dimensional cross sections for broadband speckle and single speckle as functions of spatial distance across the image plane in micrometers and normalized amplitude at a depth of 1.0 micrometer. In each of these graphs and the imaged speckle pattern was configured to be perfectly conjugate to the image capture device at each of the measured depths. By comparing each of the graphs it can be seen that a significant loss in modulated signal strength can occur as the pattern goes out of focus. In graph shows that both patterns contain a strong high frequency component throughout the entire signal. In graph shows that the pattern is far enough out of focus that the high frequency pattern is completely lost. However curve representing the CRII measurement shows that the low frequency modulation is still present and can contribute to the resulting image. In graph shows that both patterns have been lost leaving only slight contrast changes due to the field of view of the light source.

As a further example of quantification of potential signal loss in the optical microscopy systems described herein shows measurement of the power spectral density at various depths. Graph shows plots of power spectral density measured in dB versus frequency of cycles per pixel at various depths of 0 micrometers surface measurement 0.5 micrometers and 1.0 micrometers in curves and respectively. The highest value of the signal is at a depth of 0 micrometers across all frequencies. As the depth is increased from 0 to 0.5 micrometers there was a loss in the high frequency information greater than 0.04 cycles per pixel of nearly 15 dB whereas lower frequencies decreased with a 5 dB loss. At 1.0 micrometer the entire spectrum decays by about 15 dB. These measurements show that the sectioning process reduces signals outside of 1.0 micrometer of focus by about 15 dB or that the axial resolution of the system is about 1.0 micrometer for any plane in focus. The sectioning ability of the system is comparable to confocal systems attempting to achieve in vivo images using reflectance only.

In some embodiments verification that CRII produces an increased contrast versus DRSI can be performed by characterizing the standard deviation of Ifrom frame to frame in the image capture process. In various embodiments example methods of verification can include taking a measurement of the irradiance at a single pixel from frame to frame and then determining the standard deviation of Iover all frames. In other embodiments a one dimensional cross section of pixels can be measured at each frame with the standard deviation at each pixel location determined and an average of the standard deviation for all pixels calculated. Tables 1 shows example results from these standard deviation calculations for a particular experiment where measurements were taken for a single pixel a vertical stripe of 500 pixels and a horizontal stripe of 500 pixels over 40 image frames. In this particular experiment a ground glass diffuser was separated into two parts with an additional diffusion pattern layer superimposed over a portion of the ground glass allowing for consecutive measurements using the RII and CRII techniques.

The results shown in Tables 1 and 2 show that the CRII technique can produce a higher contrast both at the surface and at depth compared to a single frequency illumination pattern used in RII. Because of a 2 3 times greater contrast at depth sectioning of an image can be performed without a significant number of additional image frames captured.

In some embodiments the multiple diffuser technique of CRII also has the added benefit of reducing the amount of streaking that can be created in an image. As the diffuser is rotated on a fixed axis such as axis areas where the diffusion patterns have slightly greater correlation create local maxima in Iand areas with no minimum create a local minimum in I. As shown in the result of these two effects can be parallel lines or streaks within an image produced with a RII technique. As shown in the use of a CRII technique to produce an image of the same target object significantly minimizes the presence of streaking compared to the streaking in image of . In both images the same number of 40 image frames samples and light source intensities values were utilized. In comparing images and the comparison shows that the addition of a separate decorrelated diffusion pattern having distinct set of spatial frequencies that is can be used to eliminate many of the streaking artifacts resulting from possible radial correlation of diffusion patterns.

In some embodiments the initial setup configuration and calibration of a RII or CRII optical microscopy apparatus include a number of steps to be performed in sequence. One such example method for setup configuration and calibration is presented in . The process begins with alignment of all imaging components in act . Alignment of components includes arranging all elements of system or shown in or including the sample object specimen that is to be imaged. In act an incoherent light source such as an LED source provides illumination of an incoherent optical signal to the optical microscopy system. In act the incoherent light signal is focused by a focusing lens on a diffuser such as diffuser or composite diffuser . In act the incoherent light signal that has been modulated by the diffuser is imaged onto a specimen. Act can comprise multiple sub steps when imaging the diffuser onto the specimen and one example embodiment of these steps is described below with reference to . After imaging of the diffusion pattern onto the specimen act in act the incoherent light signal that has been modulated by the diffusion pattern is reflected from the specimen and a reflected incoherent light signal that has been modulated by both the diffusion pattern and the sample object specimen is imaged onto an image capture device. Act can comprise multiple sub steps when imaging the specimen onto the image capture device and one example of these steps is described below with reference to .

In act a first irradiance signal is captured by the image capture device. The image capture device can either communicate the captured irradiance signal to a processor for further image processing or can write the signal to a non volatile computer readable medium that can later be accessed by the processor. In act the processor can process the signal received from the image capture device to produce a first image frame. In act the diffuser can be rotated by a set distance. In act a second irradiance signal can be captured by the image capture device. And in act as second image frame can be processed by the processor. In act a correlation between the imposed diffusion patterns captured in the first and second image frames can be calculated. Process can be repeated numerous times to determine the appropriate rotation settings of diffusers to provide for an appropriate decorrelation of speckle pattern between image frames for a particular set of diffusers and motor rotation speeds as described previously above.

After calibration of a RII or CRII optical microscopy system such as by process has been completed operation of the system for imaging a specimen at multiple depths can be done. illustrates one such operational procedure for imaging an object specimen at multiple depths with either a RII or CRII optical microscopy system. Process begins with act wherein all components of the optical microscopy system are aligned for a specimen at its current depth. As described in reference to step of process aligning all components of the system can include aligning the specimen as well as the other optical components. In act the optical microscopy system can be illuminated by an incoherent light source such as an LED source . In act the incoherent optical signal produced by the LED source can propagate to a focusing lens where the focused incoherent optical signal can be focused on one or more random diffusers such as diffuser or composite diffuser depending on whether the system is a RII or CRII optical microscopy system. In act the diverging optical signal that has been modulated by the one or more diffusers can be imaged on to the sample object specimen . In some embodiments the process of imaging the incoherent diffuser modulated diverging optical signal onto the specimen can be performed by a process such as process described previously in reference to .

In act the incoherent diffusion modulated reflected optical signal that has been reflected from the sample object specimen can be imaged on to an image capture device . In various embodiments the process of imaging the signal reflected from the specimen can be performed by a process such as process described previously in reference to . In act an irradiance signal can be collected by the image capture device . In some embodiments the irradiance signal captured by the image capture device can be either communicated to a computer processor for further image processing or can be written to a non volatile computer readable medium that can later be accessed by the processor. In act the processor can process the signal received from the image capture device to produce a first image frame. In act the diffuser such as diffuser or composite diffuser can be rotated by a set distance.

Next based on configuration of the optical microscopy system and the quality of the currently captured image frame a decision can be made by the process and apparatus or by an operator of the apparatus as to whether an additional image frame is to be captured to produce an image of sufficient quality. In some embodiments if an additional image frame is to be captured then the process can proceed to act where instructions are provided to capture the additional image frame. The system is then returned to act and is configured to repeat steps to . In various embodiments if additional frames are not to be captured at the current depth of the specimen then the system can proceed to act wherein all frames at a particular depth can be processed by the processor to produce an image at the current depth. It is to be appreciated that this image can be a composite of irradiance measurements from all frames or a subset of frames captured at the current specimen depth.

Subsequently based on the configuration settings of the system a decision can be made as to whether images of the specimen at different depth are desired. In some embodiments if images of the specimen at a different depth are desired the process can advance to act wherein either the sample object specimen or the microscope objective lens are moved by associated motors to a new location. Upon moving either the specimen or the objective lens the process can be returned to act and steps to can be repeated at the new depth. In some embodiments if an image of the specimen at an additional depth is not to be done then the process can proceed to act wherein the processor can process all images in the z stack of depth images that have been created of the current specimen.

In some embodiments when capturing an image of the specimen using an image capture device such as image capture device the signals representing the image can be communicated by either electronic or photonic methods to either a processor or non volatile computer readable medium such as the computer in and . describes one such computer as the distributed system .

These data structures may be sized and organized to store values for particular data and types of data.

Components of the computer system are coupled by an interconnection element such as the bus . The bus may include one or more physical busses for example busses between components that are integrated within a same machine but may include any communication coupling between system elements including specialized or standard computing bus technologies such as IDE SCSI PCI and InfiniBand. The bus enables communications such as data and instructions to be exchanged between system components of the computer system .

The computer system also includes one or more interface devices such as input devices output devices and combination input output devices. Interface devices may receive input or provide output. More particularly output devices may render information for external presentation. Input devices may accept information from external sources. Examples of interface devices include keyboards mouse devices trackballs microphones touch screens printing devices display screens speakers network interface cards etc. Interface devices allow the computer system to exchange information and to communicate with external entities such as users and other systems.

The data storage includes a computer readable and writeable nonvolatile or nontransitory data storage medium in which instructions are stored that define a program or other object that is executed by the processor . The data storage also may include information that is recorded on or in the medium and that is processed by the processor during execution of the program. More specifically the information may be stored in one or more data structures specifically configured to conserve storage space or increase data exchange performance. The instructions may be persistently stored as encoded signals and the instructions may cause the processor to perform any of the functions described herein. The medium may for example be optical disk magnetic disk or flash memory among others. In operation the processor or some other controller causes data to be read from the nonvolatile recording medium into another memory such as the memory that allows for faster access to the information by the processor than does the storage medium included in the data storage . The memory may be located in the data storage or in the memory however the processor manipulates the data within the memory and then copies the data to the storage medium associated with the data storage after processing is completed. A variety of components may manage data movement between the storage medium and other memory elements and examples are not limited to particular data management components. Further examples are not limited to a particular memory system or data storage system.

Although the computer system is shown by way of example as one type of computer system upon which various aspects and functions may be practiced aspects and functions are not limited to being implemented on the computer system as shown in .

The computer system may be a computer system including an operating system that manages at least a portion of the hardware elements included in the computer system . In some examples a processor or controller such as the processor executes an operating system. Examples of a particular operating system that may be executed include a Windows based operating system such as Windows NT Windows 2000 Windows ME Windows XP Windows Vista Windows 7 or Windows 8 operating systems available from the Microsoft Corporation a MAC OS System X operating system available from Apple Computer one of many Linux based operating system distributions for example the Enterprise Linux operating system available from Red Hat Inc. a Solaris operating system available from Oracle Corporation or a UNIX operating systems available from various sources. Many other operating systems may be used and examples are not limited to any particular operating system.

The processor and operating system together define a computer platform for which application programs in high level programming languages are written. These component applications may be executable intermediate bytecode or interpreted code which communicates over a communication network for example the Internet using a communication protocol for example TCP IP. Similarly aspects may be implemented using an object oriented programming language such as .Net SmallTalk Java C Ada or C C Sharp . Other object oriented programming languages may also be used.

Alternatively functional scripting or logical programming languages may be used. Additionally various aspects and functions may be implemented in a non programmed environment for example documents created in HTML XML or other format that when viewed in a window of a browser program can render aspects of a graphical user interface or perform other functions. Further various examples may be implemented as programmed or non programmed elements or any combination thereof. For example a web page may be implemented using HTML while a data object called from within the web page may be written in C . Thus the examples are not limited to a specific programming language and any suitable programming language could be used. Accordingly the functional components disclosed herein may include a wide variety of elements e.g. specialized hardware executable code data structures or objects that are configured to perform the functions described herein.

In some examples the components disclosed herein may read parameters that affect the functions performed by the components. These parameters may be physically stored in any form of suitable memory including volatile memory such as RAM or nonvolatile memory such as a magnetic hard drive . In addition the parameters may be logically stored in a propriety data structure such as a database or file defined by a user mode application or in a commonly shared data structure such as an application registry that is defined by an operating system . In addition some examples provide for both system and user interfaces that allow external entities to modify the parameters and thereby configure the behavior of the components.

Various aspects and functions described herein may be implemented as specialized hardware or software components executing in one or more computer systems. There are many examples of computer systems that are currently in use. These examples include among others network appliances personal computers workstations mainframes networked clients servers media servers application servers database servers and web servers.
