This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 142 818 filed on Jun. 20 2008 entitled ASSOCIATION OF AN INPUT AND OUTPUT OF A PERIPHERAL DEVICE IN A COMPUTING SYSTEM at least some of which may be incorporated herein.

Many peripheral devices include both inputs and outputs that are not associated with each other. An application instantiated on a computing system coupled to the peripheral devices may not have access to the association of the input and the output of the peripheral device.

Implementations described and claimed herein address the foregoing problems by allowing for association of an output of a peripheral device with an input of that peripheral device in a computing system. The association of the output with the input of the peripheral device provides an ability to link the associated input and output of the peripheral device in a computing system. An application instantiated on the computing system may use the association of the input and output capabilities of the peripheral device.

In one implementation for example descriptor information of a peripheral device is received from a coupled peripheral device. The descriptor information describes attributes of the peripheral device and an association between an input of the peripheral device and an output of the peripheral device. Peripheral device classes of associated input attributes including associated output attributes of the peripheral device are provided and an instantiated application is informed of attributes of the peripheral device through classes.

In another implementation an interface layer is provided comprising associated input attributes and output attributes of an associated device. An input logical layer is used to access attributes of an interface layer for an input of the peripheral device including associated output attributes of the peripheral device. An attribute associated with the peripheral device is selected and set.

In yet another implementation for example descriptor information of a peripheral device is received and used to build interface sets including attributes of an input and an associated output of the peripheral device. The interface sets may be used to select and set attributes of the peripheral device.

In some implementations articles of manufacture are provided as computer program products. One implementation of a computer program product provides a computer program storage medium readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program. Another implementation of a computer program product may be provided in a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave by a computing system and encoding the computer program. Other implementations are also described and recited herein.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other features details utilities and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be apparent from the following more particular written Detailed Description of various embodiments and implementations as further illustrated in the accompanying drawings and defined in the appended claims.

A computing system for associating an output of a peripheral device with an input of that peripheral device is provided.

The peripheral device may comprise any type of peripheral device that may be coupled to the computing system . The peripheral device may comprise for example a typical peripheral input device for a desktop or laptop computer such as a keyboard a mouse a joystick a game controller a tablet screen a web camera a microphone an external storage device or other computer input output peripheral device. The peripheral device may also comprise a peripheral device to any other type of computing system such as a mobile telephone a security system a vehicle or airplane control system or any other type of computing system. The peripheral device may for example comprise a peripheral device to an automobile computing system such as an identification e.g. bio identification or keypad module an entry door handle a button a touch pad or screen or any other type of peripheral device that may be coupled to and controlled by the computing system .

The peripheral device may be coupled to the computing system in any manner such as via a wired or wireless link . The peripheral device may be integral with the computing system e.g. a laptop computer or mobile telephone keyboard or removably coupled to the computing system via a wireless or wired connection e.g. an IEEE 802.11 wireless peripheral device a Bluetooth wireless peripheral device a radio frequency wireless peripheral device a serial peripheral device a universal serial bus USB peripheral device e.g. a human interface device HID such as a keyboard a mouse or a joy stick a camera an external storage device a microphone or the like .

A peripheral device may include any number of inputs associated with any number of outputs on the peripheral device . A keyboard peripheral device for example may comprise a number of input keys e.g. a QWERTY Dvorak T 9 or other keyboard that may be associated with any number of outputs that may be controlled by the computing system under the control of the input logical layer . One or more outputs of the keyboard may be associated with an input of the keyboard.

In one implementation for example a height of a particular key or group of keys may be raised or lowered to raise or lower their profile relative to other keys on the keyboard. On a locked mobile telephone keyboard for example keys used to unlock the keyboard may be lowered to reduce the chance of having the keys inadvertently pressed. In another implementation as one or more modifier keys e.g. CTRL ALT FN ALTGR or other modifier keys are pressed keys that correspond to that particular key may be raised in height and or keys that do not correspond to a particular modifier key may be lowered in height to indicate which keys are expected to be depressed.

One or more displays on the peripheral device may also be used to indicate current settings likely keystroke combinations or other information. Displays on a keyboard may show current settings for the keyboard e.g. fonts colors uppercase lowercase . The displays may be located on individual keys of the keyboard or on another portion of the display. Similar to key height outputs described above the displays may also be used to indicate likely keystrokes e.g. when a modifier key has been depressed or where an application predicts likely keystroke combinations or other settings e.g. a key lock out feature that prevents repetitive otherwise unwanted keystroke combinations .

Other peripheral devices may also include any number of outputs that may be associated with an input of the device. On a mouse for example a button of the mouse may be raised when a cursor controlled by the mouse is over a link that may be selected by use of that button and or lowered when the cursor is not over such a link.

An access peripheral device e.g. a door handle of an automobile or a secured doorway may be controlled to allow access by controlling one or more output of the peripheral device. When a user is deemed to be an authorized user a door handle or other access peripheral device may be controlled to allow access. A door handle may be retracted when access is to be prevented and or extended to an accessible position when access is permitted. In another implementation a temperature of a button for a climate control system e.g. on a house thermostat or an automobile climate control system may be controlled to indicate to a user if it will increase or decrease a temperature set point of the climate control system.

An input and or an output of the peripheral device may be static or dynamic. A static input or output for example may comprise an input or output that is used for a single purpose while a dynamic input or output may change functions depending upon one or more conditions of the computing system . A dynamic button in an automobile computing system for example may be used to initiate ignition of an engine when the automobile is off while the same button may be used to control some other aspect of the automobile computing system when the engine is running. Similarly a dynamic output associated with the button may be changed corresponding to the function of the input button at any given time.

These implementations of outputs that may be associated with an input of a peripheral device are merely examples. One skilled in the art would readily appreciate from this disclosure that any number of other types of peripheral devices may include any number of types of outputs that may be associated with one or more type of input of a peripheral device.

The peripheral device is self aware in that it comprises self identifier configuration information that may be used by the computing system to associate an output capability of the peripheral device with an input capability of the peripheral device . The peripheral device is coupled to the computing system via coupling hardware e.g. a port associated with the computing system such as a serial port a USB port a parallel port a wireless transceiver or the like .

The self identifier configuration information may comprise for example a logical association between the output capability and the input capability of the peripheral device physical attributes of the output or input device e.g. a screen size color capabilities placement capabilities movement capabilities or other attributes .

An input logical layer is provided in the computing system for associating an output of the peripheral device with an input of that peripheral device. The input logical layer provides unified access to and control of different elements of the peripheral device to an operating system running on the computing system . Where a keyboard peripheral device comprises a number of inputs and corresponding outputs for example the input logical layer may provide an interface for accessing and controlling the inputs and outputs of the keyboard peripheral device.

In one implementation for example the input logical layer may link separate logical representations of devices such as device classes or other representations. In the implementation shown in for example the computing system comprises device classes for a keyboard a mouse and a door handle . In addition for each class the computing system further comprises an interface set and e.g. an interface layer including attributes for the corresponding device class. The interface set may comprise for example an application programming interface API set that includes attributes for the corresponding device class. API sets are just one example of an interface set that may be used. Other types of interface sets may also be used.

The input logical layer may receive the self identifier configuration information from the peripheral device and create the logical representations for the peripheral device . The input logical layer for example may receive a peripheral device class and configuration information identifying one or more inputs and outputs of the peripheral device and generate an interface associating at least one output with an input of the peripheral device .

In this implementation the input logical layer may utilize the data structure to identify and control one or more outputs corresponding to a particular input of a peripheral device coupled to a computer system. An application may for example utilize the logical input layer to control an output on the peripheral device corresponding to a particular input of the peripheral device. An application running on a computing system may for example direct the input logical layer to alter a height temperature and or a display associated with an input key a of the keyboard peripheral device.

The data structure shown in however is merely one example of a data structure that may be used. Other data structures such as an XML schema data structure may also be used.

Depending on the class or other logical designation of the peripheral device the input logical layer of the computing system may call the set attribute API of an input attribute logical layer in operation . The input logical layer may also determine an attribute associated with an input report in operation . The input logical layer may also set an attribute of the peripheral device in operation . In one implementation for example the input logical layer may send information over a bus may send a state change request to a cache or other data storage held in the peripheral device send state information to the peripheral device to prepopulate the cache or other data storage of the peripheral device for a specific application or set an attribute of the peripheral device via another method. In some various implementations for example a keyboard peripheral device may be set for various math sets music sets symbol translations for foreign languages and outputs of the keyboard peripheral device may be used to identify the variations of the inputs of the keyboard. The individual keys of the keyboard peripheral device may each comprise a display that may be altered to display various math sets music sets or language sets that could be used with the keyboard peripheral device.

One or more output of a peripheral device may be associated with an input of that peripheral device. In one example a keyboard modifier key e.g. CTRL ALT FN ALTGR or other modifier keys may be associated with outputs identifying acceptable keys of a limited entry set that may correspond to a latched modifier key. The limited entry set for example may include keys that correspond to features of a menu. When an ALT modifier key is latched in Microsoft Word for example an output for the keys corresponding to selections available in the menu e.g. F for File E for Edit and the like may be activated to identify to a user what keystrokes will perform an identified function. The outputs for the limited entry set of keys may for example be highlighted e.g. displaying a different appearance e.g. a color position e.g. a raised height feel e.g. a tactile identifier such as a vibration or bump and the like . Similarly outputs corresponding to keyboard shortcuts e.g. when data has been copied and is available to be inserted or pasted or predicted keystrokes may also be activated.

In other examples a plurality of keys may be grouped together to provide a larger keyset for providing easier input e.g. in a physical accommodation a gaming environment where a full keyset is not required or the like . Further outputs e.g. displays on the individual keys may display which particular keys are grouped together and what the group collectively represents. A group of keys may be collectively illuminated with a common color or other representation to identify the keys as being grouped together. Further a display may further indicate an input for which the group of keys will collectively represent e.g. a group of keys may collectively represent a single letter number function command or other input .

In a keyboard font and or case changes may be directly represented on keys of a keyboard. Displays on the individual keys may show a true representation of how a particular key would be represented in a selected font. Where a Times New Roman font has been selected in an application for example keys of a keyboard may show how individual keys would be displayed in that font. Similarly displays on the keys may show cases of letters depending on whether a CAPS LOCK key is activated or if a SHIFT key is latched. Also displays on the keys may indicate functions that may be selected when a FN key is latched. Other indications are also possible.

Where particular keys or combinations of keys are expected or required e.g. a CTRL ALT DEL combination is required those keys may be highlighted e.g. through a display position feel or other manner and or other keys may be dimmed or otherwise given a lower profile e.g. retracted .

 Timeout or lockout sequences may also be indicated through displays on keys of a keyboard. Where repetitive striking of a key is disabled within a time period for example one or more displays on the keyboard may be used to indicate that the key is being locked. When a particular key is latched for example the key may be highlighted for a predetermined time period to indicate that the key is locked from receiving a further input during that time period. Displays on one or more keys may further be used to indicate that the time out is subsiding e.g. an initial display indicating that the key is latched and a decay sequence to indicate the time out is subsiding .

Invalid inputs on a keyboard may also be indicated to a user via one or more output on a keyboard. Outputs of a peripheral device may visually spatially tactiley or otherwise indicate that an invalid input has been received from that device.

Graphic or other representations of particular available function may also be represented on an output of a peripheral device corresponding to a particular input of that peripheral device. A display on a key of a keyboard for example may depict a graphical representation e.g. an icon that corresponds to a particular function available by activation of a key of the keyboard.

In a gaming or other environment outputs of a peripheral device may be used to augment input options of the peripheral device. In one implementation contextual clues based on a game or educational application may be provided. A hint mode in a maze game for example may activate displays showing valid navigational inputs e.g. keys that may be used to navigate the maze. Similarly inputs of a peripheral device may be altered depending upon certain situations. In a role playing game for example a heightened sense of awareness may be accomplished by making inputs easier while a reduced sense of awareness e.g. an intoxicated drugged or impaired character may be accomplished by making user inputs of the peripheral device more difficult. Inputs of the peripheral device for example may indicate more or less information than would otherwise be provided. Further layout of inputs may be altered to make input easier or more difficult depending on the conditions present in the game. Keys or other input devices may be raised or lowered in profile highlighted or hidden given more or less resistance moved or assigned different values or the like depending upon the conditions of the game. Combinations of input entry in a game may also be predicted and highlighted or diminished depending upon the circumstances.

In an education application e.g. a typing or musical instrument tutorial application input devices may be augmented by output capabilities of the peripheral device. Predictive or desired inputs may be identified to aid a user in learning correct inputs or combinations of inputs.

While particular examples may be given for one or more particular implementation of a peripheral device such as for a keyboard similar functionalities or capabilities may also be used with respect to other types of peripheral devices.

An example of a hardware and operating environment of for implementing operations to associate an output of a peripheral device coupled to a computing system with an input of that peripheral device includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer including a processing unit a system memory and a system bus that operatively couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit .

These and other output devices are often connected to the processing unit through the serial port interface that is coupled to the system bus but may be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port game port or a universal serial bus USB . A media tuner module may also be connected to the system bus to tune audio and video programming e.g. TV programming for output through the video adapter or other presentation output modules.

The computer may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers such as remote computer . These logical connections may be achieved by a communication device coupled to or integral with the computer the disclosed subject matter is not limited to a particular type of communications device. The remote computer may be another computer a server a router a network personal computer a client a peer device or other common network node and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer although only a memory storage device has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN .
