The present application is a 35 U.S.C. 371 U.S. National Phase application of International Patent Application No. PCT US2013 020792 filed Jan. 9 2013 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 424 197 filed Mar. 19 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 523 220 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The following disclosure relates generally to vehicle safety systems and more specifically to structure mounted airbag assemblies for aircraft and associated systems and methods.

Various types of seat belt and airbag systems have been used to protect passengers in automobiles aircraft and other vehicles. In automobiles for example airbags typically deploy from the steering column dashboard side panel and or other fixed locations. During a rapid deceleration event e.g. a collision a sensor detects the event and transmits a corresponding signal to an initiation device e.g. a pyrotechnic device on an airbag inflator. This causes the inflator to release compressed gas into the airbag thereby rapidly inflating the airbag.

Although airbags that deploy from stationary locations e.g. a steering column may be effective in automobiles they may not be as effective in other types of vehicles having other seating arrangements. Seats in commercial passenger aircraft for example can be configured in a variety of layouts that provide different spacing between succeeding rows and adjacent seats. The aircraft seatbacks may also rotate forward and downward during a crash or similar event and thus may be unsuitable for airbag storage. As a result airbags have been developed that deploy from seat belts to accommodate occupants in aircraft and other vehicles.

The present disclosure describes structure mounted air bag assemblies for use in e.g. aircraft and associated systems and methods. In several embodiments for example a structure mounted airbag system in a commercial aircraft can include a housing positioned forward of and offset from a passenger seat. The housing can contain an airbag mounted behind a covered opening. During a crash or rapid deceleration event the airbag can deploy through the opening toward the seat to reduce the impact experienced by the occupant. Since the structure mounted airbag system is offset from the vehicle seat the airbag deploys in a manner that avoids direct contact with out of position seat occupants such as occupants in the brace position i.e. occupants with their head between their knees and small children e.g. children seated in a child seat or lap held children . As used herein the terms structure mounted and structure mountable refer to features that are or can be mounted to a substantially fixed structure e.g. a wall divider or a fixed piece of furniture rather than to a movable feature e.g. a seat belt a commercial aircraft seat back etc. .

Certain details are set forth in the following description and in to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. For example several embodiments of structure mounted airbag systems are described below in the context of commercial passenger aircraft. However the structure mounted airbag systems and aspects thereof disclosed herein may be used in a wide variety of other vehicles including other aircraft e.g. private and military aircraft ground vehicles e.g. automobiles trucks buses trains and motor homes watercraft etc. Other details describing well known structures and systems often associated with airbags circuitry restraint systems etc. have not been set forth below to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the disclosure.

Many of the details dimensions angles and other features shown in are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly other embodiments can include other details dimensions angles and features without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that further embodiments of the structure mounted airbag systems can be practiced without several of the details described below.

In the Figures identical reference numbers identify identical or at least generally similar elements. To facilitate the discussion of any particular element the most significant digit or digits of any reference number refers to the Figure in which that element is first introduced. For example element is first introduced and discussed with reference to .

In one aspect of the illustrated embodiment the airbag system includes an enclosure or housing fixedly attached to the floor of the vehicle forward of the seat and offset to one side of the seat . The housing can be positioned to the outside of the seat proximate to the aisle of the aircraft and apart from the window and or other inwardly positioned structure e.g. a divider wall as shown in . In other embodiments the housing can be positioned proximate to the window between individual seats in a row and or otherwise positioned forward of the seat . As described in greater detail below an airbag not shown can be stored in the housing and deployed through an opening in the housing toward the seat during a rapid deceleration or other crash event to lessen the crash impact experienced by the seat occupant. The airbag system can protect the passenger s head during forward rotation about the two point seat belt and the offset positioning of the housing can also provide sufficient space around the seat for the passenger to move to a brace position i.e. with the passenger s head between his or her knees and avoid impacting the airbag as it deploys. Additionally the housing can serve to hide the airbag from view of the seat occupant to provide an aesthetically pleasing seating environment.

The housing can be a separate or independent structural assembly that can be fixedly attached to a portion of the aircraft interior via the mounting structure and inhibit passengers from accessing the airbag assembly and or associated components stored within the housing e.g. to inhibit inadvertent airbag deployment . The housing can be made from a durable composite material and or other suitable materials for storing the components of the airbag system e.g. the airbag assembly to reduce the likelihood of unintentional airbag deployment e.g. due to passenger wear and tear on the housing . In certain embodiments the housing can also serve as a partial divider between aircraft seats and or a table for seat occupants. A portion of the cavity can also be used as storage for the seat occupant s belongings for additional safety equipment e.g. life vests and or for other items. In other embodiments the housing can be attached to or integrally formed with a portion of the aircraft e.g. the interior sidewalls of the aircraft . The housing for example can be incorporated into a sidewall of the aircraft from which the airbag can deploy.

In the illustrated embodiment the housing includes a cover or door positioned across the opening that at least substantially conceals the cavity from view before airbag deployment. In the door is shown spaced apart from the opening for clarity. The door can be attached to the housing using one or more releasable fasteners that swing or otherwise enable the door to move away from the opening under the force of the inflating airbag thereby allowing the airbag to deploy through the opening . The door for example can be secured over the opening with a plurality of screws that are configured to break under the force of airbag deployment. In other embodiments the door can be configured to automatically move away from the opening in response to a crash event rather than relying on the force of the airbag. The door for example can include electronics to automatically slide pivot and or otherwise move away from the opening in anticipation of airbag deployment.

In various embodiments one or more lanyards made from webbing material used for seat belts and or other suitable materials can be attached between the door and the housing . The lanyards retain the door to the housing when the airbag projects through the opening and prevent the door from flying through the aircraft cabin. In certain embodiments the lanyards can be configured to enable the door to rotate or otherwise move to an open position that is substantially flush with the adjacent sidewall of the housing and out of the way of the seat occupant during egress. In other embodiments hinges and or other suitable movable coupling mechanisms can be used to retain the door to the housing during and after airbag deployment.

The airbag assembly can include various features that allow it to be preassembled before mounting it in the housing . for example are enlarged front and back isometric views respectively of the airbag assembly configured in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure and is front view of the airbag assembly during an intermediate assembly stage. As shown in the airbag assembly can include an airbag folded or otherwise stowed within an airbag container or cover . The cover can be made from a flexible material such as a thin film material made from nylon or polyamide and can include one or more tear seams not shown that are designed to rupture upon airbag inflation. In other embodiments at least a portion of the cover can be made from a semi rigid and or rigid material that ruptures and or otherwise releases the airbag during inflation.

The airbag assembly can be secured to the housing with a dual plate mounting structure. The mounting structure can include an internal mounting plate e.g. a U shaped mounting plate as shown in positioned inside the airbag and affixed to an external mounting plate via a plurality of fasteners e.g. screws . This configuration enables the peripheral portions of the external mounting plate to be secured across the opening of the housing . This dual plate mounting structure allows the airbag assembly to be preassembled before mounting to a suitable housing e.g. the housing shown in . illustrate a certain embodiment of such a dual plate mounting structure. As those skilled in the art will understand however the dual plate mounting structure as well as other suitable mounting structures can have a variety of different configurations to accommodate the structural features to which they are attached.

In various embodiments of the airbag assembly the airbag can include an active vent not shown that opens when the pressure within the airbag reaches a predetermined threshold. The vent for example can be a discrete seam on the airbag that is sewn shut and tears open at a designated pressure e.g. when the occupant contacts the airbag . This feature can be of particular use with two point restraints that do not restrain forward movement of the occupant s upper body because it limits the force with which the seat occupant impacts the airbag and reduces the rebound of the occupant from the airbag . The vent can also allow the airbag to deflate rapidly e.g. within seconds after inflation so it does not impede occupant egress from the seat in an emergency situation.

Referring back to the airbag system can further include an airbag inflator shown schematically in fluid communication with the airbag assembly and an electronics module assembly shown schematically operably coupled to the inflator . The inflator can include a container of compressed gas e.g. air and a pyrotechnic device e.g. a squib connector that can be activated by a signal sent by the electronics module assembly in response to a crash event. The signal initiates the squib which causes the container to release the expanding gas into the airbag. In other embodiments the inflator can include other suitable initiation and or inflation devices e.g. gas generating inflators well known in the art.

In various embodiments the inflator can be spaced apart from the airbag assembly and fluidly coupled thereto using a gas delivery hose and or other suitable fluid passageway. The gas delivery hose can include a first end fitting in fluid communication with the interior of the airbag and a second end fitting e.g. an inflator connector as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 194 411 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety threadably or otherwise engaged with an outlet of the inflator . The gas delivery hose can have suitable dimensions for rapid gas delivery to the airbag depending at least in part on the distance between the inflator and the airbag assembly . In certain embodiments for example the gas delivery hose may have a deflated width of 1.125 inches 28.58 mm and an inflated outer diameter of 0.75 inch 19.05 mm .

In some embodiments the inflator can be positioned outside the housing and or spaced apart from the airbag assembly in the cavity and the gas delivery hose can extend between the airbag assembly and the inflator . The remotely positioned inflator for example can be mounted in any suitable orientation and secured to a portion of the aircraft e.g. under the housing under the floor of the aircraft proximate the housing etc. using brackets and or other suitable mounting structures that can withstand loads encountered during normal aircraft operation gas deployment from the inflator and certain impact loads e.g. loads applied under a 16 g dynamic test . The gas delivery hose can be made from a suitable flexible material that can accommodate the positioning of the inflator relative to the airbag assembly and yet be durable enough to withstand the delivery of the expanding gas to the airbag and regular wear. The modular positioning of the inflator with respect to the airbag assembly provided by the gas delivery hose allows the airbag system to accommodate the space constraints of the housing and the vehicle itself. In further embodiments the gas delivery hose can be omitted and the outlet of the inflator can be positioned in direct fluid communication with the airbag assembly .

In the illustrated embodiment the electronics module assembly includes a processor that receives electrical power from a power source e.g. one or more lithium batteries a deployment circuit that initiates the inflator and at least one crash sensor that detects rapid decelerations and or other crash events. The crash sensor for example can include a spring mass damper type sensor with an inertial switch calibrated for the vehicle s operating environments that initiates airbag deployment upon a predetermined deceleration level. In other embodiments the crash sensor can include other suitable types of sensors known in the art. Optionally the electronics module assembly can also include one or more magnetic field sensors that detect the presence of an external magnetic field e.g. from a speaker and communicate with the processor to deactivate the crash sensor and prevent inadvertent deployment of the airbag assembly . The magnetic field sensor can include for example the circuitry disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 535 115 entitled AIR BAG HAVING EXCESSIVE EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD PROTECTION CIRCUITRY which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In other embodiments the electronics module assembly can include other sensors and or additional features to aid in airbag deployment and or some of the components of the electronics module assembly may be omitted. In certain embodiments for example the electronics module assembly can include only the power source and the crash sensor which completes a circuit to activate the inflator during a crash event. The components of the electronics module assembly can be housed in a protective cover e.g. a machined or injection molded plastic box that can reduce the likelihood of damaging the electronics module assembly and a magnetic shield that can prevent the electronics module assembly from inadvertently deploying the airbag assembly . In other embodiments the electronics module assembly can be stored in the housing disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 533 105 entitled ELECTRONICS MODULE ASSEMBLY FOR INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED METHODS which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and or other suitable electronics housings known in the art. In further embodiments the electronics module assembly can include diagnostic testing features such as those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 174 659 entitled INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 228 333 entitled COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR REMOTE TESTING OF INFLATABLE PERSONAL RESTRAINT SYSTEMS which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Similar to the modular positioning of the inflator the electronics module assembly can also be housed within the cavity or in a remote location proximate the housing and coupled to the inflator via suitable electrical connectors. The electronics module assembly for example can be positioned on the underside of the housing under a seat or elsewhere in the aircraft. When mounted remotely the electronics module assembly can be positioned to properly transmit the crash pulse and reduce vibration effects.

During a crash event above a predetermined threshold the crash sensor of the electronics module assembly can close one or more switches thereby causing the processor to send a corresponding signal to the deployment circuit . Upon receiving a signal from the processor the deployment circuit can apply a sufficient voltage to an igniter e.g. a squib that causes the inflator to discharge its compressed gas into the airbag via the gas delivery hose . The expansion of the compressed gas inflates the airbag and causes it to deploy through the opening in the housing . The door moves away from the opening e.g. due to the force applied by the inflating airbag allowing the airbag to expand toward the occupant in the corresponding seat. The lanyards can retain the opened door substantially flush to the housing such that it does not interfere with the occupant during subsequent egress. The airbag can be offset from the seat so that it deploys in a direction that avoids direct contact with the seat occupant if the occupant is in the brace position. The airbag is also positioned forward enough from the seat and sized appropriately to avoid contact with lap held children or children in child seats. The active vent on the airbag can reduce the force on the occupant at impact with the airbag e.g. a head impact criterion under 1 000 reduce rebound of the occupant s head from the airbag and can also allow the airbag to deflate quickly after impact e.g. within 10 seconds to further facilitate egress from the seat. Additionally the modular airbag system e.g. the self contained airbag assembly inflator and the electronics module assembly can accommodate the space constraints of differing structural mounting locations and can be independent of other aircraft systems e.g. without needing to be interfaced with the aircraft wiring .

Referring to the inflation of the airbag can rotate the door downward against the housing and thereby move it out of the way of the seat occupant to facilitate subsequent egress e.g. after a crash . In the illustrated embodiment the airbag includes a first portion extending in a generally vertical direction adjacent to the housing and having a substantially tubular shape and a second portion that extends generally laterally with respect to the first portion toward the seat occupant giving the airbag a generally L shaped cross section. The second portion can have a generally triangular cross sectional shape that impedes the forward acceleration of the seat occupant s upper torso before the airbag makes contact with the seat occupant s head and therefore decreases the force with which the seat occupant s head strikes the airbag . In further embodiments the airbag can have other suitable configurations to accommodate the seat configuration such as the airbags described below with references to .

The airbag can include an active vent that remains closed until the internal pressure of the airbag reaches a predetermined threshold such as when the seat occupant s head impacts the airbag and or when the airbag is fully inflated. In the illustrated embodiment the vent is an elongated seam at the underside of the second portion of the airbag that tears or otherwise ruptures at the threshold pressure to release the gas e.g. air from within the airbag . In other embodiments the vent can be positioned elsewhere on the airbag and or have other suitable configurations e.g. a valve or plug or it can be omitted.

As shown in in further embodiments the airbag can be mounted to a structure e.g. a dividing wall substantially or directly in front of the seat occupant . In the illustrated embodiment the airbag has a generally hemispherical cross sectional shape but in other embodiments the airbag may have a generally triangular cross sectional shape to absorb upper body impact before the seat occupant s head hits the airbag and or other suitable airbag shapes.

In still further embodiments the airbag can be mounted to a permanent or semi permanent structure proximate to the seat and in line with the vehicle direction. As shown in for example the airbag can be positioned to the side of the aircraft seat e.g. on a divider wall between aircraft seats and generally in line with the aircraft direction i.e. as indicated by arrow . In additional embodiments the structure mounted airbag systems and assemblies disclosed herein can be mounted to other suitable structures and or have other suitable configurations.

From the foregoing it will be appreciated that specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration but that modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the various embodiments of the disclosure. The airbag system illustrated in can include for example additional airbags assemblies and or inflators operably coupled to the electronics module assembly for use with the additional vehicle seats e.g. within the same row as the seat . In various other embodiments the housing may be omitted and the airbag assembly can be mounted directly to a portion of the aircraft e.g. within the wall of the aircraft . Specific elements of any of the foregoing embodiments can also be combined or substituted for elements in other embodiments. Moreover the restraint system described above can be incorporated in non automobile or non aircraft systems. Certain aspects of the disclosure are accordingly not limited to automobile or aircraft systems. Furthermore while advantages associated with certain embodiments of the disclosure have been described in the context of these embodiments other embodiments may also exhibit such advantages and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such advantages to fall within the scope of the technology. Accordingly the disclosure is not limited except as by the appended claims.
