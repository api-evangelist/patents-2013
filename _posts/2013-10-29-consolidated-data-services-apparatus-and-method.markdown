In operation algorithm allows diverse data services and devices to interface through a common platform that includes consolidated web service user API content API feedback API and update API . Algorithm can also or alternatively be implemented using object oriented programming where the different states disclosed above and in further detail below are related based on object oriented principles. The various APIs and associated methods described below can be used within the architecture of system and with algorithm to provide the functionality discussed herein. In that regard the discussion of the APIs and associated methods that follows can be applied to system and algorithm as well as to other suitable systems and algorithms.

Content providers have varying functions parameters return types and processes for communicating with other systems such as Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP eXtensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call XML RPC and JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call JSON RPC and Relative Expression Software Tool REST . In addition content providers have varying methods of authenticating users that further complicate web service implementation. Content API provides a uniform interface to these different protocols.

In one exemplary embodiment content API can allow a call to be executed across different data services through in a uniform fashion by using proxy calls through a content API REST Interface. REST is an architectural style developed alongside HTTP and can be utilized for client server communication rather than building a layer on top of client server communications such as SOAP or XML RPC. Other suitable interfaces can also or alternatively be utilized.

Web service calls can vary between content providers and a call from one web service may have no basis for a call in another or simply may not exist. For example a web service call to retrieve a list of top tracks would not make sense for a content provider that specializes in photos. For this reason such a call would result in a mapping error that could be handled appropriately. In situations where content providers offer similar services the mapping error might not be apparent. The error system employed by content API allows non existent calls to be properly handled in addition to providing a means for investigating a content provider s web service.

The following sections describe content API methods and parameters. Due to the open ended nature of content API the responses from calls depend more on parameters passed than on the method invoked. Below is a description of methods for content API and each method s available parameters. While some parameters are always required such as partner key the intention of the request will determine which parameters are used and will vary from call to call.

User API allows a partner developer to create and manage profiles on behalf of the user. In addition to storing general information about the user the user profile manages multiple content provider credentials by employing a keychain model. User API is used for accessing content provider user data such as a user s music library playlists favorites friends or other suitable data.

Sharing and bookmarking can also be provided by User API . Users can be allowed to create bookmarks and playlists to access relevant content quickly and to share content. Unlike content API which can be open ended to accommodate various content providers user API can expose methods and parameters more like a traditional web service.

Signatures can be used for user API calls and calls that use a session key. A signature can be created without a session key e.g. SHA1 method ordered parameters partner secret or with a session key e.g. SHA1 method ordered parameters partner secret session key . The SHA1 output can be converted to hexadecimal format. The method used can be the call method for example get from content API or login from user API . Ordered parameters can be a concatenation of each parameter ordered by parameter key name followed by the parameter value.

The partner secret can be the private token given to a partner when the partner key is received. The session key can be the token returned from a user authentication call such as register login get session and create session. The session key can be added to the signature when it is needed to perform a call. The query library can automatically create and add a signature to the query.

In one exemplary embodiment four user API methods can be used to return a session 1 register 2 login 3 session 4 session add. The session key can be a unique token that identifies the user when making calls to the web service. The session key can expire after a predetermined amount of time. In addition to the session key a coordinated universal time UTC timestamp can be returned that marks the session expiration. When the session has expired it will no longer be valid and a call must be made to retrieve a new session. This call can be performed without prompting the user to login again assuming the application has properly stored the user s web service username and authorization token. The authorization token can be a SHA1 hash of the user s web service password which can be captured when the user performs a login. The application does not need to store a plaintext password as none of the functions require it apart from registration.
