Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to the mitigation of motion sickness in human operators viewing display devices.

Motion sickness is provoked by sensory conflict between visual and sensory motor activities that involve the vestibular system through head movements. Associated with motion sickness is a constellation of autonomic symptoms such as pallor drowsiness salivation sweating nausea and in more severe cases vomiting. Although some individuals eventually adapt to situations that initially provoke such sickness others do not. In these individuals occurrences may be severe enough to arrest task performance until the symptoms subside.

In field experiments conducted for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory on indirect vision driving some symptoms of motion sickness occurred in most of the participants. As shown in participants such as operator drove a ground vehicle while viewing a vehicle mounted display . The display provided the participants with images of the external scene return from a forward looking camera mounted on the exterior of the vehicle. The cab area was completely enclosed to prevent direct viewing of the external scene by the participants. On average one out of eight participants was made sick enough to abort the driving task. Similar results have been reported for driving experiments in movement base vehicle simulators while viewing computer graphics generated terrain road scenes on a vehicle mounted display.

In another field experiment on indirect vision driving some participants experienced motion sickness while operating a vehicle with a vehicle mounted camera system slaved to the driver s head movement the participants viewed the camera return through a head mounted display and the pan and tilt motion of the camera system was computer controlled via a head tracker. The symptoms were particularly strong when operating with stereo optics displays of slightly offset dual camera binocular views.

In a field experiment on indirect vision target detection from a moving vehicle with a head mounted display some participants experienced motion sickness while viewing the target range as the vehicle was changing course the vehicle mounted camera system was slaved to the gunner s head movement.

In other experiments participants have reported symptoms of motion sickness while operating a movable camera e.g. a camera mounted on a remote vehicle from inside a moving control vehicle. Symptoms of motion sickness can be particularly strong when the control vehicle is turning in a direction opposite to the direction of turn of the camera. In such a case the motion of the scene viewed on the display is directly opposite to that sensed by the vestibular system of the human operator riding in the control vehicle.

With respect to the example previously provided in if the vehicle is turning as indicated by arrow A and the camera is simultaneously rotated clockwise at a rate of turn greater than that of the vehicle arrow B the sequential images of the exterior scene displayed to the user are as shown in . That is the image associated with the exterior scene e.g. the sign is displayed to the operator as moving to the left across the display device . Since an operator is accustomed to an exterior scene moving to the right when the vehicle in which the operator is located is turning to the left motion sickness can be induced in the operator.

Therefore there is a need in the art for improved systems and methods to adaptively mitigate motion sickness in operators viewing display devices.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and apparatus for adaptively mitigating motion sickness in an operator are provided herein. In some embodiments a compensatory modulator for use with a display controller included in a system to adaptively mitigating motion sickness in an operator may include one or more inputs to receive at least one of physiological measurements of the operator or operator activity behavior from one or more monitoring devices and a motion sickness expert system configured to a determine a cognitive state of the operator based on the received inputs b compute mitigating display parameters based on the determined cognitive state of the operator and c output the computed mitigating display parameters to the display controller.

In some embodiments a system for adaptively mitigating motion sickness may include a display device configured to display a first primary image and a second compensatory image a display controller coupled to the display device and configured to control display of the second compensatory image and a compensatory modulator communicatively coupled to the display controller the compensatory modulator including a motion sickness expert system configured to determine a cognitive state of the operator based on at least one of physiological measurements of the operator or operator activity behavior wherein the display controller is configured to determine display parameters of the second compensatory image based on a a motion of the first primary image and the display device and b the determined cognitive state of the operator from the compensatory modulator.

In some embodiments a method for adaptively suppressing motion sickness in an operator viewing a first primary image on a display device is provided and may include measuring physiological characteristics and activity behavior of the operator while viewing the first primary image determining a cognitive state of the operator while viewing the first primary image based on the measured physiological characteristics and activity behavior computing mitigating display parameters based on the determined cognitive state of the operator displaying a second compensatory image on the display based on a a motion of the first primary image and the display device and b the computed mitigating display parameters.

The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. It is contemplated that elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.

Systems and methods are provided that can mitigate motion sickness in an operator who is viewing a scene e.g. the scene return from a video camera displayed by a display device. Exemplary embodiments of a sickness suppression system may include a display device for compensating for motion sickness and a display controller of such and a means for automatically adjusting the display to the state of the operator. The intensity of the compensatory display may be adjusted to match the motion sickness state of the viewer increasing in intensity for mitigation as motion sickness occurs and decreasing as motion sickness is abated to decrease task interference. In this process the optimal mitigation intensity occurs when the compensatory display appears to the user as immersed in the environment supportive of the primary task to the level of generating mitigation but not to the level of interfering. In some embodiments this may be performed by a compensatory modulator with an embedded expert system on motion sickness. The expert system may be relatable to observables indicative of subjective feelings of motion sickness. In other embodiments an expert system may be expanded to include the state of cognition in which self referral induced by motion sickness the occurrence of task immersion and that of task interference are treated as state components. Self referral is attention to the state of one self as opposed to attention to the external task or the environment in particular to the state of the visceral senses i.e. perception of the presence of the body s internal organs here as induced by motion sickness. Here task immersion occurs with senses and attention focused on the task elements when the mitigation appearing as a natural occurrence while task distraction occurs when the mitigation appears to demand sharing of attention because of stimuli intrusion into the visual field a situation that can occur when motion sickness is not present.

First embodiments of a compensatory display image including the compensatory display properties and the compensatory engine used to facilitate changes the display properties in a synchronized manner so as to maintain a graded compensation in distribution and properties of the compensatory image are described below. Then a description of at least some embodiments for the compensatory modulator and the embedded expert system on motion sickness is provided.

This application makes reference to U.S. Pat. No. 7 918 781 naming Christopher C. Smyth et al. as inventors and entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SUPPRESSING MOTION SICKNESS which is incorporated by reference herein.

In embodiments of the present invention compensatory images are displayed to the operator to compensate for the displayed scene that is causing the motion sickness. The compensatory images are controlled to correspond to changes in the velocity flow of the displayed scene as well as to accelerations sensed by the operator viewing the displayed scene. As used herein velocity flow refers to the direction and speed of motion of an image with respect to the display device that is used to display the image.

With reference to an operator is located within a vehicle in which a display device is mounted. The camera associated with the vehicle acquires image data corresponding to an exterior scene. In the camera is acquiring images associated with a sign .

In the example presented with respect to recall that the vehicle is turning to the left as indicated by arrow A while the camera is rotating clockwise at a rate that is greater than the turn rate of the vehicle. Therefore the images from the camera that are displayed by the display device do not correspond to the sensory motor cues sensed by the vestibular system of the operator.

Let Vbe the stable earth referenced scene velocity flow i.e. the velocity flow of images displayed to the operator that corresponds to the motion indicated by arrow F sensed by the operator let Vbe the velocity flow of images displayed in the scene field and let Vbe the velocity flow of images displayed in the compensatory field . Then V V V. The positive direction of the first image flow field V is in the opposite direction from that of the stable earth velocity and of the compensatory field this is because the equivalent stable velocity for the first image is opposite to the velocity of the first image flow field.

The accelerations experienced by the operator are determined with respect to an arbitrary coordinate system that has an x axis parallel to the x axis of display device and a y axis that is parallel to the y axis of the display device. Therefore with respect to the motion of the operator relative to the x axis of coordinate system the acceleration of the operator is expressed as . The x axis component of the stable scene velocity flow V is represented by V d . Then with Vbeing the x axis component for the velocity flow of images displayed in the scene field the x axis component of the velocity flow of images displayed in the horizontal compensatory field V is given by V V d .

Similarly with respect to the motion of the operator relative to the y axis of coordinate system the acceleration of the operator is expressed as . The y axis component of the stable scene velocity flow V is represented by V d . Then with Vbeing the y axis component for velocity flow of images displayed in the scene field the y axis component of the velocity flow of images displayed in the vertical side compensatory field V is given by V V d .

Note that for those embodiments that consider the z axis motion C V d . By way of example one manner to display compensatory images that vary in response to motion along the z axis is to change the size of the compensatory images so that the images appear to get closer or move farther away from the operator. While this analysis is based on rotations similar comments apply to linear motions.

Based on these equations there is no velocity flow for images displayed in the compensatory field when images displayed in the scene field are moving in a direction and at a rate opposite to those of the direction and rate of the vehicle in which the operator is located. In contrast images displayed in the scene field that are moving in the same direction as the vehicle result in an opposing velocity flow of the images displayed in the compensatory field.

In order to provide suitable compensatory images measurements of the velocity flows of the images displayed in the scene field as well as the acceleration experienced by the operator should be real time and accurate. In some embodiments the velocity flow field of the images displayed in the scene field can be estimated from analysis of the images themselves. For instance the position of a particular object displayed in the scene field can be determined periodically for measuring the velocity flow. Additionally or alternatively information corresponding to the position orientation and or speed of the vehicle on which the camera that is acquiring the images for display in the scene field can be used. In the case of teleoperations such information could be extracted from the control signals used to control the vehicle and or camera.

The accelerations experienced by the operator can be measured by one or more sensors e.g. accelerometers that can be mounted in various locations. For instance one or more sensors can be located on the display device on the vehicle body and or on the operator e.g. on the operator s helmet.

It should be noted that embodiments of the methods apparatus and systems described herein can be implemented in software firmware hardware or combinations thereof. When implemented in hardware such a system can be implemented with any or a combination of various technologies. By way of example the following technologies which are each well known in the art can be used a discrete logic circuit s having logic gates for implementing logic functions upon data signals an application specific integrated circuit s ASIC having appropriate combinational logic gates a programmable gate array s PGA and a field programmable gate array s FPGA .

When implemented in software such a system typically is used in conjunction with a computer or processor based device. An example computer that can be used to implement an embodiment of a system for suppressing motion sickness is depicted schematically in .

As shown in embodiments of a system to adaptively mitigating motion sickness in an operator and or components thereof e.g. a compensatory modulator etc. includes a computer . Computer incorporates a processor memory a display device a sensor s and an input and or output I O device s that are communicatively coupled via a local interface . The software in memory can include one or more separate programs each of which comprises an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. In the embodiment of the software in the memory includes a display controller an operating system O S and an application that provides an output to the display device. The display controller includes a scene image driver a compensatory image driver a compensatory image engine and a compensatory modulator .

In operation the display controller provides information to the display device for displaying scene images and compensatory images. Specifically the scene images that are displayed in the scene field of the display device are controlled by the scene image driver and the compensatory images that are displayed in the compensatory field are controlled by the compensatory image driver . The scene image driver receives information from the application and or the I O device s that corresponds to the scene images. The scene image driver in addition to providing an input for controlling the scene field provides an input to the compensatory image engine . This input is used by the compensatory image engine to determine the velocity flow of the scene images. For instance in this embodiment consecutive positions of a selected scene image are analyzed to determine the velocity flow. Rotational velocities of the scene images are computed from the velocity flow and the distance of the display device from the viewing position of the operator. Thus in this embodiment the compensatory image engine functions as an image motion sensor.

The motion of the operator is determined by the sensor s with information from the sensor s being provided to the compensatory image engine. The compensatory image engine then uses the various inputs to calculate parameters associated with compensatory images that are to be displayed within the compensatory field of the display device . Information corresponding to the parameters of the compensatory image is provided to the compensatory image driver which then provides corresponding input to the display device for controlling the compensatory images.

In some embodiments the compensatory image engine can receive an input from the application that corresponds to the state of the application. For example operator inputs to the application can be analyzed for providing predictive control to the compensatory images.

Having described compensatory displays and the compensatory engine used to facilitate changes the compensatory image display properties embodiments of systems and methods for suppressing motion sickness and the compensatory modulator will now be described in greater detail.

Referring to a motion sickness mitigation system is depicted in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments the system includes a compensatory display system for suppressing motion sickness and a modulator of the intensity of such a display for adaptive compensation both systems separated into two interacting components. In some embodiments the compensatory display system consists of a display device with a task display and a motion sickness compensatory display . In some embodiments the movement m of the image displayed in the compensatory display may be determined by a compensatory engine via control signal based on the movement m1 of the task display image via data line and the movement m of the display device via data line as measured by accelerometer for example. The compensatory engine may determine a display format in such a manner as to maintain an inertial reference frame for the display from the accelerations and angular velocities both physical and visual sensed by the operator viewing the displayed scene. Meanwhile the compensatory modulator may set the intensity via control line in accordance with the motion sickness state of the operator as determined by an embedded electronic expert system on motion sickness from activity behavior and physiological measurements and display settings feedback from engine via data line . Here at least one embodiment of the expert system incorporates a model of the symptomatic stages of motion sickness and in particular incapacitating motion sickness as related to the behavior and physiological measurements.

The manifestation of motion sickness has been quantified as a multidimensional construct with symptomatic components of gastrointestinal central peripheral and sopite related distresses possibly all linked through the parasympathetic nervous system. This component of the autonomic nervous system maintains homeostasis regardless of changes in the internal being. The cumulative effect of these symptoms may be to cause an overall feeling of motion sickness. The gastrointestinal symptoms stomach sickness queasy nauseated may vomit occur with apparent stomach discomfort. The central symptoms faint like lightheaded disoriented dizzy as if spinning possibly result in a decreased capacity of the central nervous system to process task related information. In turn the peripheral symptoms sweaty clammy cold sweat hot or warm involve the body s peripheral response. Finally the sopite symptoms annoyed irritated drowsy tired fatigued uneasy result in disengagement from the environment possibly by sleepiness. These distinguishable symptoms that are readily observable may be differentially responsive to various types of real or apparent motion. Furthermore individuals may experience differing degrees of activation along each of these distress dimensions in the same type of motion environment.

Subjective questionnaires have been developed by researchers for quantifying both the symptomic causes and degree of motion sickness such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire SSQ See Kennedy R S Lane N E Berbaum K S Lilienthal M S 1993 . Simulator Sickness Questionnaire An Enhanced Method for Quantifying Simulator Sickness 3 3 203 220 based on sickness symptoms for oculomotor disorientation and nausea symptomatic components and the Gianarios Motion Sickness Questionnaire See Gianaros P J Muth E R Mordkoff J T Levine M E Stern R M 2001 . A Questionnaire for the Assessment of the Multiple Dimensions of Motion Sickness. 72 2 115 119 based on gastrointestinal central peripheral and sopite related symptomatic components. The scoring of the degree of global motion sickness is made from a weighted summation of the subjective ratings of the component sub scales. The ratings for the two questionnaires overlap to some degree. For example the Gianaros Gastrointestinal measure includes distress ratings i.e. stomach discomfort queasy may vomit nauseated that are similar to those for the SSQ Nausea measure i.e. stomach awareness salivation burping vomiting nausea . In addition the SSQ Nausea includes a rating i.e. sweating common to the Gianaros Peripheral. The Gianaros Central includes ratings i.e. faint like lightheaded disoriented dizzy spinning that are similar to those of the SSQ Oculomotor i.e. headache difficulty focusing eyestrain blurred vision and those of the SSQ Disorientation related to vestibular disturbances such as dizziness and vertigo. Similar comments apply to the scores on the Gianaros Sopite related motion induced sub scales of fatigue drowsiness and mood changes annoyed irritated uneasy .

Some embodiments of the present invention use both the Gianarios Questionnaire and the SSQ frameworks. The Gianarios Questionnaire and SSQ frameworks have shown that occurrences where participants aborted an experiment See Smyth C C 2006 . Discriminant Predictors of Incapacitating Motion Sickness A Preliminary Study unpublished report Army Research Laboratory Aberdeen Proving Ground Md. 21005 before completion reportedly because of subjective feelings of motion sickness are highly predictable. A study of the time history of these occurrences shows that the motion sickness builds with time to the incapacitating level. The measures of the questionnaires are linearly related at low levels of sickness intensity but the Gianarios Gastrointestinal and SSQ Nausea measures become decoupled from the rest as the sickness intensity increases to the level of incapacitation. This parallel course with increasing sickness is to be expected since as has been mentioned the ratings for the two questionnaires overlap to some degree and at this higher level the components probably correspond to the same sickness phenomena. The Gianarios Central and the Peripheral measures and the SSQ Oculomotor measure are possibly related to inducers of motion sickness that are accumulated over the experience to reach the higher level stages of Gastrointestinal and Nausea discomfort. The measures would be decoupled since gastrointestinal distress or Nausea discomfort would be attended to at the expense of the other symptoms. The cumulative effect of these component symptoms is to cause an overall feeling of motion sickness the occurrence of which may be severe enough to arrest task performance until the symptoms subside.

A Factor Analysis applied to the test measures combined from both questionnaires groups the Gianarios Gastrointestinal and Peripheral measures and the Kennedy Nausea measure together separate from the rest. Using the factorial components as predictor variables in a Discriminant Analysis separates the incapacitated group from the remaining and the drop out points for that group from the previous ones. Similar success occurs with the sub scales of either questionnaire as predictors as long as the Gastrointestinal or Nausea measures are included. Furthermore the Kennedy Total Severity and Gianaros Overall summary measures being composites of the respective sub scales separate participants who tend toward sickness from those who can be expected to complete the experiment.

Considering the analysis results for the above mentioned research the first factorial component separates the measures by questionnaire while the remaining two components separate measures across the questionnaires. shows the factorial component loading diagram for the last two components that separate measures across the questionnaires. The second component groups the Nausea Peripheral and Gastrointestinal symptomatic components together on one side of the axis and the remaining on the other. The third component separates the Gastrointestinal measure and the Kennedy measures from the other Gianaros measures described above. Considering the questionnaires the Peripheral and Gastrointestinal measures are separated from each other and from the Central and Sopite measures which are practically indistinguishable the Nausea measure is separated from the rest of the Kennedy measures which are clustered together. The pattern is practically the same for both the measure values and the z scores of the measures. The Central and Sopite measures are practically indistinguishable and may be treated as the same measure the same somewhat so for the Oculomotor and Disorientation the Gastrointestinal and the Nausea measure may be treated together these measures and the Peripheral measure have practically the same loading on the 2nd component. The Gastrointestinal sub scale measure of the Gianarios Questionnaire and the Nausea measure of the Kennedy Questionnaire are significant by the incidences of incapacitating motion sickness.

The inventor discovered that the second factorial component separates the most significant sickness sensitive measures from the rest and that this component is significant by the trend to sickness thus suggesting it may be an indicator of sickness. shows a plot of the average value of the 2nd component as a function of the sickness experience time for the group that became incapacitated. The component value shows a steadily increasing trend with time finally reaching the value for incapacitation . On this basis at least some embodiments may track motion sickness by estimating the subjective motion sickness symptoms from measurements relating these estimates to the symptomatic component subscales computing the resulting factorial components from the scale loadings and using the factorial component value to estimate the degree of motion sickness.

In some embodiments the subjective measures may be linked to physical observables of symptoms through the ratings. For example the Gastrointestinal and Nausea symptoms of stomach discomfort and associated queasiness and feeling nauseated are symptoms of gastric distress related to a decrease in gastric motility and tonus in the muscles of the stomach that control stomach contraction. In some embodiments this physiological activity may be measured by an electrogastrogram EGG from skin surface electrodes taped onto the abdomen over the stomach region to sense the gastric myoelectric activity of the stomach muscles. In particular an increase in gastric tachyarrhythmia a dysrhythmic pattern of the 4 to 9 cycles per minute CPM gastric myoelectric activity may be taken as a physiological indicator of the condition of gastrointestinal distress.

The Peripheral measure symptom of increased diaphorsesis or sweating with associated feelings of clammy and a cold sweat is accompanied by increased skin conductivity. This physical phenomenon may be measured by a galvanic skin response using skin surface electrodes placed for example on the forearm in a bipolar configuration to measure the skin resistance to a slight current passed between the electrodes.

The Soptic measure relates to a cluster of activities made in response to motion induced excessive sensitivity with consequential avoidance of stimuli and resulting in loss of initiative and impaired cognitive concentration that may be manifested as feelings of being annoyed irritated drowsy tired fatigued or uneasiness accompanied by arrested physical behavior. The arrested behavior manifested as lack of eye and body movements may be measured from scene analysis of a camera view of the user for example as measured by an eye tracker an Actimeter attached to the wrist an electromyogram EMG or the like . The camera scene may show facial expressions associated with irritation and annoyance along with activities of drooping eye lids increased eye blinks and prolonged blinks head in a back position or leaning forward all associated with drowsiness. Increased brain wave spectral power in the 0.5 4.0 Hertz delta frequency band measured by spectral analysis of electroencephalograms EEG are related to drowsiness.

The Central measure with feelings of faint like lightheaded disoriented dizzy spinning and those of Disorganization dizziness vertigo are related to measures of heart rate variability increased respiration rate increased and autonomic cardiac activities decreased of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia all measured from analyses of the electrocardiogram EKG . Similarly disorientation is related to spectral power changes in the EEG such as for example increased brain wave spectral power in the 0.5 4.0 Hertz delta frequency band decreased ratio of theta wave 5 7 Hz power to total wave 1 30 Hz power at frontal and parietal lobes slight increase in theta band in temporo frontal region and suppression of 20 and 40 Hz peaks in central posterior occipital regions. However changes in heart rate respiration and brain waves may be just as well related to task workload. The Oculomotor measures related to eye strain difficulty focusing blurred vision may be measured of an analysis of facial camera scene and eye movements recorded by eye tracker or electroculogram EOG showing behavior associated with attempts to re focus.

While the above measures pertain to the state of self referral in some embodiments these measures provide a framework for the cognitive state of the user as pertains to task performance on a gradient from task immersion to that of confounded. Furthermore in embodiments consistent with the present invention the aforementioned measures may be relatable to subjective questionnaires such as the Task Loading Index TLX on workload See Hart S G Staveland L E 1988 . Development of NASA TLX Task Load Index Results of Experimental and Theoretical Research In P. A. Hancock N. Meshkati Eds. Amsterdam North Holland Press with ratings on symptoms of demands imposed on the user and the interaction of the user with the task. Mental Physical and Temporal ratings measure the demand symptoms while Effort Frustration and Performance ratings relate to the interaction symptoms. Factorial analysis of data results from experiments on vehicle driving with indirect vision cameras See Smyth C C Gombash J W Burcham P M 2001 . ARL TR 2511 Army Research Laboratory Aberdeen Proving Ground Md. 21005 have shown that the workload rating measures can be factored along components of a task cognitive functional space See Smyth C C 2001 . ARL TR 2701 Army Research Laboratory Aberdeen Proving Ground Md. 21005 .

Again the subjective measures are linked to physical observables of symptoms through the ratings. For example the mental demand includes symptoms of looking and searching which are observable from eye movement analysis among other sources. The physical demand includes symptoms of physical activity such as pushing pulling turning controlling or activating controlling devices. A rating of the task as physically easy or demanding slow or brisk slack or strenuous restful or laborious may be determined by the amount of activity. Similarly the temporal demand includes the symptom of time pressure which may be measured from the rate or pace at which the task or task elements occur. Considering the interactive symptoms which are subjective judgments by the user the Effort is a rating of how hard the user judges work was performed mentally and physically Performance is a rating of the goal attainment success while Frustration judges the degree of dissatisfaction. These ratings are again relatable to observables particularly from the EEG.

For example a pattern in the EEG of irregular rapid waves with low amplitude correspond to alert excited and emotional states. Regular slower and higher amplitude waves may appear for relaxed states. Meanwhile even larger and slower fluctuations appear when the subject is drowsy. Thus the level of arousal from low to high can be determined from the pattern of EEG activity. In some embodiments the member classes may include the following states drowsiness relaxed attentive and excited . The drowsiness state has a predominance of spectrum power in the delta band and the relaxed state in the alpha. The attentive state shows alpha suppression with strong components in the beta and gamma bands. Finally the excited state has a predominance of power in the gamma band. The measured power spectrum will be distributed across these frequency bands. In turn the logic rules judge the most preferred cognitive state to be that of attentiveness and least those of the end extremes drowsiness or excitement. This is based on experiments that have shown that performance is greater at the intermediate levels of arousal than at the low and high arousal states.

The physiological and eye movement activity for task immersion may be further described to the levels of task cognitive processing where considering task related vision attributes eye blinks and eye movement and fixation patterns may indicate the state and source of visual attention. In vehicle control with vision directed to the scene display the visual patterns may be pursuit tracking of objects in the scene as the vehicle moves forward such as visual tracking of the road edge associated with Skill level driving with occasional transient saccades to acquire new road objects that are associated with Rules based processing of search activity. This activity is commonly associated with a cluster of fixations once an object has been located that are used to first recognize a feature of the object for identification and then a longer fixation for identifying the object followed by a flurry of eye blinks during evaluation. As has been mentioned a shift in fixation from the scene display to the vehicle menu display may be preceded by a fixed gaze while task preparation is mentally made presumably by priming short term memory to task schema based rules and knowledge in long term memory store. In turn the shift may be followed by a search pattern for pertinent features of the display to complete task setup by mapping object stimuli to schema feature framework and finally during task execution a disciplined pattern of fixations clustered on task pertinent features with longer fixations made in selection and possibly eye blink flurries during a resulting manual action.

Furthermore the general state of task attention may be determined from electrocardiogram EKG measurements not shown since the heart rate and its variability are sensitive to the cognitive workload with an increase in heart rate and a reduction in variability with increased task demands in particular the power spectrum of the middle frequency component 0.1 Hz is reduced during resource limited tasks.

Still further the state of task cognition may be determined from electroencephalogram EEG measurements from skin scalp sites not shown of cortical brain activity the scalp topological and power spectrum frequency distributions of the Electroencephalography EEG are related to cognitive processing. In particular scalp topology spectra distributions associated with task cognitive states are 

In some embodiments of the present invention the expert system estimates the cognitive state as degrees of one or more of self referral induced by motion sickness task immersion and task distraction by matching clusters of such measurements to a framework for equivalent subjective ratings of symptoms of the state conditions coupled to a structure incorporating a state model. Here the subjective sub scales are frames for the features of the observables the values of which are the scale ratings the relations among the scalar frames construct the symptoms and from these in turn the factorial component are computed using the factor loadings the value of which is used to estimate the subjective degree of the cognition state. As shown in the flowchart of the method following program call isolates pertinent features of the observable measures forms clusters of weighted features fits clusters to the state symptoms determines the equivalent subjective ratings of the symptoms estimates state components from the factorial loadings computes the degree of the subjective state computes the mitigating display parameters and outputs the parameters to the display controller .

An exemplary compensatory modulator including activity behavior and physiological measurement inputs consistent with at least some embodiments of the present invention is shown in . In some embodiments an operator s physiological measurements are made with skin surface electrodes for EEG EOG and EMG EKG and EGG the signals of which are processed by a physiological recorder with output to a physiological state assessor . In some embodiments the EEG recording may be made from a scalp cap of multiple electrodes judiciously distributed about the scalp for example in a standard 10 20 International System electrode configuration or the like all with amplifiers having output to the recorder . In some embodiments the EOG recordings may be made with a grid of electrodes placed above below and laterally about the eyes with multiple amplifier outputs for measuring eye movements vertical lateral and blinks . In some embodiments the EMG recordings may be made using a bipolar electrode configuration for facial and head muscles while the EKG and EGG may employ a set of electrodes as elaborated below. Similarly in some embodiments the galvanic skin resistance GSR recording by a bipolar electrode configuration may be input to a bio signal analyzer with output to the physiological state assessor . Limb activity may be measured with an actimeter with embedded accelerometers attached to the wrist and output to motor activity estimator with output to the physiological state assessor . The output of the head tracker along with the video output from the video camera goes to the eye tracker with output to the physiological state assessor output to the eye gaze estimator and video feed through to the facial and gesture analyzer . The eye gaze estimator outputs to a motion sickness assessor an estimate of the gaze point on the display from an embedded knowledge of the workspace geometry. With inputs from the eye gaze estimator inputs from the physiological state assessor and from the video analyzer along with task behavior predictor from the task knowledge the motion sickness assessor outputs a control signal to the compensatory engine from the embedded expert system. Here task knowledge is embodies knowledge of the task being performed including the present state of the task and displays with feedback from the compensatory display status and the expected manual activities and eye movements that would be made for performing the task. The task knowledge may be compared to the actual state of the task including manual and eye movements of the operator to further determine the operator state.

At least one exemplary embodiment of the motion sickness assessor included in compensatory modulator is shown in as . In some embodiments the motion sickness assessor includes a cognitive state assessor with inputs in series with a neuro fuzzy network circuit . The neuro fuzzy network circuit may consist of a fuzzifier stage a sickness inference machine e.g. a neural network NN inference machine and a defuzzifier . In some embodiments the inputs to the state assessor may consist of input from the state assessor input from eye gaze estimator input from facial image processor and input from task behavior estimator . The outputs from the state assessor to the fuzzifier consists of the degree of state estimates for self referral I1 task immersion I2 and task confounded I3 . In some embodiments the fuzzifier consists of two layers with input layer L1 and output L2 of the linguistic level of the states. The neural network inference machine which in some embodiments may be in the form of a feed forward propagation three layer network input L3 output L5 with a hidden layer L4 operates upon the input according to production rules for network connector weights between layer nodes. The production rule outputs are converted as linguistic values inputs at layer L6 by the defuzzifier into a signal R layer L7 and then into the rate control signal C following crisping at layer L8. The output C of defuzzifier and neuro fuzzy network circuit may be input to a proportional integrator PI with display control signal IC with the integral reducing sensitivity to transients in motion sickness response.

The state assessor may be composed of three sub processors one for each of the states concerned which in this embodiment consists of state assessment for self referral from motion sickness and another for the degree of task immersion and for task confounding. A state assessor sub processor consistent with at least some embodiments of the present invention is shown in . In some embodiments the state assessor sub processor may consist of observable inputs a feature classifier for the inputs a clustering processor with outputs to a symptoms processor and a state classifier . The state classifier may further consist of a subscale rater a loading computer and computation of the factorial value . In some embodiments the factorial value is mapped to the degree of cognitive syndrome condition with degree output D as input to the fuzzifier . While this may describe the state assessor for the sickness assessment in further embodiments a similar design is used for the task involvement states. In at least some embodiments the feature cluster and symptom processors may be configured as neural networks.

In some embodiments the fuzzifier converts the state degree to linguistic values for the membership categories as shown in with standard Lambda membership functions. The degree of motion sickness is converted to membership values for the linguistic classes of low med and high with high being bounded by the state of incapacitation. Similar linguistic values are computed for the task involvement states.

In further embodiments the defuzzifier converts the linguistic values output of intensity membership from the inference rules processor according to in . In the degrees of membership in very low low med high and very high are converted to intensity rates for the classes which are in turn converted to a single value by the crisper. In this embodiment the med degree is the null point and the low degrees are negative rates. In some embodiments the crisper uses a center of maximum defuzzification method commonly used in control applications since the method provides a continuous output although other methods are available as well such as the center of gravity method otherwise known as the center of area method. In this method typically the maximum values are calculated for the membership functions of the inference rules processor and these values are used as weights for the most typical values of the membership terms to determine the defuzzifier output of the modulator intensity rate.

In some embodiments the inference rules processor operates according to production rules relating the state linguistic values to the intensity membership values according to the rule of Table 1. The production rules embody the knowledge of the system expressed in terms of the linguistic variables and consist of if condition then action type statements. Here Rule 1 corresponds to the case where since the motion sickness state MS STATE is HIGH and the task immersion state IM STATE is LOW the compensatory intensity rate RATE is set VERY HIGH in this rule the fuzzy logical operator .and. is the minimum of the compared values. Rule 2 corresponds to the case which since the motion sickness state is high and the task immersion IM STATE is medium MED and the task confounding CF STATE is low the rate is set low. Similarly Rule 3 corresponds to an equilibrium point where the motion sickness is mitigated to the point where the operator can still function on the task. Rule 4 corresponds to the case where the motion sickness is low but the compensatory display is causing task confounding. Rule 5 corresponds to the case where the motion sickness is low and the task immersion is high without a need for the compensatory display. Other rules are possible. For example in a further embodiment the compensatory display return may be a separate output of the fuzzifier that converted to separate linguistic values may constitute a rule in the production set.

In other embodiments the production rules are refined using a fuzzy logic trainer based on a neural network as shown as in . The input and output from the fuzzifier and the input and output from the defuzzifier are inputs to a learner with output to a rule base processor . The processor outputs updates of the production rules to the inference processor .

Generally method begins at where the method measures physiological characteristics and activity behavior of the operator while viewing the first primary image. At the method determines a cognitive state of the operator while viewing the first primary image based on the measured physiological characteristics and activity behavior. At mitigating display parameters are computed based on the determined cognitive state of the operator. Finally at a second compensatory image is displayed based on the display based on a a motion of the first primary image and the display device and b the computed mitigating display parameters.
