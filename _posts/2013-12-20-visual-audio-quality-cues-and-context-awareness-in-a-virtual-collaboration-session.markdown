This disclosure relates generally to computer systems and more specifically to systems and methods for providing visual audio quality cues and context awareness in a virtual collaboration session.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an Information Handling System IHS . An IHS generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications IHSs may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in IHSs allow for IHSs to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage global communications etc. In addition IHSs may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

In some situations two or more IHSs may be operated by different users or team members participating in a virtual collaboration session or virtual meeting. Generally speaking virtual collaboration is a manner of collaboration between users that is carried out via technology mediated communication. Although virtual collaboration may follow similar processes as conventional collaboration the parties involved in a virtual collaboration session communicate with each other at least in part through technological channels.

In the case of an IHS or computer mediated collaboration a virtual collaboration session may include for example audio conferencing video conferencing a chat room a discussion board text messaging instant messaging shared database s whiteboarding wikis application specific groupware or the like. For instance whiteboarding is the placement of shared images documents or other files on a shared on screen notebook or whiteboard. Videoconferencing and data conferencing functionality may let users annotate these shared documents as if on a physical whiteboard. With such an application several people may be able to work together remotely on the same materials during a virtual collaboration session.

Embodiments of systems and methods for providing visual audio quality cues and context awareness in a virtual collaboration session are described herein. In an illustrative non limiting embodiment a method may include receiving a plurality of audio signals each audio signal captured from one of a plurality of a participants of a virtual collaboration session determining for each of the plurality of participants a voice quality of the participant s audio signal and providing a visual cue of the voice quality of each participant s audio signal to at least one of the plurality of participants.

In some implementations the virtual collaboration session may include a conference call or a whiteboarding session the voice quality may include a mean opinion score MOS and or the voice quality may include a signal to noise ratio SNR measurement. The at least one of the plurality of participants may include a moderator or organizer of the virtual collaboration session. Also the visual cue may include an icon shape or color indicative of the voice quality.

The method may also comprise determining that the voice quality of a given participant s corresponding audio signal fails to meets a threshold value and in response to the determination making a suggestion to the at least one of the plurality of participants that the given participant be muted during the virtual collaboration session.

The method may further comprise providing a visual cue of the voice quality of a given participant s audio signal to the given participant where the visual cue includes an icon shape or color indicative of the voice quality determining that the voice quality of the given participant s audio signal fails to meets a threshold value and allowing the given participant to mute his or her microphone during the virtual collaboration session. In some cases determining the voice quality of the participant s audio signal includes determining whether the audio signal includes a component not intended to be shared with other participants of the virtual collaboration session.

In another illustrative non limiting embodiment a method may include receiving an audio signal captured from a participant of a virtual collaboration session and determining whether the audio signal includes a component not intended to be shared with other participants of the virtual collaboration session.

For example the virtual collaboration session may include a conference call or a whiteboarding session. The component may include ambient noise in the participant s environment and or the participant s spoken voice.

In some cases determining whether the audio signal includes the component may include detecting a physical proximity of the participant to the IHS. Additionally or alternatively determining whether the audio signal includes the component may include determining a head orientation of the participant. Additionally or alternatively determining whether the audio signal includes the component further may include identifying a gesture made by the participant during the virtual collaboration session. Moreover in response to a determination that the audio signal includes the component the method may also include causing an instruction to be provided to another participant of the virtual collaboration session to mute the participant.

In yet another embodiment a method may include receiving an audio signal captured from a participant of a virtual collaboration session identifying at least one of context of the audio signal or a gesture made by the participant during the virtual collaboration session and modifying a manner in which the audio signal is provided to other participants of the virtual collaboration session based at least in part upon the context.

In some implementations the gesture may include an at least partial covering of the participant s mouth with his or her hands and modifying the manner in which the audio signal is provided to the other participants may include muting the participant s audio signal. Additionally or alternatively the gesture may include a cupped hand around the participant s ear and modifying the manner in which the audio signal is provided to the other participants may include unmuting the participant s audio signal. In other implementations identifying the context may include determining a quality of the participant s network connection and modifying the manner in which the audio signal is provided to the other participants may include muting the participant s audio signal if the quality of the participant s network connection is below a threshold value.

In some embodiments one or more of the techniques described herein may be performed at least in part by an Information Handling System IHS operated by a given one of a plurality of participants of a virtual collaboration session. In other embodiments these techniques may be performed by an IHS having a processor and a memory coupled to the processor the memory including program instructions stored thereon that upon execution by the processor cause the IHS to execute one or more operations. In yet other embodiments a non transitory computer readable medium may have program instructions stored thereon that upon execution by an IHS cause the IHS to execute one or more of the techniques described herein.

To facilitate explanation of the various systems and methods discussed herein the following description has been split into sections. It should be noted however that the various sections headings and subheadings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to limit or otherwise modify the scope of the description or the claims.

The inventors hereof have recognized a need for new tools that enable better team interactions and improve effectiveness in the workplace particularly as the workforce becomes more geographically distributed and as the volume of business information created and exchanged increases to unprecedented levels. Existing tools intended to facilitate collaboration include digital whiteboarding instant messaging file sharing and unified communication platforms. Unfortunately such conventional tools are fragmented and do not adequately address certain problems specific to real time interactions. In addition these tools do not capitalize on contextual information for further gains in productivity and ease of use.

Examples of problems faced by distributed teams include the lack of a universally acceptable manner of performing whiteboarding sessions. The use of traditional dry erase boards in meeting rooms excludes or limits the ability of remote workers to contribute and current digital whiteboarding options are unnatural to use and are therefore not being adopted. In addition there are numerous inefficiencies in setting up meeting resources sharing in real time and distribution of materials after meetings such as emailing notes presentation materials and digital pictures of whiteboard sketches. Fragmentation across tool sets and limited format optimization for laptops tablets and the use of in room projectors present a further set of issues. Moreover the lack of continuity between meetings and desk work and across a meeting series including common file repositories persistent notes and whiteboard sketches and historical context can create a number of other problems and inefficiencies.

To address these and other concerns the inventors hereof have developed systems and methods that address among other things the setting up of resources for a virtual collaboration session the taking of minutes and capture of whiteboard sketches the creation and management to agendas and or provide the ability to have the right participants and information on hand for a collaboration session.

In some embodiments these systems and methods focus on leveraging technology to increase effectiveness of real time team interactions in the form of a connected productivity framework. A digital or virtual workspace part of such a framework may include an application that enables both in room and remote users the ability to interact easily with the collaboration tool in real time. The format of such a virtual workspace may be optimized for personal computers PCs tablets mobile devices and or in room projection. The workspace may be shared across all users personal devices and it may provide a centralized location for presenting files and whiteboarding in real time and from anywhere. The integration of context with unified communication and note taking functionality provides improved audio speaker identification and automation of meeting minutes.

The term context as used herein refers to information that may be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person place or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application including the user and application themselves. Examples of context include but are not limited to location people and devices nearby and calendar events.

For instance a connected productivity framework may provide among other things automation of meeting setup proximity awareness for automatic joining of sessions Natural User Interface NUI control of a workspace to increase the usability and adoption intelligent information management and advanced indexing and search and or meeting continuity. Moreover a set of client capabilities working in concert across potentially disparate devices may include access to a common shared workspace with public and private workspaces for file sharing and real time collaboration advanced digital whiteboarding with natural input to dynamically control access robust search functionality to review past work and or the ability to seamlessly moderate content flow authorization and intelligent information retrieval.

When certain aspects of the connected productivity framework described herein are applied to a projector for instance the projector may become a fixed point of reference providing contextual awareness. The projector may maintain a relationship to the room and associated resources e.g. peripheral hardware . This allows the projector be a central hub for organizing meetings and it does not necessarily rely on a host user and their device to be present for meeting and collaborating.

In some implementations a cloud hosted or enterprise service infrastructure as described herein may allow virtual collaboration session to be persistent. Specifically once a document drawing or other content is used during a whiteboard session for example the content may be tagged as belonging to that session. When a subsequent session takes places that is associated with a previous session and or when the previous session is resumed at a later time the content and transactions previously performed in the virtual collaboration environment may be retrieved so that to participants there is meeting continuity. In some embodiments the systems and methods described herein may provide digital video recorder DVR type functionality for collaboration sessions such that participants may be able to record meeting events and play those events back at a later time or pause the in session content in temporary memory. The latter feature may enable a team to pause a meeting when they exceed the scheduled time and resume the in session content in another available conference room for example.

As will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art in light of this disclosure virtually any commercial business setting that requires meeting or collaboration may implement one or more aspects of the systems and methods described herein. Additionally aspects of the connected productivity framework described herein may be expanded to other areas such as educational verticals for use in classrooms or to consumers for general meet ups.

For purposes of this disclosure an IHS may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute calculate determine classify process transmit receive retrieve originate switch store display communicate manifest detect record reproduce handle or utilize any form of information intelligence or data for business scientific control or other purposes. For example an IHS may be a personal computer e.g. desktop or laptop tablet computer mobile device e.g. Personal Digital Assistant PDA or smart phone server e.g. blade server or rack server a network storage device or any other suitable device and may vary in size shape performance functionality and price. An IHS may include Random Access Memory RAM one or more processing resources such as a Central Processing Unit CPU or hardware or software control logic Read Only Memory ROM and or other types of nonvolatile memory.

Additional components of an IHS may include one or more disk drives one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various I O devices such as a keyboard a mouse touchscreen and or a video display. An IHS may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.

CPU s are coupled to northbridge controller or chipset via front side bus . Northbridge controller may be configured to coordinate I O traffic between CPU s and other components. For example in this particular implementation northbridge controller is coupled to graphics device s e.g. one or more video cards or adaptors via graphics bus e.g. an Accelerated Graphics Port or AGP bus a Peripheral Component Interconnect or PCI bus or the like . Northbridge controller is also coupled to system memory via memory bus . Memory may be configured to store program instructions and or data accessible by CPU s . In various embodiments memory may be implemented using any suitable memory technology such as static RAM SRAM synchronous dynamic RAM SDRAM nonvolatile Flash type memory or any other type of memory.

Northbridge controller is coupled to southbridge controller or chipset via internal bus . Generally speaking southbridge controller may be configured to handle various of IHS s I O operations and it may provide interfaces such as for instance Universal Serial Bus USB audio serial parallel Ethernet or the like via port s pin s and or adapter s over bus . For example southbridge controller may be configured to allow data to be exchanged between IHS and other devices such as other IHSs attached to a network e.g. network . In various embodiments southbridge controller may support communication via wired or wireless general data networks such as any suitable type of Ethernet network for example via telecommunications telephony networks such as analog voice networks or digital fiber communications networks via storage area networks such as Fiber Channel SANs or via any other suitable type of network and or protocol.

Southbridge controller may also enable connection to one or more keyboards keypads touch screens scanning devices voice or optical recognition devices or any other devices suitable for entering or retrieving data. Multiple I O devices may be present in IHS . In some embodiments I O devices may be separate from IHS and may interact with IHS through a wired or wireless connection. As shown southbridge controller is further coupled to one or more PCI devices e.g. modems network cards sound cards or video cards and to one or more SCSI controllers via parallel bus . Southbridge controller is also coupled to Basic I O System BIOS and to Super I O Controller via Low Pin Count LPC bus .

BIOS includes non volatile memory having program instructions stored thereon. Those instructions may be usable CPU s to initialize and test other hardware components and or to load an Operating System OS onto IHS . Super I O Controller combines interfaces for a variety of lower bandwidth or low data rate devices. Those devices may include for example floppy disks parallel ports keyboard and mouse temperature sensor and fan speed monitoring control among others.

In some cases IHS may be configured to provide access to different types of computer accessible media separate from memory . Generally speaking a computer accessible medium may include any tangible non transitory storage media or memory media such as electronic magnetic or optical media e.g. magnetic disk a hard drive a CD DVD ROM a Flash memory etc. coupled to IHS via northbridge controller and or southbridge controller .

The terms tangible and non transitory as used herein are intended to describe a computer readable storage medium or memory excluding propagating electromagnetic signals but are not intended to otherwise limit the type of physical computer readable storage device that is encompassed by the phrase computer readable medium or memory. For instance the terms non transitory computer readable medium or tangible memory are intended to encompass types of storage devices that do not necessarily store information permanently including for example RAM. Program instructions and data stored on a tangible computer accessible storage medium in non transitory form may afterwards be transmitted by transmission media or signals such as electrical electromagnetic or digital signals which may be conveyed via a communication medium such as a network and or a wireless link.

A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that IHS is merely illustrative and is not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure described herein. In particular any computer system and or device may include any combination of hardware or software capable of performing certain operations described herein. In addition the operations performed by the illustrated components may in some embodiments be performed by fewer components or distributed across additional components. Similarly in other embodiments the operations of some of the illustrated components may not be performed and or other additional operations may be available.

For example in some implementations northbridge controller may be combined with southbridge controller and or be at least partially incorporated into CPU s . In other implementations one or more of the devices or components shown in may be absent or one or more other components may be added. Accordingly systems and methods described herein may be implemented or executed with other IHS configurations.

In various embodiments the virtual collaboration architecture described above may be used to implement a number of systems and methods in the form of virtual collaboration application shown in . These systems and methods may be related to meeting management shared workspace e.g. folder sharing control remote desktop or application sharing digital whiteboard e.g. collaboration arbitration boundary or light curtain based input recognition and or personal engagement e.g. attention loss detection eye tracking etc. some of which are summarized below and explained in more detail in subsequent section s .

For example virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for managing public and private information in a collaboration session. Both public and private portions of a virtual collaboration workspace may be incorporated into the same window of a graphical user interface. Meeting project content in the public and private portions may include documents email discussion threads meeting minutes whiteboard drawings lists of participants and their status and calendar events. Tasks that may be performed using the workspace include but are not limited to editing of documents presentation of slides whiteboard drawing and instant messaging with remote participants.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for real time moderation of content sharing to enable the dynamic moderating of participation in a shared workspace during a meeting. Combining a contact list alongside the shared workspace and folder system in one simplified and integrated User Interface UI puts all input and outputs in one window so users simply drag and drop content in session workspace tabs and people to and from each other to control access rights and share. Behavior rules dictating actions may be based on source and destination for drag and drop of content and user names. Actions may differ depending on whether destination is the real time workspace or file repository. Also these systems and methods provide aggregation of real time workspace whiteboard presentation area with file repository and meeting participant lists in one UI.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for correlating stroke drawings to audio. Such systems and methods may be configured to correlate participants audio and drawing input by synchronization of event triggers on a given device s . As input is received drawing speech or both the data are correlated via time synchronization packaged together and persisted on a backend system which provides remote synchronous and asynchronous viewing and playback features for connected clients. The data streams result in a series of layered inputs that link together the correlated audio and visual sketches . This allows participants to revisit previous collaboration settings. Not only can a user playback the session in its entirety each drawing layer and corresponding audio can be reviewed non linearly.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for live speech to text broadcast communication. Such systems and methods may be configured to employ Automatic Speech Recognition ASR technology combined with a client server model and in order to synchronize the converted speech s text transcript for real time viewing and later audio playback within a scrolling marquee e.g. news ticker . In conjunction with the converted speech s text the audio data of the speech itself is persisted on a backend system it may provide remote synchronous and asynchronous viewing and playback features for connected clients.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for dynamic whiteboarding drawing area. In some cases a virtual border may be developed around the center of a user s cursor as soon as that user starts to draw in a shared whiteboard space. The border may simulate the physical space that the user would block in front of a traditional wall mounted whiteboard and is represented to all session participants as a color coded shaded area or outline for example. It provides dynamic virtual border for reserving drawing space with automatic inactivity time out and resolution with other borders as well as moderation control of a subset of total available area allowing border owner to invite others to draw in their temporary space and the ability to save subsets of a digital whiteboard for longer periods of time.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for coaching users on engagement in meetings and desk work. These systems and methods may be configured to measure a user s activity and to feedback relevant information regarding their current level of engagement. Sensors may detect activity including facial movements gestures spoken audio and or application use. Resulting data may be analyzed and ranked with priority scores to create statistics such as average speaking time and time spent looking away from screen. As such these systems and methods may be used to provide contextual feedback in a collaborative setting to monitor and to improve worker effectiveness ability to set goals for improvement over time such as increased presence in meetings and reduced time spent on low priority activities combined monitoring of device and environmental activity to adapt metrics reported based on user s context and ability for user to extend to general productivity improvement.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for automated tracking of meeting behavior and optimization over time. Such systems and methods may act as a planning tool configured to leverage device sensors user calendars and or note taking applications to track user behavior in meetings and suggest optimizations over time to increase overall effectiveness. As such these systems and methods may leverage device proximity awareness to automatically track user attendance in scheduled meetings over time and or use ASR to determine participation levels and mood of meetings e.g. assess whether attendance is too high too low and general logistics .

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for managing meeting or meeting topic time limits in a distributed environment. A meeting host service may provide controlled timing and notification of meeting events through use of contextual information such as speaker identification key word tracking and or detection of meeting participants through proximity. Meeting host and individual participants may be notified of time remaining prior to exceeding time limits. Examples include but are not limited to time remaining for current topic and exceeding preset time to talk limit. In some cases these systems and methods may be configured to perform aggregation of contextual data with traditional calendar contact and agenda information to create unique meeting events such as identifying participants present at start and end of meeting e.g. through device proximity . Such systems and methods may also be configured to use of contextual data for dynamic management of meeting timing and flow in a distributed environment and to provide contextual based feedback mechanism to individuals such as exceeding preset time to talk.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for enhanced trust relations based on peer to peer P2P direct communications. In many situations people whom have not met in person may be in communication with each other via email instant messages IMs and through social media. With the emerging P2P direct communications face to face communication may be used as an out of band peer authentication we have met . By attaching this attribute in a user s contact list when the user is contacted by other people whose contact information indicates that they have interacted face to face these systems and methods may provide the user a higher level of trust.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for a gesture enhanced interactive whiteboard. Traditional digital whiteboard uses object size and motion to detect if a user intending to draw on the board or erase a section of the board. This feature can have unintended consequences such as interpreting pointing as drawing. To address this and other concerns these systems and methods may augment the traditional whiteboard drawing erase detection mechanism such as light curtain with gesture recognition system that can track the user s face orientation gaze and or wrist articulation to discern user intent.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for hand raise gesture to indicate needing turn to speak. It has become very commonplace to have remote workers who participate in conference call meetings. One key pain point for remote workers is letting others know that they wish to speak especially if there are many participants engaged in active discussion in a meeting room with a handful or few remote workers on the conference call. Accordingly these systems and methods may interpret and raise gesture that is detected by a laptop web cam as automatically indicating to meeting participants that a remote worker needs or wants a turn to speak.

Additionally or alternatively virtual collaboration application may implement systems and or methods for providing visual audio quality cues for conference calls. One key pain point anyone who has attended conference calls can attest to is poor audio quality on the conference bridge. More often than not this poor audio experience is due to background noise introduced by one or several of the participants. It is often the case that the specific person causing the bridge noise is at the same time not listening to even know they are causing disruption of the conference. Accordingly these systems and methods may provide a visual cue of audio quality of speaker e.g. loudness of speaker background noise latency green yellow red of Mean opinion score MOS automated identification of noise makers e.g. moderator view and private identification to speaker and or auto muting filtering of noise makers e.g. eating sounds keyboard typing dog barking baby screaming .

The workplace has been evolving to become more distributed than ever. It has become very commonplace for a wide spectrum of meetings to include at least one participant joining via a conference call or other virtual collaboration system e.g. whiteboarding session etc. . In many instances because of geography and travel costs large group meetings are conducted virtually via conference call. A problem with conference calls is the poor audio quality on the conference bridge. More often than not this poor audio experience is due to background or ambient noise introduced by one or several of the calls participants. It is often the case that the specific person causing the bridge noise is at the same time not listening to even know they are causing disruption of the conference.

To address these concerns the inventors hereof have developed systems and methods for providing the conference bridge owner e.g. a moderator or coordinator and or other participants of a virtual collaboration session with visual cues of audio quality and or context awareness. In some embodiments these systems and methods may allow a conference call moderator to visually see via audio cues which participant s is are introducing any possible noise and may give the moderator the ability to address the problem manually e.g. by muting an offending participant if need be. Additionally or alternatively these systems and methods may also provide each participant a visual cue of their own audio quality and may include alerts for example if participants are introducing noise into the conference call as well as suggestions to be made to improve a participant s voice quality including auto muting and muting functions . Additionally or alternatively sensors and contextual data may be used to help participants manage noise and other undesirable sounds introduced into a conference call or collaboration session.

In some implementations a visual cue of audio quality of a speaker may represent a speaker s loudness background noise latency mean opinion score MOS score signal to noise ratio SNR or the like. In other implementations the systems and methods described herein may provide an automated identification of noise makers moderator view of conference participants and private identification to individual participants as well as auto muting based on physical participant and sensor gesture and or contextual cues.

To provide visual audio cues for virtual collaboration session and context awareness for improving audio experience on those sessions a number of modules shown in may be used. For example context aware service module voice service module unified communication manager UCM broker context engine NUI framework voice conferencing application and or hardware layer sensors for context may be used together to perform some of the operations described below.

Turning to a method for providing visual audio quality cues and context awareness in a virtual collaboration session is depicted. In some embodiments method starts at block at the beginning or prior to the beginning of a virtual collaboration session. At block method determines whether listen only mode has been set. When a participant selects to join a session using the listen only mode he or she is able to hear audio signals captured and transmitted by other participants IHSs but cannot provide their own verbal contribution during the session. In some cases whether or not the listen only mode has been activated may be beyond a given participant s control and may have been set for example by a session moderator. Either way if block determines that the participant has selected listen only mode the participant s microphone is disabled at block and a mute indicator is set at block . Block determines if or when the virtual collaboration session has reached its end and method stops at block .

Returning to block if method determines that listen only mode has not been set block determines whether an auto mute feature has been set. In some cases the auto mute feature automatically mutes a participant s audio signal if the quality of that signal is such that it does not meet minimum requirements for the session. If the auto mute feature has not been set method analyzes and provides feedback to a given participant about the quality of his or her audio signal such as for example his or her noise level voice quality or the like. In some cases such feedback may be provided in the form of a visual cue in a graphical user interface presented to the participant during the session. If block determines that the noise level or voice quality is above a selected threshold value control returns to block . Otherwise method outputs one or more recommended actions to the participant at block and control passes to block .

Examples of recommendations include but are not limited to an instruction that the participant approach or move closer to his or her microphone that the participant mute his or her microphone that the participant disconnect from the session at least temporarily that the participant find a quieter location to connect from that the participant increase his or her microphone gain etc. When the recommendation is presented to a moderator in response to the threshold value having been overcome for a given participant method may instruct the moderator to mute that given participant contact the given participant via text or other messaging system to communicate the problem to him or her without disrupting the session or disconnect the given participant from the session temporarily or permanently .

Returning to block if method determines that the auto mute feature has been set block may analyze any inputs received at NUI framework module . In some embodiments NUI framework may be configured to identify a number of predetermined gestures made by a participant. For example if the participant gestures to become a passive participant as determined by block control passes to block . Otherwise at block method analyzes and provides feedback to a given participant about the quality of his or her audio signal. If block determines that the quality of the audio signal is not above a preselected threshold value the control returns to block . Otherwise method may output a notification and or recommendation to the participant at block and control again passes to block .

In various implementations a graphical user interface presented to session moderator during execution of method may provide that moderator with the ability to see each participant s ambient noise level voice quality or audio signal quality via visual cues. Using the same graphical interface the moderator may be given the ability to mute the microphone of a given participant on the conference bridge if they determine that the given participant is introducing unwanted noise. The moderator may also have the ability to see their own visual audio cues and be able to mute both their microphone and speaker headset. In contrast with moderator controls the graphical user interface presented to each participant may have a view of their own noise level voice quality and controls over their own microphone and or speakers. Moreover in some implementations controls may be provided to moderator that enable him or her to activate global mute for all noise makers which may be fewer than all participants of an ongoing session in some cases rather than having to search through a list for the offenders individually.

Still referring to block may be configured to implement context awareness for virtual collaboration sessions. Particularly sensor or gesture inputs received by NUI framework may be used to provide feedback on auto muting and action pop ups alerts to the moderator and or participants based on physical gestures. Examples of gesture inputs via NUI detection that may be used to detect a participant s intent to switch between listen only mode and active speaking may include but are not limited to 2D or 3D camera configured to determine whether the participant is looking away from his or her computer screen e.g. monitoring head orientation whether the participant has made a shoosh gesture finger to lips or covered his or her mouth with their hand to mute and whether the participant has cupped his or her hand s around their ear s to indicate unmute or increase volume among others.

Meanwhile examples of context input that may be assessed by context engines and or and used to determine whether to sign a participant onto a virtual collaboration session in listen only or active speaking mode and or to provide feedback on auto muting and action pop ups alerts to the moderator and or participants include but are not limited to a location from which a participant connecting from e.g. a moving vehicle or a fixed location etc. a type of device used by the participant e.g. a mobile device or a desktop computer etc. a type of connection e.g. wireless or wired connection broadband or narrowband connection and a type of microphone or speaker apparatus being used e.g. built in microphone or headset .

In some embodiments a decision engine may be used e.g. an artificial neural network or any other suitable algorithm for determining if a component of an audio signal captured from a given participant is intended by the given participant to be heard by or shared with other participants. Examples of components include ambient noise human animal or mechanical and in some cases may also have been purposefully generated by the participant including spoken conversations not relevant to the virtual collaboration session e.g. with another person in physical proximity with the participant on another phone or line etc. . Moreover examples of contextual features that may be used to determine user intent include the physical proximity of the participant to his or her computer or device the he ad orientation of the participant whether the sound is the participant s spoken voice whether detected keywords are related to the collaboration session etc.

In some cases when method determines for example as probability above certain threshold value that the participant does not intend for the sound to be heard by other participants an instruction or warning may be generated and transmitted or displayed to the participant and or to the moderator. If the participant does mute his or her microphone manually in response to the instruction the participant s action may then be fed back to the algorithm of the decision engine to improve accuracy through self learning.

Moderator is also provided a visual cue of each of participant s voice quality distilled in this figure to a first pattern or the color red indicating the quality is below a low threshold value a second pattern or the color yellow indicating the quality is between the low threshold value and a threshold value and a third pattern or the color green indicating the voice quality is above the high threshold value. In addition moderator is further provided control over the status of each of participant s microphones or at least over whether the audio signal received from each of participants is shared with other participants during the session.

By using interface moderator has the ability to mute the mic of any participant on a conference bridge for example if moderator sees that a particular participant is introducing unwanted noise during the session. In the moderator is going to mute Mike Davies by pressing the mic button with his finger. For example moderator may visually determine that Mike s connection is active by his respective dynamic noise level meter and may also see that his voice quality indicator is red flagging bad or poor voice quality on that connection. In addition moderator may have the ability to see his or her own visual audio cues and mute both their microphone and or speaker headset.
