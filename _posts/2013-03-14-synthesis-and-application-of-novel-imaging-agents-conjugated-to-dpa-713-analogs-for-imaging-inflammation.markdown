The translocator protein TSPO formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor PBR is an 18 kDa protein mainly found on the outer mitochondrial membrane. It has been shown to be overexpressed in CNS diseases and in certain types of cancer and has become an attractive target in imaging agent development. Several small molecule PET and SPECT ligands has been developed for TSPO imaging of PBR such as C PK11195 Ro 5 4864 DAA1106 PBR28 AC 5216 Vinpocetine and C DPA 713.

DPA 713 is a small molecule that binds to the translocator protein TSPO which is upregulated in activated leukocytes some malignant tumors and tissues involved in steroid biogenesis.

DPA 713 is a compound from the family of pyrazolopyrimidines which is twice as potent as PK 11195 and 10 times more hydrophilic. Several radiolabeled PET and SPECT ligands has been developed including C DPA 713 F DPA 714 and I DPA 713. Imaging studies in animal models and humans have shown promising TSPO targeting characteristics.

Cell lines and Tumor Models. Generation of MDA MD 231 LMD PSMA cells. LV PSMA is a VSV G pseudotyped lentivirus encoding PSMA which was packaged in 293T cells. LMD PSMA cells were generated in house by repetitive lentiviral transduction of a cell line isolated from a lung metastasis derived MDA MB 231 xenograft in a female NOD SCID mouse. PSMA expression was evaluated by western blot analysis with 7E11 05 1 200 dilution . No differences in growth of morphology were observed in cell culture between the parental LMD cells and PSMA transduced LMD PSMA cells. Six to eight week old female NOD SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 10MDA MB 231 LMD a lung metastasis derived subline of parental MDA MB 231 behind the right forearm and 5 10MDA MB 231 LMD PSMA the same cell line with Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen PSMA stably knocked in via lentiviral vector injected behind the right forearm. The xenografts were allowed to grow until the PSMA xenograft was at least 3 mm in diameter while the LMD xenograft had reached 6 8 mm in diameter.

Intact male athymic nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 2 10PC 3 PIP cells behind the right forearm and 2 10PC 3 flu cells behind the left forearm and were allowed to grow for 14 days until they reached 1 cm in longest diameter. Mice bearing LNCaP xenografts were inoculated with 5 10cells in Matrigel 1 1 vol vol Becton Dickenson Franklin Lakes N.J. and were allowed to grow for a year before they reached 1 cm in diameter. The mice were then used in imaging experiments as described below.

Serial in vivo NIRF imaging in TSPO MDA MB 231 LMD PSMA and PC 3 PIP and flu tumor xenograft bearing mice. MDA MB 231 LMD lines one mouse was imaged serially at 1 hour post tracers 4 hours 8 hours and 24 hours post tracers using a Pearl Impulse Imager LI COR Biosciences with dedicated 710 and 800 nm emission filters. All images were scaled to the same maximum using the manufacturer s software to facilitate direct comparison of all timepoints. The remaining mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation along the indicated timepoints they were imaged ex vivo with their body cavity exposed and their tissues were then harvested and frozen over dry ice for cryosectioning followed by ex vivo microscopy described above.

PC 3 PIP and flu xenograft bearing mice. Two mice bearing similar pairs of 1 cm tumors were injected intraperitoneally with either 8 nmol of the inventive probe DPA 713 IRDye680LT or 8 nmol of the inventive probeDPA 713 IRDye680LT 20 mg kg of unlabeled DPA 713 competitor. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas 2 in oxygen and imaged at 1 hour and 24 hours post injection using the Pearl Impulse imager using the 680 absorption 710 emission channels DPA 713 IRDye680LT . PIP flu and LNCaP bearing mice were imaged using the inventive probe DPA 713 IRDye800CW at 1 hour post injection using a Perkin Elmer IVIS 200 instrument set to absorb at 790 nm and emit at 810 nm. Images were visualized and processed using the manufacturer s Living Image software.

Ex vivo DPA 713 IRDye680LT microscopy. The mice used in the in vivo NIRF studies PC 3 analog xenografts and MDA MB 231 analog xenografts were sacrificed at the end of their studies and their tumors were collected and frozen on dry ice for cryosectioning to 20 microns on charged glass slides VWR . The sections were then probed with both anti TSPO Ab Novus Biologicals NBP1 45769 1 70 labeled directly with Lissamine sulfonyl chloride Aldrich according to the known method and anti CD68 Ab Abcam ab53444 1 40 and lastly with Hoechst 33342 Invitrogen 1 ng mL . Both antibodies were added simultaneously in a 10 FBS in PBS solution applied directly to the freshly thawed sections and allowed to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. The sections were washed twice at room temperature for 5 minutes each with PBS prior to the addition of sheep anti rat FITC Abcam ab6848 1 1 250 in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes. The secondary antibody solution was removed and the slides were bathed in Hoechst solution PBS for 1.5 minutes at room temperature before being washed twice as before with PBS. The slides were then mounted in Dako Cytomation aqueous mounting media with a glass coverslip and viewed 30 minutes later using a Nikon 80i upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon DS QilMc darkfield CCD camera and excited by a Nikon Intensilight C HGFI lamp. All images are recorded and processed using Nikon Imaging Software Elements.

J774 Cell Uptake Studies. J774 macrophages were cultured in 8 well chamber slides to 80 confluence. LPS was then added to each well for 24 hours to stimulate the cells. Both DPA 713 IRDye680LT and DPA 713 IRDye800CW 40 nM each were then added to each well with or without an excess of competing unlabeled PK11195 or DPA 713. The cells were returned to the incubator for either 1 hour or 24 hours. The solutions were then removed the nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 and the cells were briefly washed before mounting and viewing under a fluorescence microscope. shows the uptake of the IRDye680LT analog at 1 and 24 hours of incubation while panels G I shows the uptake of the IRDye800CW analog after 24 hours of incubation. There was almost no observable signal from the IRDye800CW analog after 1 hour of incubation likely due to the inherently lower sensitivity of the detector at this wavelength. The tracer localization for both analogs is perinuclear and granular in appearance and is consistent with the gross distribution pattern of TSPO expression in other mononuclear cell derived lines. Co administration of 1 M unlabeled TSPO specific ligand R S PK11195 along with 40 nM DPA 713 IRDye680LT resulted in widespread although incomplete blocking of tracer uptake at 1 hour panel B . Co administration of 1 M unlabeled DPA 713 along with the same concentration of tracer resulted in partial but incomplete blocking of tracer uptake panel C at 1 hour. After 24 hours of incubation with both tracer and blocking agents R S PK11195 no longer blocked DPA 713 IRDye680LT uptake panels E H although the presence of 1 M unlabeled DPA 713 virtually eliminated binding of both analogs panels F I .

In vivo NIRF imaging of DPA 713 IRDye680LT in TSPO MDA MB 231 breast cancer and TSPO PC 3 prostate cancer xenografts. NOD SCID mice were inoculated subcutaneously with a parental MDA MB 231 and a stably transfected MDA MB 231 PSMA expressing prostate specific membrane antigen cell line both of which constituitively express TSPO. In our experience cell lines ectopically expressing PSMA harbor more macrophages and are more vascular than their parental lines. This difference in macrophage density was the target for comparison between this otherwise isogenic tumor line. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with 6 nmol of DPA 713 IRDye680LT when the xenografts had reached 4 mm in diameter. The mice were imaged after 1 4 8 12 and 24 hours post probe injection followed by ex vivo imaging of the tumors at 24 hours. shows the in vivo uptake in a mouse bearing an 8 mm PSMA xenograft on one side left arrowhead and a 3 mm parental xenograft on the other. Probe uptake in the larger xenograft is visible 1 hour following peritoneal injection and continues through 24 hours after injection while background uptake clears. The smaller parental xenograft displays no observable uptake until the fur and skin are removed at 24 hours post injection 24 h . The larger PSMA expressing xenograft is visibly brighter than the smaller parental tumor.

Prostate tumors that have become androgen insensitive constituitively express TSPO including the PC 3 cell line. Athymic nude mice bearing two subcutaneous xenografts each consisting of one PC 3 PIP PSMA stable transfected macrophage and vasculature enriched and PC 3 flu PC 3 transfected with empty vector were injected intraperitoneally with 8 nmol of DPA 713 IRDye680LT when the tumors reached 4 8 mm in diameter. One mouse was injected with tracer only and one mouse received tracer co injected with 20 mg kg of unlabeled DPA 713. The mice were imaged in vivo at 1 hour post injection and again at 24 hours post injection. shows the distribution of fluorescent signal at these two time points. At 1 hour post injection only the macrophage enriched PC 3 PIP tumor is clearly visible arrowhead in both dorsal and ventral views. Neither tumor takes up the fluorescent probe when unlabeled DPA 713 is co administered. By 24 hours post injection fluorescence intensity is now distributed at the periphery of both tumors in the tracer only mouse and is strongly retained by TSPO kidneys. The mouse co injected with unlabeled DPA 713 displays neither tumor nor kidney uptake. Additionally the unbound probe has cleared from the peritoneal space.

Ex vivo microscopy. Both MDA MB 231 LMD xenografts were removed frozen and sectioned onto charged glass for analysis of cell specific localization of the inventive DPA 713 IRDye680LT probe at 24 hours post injection. The sections were subsequently probed with antibodies to delineate the presence of CD68 expressing mononuclear cells which are known to upregulate TSPO expression when activated as well as an antibody to delineate all TSPO expression within the tissue. demonstrates that at 24 hours post injection DPA 713 IRDye680LT is selectively retained by CD68 expressing macrophages despite the presence of TSPO expressing epithelial MDA MB 231 cells data not shown . Cells negative for CD68 and TSPO expression are also devoid of DPA 713 IRDye680LT. This ex vivo data supports the results shown in which demonstrate that TSPO specific uptake of DPA 713 IRDye680LT is blocked at early 1 hour timepoints by TSPO specific ligand PK11195 but not at late 24 hour time points. Autoblockade is effective at both early and late timepoints demonstrating specificity of binding as well as indicating TSPO independent trapping at late timepoints. This heterogeneity in TSPO targeted probe binding has been reported by others although the identity of any other target s has not been elucidated.
