This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 056974 filed on Mar. 14 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

For example the present invention relates to a drawing support apparatus a drawing supporting method and a drawing support program which are utilized for supporting development of Web content used for the internet or the like. In particular the present invention relates to a drawing support apparatus a drawing supporting method and a drawing support program capable of effectively developing the Web content which can avoid occurring defective drawings due to differences between browsers.

A recent Web content it may be called as contents or Web content hereinafter has advanced in diversification by an evolution of specifications of HTML HyperText Markup Language and CSS Cascading Style Sheets for creating Web content and a progress of Web technology.

In many cases an order of developing the Web content is that the contents are created with a text base such as the HTML and the CSS those contents are actually displayed in a screen by a browser browsing software hereinafter it is also called web browser . and the display status of the contents is checked.

Various technologies which support developer s works has been proposed so that such contents can be developed efficiently.

As an example of the technology Patent document 1 Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2002 183034 discloses a technology which makes the works easy by supporting operations to perform by using GUI Graphical User Interface a series of the works such as contents creation that have been done by texts and display check

Patent document 2 Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2005 122504 discloses a technology which supports a checking work of differences between a designing of contents and an actual indication.

Patent document 3 Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2002 527822 discloses a technology which supports a test of a Web site whose indication are dynamically changing by a dialogue using a form. More specifically in technology described in patent document 3 a test configuration file covering the input patterns to the form is created first and HTTP is transmitted to a Web site instead of a browser. After that the error included in the HTML will be reported by analyzing the HTML received from the Web site.

However in development of Web content it also has to consider that its drawing method and script execution specification are different for each browser which refers to the Web content.

In various browsers each of the browser is embedded an original drawing engine and script execution engine. That is the various browsers have the specification peculiar to the browser. Even if a certain browser is expressed to be based on the specification of the CSS there is a case where indications and operations as described in the specification may not be realized. That is depending on the kind of the browsers for indications inconvenience indication and operation a developer does not intend to may occur even if there are no error in HTML.

For example when an image or the like is shown to the respective browsers between the web browsers whose kinds are different a subtle difference may occur on a layout. That is in such a case it may take place that a drawing position of specific elements units such as each text and image of the Web content shifts by several pixels in a browser A and a browser B.

As a technological example which settles the problem Patent document 4 Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 2010 39815 discloses technology which automatically corrects an HTML source for an element whose display position and size is shifted by comparing a display result by using displayed images of a browser A and a browser B.

The problem caused by the particular specification of the browser also lies in the point that a specific browser has a restriction in the specification in addition to the indication gap mentioned above. That is there is a case that the browser doesn t draw an image correctly since the next drawing request has arrived before the drawing processing under the execution has completed depending on the input timing of the drawing processing for the browser. Specifically when drawing it according to a plurality of drawing requests whose issue timing is different the drawing inconvenience inappropriate drawing takes place such as the phenomenon that the specific element existing in the Web content is not indicated on the browser and the phenomenon that the drawing protrudes out of a designated area on the browser due to that the drawing speed is different.

The drawing inconvenience mentioned above occurs by any one of the drawing request which has been caught up or the next drawing request which has caught .

The browser correctly indicates all elements if re drawing is performed since an internal drawing processing of the browser correctly executes the drawing request which has been caught up and the drawing request has caught when a phenomenon occurs that such wrong description takes place.

Accordingly when a drawing inconvenience problem occurs by such drawing timing the re drawing for a display area of the browser should be compulsorily performed after the drawing completion of each drawing object. As a countermeasure to such browser a Web content developer has added the processing to perform re drawing in all locations after the drawing processing of the Web content has completed.

However the technology mentioned above has a problem that an indication performance substantially degrades owing to increasing a load of a client since it will be the Web content which always executes the re drawing processing after the drawing request.

In order to settle the problem mentioned above the main object of the present invention is to provide a drawing support apparatus a drawing support method and a drawing support program for supporting the Web content development which enables to reduce an execution frequency of a re drawing processing in a Web browser.

To realize the above mentioned object a drawing support apparatus of the present invention includes an analysis unit to calculate a drawing inconvenience occurrence probability based on a drawing request order information representing a drawing request order given from an out side or an external apparatus which monitors a drawing request for a browser for each of the drawing request order and a drawing result indication unit to indicate the drawing inconvenience occurrence probability calculated by the analysis unit.

In another aspect a drawing support method of the present invention includes calculating a drawing inconvenience occurrence probability based on a drawing request order information representing a drawing request order given from an out side or an external apparatus which monitors a drawing request for a browser for each of the drawing request order and indicating the drawing inconvenience occurrence probability calculated in the calculating.

In a further aspect of the present invention a non transitory readable storage medium storing a drawing support program enables a computer to implement an analysis processing to calculate a drawing inconvenience occurrence probability based on a drawing request order information representing a drawing request order given from an out side or an external apparatus which monitors a drawing request for a browser for each of the drawing request order and a drawing result indication processing to indicate the drawing inconvenience occurrence probability calculated by the analysis processing.

According to the present invention the development and creation of the Web content can be efficiently performed in order to achieve the re drawing processing that corresponds to difference of a occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience per an drawing execution order for the Web browser which has a possibility that the drawing request next to the present description processing has caught up.

Other exemplary features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.

A realization method and configuration of an apparatus of the present invention is not limited to the each exemplary embodiment described hereinafter.

The first exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail by using the drawings. is a figure which shows a relation chart of the drawing support apparatus a browser and Web content of this embodiment. The first exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a drawing support apparatus a browser Web content a drawing examiner and a network .

The browser and the Web content can communicate via a communication network hereinafter just referred to as network such as the internet and an in house LAN local area network .

The drawing support apparatus may include a general information processing apparatus computer which operates by program control or may be constructed by an exclusive hardware.

The browser and the Web content may be provided in the drawing support apparatus or it may be provided for other information processing apparatus computer or the like.

In this embodiment a drawing examiner accesses the Web content via the browser . The drawing examiner is a user who operates the drawing support apparatus so as to for example confirm a drawing result.

The drawing support apparatus is equipped with a drawing request monitoring unit a data storage unit a drawing result acquisition unit that receives the drawing result drawing result information from the drawing examiner an analysis unit and an analysis result indication unit which indicates the analysis result by using an updated data stored in the data storage unit .

In the drawing support apparatus in order to draw the Web content desired by the drawing examiner the drawing request monitoring unit monitors a drawing request to be sent to the browser and stores an order information of the drawing request.

Specifically for example a program which monitors the drawing request with an add on form or the like is included in the browser . A method may be applicable that the program executed in the browser notifies a monitoring result to the monitoring unit by monitoring the drawing request which is carried out for the browser when this program indicates the Web content .

The order information on the drawing request may be given to the analysis unit from outside not generated by monitoring of the drawing request monitoring unit

In the drawing support apparatus the data storage unit is able to accumulate drawing test records so far information regarding to occurrence probability of a drawing inconvenience for each drawing execution order in the past drawing test .

As shown in the drawing test record gives an order information ID corresponding to each drawing request order in the Web content as a test object. The order information ID is a record of a drawing object the execution times in the respective drawing request order occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience inappropriate drawing which has occurred in the drawing carried out with the those execution times and the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience which is calculated from the occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience for the each respective ID.

In the drawing support apparatus the analysis unit calculates a drawing inconvenience probability for the each drawing execution order by analyzing the various drawing information given from the drawing request monitoring unit the data storage unit and the drawing result acquisition unit . And the analysis unit reflects the information on this drawing test in data stored in the data storage unit .

Next the browser is a kind of program having indication functions so that the drawing examiner can browse contents of various Web sites including the Web content . As a general function of a browser the browser has a drawing demand accepting unit and a drawing processing unit .

Next an operation of this embodiment having the configuration mentioned above will be described in detail. First the precondition in this description is described.

In this embodiment terminologies element function and block are used. The element is an object operated in the function as exemplarily illustrated by a drawing object element div element . In this embodiment as illustrated by identification information the value of the id attribute of the element information which identifies the element is set to a value of id attribute that has given to the element.

In this embodiment it is supposed that the value of the id attribute is unique in the Web content . The identification information may be other suitable values.

The function is API Application Programming Interface which performs for the element as an operation terget various operations such as generation and arrangement as exemplarily illustrated by a function .

As illustrated with a createDivElement block the block includes zero to a plurality of functions. Generally although something like the createDivElement block is also called function in some cases for convenience of the explanation the terminologies which discriminate such function and block respectively are used in this embodiment.

Here the drawing object corresponds to the element while the identification information on the drawing object corresponds to the value of the id attribute of element . Drawing request order information corresponds to a block including drawing processing functions respectively. There are two types of the function . That is one type of the function generates the drawing request and another type of the function is not related to the drawing. In this embodiment there are four types of the block including the drawing processing functions. That is the four types of the block are a createDivElement block to a div element a placeDivElement block a createImgElement block to an img element and a placeImgElement block .

In the script a block including the drawing processing is called in an order that is indicated in the block which shows a processing flow. That is the script includes the processing that creates to a div element in a createDivElement block places to a body element in a placeDivElement block creates to an img element in a createImgElement block and places to a body element in a placeImgElement block .

In the following description it is supposed that the drawing inconvenience has occurred to the div element generated in the script .

A specific example of the monitoring method by a drawing request monitoring unit is indicated. According to this embodiment it is supposed that the occurrence of the drawing request creation to the drawing function and its contents are captured by overwriting the added function with a monitoring function to the respective functions that performs the drawing processing. The monitoring function is a function to acquire a request source block of the drawing object and the drawing processing as a monitoring record out of the request contents in a function corresponding to the drawing request. Although only the block which is performing the drawing processing is monitored according to this embodiment the execution order information and its processing order of the whole of the Web content may be grasped by the monitoring including the block which performs the other processing. Thereby the precision of the drawing inconvenience probability becomes high that is calculated for each of the drawing request order information that is the drawing inconvenience can be analyzed more in detail.

Hereinafter an operation of the drawing support apparatus in this embodiment will be described with reference to and .

First the drawing examiner starts the browser . Next the drawing request monitoring unit in the drawing support system receives the instruction of monitoring start of the drawing request from the drawing examiner step S A shown in . When the instruction of monitoring start of the drawing request are received the drawing request monitoring unit starts to monitor the drawing request performed to the browser step S B shown in .

Next the drawing examiner accesses the Web content which is the test object using the browser step S A shown in .

When the access to the Web content in the browser is detected the drawing request monitoring unit records a series of the drawing requests performed to the browser from the Web content step S A shown in .

As exemplary illustrated in contents of the monitoring record which the drawing request monitoring unit records are the object drawing object of the drawing request and the order drawing request order of the drawing request. Substance data of the drawing request order may be applicable to a name or a parameter of the function so that the browser performs the drawing. Substance of the drawing request order may be applicable to a name of the block including the drawing processing. First according to this embodiment the drawing request monitoring unit performs the drawing request in the order of the creation to the div element in a createDivElement block and the placement in a body element in a placeDivElement block . Next completing of the drawing request is stored as a monitoring record in the order of the creation to the div element in a createImgElement block and the placement in a body element in a placeImgElement block . Further it is supposed that execution order information is recorded according to the drawing object.

The drawing examiner checks a display state of the Web content after an indication of the Web content is completed with the browser step S A shown in . That is the drawing examiner checks a presence of an occurrence of the drawing inconvenience and an object in which the drawing inconvenience has generated when occurring the drawing inconvenience contents element such as images and sentences which have not been indicated correctly on the browser . In this case when recognizing that the drawing inconvenience occurred in the div element generated in a script a drawing examiner instructs an end of the monitoring in a drawing request monitoring unit step S A shown in .

The drawing request monitoring unit terminates to monitor the drawing request by receiving instructions to finish the monitoring step S B shown in . Next the drawing result acquisition unit indicates an input screen of the drawing result step S B shown in . That is presence of the occurrence of the drawing inconvenience and a screen for inputting information element of the screen and a name of an area which specifies the object in which the drawing inconvenience has generated contents element are indicated to the drawing examiner . Further a plurality of the drawing inconveniences may occur in a drawing test. Therefore it is supposed that the drawing examiner may be able to input concerning to a plurality of the drawing inconveniences if necessary.

The drawing examiner inputs the drawing result to the screen in which the drawing result acquisition unit has indicated step S A shown in . The information inputted to the drawing result acquisition unit can be considered to be information the information on the id attribute for example specifying the div element as an object in which the drawing inconvenience has generated in addition to the information on the occurrence presence of the drawing inconvenience. Here information representing the drawing inconvenience has occurred and the value divcontent of the id attribute of the div element in which the drawing inconvenience has generated are inputted. And the drawing result acquisition unit receives the checking result which the drawing examiner has inputted step S B shown in . The judgment and input of the checking result may be able to be automated. In this embodiment the checking method of the drawing inconvenience is not limited at all.

Next the analysis unit analyzes the drawing information. The analysis unit acquires the data which becomes the input of the analysis at the beginning of the analysis. First the drawing test record so far is read from the data storage unit Step S shown in . is a figure which has conceptually illustrated the drawing test record that the data storage unit holds.

Referring to it is found that the drawing test of this Web content has executed four times so far the number of execution times of the div element is four and the occurrence of the drawing inconvenience is once. It is also found that the number of execution times of the img element is two and the occurrence number of the drawing inconvenience is zero times. Here because drawing to the img element was added to the Web content later number of runs of the img element is something less than number of tests of the Web content. Further as another adaptation measure to the change the Web content under developing it may cooperate with a version management system. As a result even if the change of the script such as the change of the block name takes place the drawing test record in the past can be utilized.

The information which becomes an input to the analysis unit is the monitoring record under side of that the drawing request monitoring unit has recorded and the drawing result information that the drawing result acquisition unit has acquired in addition to the drawing test record that the data storage unit has accumulated so far. The information which the drawing request monitoring unit has recorded and the drawing result information which the drawing examiner has inputted are the same as described above.

Next the analysis unit checks whether or not the drawing inconvenience has occurred in this drawing test. In this embodiment it is assumed that the drawing inconvenience occurs Step S shown in .

Next when the drawing inconvenience does not occur processing is advanced to a processing of Step S shown in .

When the drawing inconvenience has occurred the analysis unit extracts all of the identifiers of the drawing inconvenience objects and the drawing request order information on which the objects are operated by using the drawing result information and the monitoring record Step S shown in . That is first the analysis unit searches the monitoring records by using a value divcontent of the id attribute that is the information specifying occurrence objects of the drawing inconvenience among the drawing result information as a retrieval key. Next the analysis unit extracts the drawing request order information which makes the element which holds the id attribute as the drawing object. As a result of the search the drawing request record which has made for div divcontent is extracted and it can be confirmed that the div element operation is performed by the order of the createDivElement block and the placeDivElement block.

And the analysis unit adds 1 to the occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience in the drawing request order information in which the drawing inconvenience has occurred in the drawing test record mentioned above so far by using the extraction result. That is one is added to the occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience in the order information on the createDivElement block and the placeDivElement block to the div element which has become inconvenient Step S shown in .

Next the analysis unit adds 1 to the number of the execution times of the order information concerning to all of the drawing request orders included in the monitoring record mentioned above. That is the analysis unit adds 1 to the number of the execution times in the sum of two of the order in formations of the order of the createDivElement block placeDivElement block to the div element and the order of the createImgElement block placeImgElement block to the img element Step S shown in .

In this case when there are a drawing object and a drawing request order which are not included in a drawing test record the analysis unit adds the drawing test record as a new item.

After that the analysis unit calculates the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience in all of the drawing request order information in which the number of the execution times is updated or added. That is in two of the order in formations in which the number of the execution times has been updated the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience is calculated Step S shown in .

In this embodiment it is supposed that the occurrence probability expresses a value given by dividing number of occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience by number of the execution times in percent . And as the end of the analysis the analysis unit updates the number of the execution times of all of the order information the number of the occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience and the occurrence probability of drawing inconvenience step S B shown in and Step S shown in which are carried out this time to the data storage unit . The drawing test record after the update of the number of the execution times the number of the occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience and the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience is illustrated conceptually in .

As the execution result of the drawing test performed this time the drawing test record to the div element will be five execution times twice of the drawing inconvenience occurrence and the 40 of the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience while the drawing test record to the img element will be three execution times zero times of the drawing inconvenience occurrence and the 0 of the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience.

After the analysis by the analysis unit the analysis result indication unit shows the analysis result to the drawing examiner by using the monitoring record of the drawing request monitoring unit and the latest drawing test record of the data storage unit step S B shown in . First the analysis result indication unit digs the drawing object and the drawing request order included in this drawing test range from the monitoring record. Next the record of this drawing test range is shown by extracting from the drawing test record. That is the drawing inconvenience probability in the drawing order of the createDivElement block placeDivElement block to div divcontent is 40 in the shown contents. And the information is included which shows that the drawing inconvenience probability in the drawing order of the createImgElement block to img imgcontent the placeImgElement block is 0 .

The analysis result indication unit shows the analysis result such as each drawing request order information carried out at this the drawing test and a list of the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience.

The analysis result indication unit may automatically create by giving the script included in the Web content to the result of the analysis result indication unit a script which is inserted the description for a probabilistic re drawing processing as a coping strategy of the drawing inconvenience.

Since the probabilistic re drawing processing described here is a processing to perform the re drawing with the proportion according to the drawing inconvenience probability that is given as an argument it is for avoiding the drawing inconvenience. A place location where the probabilistic re drawing processing is inserted is a processing part of the end of drawing request order in the range carried out by this drawing test described above. As this result it is the processing to finally avoid the drawing inconvenience by completing the execution of a series of the drawing requests and performing the re drawing corresponding to the degree of the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience at the timing after the occurrence of the drawing inconvenience.

In the probabilistic re drawing processing which the analysis result indication unit inserts the probability that re drawing is performed may be the same as the drawing inconvenience probability. The threshold value is set up for the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience. If the drawing inconvenience probability is no more than the threshold value the analysis result indication unit may not insert the description of the probabilistic re drawing. Or by the internal control of the probabilistic re drawing processing if the drawing inconvenience probability that is given by an argument is no larger than the threshold value the re drawing processing may not be performed.

When the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience is the drawing inconvenience probability which is not smaller than the threshold value on the one hand the analysis result indication unit may insert a processing to perform 100 certainly the re drawing to all of the drawing request order. Or by the internal control of the probabilistic re drawing processing if the drawing inconvenience probability that is given by an argument is no smaller than the threshold value the re drawing processing may be always performed. That is the execution probability of the re drawing processing that the analysis result indication unit inserts may not be same as the drawing inconvenience probability in the drawing request order.

An operation of the analysis result indication unit will be described below in detail concerning to a specific example of the script auto creation with reference to and . In this embodiment is a figure exemplarily indicating a result which has inserted the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing in the script shown in .

First the analysis result indication unit analyzes the drawing request order of the analysis result mentioned above and determines the place where the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing is inserted. The place where the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing is inserted is a processing part of the end of the drawing request order in the range carried out by this drawing test. That is they are two places which is the placeDivElement block to div divcontent and the placeImgElement block to img imgcontent.

Next the analysis result indication unit inserts a processing which probabilistically performs the re drawing in the form shown in for example for two locations which are the places where the script is read in and the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing. That is the processing is inserted to hand a probability to an argument in the end of each execution order and call this block. According to this embodiment the description of the inserted probabilistic re drawing is the probabilistic re drawing processing 40 shown in in the placeDivElement block A to div divcontent the probabilistic re drawing processing 0 shown in in the placeImgElement block A to img imgcontent and the probabilistic re drawing processing body .

For example as a method by which the analysis result indication unit acquires the script the script is stored as a text file at the place where it can be read out from the environment that the drawing support system works. Next it is considered that the drawing examiner inputs the file location in step S A when the drawing result is input.

Further in this embodiment it is supposed that the probabilistic re drawing body is the redrawProbable block and the analysis result indication unit is equipped with in advance. Further the analysis result indication unit may read the probabilistic re drawing processing body from the file given from the outside as the same as the script . The allocating place in the script of the probabilistic re drawing processing body shown in is set as the head of the whole script in this embodiment. However it is arranged in the location specified by the rule according to a description rule of the script language if the description rule of the script language is different.

A numerical number 40 which is an argument in the parenthesis of probabilistic re drawing 40 shown in and a numerical number 0 which is an argument in the parenthesis of probabilistic re drawing 0 shown in correspond to the drawing inconvenience occurrence probability of in the respective drawing request order. According to the probability given by an argument the probabilistic re drawing processing performs the re drawing processing. In the probabilistic re drawing processing body shown in of this embodiment the numerical value of the argument is set to be the probability percent of the re drawing processing with no modification. For example the probabilistic re drawing processing 40 shown in performs the re drawing at the rate of 4 times out of 10 times drawings. Accordingly because the drawing inconvenience of the div element occurs by 40 and the 40 out of it is normally recovered by the re drawing the final drawing inconvenience occurrence probability will be 16 .

And finally the analysis result indication unit shows the script created automatically to the drawing examiner by the method of a screen indication a printing and the file output. Further based on the analysis result such as the respective request order information executed in this drawing test and the creation probability of the drawing inconvenience for the respective drawing request order both or anyone of the scripts of .

Thus the drawing support apparatus can indicate in which part of the Web content and how high the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience is to the drawing examiner . Because the avoidance plan to the drawing inconvenience can be shown to a developer of the Web content by the function of the auto creation of the script the processing which performs the re drawing according to the probability in the proper location of the script in the Web content can be embedded easily.

For example in general by the characteristic of the web browser it is supposed that the drawing inconvenience may occur to drawing which is being processed at present due to the cause that the next drawing request catches up to the present drawing processing under running. In that case in the avoidance method that the processing is embedded to perform the re drawing in all blocks including the drawing of the Web content totally four times re drawings in blocks and and will be always performed. Or totally twice of the re drawing may be always performed at the two locations by digging that the blocks to which the drawing processing does not succeed are only the blocks and of with the effort to analyze and verify the order of the drawing processing.

According to this embodiment the re drawing processing should be performed to only the placeDivElement block and the placeImgElement block of the end of the drawing order for each drawing object shown to this example. According to this embodiment it can be easily handled by embedding the processing and shown in in which the number of the re drawing times corresponding to the drawing inconvenience probability of 40 and 0 respectively according to the shown script is subtracted.

As described above it can avoid the development and the creation of the contents so as to generate the drawing inconvenience due to that the next drawing request catches up the drawing processing under running at present in the Web browser in this embodiment. This embodiment has an effect that the development and the creation of the Web content can be performed which can reduce the occurrence frequency of the re drawing processing in the web browser.

It is a reason that the analysis result indication unit shows the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience for each drawing execution order until the present and the identification information of the drawing request objects to a developer of the Web content. As a result because the developer can obtain the combination of the information the drawing request object identification information and the drawing execution order on the location in which the drawing inconvenience generates and the occurrence probability of the drawing incontinence the processing can be embedded which performs the re drawing corresponding to the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience after the final drawing request processing of the drawing execution order in the Web content.

Next the second exemplary embodiment based on the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above will be described. In below a characteristic part according to this embodiment will be described in main. In other words the same reference code as the reference code attached in the first embodiment is attached in the composition component of the second exemplary embodiment which has the same composition component of the first exemplary embodiment and the duplicated detail description concerning to the composition component is omitted.

As shown in the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a drawing support apparatus A a browser the Web content a drawing examiner a drawing result checking system and a network .

In the drawing support system A may include a general information processing apparatus computer which operates by the program control and the exclusive hardware may be included.

The drawing support apparatus A further includes a Web content management unit a Web server Web content with a log function and a script with a log function in addition to the composition of the drawing support apparatus in the first exemplary embodiment shown in . The drawing support apparatus A has a drawing request monitoring unit A in which a part of the functions are different instead of the drawing request monitoring unit in the first exemplary embodiment. The drawing support apparatus A and the browser can communicate via the communication network hereinafter just referred to as network such as the internet and an in house LAN local area network .

In this embodiment the Web content management unit the Web server the Web content with a log function the script with a log function and the drawing request monitoring unit A are mainly implemented in order to monitor the drawing request with the form independent from a browser other than the method which directly acts on the browser such as the add on to the browser.

That is the Web content management unit the Web server and the Web content with a log function and the script with log function realize the function to add a system to monitor a drawing request on the Web content and the script . Accordingly in this embodiment the browser accesses the Web content with a log function via the Web server of the drawing support apparatus A instead of the Web content .

The Web content management unit acquires the Web content and the script based on the information given from outside and holds the copy inside. The management unit creates the Web content with the log function and the script with the log function in which the log function to monitor the drawing is added to the Web content and script .

Responding to an access request from the browser the Web server transmits the Web content with the log function and the script with the log function that the Web content management unit has created to the browser .

The Web content with the log function and the script with the log function are created by the Web content management unit . And when the drawing request is performed in the browser the Web content with the log function and the script with the log function have the log function that the browser sends a log which includes the drawing request information to the drawing support apparatus A.

When the browser indicates the Web content with the log function the drawing request monitoring unit A receives the sent log and stores it as the monitoring record of the drawing request.

According to this embodiment the drawing result check system automatically checks the drawing result of the browser as an example which shows the realization diversity of the system configuration.

The drawing result checking system acquires a drawing result with reference to the browser instead of the drawing examiner in the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above. That is the system checks the occurrence presence of the drawing inconvenience automatically and inputs to the analysis acquisition unit . Further the drawing result checking system is independent from the browser mentioned above and does not relates to the function to monitor the drawing request.

Next the operation of this embodiment having the constitution mentioned above will be described in detail.

In the following description the operations such as the acquisition to the script and the script with the log function the copy creation and addition of the log function are described with including in the operations for the Web content and the Web content with the log function which includes them. In particular the script and the script with the log function may not be described as the objects.

For example when The Web content with a log function is created with the addition of the log function to the Web content is described the log function is also given to the included script and it means that the script with the log function is also created.

First the drawing support apparatus A is started by inputting the information for the acquisition of the Web content which becomes the drawing test object step S B . For example the drawing examiner starts by the command input of the path information which indicates the position of the Web content as an argument from the console not illustrated .

Or the drawing support apparatus A may be composed so that the automatic activation can be performed at the time of the machine starting.

When the drawing support apparatus A starts the Web content management unit acquires the Web content designated by an argument creates the copy and holds it inside step S B . And the management unit creates the Web content with the log function which is given the log function that realizes the monitoring of the drawing request in the acquired the Web content step S B .

Here the log function is the function that the browser sends the contents of the drawing request to the drawing request monitoring unit A at the timing when the drawing request is performed when the Web content with the log function is indicated in the browser .

Or in order to reduce the number of telecommunication times between the browser and the drawing request monitoring unit A the log concerning to all the drawing request contents may be transmitted together after the indication completion of the whole of the Web content with the log function not at the timing that the drawing request has been performed as mentioned above.

For example the substance of the script with the log function is created by a method to insert after the drawing processing of the script to the description of the processing of the log function mentioned above in the JavaScript form. The add on of the log function may be realized by other methods.

And the Web content management unit arranges the Web content with the created log function in the Web server step S B .

Next the drawing examiner accesses the Web server via the browser and indicates the Web content with the log function step S A . Corresponding to this by the log function embedded in the Web content with the log function the drawing request monitoring unit A receives the log of the drawing request from the browser and records as the monitoring record of the drawing request step S B . Here as shown in the contents monitoring record that the drawing request monitoring unit A records are the same information as the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above.

After indication of the Web content with a log function is completed on the browser the drawing result checking system acquires the drawing result with reference to the browser and sends the drawing result to the drawing result acquisition unit step S A .

The various forms are considered as a means for checking the drawing results. For example when the technology disclosed by the patent document 2 is used the check of the drawing result can be realized by the various methods such as the comparison of the image of the indication area of the browser after the indication and the image of the indication area of the browser at the time of the normal drawing and the specification of the components existing at the position after the part which includes the difference is detected.

Similarly the various methods can be considered as a method to learn that the indication of the Web content with the log function has been completed in the browser . For example the method may direct the start of the result checking to the drawing result checking system by the drawing examiner . Or the drawing result checking system may be applicable to always watch the browser and detect the indication completion automatically.

The drawing result acquisition unit acquires the drawing result from the drawing result checking system step S B . While the drawing result acquisition unit has indicated the input screen of the drawing result in the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above the acquisition processing of the drawing result starts by receiving from the drawing result checking system in this embodiment.

The contents of the drawing result which the drawing result acquisition unit acquires from the drawing result checking system are similar to what the drawing examiner has inputted in the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above. That is the contents of the drawing result include the information element of the screen and the name of the area which specifies the presence of the drawing inconvenience occurrence and the objects in which the drawing inconvenience has generated.

Next the analysis unit analyzes the drawing information step S B . Because it is the same as that of the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above concerning to the analysis operation that the analysis unit performs the description in details will be omitted.

The analysis unit updates the drawing examination result information which the data storage unit holds in the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience which is this analysis result after the analysis step S B .

Finally the analysis result indication unit shows the drawing test result based on the monitoring record of the drawing request monitoring unit A and the latest drawing test record of the data storage unit step S B .

Because it is the same as that of the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above concerning to the indication operation of the analysis result of the drawing information the description in details will be omitted. However the analysis result indication unit performs the embedding processing based on the copy of the script which the Web content management unit holds when the script which inserts the description of the probabilistic re drawing in the script is automatically created and indicated.

In the same way as the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above this embodiment has the effect that the avoidance plan of the drawing inconvenience can be indicated by the auto creation function of the script in addition to that which part in the Web content and how high the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience can be indicated to the drawing examiner .

Moreover by including the Web server this embodiment enables to make what embeds the log function in the Web content which is the object the monitoring object. In that case according to this embodiment the effect is obtained that the function of the drawing support system A can be realized independent from the kind of the browser . That is the drawing test to a plurality of browsers can be carried out using one drawing support apparatus A because the drawing support apparatus A is not built for each kind of the browsers. As a result the load of a Web content developer can be reduced concerning to the drawing test in the Web content development which supports the indication in a plurality of browsers and its handling work.

According to this embodiment because the drawing check at the time of the indication completion of the browser can be automated using the drawing result checking system as a result there is an effect that the work of the drawing examiner can be reduced.

Next the third exemplary embodiment based on the first and the second exemplary embodiments mentioned above will be described. In the below the characteristic part according to this embodiment will be described in main. The same reference codes as the reference codes attached to the first and the second exemplary embodiments for the construction components of the third exemplary embodiment which has the similar construction to the first and the second exemplary embodiments and the duplicated detailed description is omitted concerning to the construction components.

According to this embodiment first the attached information other than the drawing request order information is added to the monitoring record. Next the case of the classification per the class henceforth referred to as case which adds the attached information to the drawing request order information at the time of analyzing the drawing inconvenience generation probability is described. That is the processing order information of the drawing request is classified by tying together into a case in which the same processing feature has the same tendency.

The system configuration in this embodiment and the flow of the whole processing are the same as that of the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above refer to and respectively . However as described below the composition of the analysis processing of the drawing inconvenience probability realized by the drawing request monitoring unit the data storage unit and the analysis unit is different.

In addition to the monitoring information in the first exemplary embodiment the drawing request monitoring unit records the calling history of the all blocks other than the drawing processing the control information that influences affects the block actions such as the synchronization asynchronization at the execution time of each block and the additional information such as the operating environment.

The data storage unit records the drawing object the number of execution times not for each drawing request order information but for each case the number of the occurrence times and the record of the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience. The contrast information which shows the drawing request order information and the drawing object has been classified into is accumulated. The contrast information of the case is used when the place location is specified where the analysis result indication unit inserts the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing in the script .

The analysis unit calculates the drawing inconvenience of the occurrence probability for each case not the drawing request order information.

First an operation until the drawing examiner accesses the Web content and the operation until the drawing request monitoring unit monitors the drawing request are the same as those of the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above. Here the operation step S B of in which the drawing request monitoring unit records the drawing request will be described first.

The drawing request monitoring unit monitors the calling history of all the blocks other than the drawing processing the control information which influences the operation in a block such as synchronization asynchronization at the execution time of each block and the additional information on the operating environment and records with the drawing request order information.

Here the synchronization asynchronization at the execution time of each block is the operation mode designation which designates whether it waits the completion of the other processing during the execution of the processing of the block mentioned above and the function mentioned above. For example the respective operation modes are switched by the execution of the function that sets the synchronization at the execution time of each block and the execution of the function that sets the asynchronization. The kind of the control setting of such operation mode and the setting method depend on the specification of the description language of the Web content. For example the operating environment is the value of the CPU utilization rate and the network utilization rate of the computer in which the browser is operating. Concerning to the kind and the contents of the additional information it is not limited to these.

The drawing request monitoring unit also classifies and records the contents of each drawing request. As the contents of the drawing request for example the kind and the value of the attached attributes such as the kind of the operations the style attributes and the class attributes such as the creation of the element a change of the attribute a change of a drawing style including the style attribute and the class attribute arrangement of the element and the cancellation of the element can be considered.

Further for example after a mapping table of the operation and the attribute type to a block name and a function name is held in advance and the drawing request monitoring unit may be operated so that it may distinguish the kind of the operation and the attribute in the detected drawing request in reference with the mapping table.

After that the drawing request monitoring unit has the similar operation as that of the first exemplary embodiment until acquiring the drawing result information step S B shown in .

Next the analysis unit analyzes the drawing information step S B shown in . According to this embodiment the analysis unit classifies the drawing request order information for each case and calculates the drawing inconvenience probability.

First the analysis unit reads the former drawing test record from the data storage unit Step S shown in . Additionally the information which becomes the input to the analysis unit is a monitoring record which the drawing request monitoring unit has recorded and drawing result information which the drawing result acquisition unit has acquired.

Next the analysis unit classifies the drawing request order information for each case Step S shown in . The case is classified for each setting of the synchronization asynchronization at the time of the each block execution and the contents of the drawing request. For example Case is the synchronization setting at the time of each block execution and the drawing request content makes it the order of the creation the body arrangement. Case is the asynchronous setting at the time of each block execution and the drawing request content makes it the order of the creation body arrangement. In this case the information which specifies the location of the script corresponding to the case which the data storage unit holds is the object of the drawing request the order information and the information on the synchronization asynchronization setting at the time of each block execution.

If the drawing inconvenience occurs the drawing request order is calculated in addition to the identifier of the drawing inconvenience object and the drawing request order information which has operated the object by using the drawing result information and the monitoring record Step S shown in .

And 1 is added to the number of the occurrence times of the drawing inconveniences in a case that the drawing inconvenience has occurred in the above mentioned drawing test record so far by using the extraction result of the case Step S shown in .

Next the analysis unit adds 1 to the number of the execution times concerning to all cases included in the above mentioned monitoring record Step S shown in .

In this case when there are the drawing object the drawing request order and the case which are not included in the drawing test record the analysis unit adds the drawing test record as a new item.

After that in all cases that the number of the execution times is updated or added the analysis unit calculates the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience Step S shown in .

For example in one Web content indication if there exists three drawing request order in formations which come under a specific case and the drawing inconvenience occurs in one execution order out of them 3 is added to the number of execution times of the case 1 is added to the number of the occurrence times of the drawing inconvenience and the occurrence probability of drawing inconvenience is calculated. That is the analysis unit carries out the case 3 times and regards that the drawing inconvenience has occurred once in the one time drawing test.

And the analysis unit reflects the analysis result in the data storage unit Step S shown in and Step S shown in .

Finally the analysis result indication unit shows the analysis result of the drawing inconvenience to the drawing examiner using the monitoring record of the drawing request monitoring unit and the latest drawing test record of the data storage unit step S B shown in .

In the presentation of the analysis result of the drawing inconvenience when the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing is inserted in the script the data storage unit investigates each relevant location based on the drawing request order information and the contents of the contrast information and the case and inserts the description of the probabilistic re drawing processing. At that time although included in the case which has become the result indication object the description of probabilistic re drawing processing to the script may be inserted to the request order information which has not carried out in this test.

Further by other additional information included in a monitoring record the analysis result indication unit may be changed the method to insert description of probabilistic re drawing in a script . For example according to the load of the Web content at the time of the drawing processing the execution probability of the re drawing in the inserted probabilistic re drawing processing may be adjusted. That is it may be applicable to make the probability of re drawing lower than a standard probability probability to be applied when a load is not high if the load such as the CPU utilization rate in the browser execution environment is high while it may be applicable to make the probability of re drawing higher than the standard probability if the load is low conversely.

As it has been described above this embodiment has an effect that the drawing test result which has been obtained before can still be reflected for the Web content which has performed the drawing test in the past.

A reason is that the analysis unit calculates the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience for each case with the same tendency of the feature of the contents. Therefore it is because that the analysis result indication unit can embed the processing to perform the re drawing corresponding to the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience for a drawing request processing part that is included in the case that the drawing inconvenience occurrence probability has changed at this test in the script which has performed drawing test in the past.

In the drawing support apparatus B the analysis unit B calculates an occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience for the each drawing request order based on the drawing request order information representing the drawing request order given from an out side or an external apparatus that monitors the drawing request to a browser. Next the drawing result unit display B shows the drawing inconvenience occurrence probability that the analysis unit B has calculated to the user drawing examiner .

According to drawing support apparatus B according to this embodiment a development and a creation of the Web content can be efficiently carried out which performs the redrawing processing corresponding to a difference of the occurrence probability of the drawing inconvenience of the each drawing execution order for the Web browser having a possibility that the next drawing request catches up the present drawing processing.

The present invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment described above and the various modifications are applicable for its implementation.
