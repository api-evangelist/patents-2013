title: Facilitating user incident reports
abstract: With a computer processor, access is obtained to a sorted global tuple list of incident types, each tuple of which includes at least an incident identifier, a corresponding incident type, a corresponding context, and a corresponding impact factor. The latter specifies importance of solving the corresponding incident type in the corresponding context. Each tuple of the global tuple list is sorted by decreasing order of impact factor. At the computer processor, context information is obtained for at least one remote computing device; based on the context information and the sorted global tuple list, the computer processor sends, over a telecommunications infrastructure, data which causes an incident reporting display on the remote computing device to be re-ordered in accordance with the impact factors as they are ranked in accordance with the context information for the at least one remote computing device.

Techniques of the present invention can provide substantial beneficial technical effects. For example one or more embodiments provide faster incident reporting times to allow authorities to more quickly respond to emergencies.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.

One or more embodiments provide a system and method that manages user interfaces in Citizen Sensor Monitors CSM applications which are part of a Citizen Sensing Platform CSP . More particularly one or more embodiments provide an engine that generates ranking lists of incidents based on a combination of local context information e.g. user s location current time events objects present cultural context and the like in combination with user profile and a calculation of impact factor of related incidents that is a context variant value that indicates the level of priority of the incidents . Advantageously one or more embodiments provide the best fit reporting interface for a CSM that is for instance order the list of items to be displayed in the Citizen Sensing Reports CSR in a sequence that is probably most adequate considering the immediate interest of the end users.

As noted a Citizen Sensor Platform CSP is an emerging paradigm in social computing research defined as a network of interconnected participatory citizens who provide observations or reports about events happening in a city. The objective is to instrument citizens and cities interconnect parties analyze related events and provide recommendation and feedback reports. One or more embodiments enhance the ability of citizen volunteers to provide such reports by dynamically updating the user interface s of reporting tool s on mobile computing device s used by such citizen volunteers.

CSM applications are software solutions deployed on end user s mobile computing devices that allow them to report situations on the spot. These reports generate Citizen Sensor Events CSE that mark situations such as security threats the occurrence of potholes pollution in creeks traffic jams problem in public illumination and the like. CSR are the combination of end users entered annotations with automated sensed information. These reports are transmitted to a remote server where the data is stored indexed and grouped. This information is used for running analysis and generating reports.

One or more embodiments advantageously take into account the result of the activities from the users and a ranking of such results in order to change the user interface. Furthermore one or more embodiments take into account environmental information a user profile and or a ranking of the topics to be reported or the items to be displayed in order to decide about adaptations in the interface.

In one or more embodiments the user interface of the user who reports incidents is adapted based on the impact of such incidents weather location and or time. One exemplary benefit of this solution is that users are able to find the type of incident more quickly in the user interface which is particularly important for emergency incidents.

One or more embodiments provide a system and method that maintains and or ranks lists of incidents or reporting items and displays them on a user interface provided for the client application of a Citizen Sensing Platform. Referring to a system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment includes a user interface provided for the client application of a Citizen Sensing Platform. The exemplary system includes one or more Mobile Computing Devices MC through such as smartphones or tablet computing devices used by end users refers generally to any such MC . Citizen Sensor Monitor CSM applications running on the MCs provide the interface to allow end users to report Citizen Sensor Events CSE which mark situations such as security threats the occurrence of potholes pollution in creeks traffic jams problems in public illumination and the like. The application creates Citizen Sensing Reports CSR by combining CSE with automated sensed information.

The exemplary system also includes a Remote Server RS running back end services related to the Citizen Sensor Platform CSP . The exemplary system still further includes a Telecommunication Infrastructure T as for example WiFi 3G 4G networks or any other form of wireless communication that allows for data communication between applications running on MCs through and RS .

CSP provides a set of services to provide a communication interface processing methods data repository Analytics methods and displaying methods as the back end services for CSE generated through CSM .

An exemplary method includes the User entering Citizen Sensor Events CSE by classifying events on the spot e.g. reports about broken lights road potholes and the like using one of the CSM applications running on one of the MC . The CSM augments the CSE with contextual information e.g. location user profile sensor data and the like thereby generating a CSR. The CSM packs the CSR in communication packets forming the data package d and transmits d to the CSP running on RS through the Telecommunication Infrastructure . The CSP implements a set of data interface modules MI that receive data packets d unpack the elements generating the data structures tuples t including for example 

incidentType is the type of incident e.g. car accident flooding incident requiring police response or the like 

The skilled artisan given the teachings herein will be able to implement the modules MI using a variety of techniques a non limiting example of a suitable technique is a webserver.

The CSP implements a set of data processing modules MP to process t by pre processing storing and classifying the information storing the raw and processed information into Data Repositories DR storing t as part of the set of tuples T. The skilled artisan given the teachings herein will be able to implement the modules MP using a variety of techniques. The pre processing step depends on the type of analysis that is to be conducted. For example potentially incorrect reports can be removed from the database by filtering out those that are clearly redundant e.g. two reports submitted by the same user in a very short period of time containing exactly the same information and those containing clearly wrong measurements e.g. reports associated with geographical coordinates located in the middle of the ocean . Storing modules depend on the particular embodiment. Classification criteria depend on the particular embodiment as well. By way of a non limiting example reports can be classified according to the frequency with which similar ones have been made and this is a task that can be accomplished with a simple cross relation of reports of same type associated to a certain restricted area during a certain period of time. More advanced embodiments may consider weighted reports where these weights stem e.g. from users reputations. The modules MP can thus be implemented in one or more embodiments as part of a system with a database.

The CSP implements a module referred to as MR in accordance with an embodiment of the invention which provides a technique to process data from DR generating a ranking list RL including the elements in response an inbounding request implementing the following steps 

Let wdenote the weight of event e for the user and idenote the impact of event e at the current time t and location l. More precisely assume vectors w and i are in R where E denotes the set of event types. Initially the technique computes the contextual weight of each event e which is denoted as c. The technique makes a simple normalization of the vectors i and w that is it computes vectors i and w such that and .

That is the e th coordinate of vector c is equal to the element of matrix w i at line e and column e.

Once vector c has been computed the list of event Types is sorted in descending order. An order number is assigned to each event type according to the results of this sorting procedure the element with highest contextual weight will be the first to appear on the list .

With continued reference to and by way of review and provision of additional detail Mobile Computing Device MC includes one or more suitable mobile computing devices such as smartphone or tablet computing device used by end users. Citizen Sensor Monitors CSM applications running on MC provide the interface to allow end users to report Citizen Sensor Events CSE that mark situations such as security threats the occurrence of potholes pollution in creeks traffic jams problem in public illumination and the like. The applications prepare Citizen Sensing Reports CSR by combining CSE with automated sensed information.

Remote Server RS runs back end services related to Citizen Sensor Platform CSP . Telecommunication Infrastructure T as for example WiFi 3G 4G networks or any other form of wireless communication allows for data communication between applications running on MC and RS.

Citizen Sensor Platform CSP includes a set of services to provide for example communication interface processing methods data repository analytics methods and displaying methods as the back end services for CSE generated through CSM . User s Incident Tuple List on the user side contains the list of incident types presented to the user through his or her device. Global Incident Tuple List on the server side contains the list of incident types and their respective impact factors according to time location and weather. The impact factor determines the importance of solving an incident type at a given time location weather and so on.

Referring now to the flow chart of on user side in event list setup receive updated list and or order of the incidents when the application running on the user device responsible for reporting the incidents starts and or at pre determined time intervals. In report incident step the user device reports the incident to the server . The monitor select the incident type adds optional details to the incident and submits the incident report.

On server side in setup incident configuration step receive a global tuple list of the incident types from an external source . Each database tuple of this list includes 

impact factor is a number that classifies how important is to solve the incident type at a given time location and weather.

In step wait incident list request wait for a user to request and or update the incident type list and send the list to the user.

In step receive report wait for a user reporting an incident. Receive from the user current time location and incidentID weather information is obtained from an external source in one or more embodiments .

In step refine incident configuration obtain the rank of the incidentType inside the list of incident types presented to the user and update user incident tuple list for that time location and weather in the server database of server . Then update the list in the user device as seen at when necessary.

One or more embodiments are useful in a variety of contexts. One or more embodiments are believed to be particularly pertinent in the context of users reporting incidents urgently. In this regard currently users may take a long time to go through a list of possible incidents e.g. flooding incidents requiring police attention car accidents brush fires and the like . Emergency situations typically require fast reporting actions. One or more embodiments advantageously provide a system and method to adapt the user interface e.g. of a remote device according to incident impact weather location and or time. One or more embodiments advantageously provide a ranking method and user interface adaptation based on the impact factor of solving an incident at a given time location and weather.

In the methodology was as follows. The context was defined from a list of possible contexts based on absolute counting of citizen reports. The target option was located at the middle of the list for the interface without the proposed technique while the target option was at the top of the list for the interface using a technique in accordance with an aspect of the invention. The reaction time is the average of ten executions per user per method.

View shows the screen with prioritization. The choices are the same and all are visible on the screen but they have been re ordered to put flooded area at the top as likely most important to this particular user based on the context.

The desired choice flooded area is not visible without scrolling the necessity for scrolling is indicated by the arrow labeled scroll. View shows the screen with prioritization. The choices are different catalog flora has been removed to put flooded area at the top as likely most important to this particular user based on the context.

Other exemplary applications could have different percentages of improvement the values depicted are non limiting and merely to illustrate to the skilled artisan what can be attained in some cases.

One or more implementations of the invention use software e.g. in memory which when loaded into RAM causes the processor to implement the logic described herein.

Input output I O block coupled to processor is indicative of a variety devices such as a touch screen keypad a display and so on. Memory is coupled to processor . Accelerometer coupled to processor detects acceleration of phone . Audio module coupled to processor includes for example an audio coder decoder codec speaker headphone jack microphone and so on. Optionally a command system for responding to voice commands via automatic speech recognition can be provided. Power management system can include a battery charger an interface to a battery and so on.

Given the discussion thus far it will be appreciated that in general terms an exemplary method according to an aspect of the invention includes the step of obtaining with a computer processor access to a sorted global tuple list of incident types. Each tuple of the global tuple list includes at least an incident identifier a corresponding incident type a corresponding context and a corresponding impact factor. The corresponding impact factor specifies the importance of solving the corresponding incident type in the corresponding context. Each tuple of the global tuple list is sorted by decreasing order of the impact factor. A further step includes obtaining at the computer processor context information for at least one remote computing device . A still further step includes based on the context information for the at least one remote computing device and the sorted global tuple list sending with the computer processor over a telecommunications infrastructure data which causes an incident reporting display on the remote computing device to be re ordered in accordance with the impact factors as they are ranked in accordance with the context information for the at least one remote computing device.

In at least some instances the three steps mentioned in the preceding paragraph are implemented via basic data retrieval operations conducted by an application such as a web server that has direct access to the databases e.g. containing the tuples and the context information. The application running on the device may send a UI update request to remote server and the server makes the data extraction using the necessary protocols given the teachings herein the skilled artisan who will be familiar with appropriate protocols per se will be able to select appropriate protocols to implement one or more embodiments computes the new UI and submits its parameters to the remote application .

Optionally a ranking step can be carried out by a ranking engine prior to the step of sending the data to the remote device. However in one or more embodiments the platform only needs the final results i.e. the ranks themselves and not the ranking application itself. One or more embodiments employ an appropriate ranking algorithm to sort the elements appearing on the UI other ranks can be directly from tables for example.

The data that causes the display to be re ordered can be sent periodically at predetermined times when a change is detected in the context of the remote computing device e.g. location weather when the CSM is first invoked on a device and so on.

In some instances an additional step includes obtaining with the computer processor access to an unsorted global tuple list of incident types. Each tuple of the unsorted global tuple list includes at least the incident identifier the corresponding incident type the corresponding context and the corresponding impact factor. A further step includes sorting the unsorted global tuple list by decreasing order of the impact factor to obtain the sorted global tuple list. In one or more embodiments the aspects discussed in this paragraph are implemented on the remote server which includes at least a database and a network server which can be implemented as a web server for instance .

In some instances the corresponding context for the tuples and the context information for the at least one remote computing device includes time location weather and optionally user profile. In some cases the location is obtained directly from the at least one remote computing device but the weather for the at least one remote computing device is obtained indirectly from an external source. In one or more embodiments the data mentioned in this paragraph are directly obtained by the client application or the operating system of client device through the device s sensors such as the GPS thermometer etc. and through the user s identification parameters that can be directly obtained by the application.

In one or more embodiments the computer processor obtains a plurality of incident reports from a plurality of external computing devices and the sorted global tuple is periodically updated list based on at least portions of the plurality of incident reports. In one or more embodiments one piece of the application is responsible for receiving the reports. For example the remote server may provide a RESTful application program interface API in order to offer this functionality automatically.

It is worth repeating that the ranking of the report items i.e. the changing of the order of the report items based on information about context and on the user s profile is a significant aspect of one or more embodiments. A suitable software module implementing this functionality is typically deployed on the remote server which has access to the required databases.
