title: Apparatuses, methods and systems for accessing a new customer service representative and for monitoring customer service
abstract: This disclosure details the implementation of methods, systems and computer program products for a customer satisfaction engine (CSE). Embodiments of the CSE allow callers to key in customer satisfaction data using a rating system and/or to change customer service representatives (CSR) during the course of a customer service call rather than after the call has ended. Caller generated ratings may be stored in a database in association with the respective CSR profile for later access, analysis, and/or review. CSE embodiments may also allow customers to log in to a website and view operations made by the CSR as a service call progresses. CSE systems may provide for improved customer service and allow companies improved efficiency, monitoring and reporting of CSR performance.

This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12 347 913 filed on Dec. 31 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 379 831 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Companies have customer service departments which employ customer service representatives CSR to provide support to customers. Typically customers call a toll free number to receive service and advice. Companies generally monitor the performance of their CSRs through customer satisfaction surveys. Following a call to a CSR often a customer will be asked to take a customer satisfaction survey. However a customer may opt not to take the survey depending on his own preference for taking surveys or the amount of time required.

The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and or detailed. As such a detailed discussion of reference number would be found and or introduced in . Reference number is introduced in etc.

This disclosure details the implementation of methods systems and computer program products for a Customer Satisfaction Engine hereinafter CSE . Customers making service calls may find their experience with the CSR unsatisfactory and or inefficient for a number of reasons. For example the customer may be subject to long wait times and or numerous transfers the customer may have to call back a number of times especially if the CSR lacks expertise to understand the customer s specific problem or the CSR may be rude. A customer s dissatisfaction reflects negatively on the company that the CSR represents and may result in a customer terminating the service. As for customer satisfaction surveys customers who opt out of taking surveys or surveys that are given after a long lag time may deprive companies of valuable customer feedback.

The CSE allows customers the freedom to promptly change to a new customer service representative CSR if they are unsatisfied with the customer service they are receiving. Embodiments will allow customers to press a key on the phone or if logged on to the customer service website click on a link to change representatives. Further some implementations will allow customers to monitor the progress of the call in real time on the website. Aspects of the invention will also allow customer satisfaction surveys to be integrated inconspicuously during the call itself rather than after the customer has hung up. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the CSE within the context of customer service. However it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily configured for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example aspects of the CSE can be configured to a wide variety of survey types and applications in which ratings or satisfaction data are used.

A CSR center comprising a plurality of CSRs may also communicate via a communications network with the CSE by means of a CSR interface . The CSR interface may receive relay and or process CSR actions and or activities for use analysis and or the like by CSE components and or affiliated entities. For example in one implementation the CSE may monitor CSR actions pertaining to a caller s service account e.g. registering a payment submitting an inquiry to another department etc. and relay that information for display to the caller via a web interface. Raw and or processed caller inputs such as ratings requests for new CSRs and or the like may also be relayed to a CSR center via the CSR interface . In one implementation the CSE may be incorporated within a CSR center and or integrated with CSR systems.

The CSE controller may be coupled to one or more operational modules configured to implement various features associated with embodiments of CSE operation. In one implementation the CSE controller may be coupled to a rating module configured to receive and process caller inputs pertaining to ratings and or other evaluations of CSRs call experiences and or the like. For example in one implementation when a caller presses a specific key one or more times the rating module may process a number of presses and or translates such presses into a satisfaction rating. At the end of a call but prior to hanging up the CSE may prompt the caller to enter additional satisfaction data. Satisfaction data may then be processed to update a CSR profile stored in a CSR profiles database . In various implementations satisfaction data may be stored in association with a particular CSR user call time date CSR center manager CSR center policy and or the like.

In one implementation the CSE controller may further be coupled to a switching module configured to effect transfer of a call from one CSR to another based on inputs received from a caller and or to receive and or assess caller reasons for requesting a new CSR. In one implementation a caller may press a predetermined key indicating that a new CSR is requested. The CSR controller may then cause the call with the first CSR to be ended and direct the call to a new CSR. Prior to speaking to the new CSR an interactive voice response system IVR may present an option to indicate satisfaction or dissatisfaction in addition to instructions for the caller to indicate his or her reason for requesting a new CSR. Depending on the options the customer chooses the call may be transferred to another representative through the communications network who may be the next available CSR or a CSR who is trained to handle specific scenarios.

In one implementation when a call is transferred information gathered by the first CSR along with any activities performed may be transferred to the second CSR along with the call. After speaking to the second CSR satisfaction ratings for the first and second CSR may be tallied and stored in association with the respective CSRs in a CSR profile database .

In one embodiment a caller may be logged into a customer service website such as via the caller interface that is configured to monitor the progress of the call in real time. For example the customer requesting support may type a customer identifier login password and or the like on the website and view the progress of their call. Further the CSE system may be linked to the operations being performed by the customer allowing the customer to provide feedback by watching the call as it progresses. The customer may also key in satisfaction ratings at various times during the call. A caller profile may also be stored such as in a caller profiles database allowing more efficient communication should the customer call for information at a later time.

In one implementation companies CSR centers and or other CSE affiliated agencies may impose an incubation period before a caller is allowed to select a new CSR. For example a caller may be required to talk to a particular CSR for at least 3 minutes before being provided with the opportunity to switch to another CSR by pressing a button on his or her telephone or clicking a link on a CSE web interface. In one implementation an indicator may be provided to the caller to signal that he or she may now switch CSRs if desired e.g. a tone a message and or the like . The number of times a customer may transfer to a new CSR may also be limited in some implementations. For example in one implementation a company operating a CSR service may choose to limit the transfer option to a maximum of 3 times. An attempt to transfer more than 3 times may be taken as an indication of a problem with the customer with the expertise of the CSRs involved and or the like and a record may be stored in association with a customer profile CSR profile and or the like indicating the problem. In either case the call may be transferred to a supervisor and or the caller may be presented with additional choices.

In a further implementation a company CSR center administrator CSE administrator and or the like may be provided access to CSR profiles and or the CSR profiles database such as to monitor ongoing customer service through a point system and or be used to generate CSR reports. Thus the system may establish a tracking mechanism to assess CSR performance. Furthermore the information may be shared among CSRs supervisors administrators management and or the like providing a mechanism and incentive to individually and collectively improve the performance of the CSRs. In one implementation CSR ratings may be stored in association with particular times and or dates at which the ratings were registered and or in association with particular call service policies that were implemented during the calls in which the ratings were registered. In this manner a CSR and or CSE administrator manager supervisor and or the like may discern the impact of a particular call service policy method technique and or the like on customer satisfaction levels.

After the instructions are given an indexing variable i may be initialized to 1 and a first CSR may be selected and or assigned to the call such as by selecting the CSR from a list of available CSRs . In one implementation selection of a CSR may be based on the type of call that is received e.g. the caller may be asked to specify a problem before CSR selection CSR expertise and or the like. The call with the first CSR proceeds and a determination may be made as to whether any updates have been implemented with respect to the caller s service account profile and or the like . In the course of the conversation between the caller and the CSR a wide variety of changes may be implemented to a caller s record to indicate such as for example removal of a mistaken charge correction of an error registration updates and or the like. If an update is implemented then the caller s account and or profile may be updated and updates may be published to a web interface for viewing by the caller thereby allowing the caller to monitor in real time the progress and or tangible consequences of the call.

A determination may then be made as to whether any from a pre determined set of caller actions have taken place such as but not limited to pressing one or more keys on a caller s telephone clicking a link on a web interface and or the like. If no action has taken place a determination may be made as to whether the call is complete e.g. that a CSR has indicated completion . If so then the CSE may end the call implement a post call survey hang up and or the like . Otherwise the call may proceed . If at a caller action is recognized then a determination may be made as to whether the caller action comprises a switch indicator i.e. an indication that the caller wishes to change to a different CSR . In one implementation a caller may be required to stay on with a particular CSR for a set period of time before being permitted to submit a switch indicator. If the caller action is not a switch indicator then the caller has submitted a rating indicator and the rating is registered and or stored in association with a CSR caller and or the like in a CSR profile caller profile and or the like . Ratings may be registered by a wide variety of different methods in different implementations such as but not limited to pressing a particular button or sequence of buttons on a telephone device clicking a link or entering a comment or numerical value via a web interface and or the like. In one implementation components of the PBX Asterisk platform may be employed for interpreting inputs. In some implementations recognizing caller actions may take place at any time after the caller talks to the CSR and or at any time after expiration of an incubation period.

In some implementations the CSE may admit various methods of assigning points and or otherwise registering ratings for consecutive CSRs. For example if a second CSR resolves an issue that a first CSR could not resolve the second CSR may be awarded additional positive ratings such as points lost by the first CSR.

In some implementations the CSE may provide access to CSR ratings in real time and or for various reporting and or monitoring purposes. For example in one implementation a CSR center administrator manager and or the like may be provided with CSR rating information at a monitoring terminal to permit real time viewing of CSR ratings for service calls in progress. In another implementation a CSR representative may aggregate rating information from CSR profiles to yield a rating report that may have ratings organized in a variety of different ways such as by CSR identifier time date call service policy caller department and or the like.

If the determination at indicates that a switch indicator has been submitted then the CSE may register and or store a record of the switch indicator in association with the CSR s profile . In one implementation the CSR may also receive a negative rating as a result of the switch indicator. In one implementation a caller may be provided with an interface screen to provide a reason for switching to a new CSR. A caller provided reason may then be stored in association with the caller CSR and or their respective profiles and later provided for display aggregation and or analysis by a supervisor or CSE system component. The indexing variable i may be incremented and a determination made as to whether the index exceeds a maximum threshold value for the number of times that a caller is allowed to switch CSRs . If the index has not equaled or exceeded the maximum then a new CSR is selected and or assigned at . Otherwise a warning message may be supplied to the caller that he or she has met or exceeded the maximum number of call transfers a negative rating and or other transfer excess indicator may be recorded in association with the caller and or in a caller profile the call may be transferred to a supervisor administrator and or the like.

Typically users which may be people and or other systems engage information technology systems e.g. commonly computers to facilitate information processing. In turn computers employ processors to process information such processors are often referred to as central processing units CPUs . A common form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative signals to enable various operations. Such communicative signals may be stored and or transmitted in batches as program and or data components facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction code signals may engage the CPU circuit components to perform desired operations. A common type of program is a computer operating system which commonly is executed by CPU on a computer the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Common resources employed in information technology systems include input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer memory storage into which data may be saved and processors by which information may be processed. Often information technology systems are used to collect data for later retrieval analysis and manipulation commonly which is facilitated through a database program. Information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.

In one embodiment the CSE controller may be connected to and or communicate with entities such as but not limited to one or more users from user input devices peripheral devices a cryptographic processor device and or a communications network .

Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients servers and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term server as used throughout this disclosure refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting clients. The term client as used herein refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer other device program or combination thereof that facilitates processes information and requests and or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a node. Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a router. There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks LANs Pico networks Wide Area Networks WANs Wireless Networks WLANs etc. For example the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.

The CSE controller may be based on common computer systems that may comprise but are not limited to components such as a computer systemization connected to memory .

A computer systemization may comprise a clock central processing unit CPU a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM and or an interface bus and most frequently although not necessarily the foregoing are interconnected and or communicating through a system bus . Optionally the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally a cryptographic processor and or a global positioning system GPS component may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and provides a base signal. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of signals embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative signals may further be transmitted received and the cause of return and or reply signal communications beyond the instant computer systemization to communications networks input devices other computer systemizations peripheral devices and or the like. Of course any of the above components may be connected directly to one another connected to the CPU and or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.

The CPU comprises at least one high speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and or system generated requests. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as AMD s Athlon Duron and or Opteron IBM and or Motorola s PowerPC IBM s and Sony s Cell processor Intel s Celeron Itanium Pentium Xeon and or XScale and or the like processor s . The CPU interacts with memory through signal passing through conductive conduits to execute stored signal program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such signal passing facilitates communication within the CSE controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount of speed parallel mainframe and or super computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively should deployment requirements dictate greater portability smaller Personal Digital Assistants PDAs may be employed.

The power source may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells alkaline lithium hydride lithium ion lithium polymer nickel cadmium solar cells and or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells in one embodiment the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the CSE thereby providing an electric current to subsequent components. In one example the power source is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment an outside power source is provided through a connection across the I O interface. For example a USB and or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.

Interface bus es may accept connect and or communicate to a number of interface adapters conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards such as but not limited to input output interfaces I O storage interfaces network interfaces and or the like. Optionally cryptographic processor interfaces similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed such as but not limited to Accelerated Graphics Port AGP Card Bus Extended Industry Standard Architecture E ISA Micro Channel Architecture MCA NuBus Peripheral Component Interconnect Extended PCI X PCI Express Personal Computer Memory Card International Association PCMCIA and or the like.

Storage interfaces may accept communicate and or connect to a number of storage devices such as but not limited to storage devices removable disc devices and or the like. Storage interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to Ultra Serial Advanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface Ultra Serial ATA PI Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics E IDE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 1394 fiber channel Small Computer Systems Interface SCSI Universal Serial Bus USB and or the like.

Network interfaces may accept communicate and or connect to a communications network . Through a communications network the CSE controller is accessible through remote clients e.g. computers with web browsers by users . Network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to direct connect Ethernet thick thin twisted pair 10 100 1000 Base T and or the like Token Ring wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11a x and or the like. A communications network may be any one and or the combination of the following a direct interconnection the Internet a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet OMNI a secured custom connection a Wide Area Network WAN a wireless network e.g. employing protocols such as but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol WAP I mode and or the like and or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further multiple network interfaces may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast multicast and or unicast networks.

Input Output interfaces I O may accept communicate and or connect to user input devices peripheral devices cryptographic processor devices and or the like. I O may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to Apple Desktop Bus ADB Apple Desktop Connector ADC audio analog digital monaural RCA stereo and or the like IEEE 1394a b infrared joystick keyboard midi optical PC AT PS 2 parallel radio serial USB video interface BNC coaxial composite digital Digital Visual Interface DVI RCA RF antennae S Video VGA and or the like wireless and or the like. A common output device is a television set which accepts signals from a video interface. Also a video display which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube CRT or Liquid Crystal Display LCD based monitor with an interface e.g. DVI circuitry and cable that accepts signals from a video interface may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Typically the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface e.g. an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable etc. .

User input devices may be card readers dongles finger print readers gloves graphics tablets joysticks keyboards mouse mice remote controls retina readers trackballs trackpads and or the like.

Peripheral devices may be connected and or communicate to I O and or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces storage interfaces and or the like. Peripheral devices may be audio devices cameras dongles e.g. for copy protection ensuring secure transactions with a digital signature and or the like external processors for added functionality goggles microphones monitors network interfaces printers scanners storage devices video devices video sources visors and or the like.

It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed the CSE controller may be embodied as an embedded dedicated and or monitor less i.e. headless device wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.

Cryptographic units such as but not limited to microcontrollers processors interfaces and or devices may be attached and or communicate with the CSE controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller commonly manufactured by Motorola Inc. may be used for and or within cryptographic units. Equivalent microcontrollers and or processors may also be used. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16 bit multiply and accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512 bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents as well as allow for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of CPU. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include VLSI Technology s 33 MHz 6868 or Semaphore Communications 40 MHz Roadrunner .

Generally any mechanization and or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However memory is a fungible technology and resource thus any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the CSE controller and or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on chip CPU memory e.g. registers RAM ROM and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration memory will include ROM RAM and a storage device . A storage device may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum a fixed and or removable magnetic disk drive a magneto optical drive an optical drive i.e. CD ROM RAM Recordable R ReWritable RW DVD R RW etc. an array of devices e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID and or other devices of the like. Thus a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.

The memory may contain a collection of program and or database components and or data such as but not limited to operating system component s operating system information server component s information server user interface component s user interface Web browser component s Web browser database s mail server component s mail client component s cryptographic server component s cryptographic server the CSE component s and or the like i.e. collectively a component collection . These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non conventional program components such as those in the component collection typically are stored in a local storage device they may also be loaded and or stored in memory such as peripheral devices RAM remote storage facilities through a communications network ROM various forms of memory and or the like.

The operating system component is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the CSE controller. Typically the operating system facilitates access of I O network interfaces peripheral devices storage devices and or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant scalable and secure system such as Apple Macintosh OS X Server AT T Plan 9 Be OS Unix and Unix and Unix like system distributions such as AT T s UNIX Berkley Software Distribution BSD variations such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and or the like Linux distributions such as Red Hat Ubuntu and or the like and or the like operating systems. However more limited and or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS IBM OS 2 Microsoft DOS Microsoft Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millennium NT Vista XP Server Palm OS and or the like. An operating system may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or the like. Most frequently the operating system communicates with other program components user interfaces and or the like. For example the operating system may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. The operating system once executed by the CPU may enable the interaction with communications networks data I O peripheral devices program components memory user input devices and or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the CSE controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the CSE controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction such as but not limited to multicast TCP IP UDP unicast and or the like.

An information server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as but not limited to Apache Software Foundation s Apache Microsoft s Internet Information Server and or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts Java JavaScript Practical Extraction Report Language PERL Hypertext Pre Processor PHP pipes Python WebObjects and or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as but not limited to File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS Secure Socket Layer SSL messaging protocols e.g. America Online AOL Instant Messenger AIM Application Exchange APEX ICQ Internet Relay Chat IRC Microsoft Network MSN Messenger Service Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol PRIM Internet Engineering Task Force s IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE open XML based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP i.e. Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance s OMA s Instant Messaging and Presence Service IMPS Yahoo Instant Messenger Service and or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System DNS resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the CSE controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example a request such as http 123.124.125.126 myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request 123.124.125.126 resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the myInformation.html portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information myInformation.html. Additionally other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports e.g. FTP communications across port and or the like. An information server may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the information server communicates with the CSE database operating systems other program components user interfaces Web browsers and or the like.

Access to the CSE database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below e.g. CGI and through inter application communication channels as enumerated below e.g. CORBA WebObjects etc. . Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the CSE. In one embodiment the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and or fields. In one embodiment the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join select commands based on the tagged text entries wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the CSE as a query. Upon generating query results from the query the results are passed over the bridge mechanism and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.

Also an information server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels gearshifts and speedometers facilitate the access operation and display of automobile resources functionality and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes cursors menus scrollers and windows collectively and commonly referred to as widgets similarly facilitate the access operation and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources functionality and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces GUIs such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System s Aqua IBM s OS 2 Microsoft s Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millennium NT Vista i.e. Aero XP or Unix s X Windows e.g. which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment KDE mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment GNOME provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.

A user interface component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by with and or atop operating systems and or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display execution interaction manipulation and or operation of program components and or system facilities through textual and or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect interact with and or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the user interface communicates with operating systems other program components and or the like. The user interface may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

A Web browser component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit or greater encryption by way of HTTPS SSL and or the like. Some Web browsers allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Java JavaScript ActiveX web browser plug in APIs e.g. FireFox Safari Plug in and or the like APIs and or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs cellular telephones and or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the Web browser communicates with information servers operating systems integrated program components e.g. plug ins and or the like e.g. it may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. Of course in place of a Web browser and information server a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users user agents and or the like from the CSE enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.

A mail server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as but not limited to sendmail Microsoft Exchange and or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET CGI scripts Java JavaScript PERL PHP pipes Python WebObjects and or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as but not limited to Internet message access protocol IMAP Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI Microsoft Exchange post office protocol POP3 simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and or the like. The mail server can route forward and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent relayed and or otherwise traversing through and or to the CSE.

Access to the CSE mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and or the operating system.

Also a mail server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests information and or responses.

A mail client component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail Microsoft Entourage Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Outlook Express Mozilla Thunderbird and or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols such as IMAP Microsoft Exchange POP3 SMTP and or the like. A mail client may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the mail client communicates with mail servers operating systems other mail clients and or the like e.g. it may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests information and or responses. Generally the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.

A cryptographic server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU cryptographic processor cryptographic processor interface cryptographic processor device and or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and or decryption requests by the cryptographic component however the cryptographic component alternatively may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric e.g. Pretty Good Protection PGP encryption and or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as but not limited to digital certificates e.g. X.509 authentication framework digital signatures dual signatures enveloping password access protection public key management and or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous encryption and or decryption security protocols such as but not limited to checksum Data Encryption Standard DES Elliptical Curve Encryption ECC International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Message Digest 5 MD5 which is a one way hash function passwords Rivest Cipher RC5 Rijndael RSA which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman Secure Hash Algorithm SHA Secure Socket Layer SSL Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS and or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols the CSE may encrypt incoming and or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network VPN with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of security authorization whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content e.g. employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the CSE component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the CSE and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems i.e. it may act as a client and or server of secured resources. Most frequently the cryptographic component communicates with information servers operating systems other program components and or the like. The cryptographic component may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The CSE database component may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component which is executed by the CPU the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional fault tolerant relational scalable secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field i.e. the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely they uniquely identify rows of a table on the one side of a one to many relationship.

Alternatively the CSE database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. Such data structures may be stored in memory and or in structured files. In another alternative an object oriented database may be used such as Frontier ObjectStore Poet Zope and or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and or linked together by common attributes they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the CSE database is implemented as a data structure the use of the CSE database may be integrated into another component such as the CSE component . Also the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures objects and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases e.g. tables may be exported and or imported and thus decentralized and or integrated.

In one embodiment the database component includes several tables . A CSR Profiles table may include fields such as but not limited to CSR ID CSR name contact info rating ID s rating value s switching history expertise hours CSR center supervisor and or the like. A Caller Profiles table may include fields such as but not limited to caller ID login password caller name contact info telephone number hardware ID mobile device type service account ratings switching history CSR ID s warnings call history and or the like. A Ratings table may include fields such as but not limited to rating ID rating type rating values usage rules and or the like. These tables may support and or track multiple entity accounts on the CSE controller.

In one embodiment the CSE database may interact with other database systems. For example employing a distributed database system queries and data access by search CSE component may treat the combination of the CSE database an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.

In one embodiment user programs may contain various user interface primitives which may serve to update the CSE. Also various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the CSE may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers i.e. individual database controllers for each of the above tables . Employing standard data processing techniques one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and or storage devices. Similarly configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and or distributing the various database components . The CSE may be configured to keep track of various settings inputs and parameters via database controllers.

The CSE database may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the CSE database communicates with the CSE component other program components and or the like. The database may contain retain and provide information regarding other nodes and data.

The CSE component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment the CSE component incorporates any and or all combinations of the aspects of the CSE that was discussed in the previous figures. As such the CSE affects accessing obtaining and the provision of information services transactions and or the like across various communications networks.

The CSE component is configurable to access calculate engage exchange generate identify instruct match process search serve store and or facilitate service call handling customer service representative switching and rating customer service representative and caller profile management and or the like and use of the CSE.

The CSE component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as but not limited to Apache components Assembly ActiveX binary executables ANSI Objective C C and or .NET database adapters CGI scripts Java JavaScript mapping tools procedural and object oriented development tools PERL PHP Python shell scripts SQL commands web application server extensions WebObjects and or the like. In one embodiment the CSE server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The CSE component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the CSE component communicates with the CSE database operating systems other program components and or the like. The CSE may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The structure and or operation of any of the CSE node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. Program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the CSE controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA local and remote application program interfaces Jini Remote Method Invocation RMI process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. Again the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.
