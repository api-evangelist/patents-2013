The present technology was developed with Government support under Contract No. DE FC26 05NT42643 awarded by the Department of Energy. The Government may have certain rights in the claimed inventions.

The contents of commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 13 711 250 filed Dec. 11 2012 and titled ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER COATINGS AND METHODS THEREFOR are incorporated herein by reference.

The present technology generally relates to coating systems and methods suitable for protecting components exposed to high temperature environments such as the hostile thermal environment of a turbine engine. More particularly this technology is directed to an Environmental Barrier Coating EBC on a silicon containing region of a component and to the incorporation of surface features in the silicon containing region to inhibit creep displacement of the EBC when subjected to shear loading at elevated temperatures.

Higher operating temperatures for turbine engines are continuously sought in order to increase their efficiency. Though significant advances in high temperature capabilities have been achieved through formulation of iron nickel and cobalt base superalloys alternative materials have been investigated. Ceramic composite materials are currently being considered for such high temperature applications as combustor liners vanes shrouds blades and other hot section components of turbine engines. Some examples of ceramic composite materials include silicon based composites for example composite materials in which silicon silicon carbide SiC silicon nitride SiN and or a silicide serves as a reinforcement phase and or a matrix phase.

In many high temperature applications a protective coating is beneficial or required for a Si containing material. Such coatings should provide environmental protection by inhibiting the major mechanism for degradation of Si containing materials in a water containing environment namely the formation of volatile silicon hydroxide for example Si OH products. A coating system having these functions will be referred to below as an environmental barrier coating EBC system. Desirable properties for the coating material include a coefficient of thermal expansion CTE compatible with the Si containing substrate material low permeability for oxidants low thermal conductivity stability and chemical compatibility with the Si containing material.

The silicon content of a silicon containing bondcoat reacts with oxygen at high temperatures to form predominantly an amorphous silica SiO scale though a fraction of the oxide product may be crystalline silica or oxides of other constituents of the bondcoat and or EBC. The amorphous silica product exhibits low oxygen permeability. As a result along with the silicon containing bondcoat the silica product that thermally grows on the bondcoat is able to form a protective barrier layer.

The amorphous silica product that forms on a silicon containing bondcoat in service has a relatively low viscosity and consequently a high creep rate under shear loading. High shear loads e.g. from about 0.1 to 10 MPa can be imposed by g forces e.g. from about 10 000 to about 100 000 g s resulting from high frequency rotation of moving parts such as blades buckets of turbine engines. Such shear loading may cause creep displacements of the EBC relative to the bondcoat and substrate which can result in severe EBC damage and loss of EBC protection of the underlying substrate.

The present technology provides an environmental barrier coating EBC system and a method of fabricating the EBC system on an article formed of a silicon containing material such as a ceramic matrix composite CMC in which a silicon containing material serves as a reinforcement phase and or a matrix phase. The EBC system and method are particularly well suited for protecting silicon containing articles exposed to high temperatures including the hostile thermal environment of a turbine engine.

According to one example of the technology an article comprises a silicon containing region at least one outer layer overlying a surface of the silicon containing region and a constituent layer i.e. a thermally grown oxide or TGO layer on the surface of the silicon containing region and between and contacting the silicon containing region and the at least one outer layer the constituent layer being at least partially formed by constituents of the silicon containing region and being susceptible to creep within an operating environment of the article wherein the bondcoat and or substrate defines a plurality of channels and a plurality of ridges that interlock within the plurality of channels are formed in the silicon containing region to physically interlock the at least one outer layer with the silicon containing region through the constituent layer.

By interlocking the silicon containing region with an initial layer of the environmental barrier coating system displacement of the EBC attributable to creep of the constituent layer for example a silica layer that thermally grows on the silicon containing region or layer can be substantially inhibited thereby promoting the structural integrity of the environmental barrier coating system and its ability to protect the article in high temperature applications. The technology is applicable to use with known environmental barrier coating materials and the interlocking features can be produced using various processes.

The present technology is generally applicable to components that operate within environments characterized by relatively high temperatures stresses and oxidation. Notable examples of such components include high and low pressure turbine vanes nozzles and blades buckets shrouds combustor liners augmentor hardware and other hot section components of turbine engines though the technology has application to other components.

Referring to an article or component for example a turbine bucket or blade may include an Environmental Barrier Coating EBC system to protect the article or component when operated in a high temperature chemically reactive environment. The component may include a substrate for example an airfoil section extending from a platform . The platform may include a mounting and securing structure configured to mount and secure the component to a rotating element such as a rotor not shown . The substrate may include a silicon containing region. Examples of silicon containing materials include those with a silicon carbide silicon nitride a silicide for example a refractory metal or transition metal silicide including but not limited to for example Mo Nb or W silicides and or silicon as a matrix or second phase. Further examples include ceramic matrix composites CMC that contain silicon carbide as the reinforcement and or matrix phase.

The EBC system of represents one of a variety of different EBC systems shown as being directly applied to a surface of the substrate . A silicon containing bondcoat is disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 299 988. The bondcoat is further represented as bonding a first EBC layer to the substrate and optionally at least one additional layer of the EBC system . The EBC system provides environmental protection to the underlying substrate . It may also reduce the operating temperature of the component thereby enabling the component to operate at higher gas temperatures than otherwise possible. While represents the component as including the silicon containing bondcoat in which case the first EBC layer is deposited directly on a silicon containing surface region formed by the bondcoat the technology is also applicable to a component that does not include a bondcoat as described herein in which case the first EBC layer may be deposited directly on a silicon containing surface region formed by the substrate . It should be appreciated that a constituent layer or a portion of the constituent layer described in more detail below may be present prior to application of the first EBC layer .

Degradation of a silicon containing material in a combustion environment results in reaction with water vapor to form volatile silicon hydroxide for example Si OH products. The EBC system may serve to resist recession by chemical reaction of the bondcoat and or substrate with water vapor provide a temperature gradient to reduce the operating temperature of the component or both. Suitable EBC systems usable with the present technology include but are not limited to those disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 296 941 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 410 148. The EBC system may perform a multitude of sealing reaction barrier recession resistance and or thermal barrier functions.

As noted above each of the bondcoat and substrate may define a surface region of the component that contains silicon. For example the bondcoat may comprise or consist essentially of elemental silicon. Alternatively the bondcoat may contain silicon carbide silicon nitride metal silicides elemental silicon silicon alloys or mixtures thereof. Bondcoat may further contain oxide phases such as silica rare earth silicates rare earth aluminosilicates and or alkaline earth aluminosilicates. The use of silicon containing compositions for the bondcoat improves oxidation resistance of the substrate and enhances bonding between the substrate and first EBC layer . The silicon of the bondcoat reacts with oxygen at elevated temperatures to thermally grow the constituent layer of predominantly amorphous silica SiO on its surface as schematically represented in . The resulting thermally grown oxide of amorphous silica exhibits low oxygen permeability. As a result along with the silicon containing bondcoat the constituent layer is able to deter permeation of oxygen into the bondcoat and substrate . During growth of the constituent layer some of the amorphous silica may crystallize into crystalline silica and additional impurity elements and second phases can be incorporated therein.

In the absence of the silicon containing bondcoat the first layer of the EBC system can be deposited directly on a silicon containing surface region of the component defined by the substrate in which case the substrate is formed to have a composition whose silicon content is sufficient to react with oxygen at elevated temperatures and form a silica rich constituent layer described above. Furthermore depending on the composition of the substrate this layer may be a predominantly amorphous silica product a silica rich glass or a multi phase mixture wherein at least one of the phases is silica rich. As a matter of convenience the remaining disclosure will make reference to embodiments that include the bondcoat as represented in though the disclosure should be understood to equally apply to a constituent layer that forms on the surface of the substrate .

The constituent layer that forms on the silicon containing bondcoat or another silicon containing surface region such as the substrate during high temperature service may grow to thicknesses of up to about 50 m or more depending on the application. The constituent layer may have a relatively low viscosity and consequently a high creep rate under shear loading that can be imposed by g forces that occur during rotation of components such as blades buckets of turbine engines. As a result of creep of the constituent layer displacements of the overlying EBC system relative to the substrate can exceed 100 mm over 25 000 hours service at about 1315 C. about 2400 F. . Such large creep displacements can result in severe damage to the EBC system and direct loss of environmental protection of the underlying substrate .

Referring to creep of the constituent layer that forms on the silicon containing bondcoat or in the absence of the bondcoat on the surface of the substrate may be inhibited by providing the surface of the bondcoat with surfaces or features configured to mitigate creep of the constituent layer . As shown in the surface features may take the form of ridges that are formed by processes described in co pending commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 14 068 840 entitled METHODS OF MANUFACTURING SILICA FORMING ARTICLES HAVING ENGINEERED SURFACES TO ENHANCE RESISTANCE TO CREEP SLIDING UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURE LOADING the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Each ridge may include a leading edge that forms a leading edge channel between the first layer of the EBC system and the ridge . It should be appreciated that the terms leading and trailing are for illustrative purposes only to describe the relative relationships of the edges with respect to a direction in which a shear loading may be applied to the EBC system for example by rotation of the article .

Each ridge may also include a trailing edge that defines a trailing edge channel between the first layer of the EBC system and the ridge . Each ridge may further include a top edge that defines a channel between the ridge and the first layer of the EBC system . It should be appreciated that the use of the term top is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to connote any particular orientation of the edge with respect to the substrate or the component or article .

The formation or growth of the constituent layer forms a channel between the bondcoat and the first layer of the EBC system . The channel may include the leading edge channel and the trailing edge channel formed between the leading edge and the trailing edge of the ridge respectively and the first layer of the EBC system . The channel may further include the connecting channel extending from the leading edge channel to the trailing edge channel that is defined between the top surface of the ridge and the first layer of the EBC system .

As shown in application of a shear loading to the article e.g. by rotation of the component may cause a viscous shear of the constituent layer which may be an amorphous silica product a silica rich glass or a multi phase mixture wherein one of the phases is silica rich glass. The viscous shear of the constituent layer results in a flow of the constituent layer along the channel and accelerated oxidation of the leading edge of the ridge . Continued operation i.e. rotation of the component in a gas turbine results in continued growth of the constituent layer viscous shear and flow of the oxide from the leading edge through the channel and oxidation of the leading edge of the ridge of the bondcoat . As shown in the oxidized leading edge of the ridge and the first layer of the EBC system may nearly contact after operation and narrow the channel to limit the creep of the EBC system .

Referring to the ridge of the bondcoat may have a height or amplitude H and a wavelength L. Although only one ridge is shown in referring to it should be appreciated that the bondcoat may include ridges of height H and wavelength L in a direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation acceleration to mitigate creep sliding of the EBC system over the bondcoat and or substrate . As discussed further the dimensions of the ridges are determined to provide sufficient sliding resistance as required to complete a service interval e.g. 25 000 hours for a spinning component.

The constituent layer may have a thickness h that varies from a leading edge thickness hto a trailing edge thickness h. The thickness hof the constituent layer will vary during use of the component as the bondcoat continues to oxidize during operation of the turbine. The flow of the constituent layer during operation may be modeled using an analytical model or Finite Element Analysis FEA . In the models a balancing of forces relates channel pressures to the applied shear stress and the Poiseuille flow relates the channel flow velocities to the channel pressures. The principle of volume conservation relates channel flow velocities to a sliding velocity of the EBC system . These principles provide the relationship between the sliding velocity and the applied shear stress.

The results of the models are shown in which depicts the leading edge thickness hand the trailing edge thickness hof the constituent layer and the resulting sliding displacement s m of the EBC system for the conditions shown and a shear stress of 0.25 MPa. As shown in the sliding displacement s of the EBC system becomes oxidation rate limited as opposed to SiOcreep rate limited and the sliding closely tracks about half the difference in oxide thicknesses on the ridge walls. As shown in the creep of the EBC system as a result of shear on the constituent layer requires both the amplitude and wavelength of the surface features to meet a minimum requirement.

Referring to the engineered surface of the bondcoat or substrate may include a plurality of ridges that are provided substantially perpendicular to the direction of shear loading . The ridges may have a wavelength L and a span W that defines a of W L. The may be from about 0.1 to about 0.9 for example from about 0.2 to about 0.8 for example about 0.4 to about 0.6. Although the ridges are shown as being generally square in cross section and extending substantially perpendicular to the shear loading direction i.e. in a substantially chordwise direction it should be appreciated that the engineered surfaces i.e. ridges may have other cross sectional shapes e.g. rectangular trapezoidal or any generally sinusoidal or wavy shaped configuration. Although the examples show the features perpendicular to the shear stress the features ay be provided at an angle to the shear loading direction e.g. up to about 45 to the shear loading direction. It should also be appreciated that although the engineered surfaces are shown as periodic and continuous the surfaces may be non periodic and or non continuous. It should further be appreciated that the engineered surfaces may be provided as sets of intersecting surfaces e.g. diamond shaped that may be up to 45 .

The ridges may have a height of from about 10 to about 250 m for example about 50 to about 200 m for example about 75 to about 1250 m for example about 100 m though the dimensions may depend on the maximum anticipated thickness of the constituent layer and other factors associated with the particular application. The ridges may have a wavelength L of from about 20 to about 10 000 m and particularly about 50 to about 2 000 m or for example about 250 to about 1 000 m. The constituent layer thickness hmay be from about 4 to about 40 m.
