This application is a divisional of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 292 957 filed on Nov. 9 2011 which is a continuation of U.S. patent Ser. No. 12 147 284 filed on Jun. 26 2008 the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

Text data may be expressed in a multitude of human understandable languages human languages that implement different human writing systems to communicating content. For example while the Chinese language uses numerous text characters to express content human languages using Latin text characters may reuse common text characters that are combined phonetically and arranged in different ways to express content. An application that makes use of text data expressed in a human language may support multiple human languages that utilize different human writing systems to express the underlying content. However the application may be inefficient when accounting for the multitude of human languages.

Script detection service techniques are described. In an implementation corpora of text is analyzed to determine which strings in the corpora of text are to be included in a targeted dictionary that is usable for language detection services. The targeted dictionary is populated with a strings that are individually associated with a human language. The plurality of strings include individual text characters associated with values that correspond to a particular subset of values in a table that associates subsets of values with individual human writing systems.

In an implementation a system includes a linguistic service to analyze a corpora of text to determine which strings in the corpora of text are to be included in a targeted dictionary that is usable for language detection services. The linguistic service populates the targeted dictionary with a strings that are individually associated with a human language. The plurality of strings include individual text characters associated with values that correspond to a particular subset of values in a table that associates subsets of values with individual human writing systems.

In an implementation one or more computer readable media comprise instructions that are executable by a computer to analyze a corpora of text to determine which strings in the corpora of text are to be included in a targeted dictionary that is usable for language detection services. The instructions are further executable to populate the targeted dictionary with a strings that are individually associated with a human language. The plurality of strings include individual text characters associated with values that correspond to a particular subset of values in a table that associates subsets of values with individual human writing systems.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The terms service and or module for instance may refer to system s computer readable instructions e.g. one or more computer readable storage media having executable instructions and or procedure s as permitted by the context above and throughout the document.

Traditionally an application making use of text data includes one or more services to perform functions with the text data. For example a word processing application may include a spelling service that checks the text data to ensure that the text data conforms to a human language. Applications making use of text data may be complex as a multitude of human languages exist and human languages implement a wide variety of human writing systems and conventions to express content. Consequently operation of an application interacting with human text may be inefficient as the application accounts for the multitude of human languages and human writing systems.

Script detection service techniques are described. In an implementation a determination is made as to which human writing system is associated with individual text characters in a string of one or more text characters. For example the determination may include scanning values representing individual text characters in a string. A designation may be made to associate a particular human writing system with the string based on the determination as to which human writing system is associated with values representing the individual text characters in the string.

In an implementation a range of positions in a text for the one or more characters are indicated. For example a communication may be formed that associates the particular human writing system with the range of positions in the text occupied by the one or more characters included in the string.

When more than one human writing system is associated with the individual text characters included in the string the particular human writing system may be a language that incorporates text characters from a base human language. For example when a string includes a first text character that is Chinese and a second text character that is Japanese the string may be designated as Japanese as the Japanese language incorporates Chinese text characters.

In one or more embodiments script detection techniques may be employed as an independent service or may be implemented as part of language detection service techniques. Further discussion of script detection techniques may be found in relation to and .

Language detection service techniques are also described. In an implementation a determination is made as to which human writing system is associated with text characters represented by values in a string. For example values representing text characters in a string may be scanned to determine which human writing system is associated with the text characters forming the string. When the values are associated with more than one human writing system the string is compared to a targeted dictionary to identify a particular human language associated with the string. In further implementations a human language associated with a text including the string is assigned based on the string. For example the string may be compared with the targeted dictionary to identify whether the text including string is to be assigned for example the English language. Further discussion of language detection techniques may be found in relation to and .

In another implementation the human language associated with the string is ascertained based on a substring in the string. For example the word riding may be parsed to the suffix ing so that the English language is associated with the word riding .

In a further implementation selection of which strings included in the targeted dictionary are to be used for comparison may be based on the determination. For example when the string includes Latin text characters Latin based strings in the targeted dictionary may be considered e.g. English French German or Italian.

In the following discussion an Example Environment is first described that may employ script detection and or language detection service techniques. The Example Environment is discussed with respect to interacting with an application through a platform. While example techniques systems and approaches are generally described in in other implementations the script detection service and or language detection service may be implemented in other environments and configurations. Discussions related to other linguistic services are included to highlight interactions between a script detection service a language detection service the platform one or more applications other linguistic services and so on. Example Procedures are also described that may be employed in the example environments as well as in other environments. Although these systems and techniques are described as employed in a computing environment in the following discussion it should be readily apparent that these structures modules techniques and approaches may be incorporated in a variety of environments without departing from the spirit and scope thereof In addition while text and text data are discussed the methods techniques approaches service modules and so on may be configured to implement other encoded information. For example a service may be configured to recognize property information for a video file.

The linguistic services may include modules e.g. subservices to perform specific functions for a linguistic service. For example the proofing service may include a spelling module and a grammar module and so on.

While the computer is illustrated as including a processor and memory the processor and or the memory may be representative of one or more devices e.g. the processor may be representative of a plurality of central processing units. Processor s are not limited by the materials from which they are formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein. For example processor s may be comprised of semiconductor s and or transistors e.g. electronic integrated circuits ICs that execute instructions to provide the application and or linguistic services . Sample processor mechanisms may include but are not limited to quantum computing optical computing mechanical computing e.g. using nanotechnology and so on.

Although one memory is illustrated a wide variety of types and combinations of memory may be employed such as random access memory RAM read only memory ROM hard disk memory removable medium memory and other types of computer readable media. The memory for example may be used to store instructions used by the processor s to provide the application and or linguistic services .

The computer is illustrated as executing an operating system on the processor s which is also storable in the memory . The operating system may be representative of functionality to abstract underlying functionality of the computer . The operating system may for example provide a foundation for the application and or linguistic services to be executed on the computer without having to know the specific configuration of the computer e.g. which particular kind processor is employed by the computer amounts of memory and so on.

The platform may broker communication between the application and the linguistic services . For example the platform may be configured to broker communications passing through the platform such that the linguistic services are obscured from the application . By obscuring the linguistic services from the application the linguistic services may be changed or added without encoding the change or the addition into the application s code. In this manner the linguistic services may be independent from the application . For example instead of configuring a first linguistic service to function for a specific application the first linguistic service may be formed so that multiple applications may implement the first linguistic service e.g. individual instances of the first linguistic service. Additional aspects of the platform and associated benefits are discussed with respect to sample communication sessions between the application and the linguistic services .

In one or more embodiments a service manager may be included in the computer . The service manager may be representative of functionality to expose a way for users to manage the platform and or the linguistic services . For example when a user installs a new linguistic service the service manager may be used to manage a plugin process to override a previously installed service. Thus for example when a new proofing service is installed the service manager may be used to manage the platform and or the linguistic services so that text data for proofing is communicated to the new proofing service rather than a previous proofing service.

Referring to when initiating communication the platform may designate which linguistic services in system are available for use by the application e.g. a communication application based on a property of the linguistic service e.g. a service property. For example during an enumeration phase the platform may designate that the spelling property and a phone lookup property are available through the platform rather than designating that the proofing service and the communication service are available for use by the application . By designating linguistic services based on service properties the platform may obscure e.g. conceal the linguistic service providing the function to the application and vice versa . As a result the application may not be configured for a particular service in order to implement the functionality provided by the particular linguistic service. Although a service property is discussed in one or more instances multiple service properties may be implemented.

For example in response to receiving an application program interface API call the platform may designate the linguistic services available for use by the application . The platform may designate that a particular linguistic service is available based on a service property of the particular linguistic service. In this way the application may not be tied to the particular linguistic service e.g. the linguistic services may be decoupled from the application and the platform may designate the available linguistic services without the application issuing an API call specifying the particular linguistic service e.g. an API call for the communication service . Moreover the application may use a limited number of API calls in comparison to issuing API calls tied to linguistic services.

In one or more embodiments the application may specify that linguistic services are to be designated based on a service property specified in the API call. The application may prescreen e.g. filter which linguistic services are to be designated by specifying which service properties are relevant to the application . For example a word processing application may specify that a spelling functionality is to be designated by issuing an API call specifying a spelling property. Accordingly the platform may not designate the communication service because a phone lookup property was not specified in the API call. Having described designating linguistic services communication and recognizing linguistic property information are now discussed.

Referring to once the linguistic services are designated the application in a system may send a text to a designated linguistic service for recognition. For example the platform may broker communication of the text to the designated linguistic services. The platform for example may route or direct the text to the proofing service .

The designated linguistic services may recognize linguistic property information associated with text data in the text . For example one of the linguistic services may associate linguistic property information with text data within range of the text e.g. 8 bytes of data that start at a position 20 bytes into the text .

Consider for example a session occurring between the application e.g. communication application having the text the proofing service and the communication service . As illustrated the text may include a telephone number 5558675309 and the word cel. The platform may for example broker communication of the text by directing the text to the proofing service .

Upon receiving the text the proofing service may recognize linguistic property information associated with text data within a range of the text and return linguistic property information to the application . For example the proofing service may recognize that the word cel is misspelled e.g. cel is not in a dictionary and that the word cel is an improper spelling of the word cell. As a result the proofing service may populate the memory e.g. property bag with the linguistic property information indicating that the text data is misspelled and the text data is the word cell. The proofing service may associate the foregoing linguistic property information with a range occupied by the word cel in the email message. For example the word cel may start at position 51 and go for three units in the text .

In the case of the communication service upon receiving the text e.g. an email message the communication service may recognize that text data 5558675309 is a telephone number e.g. the text data within the range occupied by 5558675309 corresponds to a telephone number. The range for the telephone number may for example start at position 55 in the text and have a length of 10 units. In response to recognizing the text data as a telephone number a phone lookup module may populate the memory with caller identification information associated with the telephone number e.g. Jenny and associate a range starting at position 55 with the term Jenny .

With the linguistic property information in the memory the platform may communicate the text data property information. For example the proofing service may store the linguistic property information cell in memory until the communication service has recognized the telephone number at which time the word cell and the caller identification information Jenny may be communicated to the application .

When the text data within the range has been altered e.g. the text has been deleted or modified since the associated linguistic property information was stored in memory the platform may release the memory storing the linguistic property information. For example the platform may permit deletion or overwriting of a portion of the memory storing the linguistic property information when the associated text data has been altered.

In one or more embodiments the linguistic services may be configured to interact with other linguistic services through the platform . For example the language detection service may be used to designate the text data as for example German before requesting that a German proofing service spell check the text data. In the foregoing situation the language detection service may return the recognized linguistic property information e.g. the text data is German through the platform to the German proofing service. In another example the proofing service may request that the language detection service identify which human language is associated with the text data and return the linguistic property information result to the proofing service .

In some implementations the linguistic services may be configured to form a callback to the application upon recognizing the linguistic property information. For example the proofing service may form and send the application a callback that indicates that the memory has been populated with linguistic property information. In response the application may instruct the platform to communicate the linguistic property information.

In another implementation the linguistic services output the linguistic property information in a format indicated by the application . For example as part of initiating a session the application may indicate that the proofing service is to return the linguistic property information in hypertext markup language HTML format. In other implementations the linguistic service may return multiple versions of the linguistic property information e.g. as Unicode text and HTML. In further embodiments the linguistic services may output linguistic property information in a format specific to one or more applications to accommodate interrelated applications.

In one or more embodiments the linguistic services may indicate that an action is associated with the text data within a range of the text. For example the communication service may indicate that text data 5558675309 is a telephone number and or prompt the user via a user interface to initiate the communication service to dial the telephone number . Having discussed techniques approaches interactions and functions associated with linguistic services and the platform the script detection service and the language detection service will be discussed in depth.

Referring to as illustrated a system includes the script detection service and the language detection service having a frequency module . As described with respect to the script detection service and or language detection service may be independent from the application implementing the functions supported by the language detection service .

While the script detection service may be described at times as being included in the language detection service it is to be apparent that the script detection service may be used independently. In some instances for example the script detection service may be used independently to minimize the processing overhead associated with detecting which human language is associated with a text. For example the script detection service may be used to indicate what font choices are to be offered in a particular editing scenario.

The script detection service is representative of functionality to determine which human writing system is associated with text characters in a string of one or more text characters e.g. a string in question or the in question string based on values representing the text characters. With the values the script detection service may designate which human writing system is associated with the string including the text characters. For example the script detection service may determine that the text characters c a t are Latin text characters by scanning the values representing the text characters c a t 444. The script detection service may use a table that associates values with human writing systems in making the determination. For example the table may indicate that when the values are within a first subset of values the string is Chinese while when the values are in a second subset of values the string is Thai. The script detection service may make this determination e.g. the text characters are Latin based on the values assigned to the text characters c a t . For example in the Unicode standard the values representing the characters c a t are within a Latin text character subset of values.

While the Unicode standard e.g. Unicode 5.1 is discussed with respect to the script detection service and or the language detection service other standardized encoding systems are available e.g. ASCII and so on to handle text data in computing type environments. Unicode is promulgated by the Unicode Consortium which is a non profit organization Unicode Inc. Mountain View Calif. .

In the Unicode standard individual text characters are assigned numerical values that uniquely represent the text character. For example the script detection service may designate that a word in a processing document is Chinese by scanning the Unicode values representing the text characters in the word.

The script detection service may indicate that a range of positions within the text for the one or more text characters included in the string. For example the script detection service may form a communication including the linguistic property information for the string e.g. the particular human writing system and the range within the text occupied by the text characters included in the string. The range may be expressed as a starting position for the string and a length of the string e.g. starting position 43 and 5 bytes long.

In some instances the script detection service may determine the values representing the text characters are unique to a single human writing system. For example when the script detection service determines text characters in a string are Thai based on the values the script detection service may designate that the string is Thai and send this linguistic property information to the application e.g. the text characters are Thai because no other human writing system implements Thai characters.

In instances in which the values represent text characters that are associated with more than one human writing system the script detection service may forward this linguistic property information e.g. the text characters are Cyrillic to the frequency module . When the values representing text characters in the string are Latin text characters the script detection service may indicate this linguistic property information to the frequency module . The frequency module may use the linguistic property information e.g. the text characters are Latin to narrow which strings in a targeted dictionary are to be considered when comparing the string in question to the targeted dictionary including a plurality of strings.

In other instances when more than one human writing system is associated with the string in a text the script detection service may designate a particular human writing system is associated with the string when a first human writing system is based on another human writing system. For example the script detection service may designate that a string including Japanese and Chinese characters is Japanese because some text characters in Japanese are based on Chinese text characters. In additional instances the script detection service may forward the string in question to the language detection service to associate a human language with the designation of the particular human writing system.

In one or more embodiments the script detection service may indicate that a service is available to perform a function. For example having designated that a string is Cyrillic the script detection service may indicate that a Russian spelling service is available to check to see that the string is spelled properly. As should be apparent the techniques approaches structures and so on employed by the script detection service may be implemented as part of or in conjunction with the language detection service discussed further below .

Referring to as illustrated the language detection service includes the frequency module which is representative of functionality to identify a particular human language associated with the string e.g. an in question string and or a text including the string by comparing the string to a targeted dictionary . For example a targeted dictionary may contain a plurality of strings e.g. words that are associated with a human language and that frequently occur in the human language in comparison to other strings. While words are described in some instances a string may be a combination of words such as Memorial Day. In another example a string may be a word along with punctuation for example while the string the may appear in a word e.g. them the word the with a space may be considered. Exemplary human languages may include French German Chinese English Italian Spanish Dutch and so on. For example the frequency module may compare the string with a plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary to identify which human language corresponds with the text and or string in question.

In some implementations what strings in the targeted dictionary are considered may be selected based on one or more of the values representing the text characters in the string. For example when the script detection service determines that the values represent Latin based text characters the script detection service may inform the frequency module so that strings using Latin text characters in the targeted dictionary are used for comparison. In this way the frequency module may not consider strings in the targeted dictionary that are associated with other human writing systems.

Having discussed use of the targeted dictionary sample techniques are now discussed for populating the targeted dictionary before discussing the use of the targeted dictionary in depth. While the construction and use of a targeted dictionary are discussed with respect to the language detection service it is to be apparent that the targeted dictionary may be used in different environments and independently of the language detection service .

The targeted dictionary may be populated with a plurality of strings that are individually associated with a human language. Strings may be associated with a human language for example because the string frequently occurs in the human language the string is indicative of the human language the string s role in the human language e.g. does the string serve a function in the human language and so on. In one or more embodiments the plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary may be assigned a weight according to the string s association with the language e.g. is the string unique to the language. What strings are to be in the targeted dictionary may be decided by analyzing corpora of text e.g. a significant sampling of text in the human language.

In one or more embodiments the targeted dictionary may include strings such as words that serve functions in the language e.g. determiners prepositions conjunctions connectors or pronouns. Exemplary determiners include but are not limited to an a some each the der die and das determiners in English German . Exemplary prepositions include but are not limited to of in on by and to. Exemplary connectors include but are not limited to and or but and if. Exemplary pronouns include but are not limited to he she it they and her. The foregoing strings may be used because of the string s role in the language e.g. a preposition indicates a relationship between items.

In some implementations how frequently a string appears in the corpora of text may be used to assign a weight to the string in the targeted dictionary . For illustration sample frequency weights may be on a 0 10 scale less than one percent 0 one percent 2 one to three percent 4 three to four percent 6 four to five percent 8 and five percent or greater 10 . The word she for example made be assigned a greater weight than another word as the word she frequently appears in English language text.

When weighing strings in the targeted dictionary a string s association with the human language may be considered as part of populating the targeted dictionary . For example some strings may be in the targeted dictionary even though the string occurs less frequently in comparison to other strings because the string is indicative of the human language e.g. linguistically distinct to the human language. For example an indicative string may not appear in other human languages e.g. related human languages.

When the targeted dictionary contains weighted strings individual strings may be assigned a weight based on how indicative the string is of the human language. For example the word the may be given more weight for the English language in comparison to the word or because the word or appears in both French and English. Exemplary weightings based on linguistics may include but are not limited to weights are expressed in the range from minus two through plus two a string is unique to one human language 2 a string is included corpora of text for a second human language but in targeted dictionary for second human language 1 a string is in corpora for less than two other human languages 0 a string is in corpora for between two to four other human languages 1 and a string is in corpora for more than four other languages 2 .

In some implementations the plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary may be weighted based on the length of the string e.g. a number of text characters in the string. When comparing the strings the and what the word what may be assigned a higher weight as the word what includes four text characters while the word the includes three text characters. Exemplary weightings based on a number of text characters in a string may include but are not limited to from minus one to add two one text character 0 two text characters 1 three text characters no change four text characters 1 and five or more text characters 2 .

In one or more embodiments strings in the targeted dictionary may be assigned an overall weight based on one or more of whether the string serves a function in the human language how frequently the string occurs in the human language the linguistic distinctiveness of the string and so on.

An overall number of strings in the targeted dictionary may be based on which human languages are included. For example a targeted dictionary including a plurality of strings for the English language may include more strings than for another human language based on the frequency and or linguistic distinctiveness of the included strings. The overall number of strings in the targeted dictionary may be selected based on other considerations such as an expected processing time processing overhead and so on associated with comparing a string in question to the plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary . For example the targeted dictionary may include approximately 300 or less strings for a human language. While additional strings beyond approximately 300 or less strings may be included in the targeted dictionary populating the targeted dictionary with 300 or less strings may permit accurate language detection while minimizing an overall amount of time to compare the string in question to the plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary .

When a human language does not have a sufficient amount of text to conduct analysis or when obtaining sample text is impractical the analysis of another human language may be used to predict which strings from an under represented language are to be in the targeted dictionary . For example a targeted dictionary for a human language may include function words from the under represented language based on an analysis of another human language e.g. a related human language. For example rather than analyzing Kyrgyz text a written language using modified Cyrillic and Arabic scripts the targeted dictionary may be populated with strings representing function words in Kyrgyz. Having described populating the target dictionary use of the targeted dictionary is now described.

When using the targeted dictionary with weighted strings a human language associated with the text including one or more in question strings may be weighed as part of identifying the particular human language associated with the in question string or the text including the in question string. Consider for example the in questions strings in the text e.g. sentence What does le roi des autres poisons mean When comparing the in question strings forming the text the frequency module may identify the particular human language by scoring the weighted values for the strings in the text. For example the frequency module may identify the text What does le roi des autres poisons mean as English by summing the weighted values for the strings in the sentence. Thus if the strings are assigned the following values What 5 does 2 le 4 des 2 the sentence is identified as English even though the text includes the French words le roi des autres poisons. 

When identifying the particular language the frequency module may be configured to check the first text character in the string in question and lookup whether the targeted dictionary includes a string that begins with the first text character. For example when the script detection service forwards this is Latin to the frequency module the targeted dictionary may be selected to include an English table including a plurality of strings for English a German table including a plurality of strings for German and so on.

When the first text character in the string is not in the targeted dictionary e.g. in the English or German tables the frequency module may ignore the string and consider a second string when identifying which human language is associated with the text. When the first character in the in question string is in both the English and German tables a second text character may be considered and so on. When the string in question is apple the first three characters may be considered when the English word apple is in the English table and the word apfel or another word starting with the text characters ap is in the German table. After eliminating German as a potential human language the frequency module may confirm the string is apple and the English language is identified. As a result the frequency module may follow a binary tree approach when comparing the in question string to the plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary.

In some embodiments when text and or string in question are associated with more than one language the language detection service may communicate an ordered list of the human languages to the application . For instance in the What does le roi des autres poisons mean example the linguistic property information may be 1 English and 2 French.

In one or more embodiments the language detection service includes a morphology module . The morphology module is representative of functionality to ascertain the human language associated with the string based on a substring. Some strings include substrings e.g. suffixes or prefixes that are indicative of a human language. For example the suffix ing e.g. a gerund form of a word may be associated with the English language. The morphology module may ascertain the human language associated with the string even though the whole string is not in the targeted dictionary . While for example the frequency module may not identify the string playing because the string playing is not in the targeted dictionary the morphology module may ascertain the string playing is associated with the English language based on the suffix ing which is parsed from playing .

In some implementations the language detection service includes a punctuation module . The punctuation module is representative of functionality to identify which human language is associated with the string in question and or the text by examining punctuation in the text. For example in the sentence What does le roi des autres poisons mean the punctuation module may associate the text and or in questions strings with the English language by examining one or more of blank spaces e.g. no text character capitalized text characters punctuation marks and so on.

In additional implementations the frequency module the morphology module and or the punctuation module may be used in a serial configuration in parallel configuration and so on. In other embodiments the frequency module may be used while the morphology module and the punctuation module may be used if one or more of the text or the string is of a certain size or if the frequency module returns a tie e.g. two human languages are identified.

The components service modules functions and techniques discussed above may be implemented singly or in combination based on design preference. Generally any of the modules services and functions described herein can be implemented using software firmware hardware e.g. fixed logic circuitry manual processing or a combination of these implementations. The terms module functionality and logic as used herein generally represent software firmware hardware or a combination thereof. Additionally functions can be embodied as executable instructions that are included in one or more computer readable storage media.

The following discussion describes transformation procedures that may be implemented utilizing the previously described structures modules approaches and techniques. Aspects of the procedures may be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks.

An API call requesting one or more linguistic services based on a property of the linguistic services is issued block . In one or more embodiments the API call specifies which service properties the application wants to use. In other instances the API call may be a general request to interact with the linguistic services available through the platform .

Responsive to the API call the linguistic services that are available are designated block . For example the platform may designate the linguistic services that have a service property specified in the API call e.g. a spelling property are available to recognize linguistic property information associated with text data. The designation of the linguistic service based on one or more service properties may obscure the linguistic services from the application and vice versa . In the foregoing manner the application may not be specifically configured for the linguistic service . For example instead of designating the proofing service the platform may designate the proofing service based on a spelling property and a grammar property. In addition this approach may minimize the number of different APIs used by the application in comparison to issuing API calls for a linguistic service.

In some embodiments the platform may obtain the property of the linguistic service from the linguistic service in response to receiving the API call block . In other embodiments the platform may have the property of the linguistic service as the linguistic service may be a plugin to the platform .

In one or more embodiments the API call may indicate that the linguistic service is to output linguistic property information in a particular format. For example the application may request that linguistic property information is to be output in HTML format.

Once a session is initiated the text including text data may be communicated through the platform block . For example the platform may broker communication of text e.g. the email message block passing through the platform. The platform may for example direct communications between the application and or linguistic services . In some embodiments the platform may broker communications between linguistic services performing functions for the application . For example the grammar service and the language detection service may communicate through the platform .

Linguistic property information associated with text data in a text is recognized block . For example the communication service may recognize linguistic property information associated with text data within a range of text communicated from the application through the platform .

Upon recognizing linguistic property information associated with text data the linguistic property information may be communicated to the application block . For example the linguistic service may populate the memory with the linguistic property information associated with text data. The text data information may be stored in the memory until the platform communicates block the linguistic property information to the application.

In one or more embodiments a callback may be formed block for communication to the application block . For example when the application is configured for a synchronic communication the linguistic service may form the callback to inform the application that recognition is complete.

In some embodiments when an action is associated with the text data the recognized linguistic property information may include an indication e.g. an actionlD that the linguistic service may perform the action block . For example if an email address is recognized in a word processing document the communication service may indicate that the linguistic service can send an email message to the email address.

With the linguistic property information block the application may initiate the action block for performance by the service block . In the previous word processing document example the application may display a user interface that permits initiation of the action e.g. create an email message targeting the email address.

A determination is made as which human writing system is associated with individual text characters in a string of one or more characters block . For example the determination may be made by scanning values representing the individual characters to check the values against a table that associates subsets of values with individual human writing systems. For example while Latin text characters are within a first subset of values Chinese text characters may be within a second subset of values. Thus when scanning the string c a t against the table the determination may yield human writing systems using Latin text characters.

A designation as to which particular human writing system is associated with the string may be based on the human writing systems associated with the individual text characters in the string block . When the text characters in the string are associated with for example Korean the string may be designated as Korean. In the case of a string including Korean text characters the determination may be definitive as no other human writing system uses Korean text characters.

When the string includes text characters that are associated with a base language and text characters that are associated with a language that incorporates text characters from the base language e.g. a child language the child language may be identified. When a string includes both Chinese text characters and Japanese text characters in some instances the string may be designated as Japanese. In other examples language detection techniques may be used to break the tie. 

In one or more embodiments an indication may be made as to which range of positions within the text are occupied by the text characters block and a communication may be formed that associates the range of positions with the particular human writing system block . For example the communication may include the linguistic property this is Chinese text along with the range of positions occupied by the Chinese text characters in the string. In some instances this communication may be returned to the application via the platform and or may be forwarded to a service e.g. the language detection service .

In some instances the method may include indicating the availability of a service to perform a function associated with the characters in the string based on the particular language block . Thus when the string is designated as Thai a Thai spell checker may be indicated.

As discussed with respect to a determination may be made as to which human writing system is associated with text characters in an in question string based on values representing the text characters . As a result the human writing system associated with the text characters in the in question string may be determined by scanning the values representing the text characters. For example Latin text characters are in a first set of values while Chinese text characters are in another set of values. The determination of the human writing system associated with the text characters may be definitive for some human writing systems e.g. Korean as no other human writing system makes use of Korean text characters . In other instances the values may represent text characters that are common to more than one language e.g. Latin text characters are used by German Spanish French and so on.

The human writing system associated with the string by the determination may be used to select which strings in the targeted dictionary are to be considered when comparing the in question string to a targeted dictionary . While the targeted dictionary may include strings associated with a multitude of human languages the in question string may not be compared to some of the strings in the targeted dictionary because the strings are associated with human languages that do not match the text characters used in the in question string.

When the values are associated with more than one human writing system a comparison of the string in question with the targeted dictionary is preformed to identify the human language corresponding to the string in question and or the text including the string. For example the string may be compared to the targeted dictionary to identify the human language that is associated with the text and or the string in question. For example an individual string in the targeted dictionary may be associated with a single human language. The comparison a may be done on a weighted basis such as by weighing the string included in the text. The contents of the targeted dictionary and populating the targeted dictionary with a plurality of strings are discussed with respect to .

In some implementations the human language associated with the string in question and or text may be ascertained from a substring in the string block . For example the human language associated with the string is ascertained by parsing a prefix or a suffix in the string. By ascertaining the human language from a substring in the in question string the human language associated with the string may be discovered even though the string was not identified based on the string itself. In further instances this approach may be used to confirm the identification based on comparing the string to the plurality of strings in the targeted dictionary . By ascertaining which human language is associated with the string based on the substring the number of strings used to identify which human language is associated with the text may be reduced in comparison to not considering a substring in the string. For example this may shorten the length of a sentence that can be identified.

In additional implementations an examination is performed to identify which human language is associated with the text and or the in question string from punctuation included in the text block . For example in the sentence What does le roi des autres poisons mean the punctuation module may associate the text and or included strings with the particular language by examining one or more of blank spaces e.g. no text character capitalized text characters punctuation marks and so on.

An assignment may be made as to which human language is associated with the text based on the particular language associated with the string in question block . In the What does le roi des autres poisons mean example the text e.g. the sentence is assigned the English language from the comparison of the strings in question with the targeted dictionary.
