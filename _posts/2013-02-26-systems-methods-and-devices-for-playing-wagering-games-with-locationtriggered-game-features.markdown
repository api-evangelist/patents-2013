This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 745 868 which was filed on Dec. 26 2012 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 700 028 which was filed on Sep. 12 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their respective entireties.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present disclosure relates generally to wagering games as well as wagering game terminals and gaming systems. More particularly aspects of the present disclosure relate to systems methods computer programs and devices for playing wagering games with game features that are triggered by the location of a mobile gaming device.

Gaming terminals such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Thus gaming manufacturers continuously strive to develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.

One concept that has been successfully employed to enhance the entertainment value of a game is the concept of a secondary or bonus game that may be played in conjunction with a primary or basic game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game either similar to or completely different from the basic game which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome in the basic game. Generally bonus games provide a greater expectation of winning than the basic game and may also be accompanied with more attractive or unusual video displays and or audio.

Another concept that has been employed is the use of progressive jackpots. In the gaming industry a progressive jackpot involves collecting coin in data from participating gaming device s such as slot machines contributing a percentage of that coin in data to a jackpot amount and awarding that jackpot amount to a player upon the occurrence of a jackpot winning event. A jackpot winning event typically occurs when a progressive winning position is achieved at a participating gaming device. If the gaming device is a slot machine a progressive winning position may for example correspond to alignment of progressive jackpot reel symbols along an active payline. The initial progressive jackpot is a predetermined minimum amount. That jackpot amount however progressively increases as players continue to play the gaming machine without winning the jackpot. Further when several gaming machines are linked together such that several players at several gaming machines compete for the same jackpot the jackpot progressively increases at a much faster rate.

Interactive online gaming allows players to gamble from locations remote from casinos and other traditional gaming establishments. For example a player may access a gaming web site on a global computer network such as the Internet from a computing device communicatively coupled to the global computer network. The computing device may for example be a personal computer Internet appliance personal digital assistant PDA or wireless telephone i.e. cell phones . In a typical online wagering game scenario a player must first acquire internet connectivity open a web browser on their computing device access the host website navigate the website to locate the desired wagering game and supply personal and financial information e.g. credit or debit card account information before the player is permitted to engage in any wagering activity. Wagers are then deducted from the player s account and payouts for winning outcomes are added to the account. Additional information regarding online gaming can be found for example in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7 722 466 B2 to Wayne H. Rothschild which issued on May 25 2010 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.

The processes and interfaces required for online gaming can oftentimes be confusing and time consuming to the player. Moreover the player must wait until they are granted access by the host website before they are permitted to engage in any online wagering game activities. There are also security risks associated with conducting electronic transactions over the internet especially when the player is accessing a new and unfamiliar host website. These issues are exacerbated by gaming conducted wirelessly with portable computing and cellular devices such as PDA s tablets and smartphones which typically have less processing power reduced internet connectivity smaller display screens and smaller QWERTY keyboards than their desktop counterparts and are more susceptible to theft and tampering than personal desktop computers. For the foregoing and other reasons there is a need for improved online and wireless gaming features that reduce the complexity and time required to engage in game play provide enhanced security protection and or are more amenable to gaming conducted wirelessly with portable computing and cellular devices. Such new features will further enhance player excitement perpetuate player loyalty and thus increase game play and profitability to hosts and operators.

Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to wagering games with location based gaming features that are automatically triggered or otherwise activated by the location and or relative proximity of a mobile gaming device carried by a player. In one representative implementation a dedicated software application is provided for a user s portable computing device or handheld cellular device. The dedicated software application can be configured to display a map with indicators of local hotspots within a predetermined surrounding area of the user. Each of these hotspots represents a distinct location based gaming feature. As one example each location based gaming feature is a specific reel spin triggering event for a slot type wagering game. When the user and thus the user s portable computing device handheld cellular device is physically located at or is determined to be within a predetermined proximity of a hotspot the dedicated software application will automatically initiate the corresponding reel spin triggering event. In some embodiments the reel spin triggering event is initiated without requiring an input from the user. In this instance the dedicated software application may alert the user when the reel spin triggering event is initiated. Optionally a player may initiate the reel spin triggering event for example by checking in at a hotspot location. In this instance the location based feature would then be triggered automatically upon check in but in some embodiments it would not automatically trigger as soon as the hotspot is detected. The reel spin triggering event may operate to provide the player with a randomly determined outcome of the slot game.

In accord with an optional configuration the user s outcome for the play of the slot type wagering game can be compared to the outcomes for other user s at that hotspot or within a predetermined proximity of that hotspot. In this regard the user s outcome can be added to a leader board. Optionally the outcome of that individual game can be tied to an online social network game such as those offered by FACEBOOK . In this regard the leader board can be posted and viewed on the social network website and the user can be awarded with bonus games or game enhancements sometimes referred to as power ups for use with the online social network game depending for example on the how long the user remains at the top of the leader board. This same concept can be applied to group gameplay where a team of users collects location based gaming features and for example the outcomes of all of the collected spins of the team during a specified period are posted to a group team leader board.

The CPU operate s to execute a wagering game program causing the primary display area or the secondary display area to display the wagering game.

In response to receiving a wager the reels are rotated and stopped to place symbols on the reels in visual association with paylines such as paylines . The wagering game evaluates the displayed array of symbols on the stopped reels and provides immediate awards and bonus features in accordance with a pay table. The pay table may for example include line pays or scatter pays. Line pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear along an activated payline typically in a particular order such as left to right right to left top to bottom bottom to top etc. Scatter pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear anywhere in the displayed array without regard to position or paylines. Similarly the wagering game may trigger bonus features based on one or more bonus triggering symbols appearing along an activated payline i.e. line trigger or anywhere in the displayed array i.e. scatter trigger . The wagering game may also provide mystery awards and features independent of the symbols appearing in the displayed array.

In accord with various methods of conducting a wagering game on a gaming system in accord with the present concepts the wagering game includes a game sequence in which a player makes a wager and a wagering game outcome is provided or displayed in response to the wager being received or detected. The wagering game outcome is then revealed to the player in due course following initiation of the wagering game. The method comprises the acts of conducting the wagering game using a gaming apparatus such as the gaming terminal depicted in following receipt of an input from the player to initiate the wagering game. The gaming terminal then communicates the wagering game outcome to the player via one or more output devices e.g. primary display or secondary display through the display of information such as but not limited to text graphics static images moving images etc. or any combination thereof. In accord with the method of conducting the wagering game the CPU transforms a physical player input such as a player s pressing of a Spin Reels touch key into an electronic data signal indicative of an instruction relating to the wagering game e.g. an electronic data signal bearing data on a wager amount .

In the aforementioned method for each data signal the CPU e.g. CPU is configured to process the electronic data signal to interpret the data signal e.g. data signals corresponding to a wager input and to cause further actions associated with the interpretation of the signal in accord with computer instructions relating to such further actions executed by the controller. As one example the CPU causes the recording of a digital representation of the wager in one or more storage media e.g. storage unit the CPU in accord with associated computer instructions causing the changing of a state of the storage media from a first state to a second state. This change in state is for example effected by changing a magnetization pattern on a magnetically coated surface of a magnetic storage media or changing a magnetic state of a ferromagnetic surface of a magneto optical disc storage media a change in state of transistors or capacitors in a volatile or a non volatile semiconductor memory e.g. DRAM etc. The noted second state of the data storage media comprises storage in the storage media of data representing the electronic data signal from the CPU e.g. the wager in the present example . As another example the CPU further in accord with the execution of the instructions relating to the wagering game causes the primary display other display device or other output device e.g. speakers lights communication device etc. to change from a first state to at least a second state wherein the second state of the primary display comprises a visual representation of the physical player input e.g. an acknowledgement to a player information relating to the physical player input e.g. an indication of the wager amount a game sequence an outcome of the game sequence or any combination thereof wherein the game sequence in accord with the present concepts comprises acts described herein. The aforementioned executing of computer instructions relating to the wagering game is further conducted in accord with a random outcome e.g. determined by an RNG that is used by the CPU to determine the outcome of the game sequence using a game logic for determining the outcome based on the randomly generated number. In at least some aspects the CPU is configured to determine an outcome of the game sequence at least partially in response to the random parameter.

As shown the gaming system and network includes a first plurality of gaming terminals A D located in a first land based or brick and mortar gaming establishment A e.g. the Cosmollagio Casino and a second plurality of gaming terminals E H located in a second land based or brick and mortar gaming establishment B e.g. the Mandalay Rock Hotel . Also included are a variety of personal mobile computing devices represented herein by a laptop computer A and a mobile phone with a built in mobile computing platform or smartphone B which are remote from either of the gaming establishments A and B. Each of the gaming establishments A B utilizes a local casino server A and B respectively which is communicatively coupled to a corresponding communications hub A B. The local servers A B individually collectively and or in collaboration with an offsite central server system not shown can offer a plurality of wagering games in such categories as slots poker bingo keno and blackjack just to name a few examples.

The land based gaming establishments A B including one or more of the gaming terminals A H are shown linked to the mobile computing devices A B by a reconfigurable multi site computer network such as an intranet an extranet the Internet or a combination thereof. The mobile computing devices A B which are remote from any land based gaming establishment may communicatively connect with proper authorization to one or more of the local servers A B and or gaming terminals A H via the network . In so doing one or more of the wagering games that are available on the local servers A B may be conducted via either the gaming terminals A H and or or the mobile computing devices A B. Although differing in appearance the gaming terminals A H can be similar in function and connectivity to the gaming terminal discussed above with respect to . The gaming terminals A H of can take on various configurations including free standing gaming machines handheld gaming machines countertop gaming machines personal computers or laptop computers or any combination thereof.

The network in at least some embodiments can typically carry TCP IP protocol communications and HTTP HTTPS requests made by a web browser and associated responses and replies and the connection between client software and a server can be communicated over such TCP IP networks. Some non limiting examples of networks that can serve as the communications network include a wireless or wired Ethernet based intranet a local or wide area network LAN or WAN and or the global communications network known as the Internet which can be configured to accommodate many different communications media and protocols.

When a wagering game is conducted via one of the gaming terminal A H the wagering game may be conducted at a server level a terminal level or a hybrid server terminal level depending for example upon how the machine and the system are set up. Likewise when a wagering game is conducted via one of the mobile computing device A B the wagering game may be conducted at a server level or a hybrid server device level depending for example upon how the device and the system are set up. When the wagering game is conducted at the server level the game s audiovisual content and game software are executed for example at one of the local casino servers A B. In this case the gaming terminals A H and or mobile computing devices A B need not include a game engine for executing the game software and primarily serve as a display device. To allow the terminals A H and or computing devices A B to execute the audiovisual content and game software this information is downloaded or otherwise communicated from a local casino server A B to the terminal A H or device A B and stored locally prior for conducting the wagering game. When the wagering game is conducted at the hybrid level the audiovisual content is executed at the terminal A H or device A B while the game software is executed at the server A B. To allow the terminal A H or device A B to execute the audiovisual content the audiovisual content is downloaded from the server A B and stored locally on the gaming device prior to conducting the wagering game. In order to make wagering games conducted via a mobile computing device A B verifiable it may be required that the random event be generated at the server A B. Thus in some embodiments wagering games may not be conducted solely at the device level. Other embodiments may be configured to offer this functionality.

The gaming terminals A H can also be networked to each other and a server A B by the network . The gaming terminals A H in each land based gaming establishment A B can be linked by a high speed local area network such as a wireless or wired Ethernet. Each local area network can be configured to support standard Internet protocols such as TCP IP for transmitting data over the local area network and transmitting data between the local area network and a local system A B. The local casino server A B may include a gateway that serves as an entrance to the local area network. The gateway can be associated with a router which knows where to direct a given packet of data that arrives at the gateway and a switch which furnishes the actual path in and out of the gateway for a given packet. The communications hub A B can consolidate data transferred to and from the gaming terminals A H. A workstation not shown may be used to program control and or monitor the gaming terminals A H at the local casino level.

As indicated above the mobile computing devices A B can include dedicated standalone application software e.g. a mobile app to conduct any or all of the herein disclosed location based gaming features. The dedicated application software can be implemented in various forms. For instance the dedicated application software can be in the form of a web based e.g. Java applet that is downloaded to the mobile computing device and runs in conjunction with a web browser on the mobile computing device. Optionally the dedicated application software can be in the form of a standalone software application which can be implemented in a multi platform language such as .Net or Java or in native processor executable code. If executed on the mobile computing devices A B the dedicated application software can be operable to open a network connection with the gaming servers over the communications network and thus communicates via that connection with the servers A B. In some embodiments the dedicated application software communicates with a single host or client server which in turn conducts any necessary communications with one or more third party servers to complete a particular transaction. Optionally the dedicated application software and web browser can be part of a single client server interface where the software can be implemented as a plug in to the web browser for example. Other optional variations and known alternatives are considered to be within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.

Referring now to wherein like reference numerals refer to like components from the other views the gaming system includes a wagering game server that exchanges information with a mobile computing device via a network . For instance the mobile computing device also referred to herein as mobile device or gaming device and the wagering game server are communicatively coupled together through the network . In this example the mobile device can function as a handheld wagering game machine. The mobile device can take on various forms including a laptop computer a smartphone e.g. the Apple IPHONE or the Samsung GALAXY S III a personal digital assistant PDA e.g. the HP IPAQ ENTERPRISE Handheld PDA or the PALM TUNGSTEN E2 Handheld PDA a tablet computer e.g. the Samsung GALAXY TAB tablet device and the Apple IPAD tablet device and an e reader e.g. the KINDLE electronic reader device as some non limiting examples. It may be desirable in some preferred embodiments for the mobile device to be an internet capable cellular enabled device. In some embodiments the mobile device can download location specific wagering game content from the wagering game server . In some other embodiments the mobile device can have the location specific wagering game content stored in local machine readable media thereby not requiring the content be downloaded. The mobile device is associated with a user . The user can be a wagering game player playing wagering games on the mobile device . In some preferred embodiments the location based gaming features are configured to trigger even when the user is not actively playing a wagering game on the mobile device . In this regard the player may not even need to be aware that the location based gaming features will be triggered or has been triggered.

In the illustrated example the user and the mobile computing device are positioned in range of the first hotspot location so that one or more location based gaming features associated with that hotspot location are available. For example when the player is located at the first hotspot location one or more of the location based gaming features associated with the business entities in the buildings and can be automatically triggered on the mobile computing device . As the user moves with the mobile computing device to different geographic locations one or more location based gaming features associated with the other hotspot locations become available. For example when the user moves the mobile computing device in range of the second hotspot location one or more of the location based gaming features associated with the second hotspot location can be triggered e.g. a distinct reel spin triggering event associated with a business entity in the building is automatically triggered without user input . When the user moves the mobile computing device in range of the third hotspot location one or more of the location based gaming features associated with the third hotspot location are automatically triggered and so on for all the buildings shown in .

As shown the size of a designated hotspot location can vary. For example the hotspot location can be a defined as the area inside or around a building or both. This can include large buildings e.g. a baseball stadium or mall and defined perimeters around large business entities. The hotspot location can also cover a number of buildings associated with different business entities. The hotspot location can also include a location near a number of business entities. For example the hotspot location can include a park outside a shopping center.

Location and movement of the mobile computing device can be tracked via a location tracking device which can reside in the mobile computing device . The location can be determined for example through a satellite based global positioning system GPS navigation feature. Even without a GPS receiver the mobile computing device can provide location and movement information through cooperation with a cellular system through a process known as trilateration. A cellular system s towers and base stations communicate radio signals and are arranged into a network of cells. A cellular device such as cellphones smartphones and cellular enabled tablet computers have low power transmitters for communicating with the nearest tower base station router or access point. As a user moves with the cellular device e.g. from one cell to another the base stations monitor the strength of the transmitter s signal. When the cellular device moves toward the edge of one cell the transmitter signal strength diminishes for a current tower. At the same time the base station in the approaching cell detects a strength increase in the signal. As the user moves into a new cell the towers transfer the signal from one to the next. A computer can determine the location of the device based on measurements of the transmitter signal such as the angle of approach to the cell tower s the time it takes the signal to travel to multiple towers and the strength of the signal when it reaches the towers.

According to other aspects of at least some embodiments of the present concepts a movement sensor can be provided comprising one or more sensors configured to determine the movement e.g. rotation translation etc. of the mobile computing device with respect to an established datum or reference e.g. position spatial orientation reaction force velocity acceleration electrical contact etc. about or along one or more axes. In yet some other embodiments a near field communication NFC tag radio frequency identification RFID tag Bluetooth or WiFi wireless fidelity transmitted code etc. carried by or otherwise emitted from the mobile computing device can trigger initiate a location based gaming feature. As another possible option the user can use their mobile computing device to acquire and submit documentation of their presence at a particular location to trigger a location based gaming feature e.g. by taking a picture of that particular location or an item e.g. a Quick Response QR Code at that particular location.

In general the location based gaming features affect the play of a wagering game. In one example a dedicated software application is provided for the user s mobile computing device . The dedicated software application is configured to display a map e.g. which may look similar to what is shown in the top half of with indicators of designated local hotspots within a predetermined surrounding area and or a predetermined vicinity of the user . Each of these hotspots represents a distinct location based gaming feature. As one example each location based gaming feature is a specific reel spin triggering event for a slot type wagering game. For instance when the user is within range of the second hotspot which is positioned within the building at least one of the one or more location based gaming features associated with at least one of the one or more business entities in the building is automatically triggered. The dedicated software application on the user s mobile computing device will automatically initiate the corresponding reel spin triggering event. In some embodiments the reel spin triggering event is initiated without requiring an input from the user. In this instance the dedicated software application may alert the user when the reel spin triggering event is initiated. The reel spin triggering event may operate to provide the player with a randomly determined outcome of the slot game.

The following is an example with reference to the hotspot locations . A business entity in the building can be associated with e.g. sponsor one or more different wagering games for the fifth hotspot location . A business entity in the building can be associated with one or more different wagering games for the hotspot location . A different business entity in that same building can also be associated with one or more wagering games for the fourth hotspot location . Moreover another business entity in the building can be associated with one or more different sponsored wagering games for the fifth hotspot location . Yet another business entity which is located in the building can be associated with one or more wagering games for the hotspot location . A different business entity in the building can also be associated with altered wagering game content for two different wagering games for the hotspot location . The sponsored wagering game s associated with each of the foregoing entities may be the same as similar to and or interactive with one some or all of the wagering games sponsored by the other entities. Optionally one or more of the sponsored wagering game s associated with each of the foregoing entities may be completely different from and or independent of some or all of the wagering games sponsored by the other entities.

Accordingly in some embodiments a person can select from multiple wagering games having location based gaming content for some hotspot locations. The person can make their selection for example based on prizes awarded. For example assume the user moves their mobile computing device into the fifth hotspot location . The user can initiate a mobile device dedicated software application more commonly known as an app or mobile app on the mobile computing device . The mobile computing device can then present a list of wagering games available for the hotspot location on its display. The mobile computing device can also display the location and or entity associated with each of the available wagering games. The mobile computing device can further display the available prizes for the wagering games that are available to play. The user can then select which wagering game or games to play using an input control on the mobile computing device . For example the user can select a wagering game associated with the business entity in the building because the prizes include coupons for products or services for that business entity.

In some embodiments the awards for game play triggered via movement of the mobile computing device can affect subsequent game play at a brick and mortar wagering game establishment. By way of non limiting example the award for game play triggered via movement of the mobile computing device can include an award multiplier and or an additional payout for a winning outcome in a play of a wagering game at a wagering game machine at a brick and mortar wagering game establishment. To illustrate assume the user is awarded a win in the outcome of the play of a wagering game triggered by a location based gaming feature. The mobile computing device can then transmit a notification to the wagering game server regarding the additional payout for a win at a wagering game machine at a brick and mortar wagering game establishment. The wagering game server can make a corresponding update to a player account associated with the user . Subsequently when the user has a winning result at a particular wagering game machine e.g. a wagering game machine having the same theme as the wagering game played on the mobile computing device an additional award is provided to the user as a result of the win in the outcome of the play of a wagering game triggered by a location based gaming feature. The additional award can be sponsored by a business entity at or near the hotspot location which triggered the location based gaming feature. Such an embodiment incentivizes players to wager at the brick and mortar wagering game establishment after playing location based wagering games. While described in reference to wagering games conducted on a physical gaming machine located at a brick and mortar wagering game establishment this example is also applicable to online wagering games.

The location based gaming features disclosed herein can also affect other aspects of the wagering game. For example the location based gaming feature can affect aspects of the game s presentation e.g. images video audio etc. . To illustrate if the wagering game is a slot game one or more of the reel symbols can be modified to indicate or otherwise represent the hotspot location. For example as indicated above the hotspot locations can be associated with a business entity a government entity a non profit entity a geographic location etc. In such configurations the location based gaming feature can include graphics or images representing the associated business entity government entity non profit entity geographic location etc.

In some embodiments the mobile computing device is not required to be within the area defined as the hotspot location e.g. the mobile computing device need not be inside the building or store of the business entity associated with that hotspot location to trigger a corresponding location based gaming feature. Rather if the mobile computing device is within a predetermined range or proximity of a designated hotspot location the location based gaming features corresponding thereto are available. Aspects of a location based gaming feature can vary based on the mobile device s proximity to the designated hotspot location. In some embodiments the closer the mobile computing device is to a designated hotspot location the greater the potential awards associated with any game play triggered by the location based gaming feature.

In some embodiments the first user A is eligible for a first location based gaming feature or a first set of location based gaming features because the user s mobile computing device A is inside the building of the designated hotspot . The second user B on the other hand may be restricted to a second location based gaming feature which may be less valuable than the first location based gaming feature or a second set of location based gaming features which may include some but not all of the location based gaming features in the first set because the mobile computing device B of the second user B is within the first area but not within the location of the designated hotspot . In the illustrated example the third user C is also eligible for the second location based gaming feature and or the second set of location based gaming features because the mobile computing device C of the third user C even though further away from the building than the mobile computing device B is within the first area . Likewise the fourth user D may be restricted to a third location based gaming feature which may be less valuable than the first and second location based gaming features or a third set of location based gaming features which may include some but not all of the location based gaming features in the second set because the mobile computing device D of the fourth user D is within the second area but not within the location of the designated hotspot or within the first area . The fifth user E is also eligible for the third location based gaming feature and or the third set of location based gaming features because the mobile computing device E of the fifth user E is within the second area .

In this example prizes can vary based on a mobile computing device s proximity to the designated hotspot . In some embodiments the closer the mobile device is to the designated hotspot the greater the available prizes. For example because the mobile computing device A is within the location of the designated hotspot the first user A can win prizes that are at least 50. Because the mobile devices B and C are outside the location of the designated hotspot but within the first area the second and third users can win prizes that are between 25 and 50. In the same vein because the mobile devices D and E are beyond the first area but within the second area the fourth and fifth users D and E can win prizes that are up to 25. If a mobile device is outside the second area the user of that device is not eligible for any of the location based gaming features associated with the designated hotspot . Such a configuration incentivizes persons to be closer to the designated hotspot which could cause the persons to buy products and services from the business entity in the building .

Some embodiments incorporate a social network gaming component into the location based wagering game features. for example depicts a gaming system that provides location based gaming features for wagering games that have a social network gaming component. In the wagering game industry social gaming typically refers to gaming environments which allow multiple players to play wagering games as a way of social interaction as opposed to individual players playing a game in isolation. Many social network games are played over the Internet and are available as turn based models that are seamlessly integrated into widely popular social networking websites such as FACEBOOK SECOND LIFE and TWITTER . Social network games are most often implemented as browser games played over the Internet with a web browser employing standard web technologies or browser plugins. Even though social network games are often played via a web browser they are distinct from traditional browser games for example by leveraging a player s social graph and individual user data that is hosted on a particular social network website.

The gaming system of is wirelessly communicating over the network with five different users A E via five respective mobile computing devices A E. The gaming system is also operatively connected to a designated hotspot that surrounds a business establishment . The system includes a wagering game server and a social network server each of which may be similar in form and functionality to the servers and or controllers described above that communicate with the mobile devices A E through the network . The business establishment can take on any of the various forms discussed hereinabove including a coffee shop or a restaurant. As shown all five users A E have their respective mobile computing devices A E within the designated hotspot area.

In the users A E are part of a group within a social network e.g. FACEBOOK . For example the users A E can be a defined group of Facebook friends. shows how some embodiments employ player forwarding see dotted arrow begging at B to provide access to the social component of the wagering game. After a user achieves a winning result in a play of a social wagering game triggered by a location based gaming feature the user initiates an operation to cause their computing mobile device to transmit a notification to another user in their social networking group that has not yet achieved a winning result i.e. player forwarding . The player forwarding continues until each user in the group has achieved a winning result for the social component of the wagering game. After each person in the group has achieved a winning result a group win is awarded to the members of the group.

In the second user B using the mobile computing device B is provided initial access to a wagering game with the social network component. The mobile computing device B may obtain initial access through a random determination. For example the user B can initiate a dedicated mobile software application on the mobile computing device B to view the available wagering games based on the current location of the mobile device B. The mobile device B can wirelessly communicate with the wagering game server . The wagering game server can make a random determination and transmit the result to the mobile device B. If the mobile computing device B is selected the dedicated mobile software application can provide a wagering game having a social component to the mobile device B. The mobile application may download the wagering game content for the social component from the wagering game server and or retrieve it from a local machine readable storage device in the mobile computing device B.

Also the mobile application on the mobile computing device B can communicate with the social network server using an Application Programming Interface API . The mobile application can access a player account for the second user B for the social network being hosted by the social network server . The mobile application can retrieve a list of groups from the account of the second user B. The mobile application can then randomly select a group that is to be part of the social game. Alternatively the user B can be presented an option to select a group from their social network. Alternatively the user B can create a group on their social network. After the group is selected or created the persons within the group can then have the option to play the wagering game having the social component. Also wagering can include wagering of real money fun money or anything else of real or perceived value on an event with an uncertain outcome. For example the wagering could be based on a virtual currency where the wagering games are played for fun. In such an example the rewards could be discounts for services or products for a business entity.

In after a location based gaming feature is activated by the location of the mobile computing device B and the user B achieves a winning result in the play of the social game which was triggered at least in part by the location based gaming feature the user B causes the mobile computing device B to send or the system automatically generates a notification to the mobile computing device C. The third user C then plays the wagering game until there is a winning result for the social component. After a location based gaming feature is triggered by the location of the mobile computing device C and the user C achieves a winning result a notification is sent to the mobile computing device A. This process continues until all of the users A E achieve a winning result for the social component. After the last user e.g. the fifth user E in achieves a winning result a group win is awarded to the members of the group.

In some embodiments the mobile computing devices A E do not send notifications to each other. Instead after a mobile device achieves a winning result the mobile device transmits a communication to the social network server . For example a mobile device may post a notification on the wall of at least one member in the group who has not yet achieved a winning result for the wagering game. Also as each winning result is achieved and or after the group win is awarded the mobile device can post a notification on the wall of each member of the group in the social network.

It should be readily understood that the gaming systems illustrated in the drawings are merely provided as exemplary applications by which the various inventive aspects and features of this disclosure can be applied. Moreover only selected components of the systems have been shown and are described in detail. Nevertheless the systems and devices discussed herein can include numerous additional and alternative features and other well known peripheral components for example for carrying out the various methods and functions disclosed herein. Those components which are well known and or are not necessary for carrying out the aspects of the present disclosure will not be described in further detail.

The various features and aspects of the present disclosure are not per se limited to slot games these features and aspects can be applied to many different types of wagering games that can be formatted to operate in accordance with the disclosed concepts. Some non limiting examples include applying the disclosed location based gaming features to bonus games progressive games community games etc.

With reference now to the flow chart of an improved method for conducting a wagering game with a mobile computing device that is configured to wirelessly communicate information with a gaming system such as the systems shown in is generally described at in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. can be representative of an algorithm that corresponds to at least some instructions that can be stored for example in main memory of and executed for example by the CPU and or external system s of to perform any or all of the above or below described functions associated with the disclosed concepts. The method will be described with reference to the various aspects and features shown in of the drawings such reference is being provided purely by way of explanation and clarification.

The method starts at block by receiving information from a user that is required to create a player account for that user. Such information may include in any combination the user s name mailing address billing address billing information e.g. credit card number or checking account information a user ID a password player preferences etc. Once received block may also include creating a player account and at block contemporaneously storing the player account and corresponding information in a database. The player account when stored may be associated with the user s mobile computing device. For instance the player account may be stored in association with the device s serial number Internet Protocol IP address or any other functional indicator of the user s mobile computing device. Block could also be optional for example in instances where a user already has a preexisting player account. A user may be enrolled in a gaming establishment s loyalty club e.g. PLAYER S LIFE available from WMS Gaming Inc. . As another example the user may have already provided the requisite information to one of the business entities sponsoring one or more of the designated hotspots e.g. to open a My Starbucks Rewards STARBUCKS loyalty card . In such an instance the method may include requesting and importing player account information from a third party.

At block the method includes storing in a database a list of designated hotspots. This hotspot list may include various types of information for each of the hotspots such as a respective location of each of the designated hotspots and one or more corresponding location based gaming features associated with each of the designated hotspots on the designated hotspot list. Additional information that may be stored for each designated hotspot can include as some non limiting examples the name of a business or other entity sponsoring that hotspot a business identifier e.g. a tax ID other corporate information for a sponsoring business entity e.g. parent subsidiary information state of incorporation contact information a Media Access Control MAC address etc. The designated hotspot list may be generated internally e.g. via a gaming system operator or in some optional configurations can be imported in whole or in part from a third party vendor.

In accord with some preferred embodiments the method also includes at block providing to the user a dedicated standalone mobile software application that is operable to be downloaded onto the user s mobile computing device. The mobile software application or app runs on the user s mobile computing device as opposed to a mobile website which is disseminated through an internet browser and can be configured to operate in conjunction with the gaming system servers and a tracking system as will be explained in further detail below to track the movement of the mobile computing device and automatically trigger location based gaming features associated with designated hotspots visited by the user as explained above. Users can retrieve the app for example from a host website e.g. the gaming operator s website a third party website e.g. an app store an email or similar electronic communication from the gaming operator etc. Once retrieved and downloaded to the user s mobile computing device the app can be linked to the user s player account. In this regard the user s player account information may be provided when installing the mobile app.

The dedicated standalone mobile software application may be provided with various optional functions and features. For instance the mobile app can be configured to display on a display of the mobile computing device information related to a designated hotspot location and the location based gaming feature associated with the designated hotspot location. One option may be to provide this information through a help menu or other user selectable function. As another option the mobile app can generate a push notification when the user is approaching a designated hotspot location. The push notification which can be displayed by the mobile device even if the app itself is not open at that time can include for example the name of the hotspot the address location of the hotspot the distance from the user to the designated hotspot location the types of location based gaming feature s available at that hotspot location user restrictions associated with that hotspot location promotional materials of a business entity sponsoring that hotspot e.g. logos coupons advertisements etc. The app may also include user selectable dropdown menus popup windows and the like from which the user can retrieve additional information related to the location based gaming features such as the information stored in the hotspot list discussed hereinabove.

The dedicated standalone mobile software application can also be configured to display on a display of the mobile computing device a map of all designated hotspot locations within a predetermined proximity of the physical location of the mobile computing device. For example the map may look similar to what is shown in the top half of e.g. above the network cloud with a symbol avatar or icon which is representative of the user and the user s movement buildings and other geographic landmarks around the user and indicators e.g. pins or circles that represent designated local hotspots within for example one mile of the user s current location. The map may also offer user selectable options to view hotspots outside of the predetermined proximity to acquire directions to a designated hotspot location to view traffic conditions around a designated hotspot location to acquire public transportation options to a designated hotspot location singly or in any combination. In some embodiments the user s movement can be shown in real time by repositioning the user s icon avatar on the map.

The dedicated standalone mobile software application can also be configured to provide the user with various other user selectable options. The mobile app for example can be configured to display on a display of the mobile computing device other types of information such as a user history which lists all or at least the most recent hotspot location or locations visited by the user. The mobile app can also or alternatively display all of the location based gaming features and or the awards resulting therefrom which were accumulated as a result of the user visiting those designated hotspot locations. It may be desirable that the mobile app be operable to display at least those location based gaming features with awards benefits that the user has yet to redeem. The mobile software application can be further configured to display a randomly determined outcome associated with each play of a wagering game that is triggered in whole or in part by a location based gaming feature. In this regard the mobile app can provide the user with a redemption option with which the user can redeem any awards associated with winning outcomes in the aforementioned play s of the wagering game.

At block the method includes determining the physical location of the user via the user s mobile computing device. In some embodiments the gaming system servers are operable to make this determination while in some embodiments the gaming system receives an indication of the physical location of the mobile computing device from an outside source and while in other embodiments the gaming system employs a combination thereof. Location and movement of the mobile computing device can be determined through any of the means discussed above for example in the explanation of the gaming system and network . The physical location and or movement of the mobile computing device can be determined for example using GPS technology trilateration techniques triangulation of a signal output by the mobile computing device a comparison of a signal output by the mobile computing device between at least two different receivers an RFID tag an NFC tag a short range wireless connection between the mobile computing device and a stationary receiver or a short range wireless connection between the mobile computing device and a mobile receiver or any combination thereof.

The method continues to block where it is determined if the physical location of the mobile computing device corresponds to or is within a predetermined proximity of at least one of the designated hotspot locations. As indicated above in the discussion of the gaming system of the user s mobile computing device need not be within the area defined as the hotspot location to trigger a corresponding location based gaming feature. Where the designated hotspot location is located inside a brick and mortar store or building for example the user and the user s mobile device do not have to be physically inside the building store of a business entity associated with that hotspot location to trigger a corresponding location based gaming feature. Rather these location based gaming features are available if the physical location of the mobile computing device corresponds to or is within a predetermined range or proximity of a designated hotspot location.

Optionally block also includes validating that any prerequisite trigger criteria have been satisfied before automatically triggering any of the location based gaming features. By way of example and not limitation a system server can first conduct a backend check to confirm the user has a player account to confirm the mobile device being used to trigger the location based gaming feature is associated with the user and or the user s player account to confirm the user s current physical location and or to determine if the user is eligible for the location based gaming feature at a particular hotspot. In some embodiments a location based gaming feature may be subject to certain user restrictions. For example there may be time limit restrictions where the user s mobile computing device must be physically located at or within a proximity of the designated hotspot location for at least a predetermined minimum period of time before a location based gaming feature is triggered. Other restrictions may require the user to physically check in at a particular hotspot location or group of locations before a location based gaming feature is triggered. In some embodiments a user s eligibility to trigger a location based gaming feature may depend on that user s status with a particular sponsor business entity or with a particular gaming operator e.g. through player tracking the user must have achieved a threshold player status at a specific casino . There may be use restrictions which limit the number of times a location based gaming feature can be triggered by a particular user or limit the number of times a location based gaming feature can be triggered by a particular user in a given period of time. The user may also be penalized for violating restrictions. For instance if a user stays at a particular hotspot location for longer than an allotted amount of time the user may incur some sort of negative aspect e.g. lose one or more of the awards won as a result of triggered location based gaming features . These limits can be configurable by the operator.

If the physical location of the user s mobile computing device corresponds to or is within a predetermined proximity of at least one of the designated hotspot locations the method responds at step by determining which location based gaming feature or features are associated with that designated hotspot location and then automatically triggering without any input from the user one or more of the location based gaming features corresponding to the designated hotspot location. In effect for a location based gaming feature to be triggered the user is not required to be operating the mobile device to place a wager to initiate play through a key button or lever or even be aware that a location based gaming feature is in fact being triggered. In this regard the mobile app on the user s mobile computing device not need be open e.g. enabled by the user in order to trigger the location based gaming feature. Rather in some embodiments the app could actually be enabled by the hotspot for example by a backend server through the mobile device s exchange with a Wi Fi connection at the hotspot. In some embodiments the user and device can be identified by the backend server via the device s serial number or Internet Protocol IP address through exchange of an NFC or RFID tag. The app could also be encoded with a background process that runs even when the app is closed such that the app device and or user can be identified at a designated hotspot location. It may be desirable to automate the game play in the above manner so that the user is not required to operate their mobile device open their app or remember to check in at each designated hotspot location they visit.

Automatically triggering the location based gaming feature includes initiating play of at least a portion of a wagering game. In this regard triggering a location based gaming feature may operate to provide the user with a randomly determined outcome or a portion of a randomly determined outcome of the wagering game. Block may therefore include randomly determining an outcome or portion of an outcome of a base game segment of a wagering game. This may include an RNG generating a random number game logic for determining the outcome based on the randomly generated number and a CPU operating to execute a wagering game program and game assets e.g. art sound etc. for presenting the determined outcome to a user in a visual manner. The base game outcome of the wagering game can be visually represented by a plurality of symbols arranged on a display of the mobile computing device. For some preferred implementations the wagering game is a slot game also known as a reel game and the location based gaming feature is a reel spin triggering event for the slot game. When the user and thus the user s mobile computing device is physically located at or is determined to be within a predetermined proximity of a designated hotspot location the reel spin triggering event operates to automatically vary e.g. spin and stop one or more of the reels of the slot type wagering game for the user.

Block of includes generating or otherwise outputting a notification to the user of the mobile computing device that the location based gaming feature was automatically triggered. The notification may take on any known form such as a page an email an SMS text message or a push notification. In some embodiments the user s mobile computing device through operation of the mobile app downloaded thereto will generate an audible and or visual communication informing the user of the triggered location based gaming feature. For other implementations an output device such as an audio speaker or a display screen at the designated hotspot location will output the notification to the user.

Responsive to this notification or at the user s own initiative the user then requests to view the play of the wagering game or the portion thereof that was initiated through the automatic triggering of the location based gaming feature. For example at block the method includes receiving a redemption input from the user to view the randomly determined outcome of the play of the wagering game and to redeem any awards associated therewith. The redemption input may be submitted through a variety of mediums such as the mobile app on the user s mobile computing device via a website hosted by the gaming system or any other available input device. For some implementations or the redemption input may be submitted by the user visiting a store e.g. a store of a sponsor business or other brick and mortar establishment e.g. a casino . Block may therefore also include displaying the randomly determined base game outcome to the user. Some implementations may in fact require the user to interact with the mobile app in order to redeem any awards or benefits resulting from this game play. For instance to view and redeem any game play accrued through triggering of a location based gaming feature e.g. a number of free spins in a slot game the user may be required to open the app which may be configured as a standalone app on the mobile device and play each of the free spins on the mobile app. Optionally if the user opens the mobile app after the location based gaming feature is triggered and then interacts with a particular aspect of the app e.g. the user uses the app to check in on FACEBOOK and post their play activity to the social networking website the user can be awarded with additional benefits. In some embodiments a user may be required to visit a particular gaming establishment e.g. a brick and mortar casino or a particular website e.g. a virtual casino or a sponsor s host website to view the game play and or redeem any awards or benefits resulting from this game play. Doing so may optionally enable game play not otherwise available to that user or other players at a particular terminal or a particular bank of terminals at the casino. In some embodiments the outcome of a reel spin event triggered by a location based gaming feature can determine a user s placement on a leader board at a designated hotspot location associated with that location based gaming feature. In this regard the more frequently a user visits a particular hotspot location and or stays at that particular hotspot location the greater the number of times a location based gaming feature can be triggered and thus the more likely the user will ascend on the leader board. By reaching the top of the leader board a user can be declared king of that designated hotspot location which can translate into increased awards and or benefits. For some implementations staying at the top of the leader board could then translate into secondary opportunities additional awards and or benefits.

The location based gaming features disclosed herein can be employed to influence or manipulate user behavior i.e. used to drive certain behavior used as a motivational tool to alter behavior or used as a deterrent to discourage or disincentivize a certain behavior. For instance a user can be induced to visit a specific establishment to stay at a particular establishment or to relocate to a different establishment by offering the user certain incentives such as the ability to play a game feature for free by offering the ability to play games game content or other features that they may not otherwise be eligible to play or by offering the ability to win larger or more attractive awards associated with the feature. As one example a user may be deterred from staying at a particular establishment for too long e.g. for more than one hour because they will be penalized with a loss of an accrued award and or benefit. On the other hand the user may be incentivized to stay at a particular establishment for a longer period of time e.g. for at least one hour because they will be awarded with additional awards and or benefits. These concepts can also be applied to group gameplay. For example the above concepts can be employed to ensure that a group or users stays and moves together as a group or to ensure that the users stay close enough together to pass features back and forth between the users e.g. in a hot potato game configuration which requires such interplay .

Another concept related to location based gaming features that are triggered by the movement of users is an individual or group game wherein players are required to search for and find various objects akin to a treasure hunt or scavenger hunt. Such game play may comprise a wagering game or a non wagering activity e.g. tying a nominal benefit to an introductory activity that would acquaint a person with the various areas and offerings of a gaming establishment . In association with a wagering game at least one aspect of this concept requires a player to visit within a predetermined period of time e.g. seconds minutes hours one or more predetermined designated hotspot locations. In variations on the scavenger hunt concept players are required to walk around from location to location and collect things or find people and collect things from those people. For example a player may be required to actually meet an employee who will then deposit a confirmation of the contact in the users mobile device.

In some embodiments the method includes at least those steps enumerated above. It is also within the scope and spirit of the present invention to omit steps include additional steps and or modify the order presented above. It should be further noted that the method can be representative of a single play of a wagering game. However it is expected that the method be applied in a systematic and repetitive manner. Additional information regarding location based gaming can be found for example in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 8 282 490 B2 to Vladimir I. Arezina et al. which issued on Oct. 9 2012 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.

Aspects of this disclosure can be implemented in some embodiments through a computer executable program of instructions such as program modules generally referred to as software applications or application programs executed by a computer. The software can include in non limiting examples routines programs objects components and data structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The software can form an interface to allow a computer to react according to a source of input.
