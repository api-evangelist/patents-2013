title: Classification of digital content using aggregate scoring by a grid load balancer configured to assign content to different content analysis engines based on content identifications of a semantics processor
abstract: Aggregate scoring is used to help classify digital content such as content uploaded to multi-user websites (e.g., social networking websites). In one embodiment, specific categories are used that relate to a social implication of content. For example, text, images, audio or other data formats can provide communication perceived to fall into categories such as violent, abusive, rights management, pornographic or other types of communication. The categories are used to provide a raw score to items in various groupings of a site's content. Where items are related to other items such as by organizational, social, legal, data-driven, design methods, or by other principles or definitions, the related items' raw scores are aggregated to achieve a score for a particular grouping of items that reflects, at least in part, scores from two or more of the related items.

This application is a continuation of the following application U.S. Pat. No. 8 412 657 application Ser. No. 13 167 482 entitled CLASSIFICATION OF DIGITAL CONTENT BY USING AGGREGATED SCORING filed on Jun. 23 2011 which claims priority to U.S. Pat. No. 7 979 369 application Ser. No. 11 971 856 entitled CLASSIFICATION OF DIGITAL CONTENT BY USING AGGREGATE SCORING filed on Jan. 9 2008 which are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in Inn in this specification.

Continued increase in the popularity of online community data has created both benefits and problems. Online social networking sites of millions of users allow the users to post or upload content for other users to view copy modify criticize or otherwise use or manipulate. Thus each social networking site can act as a valuable resource for people to maintain business or social contacts exchange information and ideas provide resources for education commerce or entertainment or to provide other benefits.

However operators of social networking sites are often concerned with the type or quality of content that is uploaded by the site s user base. Some types of content are deemed unsuitable or objectionable for the site s users such as where the user base includes children. Other content may not achieve a desired level of quality or relevancy to a theme or goal of a site. The more popular a social networking site is the harder it is to police content due to the sheer volume of new content posted each day and due to the many different and sometimes subtle forms that content can have. But if the site operator is not effective in policing the site s content the effect on its user base can be harmful.

A preferred embodiment of the invention uses aggregate scoring to help classify digital content such as content uploaded to multi user websites. Although specific embodiments of the invention are discussed many other embodiments using features described herein are possible and may be within the scope of the invention. For example the desirability to effectively review and filter content can extend to many types of information exchanges that are available online. Newsgroups chat rooms bulletin boards wikis peer to peer networks etc. may benefit from improvements in identification classification and or control of content.

In one embodiment specific categories are used that relate to a social implication of content. For example text images audio or other data formats can provide communication perceived to fall into categories such as violent abusive rights management pornographic or other types of communication. The categories are used to provide a raw score to items in various groupings of a site s content. Where items are related to other items such as by organizational social legal data driven design methods or by other principles or definitions the related items raw scores are aggregated to achieve a score for a particular grouping of items that reflects at least in part scores from two or more of the related items.

In one embodiment the invention provides a method for classifying digital content wherein the digital content includes two or more items the method comprising identifying a grouping of the two or more items in the digital content assigning a raw score to the identified items based on predetermined criteria deriving an aggregate score for the digital content wherein the aggregate score is derived from the raw scores and using the aggregate score to output a classification of the digital content.

Information about content in the domains is provided to moderation service . Moderation service uses automated analysis such as aggregation scoring and manual review in order to provide classification of the content and identification and or removal of objectionable content. In a preferred embodiment site manager is able to use an interface such as customer console to set threshold levels to determine when content is classified as objectionable.

Note that in general any number type and arrangement of components shown in can be used in different embodiments. For example a different application may have the content organized in pages accounts or other structures than domains. In some social networking sites users have individual storage space for content that belongs to a user i.e. is generally under a user s control and there may be various different ways for the controlling user to present the controlled content to other users. It should be apparent that any suitable way to organize and present content may be within the scope of the invention.

In other embodiments a unified approach to content management can be used so that for example site manager and moderation service are the same entity. Components can be combined so that for example site manager and moderation service are the same entity. In other embodiments functionality described in association with moderation service may be provided to one or more of users . Such user moderation can be under the control of other entities such as site manager and or moderation service . In yet other embodiments additional entities not shown in can be included as where portions of moderation service are performed remotely e.g. outsourced human or automated resources etc. .

Although specific components and data flow are illustrated in other embodiments may deviate from this illustration. In general functionality described herein can be performed at any suitable location by any suitable process or device and under the control of one or more entities. Implementation of functionality can take place at different times or places. For example processing can be performed in real time near real time scheduled e.g. offline batch processed etc or by other means. Processing can be distributed standalone parallel etc. It should be apparent that many variations from the specific embodiments disclosed herein in the text and Figures are possible and are within the scope of the claims.

In flowchart is entered at when content is submitted by a user such as when a user uploads or posts information to a social or multi user website. Step is then executed to deliver the content to moderation service . The user content can be provided to the moderation service by for example site manager . Alternatively the content may be obtained from the user or site storage location directly such as where an automated process installed and or maintained by the site manager user moderation service or another entity or process not shown detects when new content is provided or when existing content changes and identifies or transfers the new content to the moderation service.

Step is then executed by the moderation service to perform an automated assessment of the content such as to provide aggregate scoring and classification as described below. If it is determined that human review is needed to classify the content then step is executed and subsequently execution proceeds to step . However if human review is not needed then step is performed directly to take action on the content based on the automated manual or combination of automated and manual review. The routine exits at step .

In browser window includes standard properties and controls such as the web page title menu bars and navigation controls . The web page content starts just below the navigation controls. At the top of the web page is the web page title Jane Doe s Spot at which identifies the user who typically has elevated control of the content on the page with respect to other users. The controlling user or owner of the page site spot or other demarcation of a group of content can upload or post content that has various types of purposes and organization on the web page.

For example picture can be an image of the spot s owner. text can be created by the owner or another user. music player can allow the owner to select songs for audio playback. Other user s who visit the site can control playback among the owner s pre selected songs.

Similarly video player allows the owner to select one or more videos for visiting user playback. Blog allows the owner to make periodic diary entries. Other users may be permitted to post or upload to different component items on the page e.g. to the pictures text players blog etc. . In general different levels of access and control can be given to the owner and to visitors. This type of access and control granting is typically at the discretion of the site manager. In some applications it may be useful for the moderation service or for other users to be able to allow or deny levels of access and control to other users.

Yet other items on the web page include animated image e.g. an animated gif video clip etc. text entries separate space entitled Friend Space that allows visitors to have greater ability to post text and images such as and respectively. It should be apparent that any number type or arrangement of web page items is possible. Typically the design and purpose of the social networking site dictates the items and how they are used and controlled by the user community.

A preferred embodiment assigns raw scores to different content items. Collections or groupings of items that are useful to perform a content analysis are identified. For example some useful groupings in a social networking application include a user upload or post a web page a site address or Uniform Resource Locator URL content associated with a user account etc. An aggregate score for the item grouping is then determined by using two or more items in the grouping in order to derive at least in part the aggregate score.

In one embodiment each item is given a raw score in each of several categories of interest. Categories can include one or more of the following 

This category includes users that portray describe or advocate physical assault against humans animals or institutions. Also included are depictions of torture mutilation gore or horrific death any sites advocating suicide or self mutilation and instructions. Sites with recipes or kits for making bombs or other harmful or destructive devices and excessive use of profanity or obscene gesticulation are also included in this category.

URLs users in this category include sites such as online purchasing or ordering information including lists of prices and dealer locations any page or site predominantly containing or providing links to content related to the sale of guns weapons ammunition or poisonous substances and displaying or detailing the use of guns weapons ammunition or poisonous substances. note weapons are defined as something used to injure defeat or destroy such as a club knife or gun .

Cyberbullying includes sending or posting harmful or cruel text or images using the Internet or other digital communication devices. It includes but is not limited to 

Posting pictures of classmates online and asking students to rate them with questions such Who is the biggest add a derogatory term 

Engaging someone in instant messaging IM tricking that person into revealing sensitive personal information and forwarding that information to others 

This category can include sites or content advocating or inciting degradation or attack of specified populations or institutions based on associations such as religion race nationality gender age disability or sexual orientation. Also sites that promote a political or social agenda that is supremacist in nature and exclusionary of others based on their race religion nationality gender age disability or sexual orientation. Holocaust revisionist denial sites coercion or recruitment for membership in a gang or cult and militancy extremist sites are also included. Content that could be excluded from this category can be news historical or other factual reporting.

Spam relates to content which might be used for purposes other than those indicated in a site s terms of services or desired purpose. For example offering services or selling products through messages may be considered spam. Another example of spam includes mass mailing or posting of comments on other members sections.

Sites or individuals that provide work arounds for filtering software cracked software pirated software download sites and pirated multimedia download sites. Content that encourages a user to participate in a con or fraud scheme to obtain money or other things of value from the user.

This category includes content users and other entities that reference discuss or show sexually oriented or erotic full or partial nudity depictions or images of sexual acts that may be undesirable for a site. Content can be text images video audio or otherwise. References or links to places where such content may be obtained can also fit this category. For example references to adult products digital versatile disks DVDs websites videoconferencing escort services etc. can be included in this category.

This category can include any content that is known or likely to be proprietary to a 3rd party and which is suspected or known to be used by a user in violation of the 3rd party s rights.

Objectionable images such as those that detract from a site s aesthetic design. For example a blinky is typically an image which includes lots of shiny pixels that some viewers may find annoying. Other types of objectionable images may include ones that don t fit a color scheme are too large depict unsettling or gross items etc.

In one embodiment items are assigned raw scores for each of multiple categories of analysis being undertaken by the moderation service. In the example of there are five categories of interest relating to Violence Abusiveness Digital Rights Scams and Pornography shown at . Each category receives a score in the range 0 to 1 inclusive. The raw scores can be derived by manual or automated methods or by a combination of manual and automated approaches. In a preferred embodiment items to be assigned raw scores are identified by detecting changes to content at a site. Content changes can be identified by spiders or log agents maintained by the site manager or by the moderation service. An application programming interface API can be provided to third party developers and customers to allow information about content and content changes to be automatically provided by third parties. Other ways to identify content changes are possible. Another approach can use the user community to identify e.g. by voting or flagging content that may be of elevated interest for analysis. For example if enough negative votes are submitted by the user community then an item or grouping may be submitted as a subject of analysis. The votes can also be used alternatively or in combination with immediate moderator review as part of the scoring and aggregation described herein.

This approach of identifying changed content helps to filter or reduce the amount of content that must be analyzed. In popular sites of millions or more users the amount of new content each day can be enormous. In future systems where resources such as processing cycles memory disk storage etc. become faster and more plentiful it may be feasible to examine more content more often without a need for filtering or identifying content for analysis.

Adjustments to the raw scores can be made based on different conditions. For example if a particular item is associated with a grouping such as a web page and that web page has received a high score e.g. a high Mixed Aggregate Level Score as discussed below this could indicate that all of the items in the web page are more likely to be objectionable. In such a case all of the items in the particular web page may have their raw scores adjusted higher just because of the association of the item to the web page with a high score.

Another type of adjustment that can be useful is to associate users on the site who communicate frequently with each other. Sometimes such user associations can be determined by specific mechanisms maintained by a site. For example a primary user may have other users that the primary user identifies as friends so that the friends may have more access to items or mechanisms on the primary user s page. The friends may be able to post video or look at certain sections of the primary user s site that are not available to non friend users.

Another way to identify associated users is to assess the amount of traffic or exchanges between users. For example if two users frequently send chat messages to each other or post to the same blog then those two users may be considered friends or associated. Once user associations are identified then an item or grouping associated with a first user e.g. a negative or positive raw score for the first user s page or account can be used to adjust the scores of one or more associated users.

Note that any properties of an identified group or item can be used to adjust a specific item s score. For example if a user is identified as having posted objectionable content a flagged user then groupings and items associated with the suspect user can be adjusted. This could include e.g. web pages in the user s account postings by the flagged user to any user s web page pages that are linked from the flagged user s pages etc. Also such adjustments can be applied anywhere in the calculations described herein not only to the raw scores shown at .

Once raw scores are assigned to items in a group also referred to as a level then two or more of the items raw scores are used to obtain a type of aggregate score referred to as an Aggregate Level Score ALS shown at . In the ALS for grouping is obtained by using each of the items in grouping namely items a b and c. The ALS includes each category of interest for which a score was assigned as a raw score to an item. It should be apparent that many variations to compute the ALS are possible. For example in other embodiments not all of the items in a grouping need be used in order to achieve an ALS. The ALS need not maintain all of the categories present in the raw scores. Some items in a grouping may have different categories of raw scores that are not present in all items in the grouping. Many other variations are possible.

In the example of an example formula for deriving an ALS is shown as x a y b z c 3. This illustrates weighting factors x y and z each applied to the raw scores. The sum of the weighted raw scores is normalized by dividing the sum by the number of items. Operations such as weighting and normalizing are optional depending upon implementation. In the example of a weighting value of 1 is used i.e. no weighting . Other modifications to the exact methods and formulas used to illustrate the invention are possible. For example a change over time first derivative of a raw score ALS or other measure or parameter can be used. Factors other than raw scores may be included in order to arrive at an ALS or other measurement. For example geographic location date time of day age political affiliation frequency of posting or accessing account amount of traffic to a web page or other demographic statistic measurement or parameter can be employed.

In a preferred embodiment Weights are applied to the raw scores. The weighted raw scores are included in a mixed score where each classification may carry a different weight. Unlike the example of the aggregation of mixed scores are not weighted and combined into a single value. Instead the separate scores in the mixed score are maintained and analyzed separately throughout the system. Other characteristics of a preferred embodiment are as follows 1 a higher score is used to indicate less desirable content 2 each item s value has a lower threshold or base value of 0.2 so that a perfectly clean or acceptable item still gets a score of at least 0.2 3 all text in an item is assigned a single score and 4 adjustments may be made for statistical correction and accuracy such as standard deviation as desired. For example a customer may wish to add an additional penalty value to a score if the standard deviation for scores in that category are high. In other cases anomalies may arise such as where a concentration of particular items with particular scores can produce an unwanted result. In such a case a deviation weight can be added to or subtracted from a score.

In a an alternative embodiment two or more of the aggregate level scores are combined to obtain a Mixed Aggregate Level Score MALS . The mixed aggregate level score is compared to a threshold. If the threshold is exceeded then the level may be escalated to higher scrutiny such as by sending one or more items in the grouping with the high MALS to a human moderator for review by flagging the items or grouping for further automated analysis by removing items or by taking other action.

In a preferred embodiment the MALS scores are used to determine whether one or more items in a grouping with a high MALS is presented to a human moderator for physical review. Other systems can take other actions such as using further automated processing to identify or categorize content. If a human moderator determines that items or groupings are objectionable then the items or groupings can be immediately removed from the site blacklisted or quarantined so that other users can not access the content. Alternatively if a human moderator determines that items or groupings are ok then the items or groupings can be approved whitelisted . Such approved items can be given a unique ID e.g. a hash of data included in an item . Items that have been previously approved can be removed from future analysis.

Where an item or grouping has been blacklisted or removed other items groupings users friends or other entities e.g. a website linked with an item a source of an item etc. associated with the blacklisted item can be adjusted so that their score s are affected by the association.

In flowchart is entered at step when it is desired to classify content. Step is executed to identify a grouping in the content for analysis. At step two or more items in the grouping are identified. At step raw scores are assigned to the items. Steps and are optionally executed if adjustments are possible to the raw scores. If it is determined at step that scores should be adjusted e.g. if an item or grouping is associated with an item grouping user or other entity under analysis then step is executed to perform the adjustment. Step is executed to derive the aggregate score for the grouping by using the raw scores or adjusted raw scores. Finally the routing is exited at step .

In application servers e.g. web page servers include content that is logged by log agent . Content submissions from users such as user are provided to a URL or address or other destination or storage posting mechanism as indicated at . Semantics parser is an automated process that filters content. For example keyword filtering of four letter words can be implemented to immediately remove content from further analysis. Content coming from known approved sources can bypass analysis. Log agent provides information about content traffic and updates to the semantics parser. If content can be identified by semantics parser it is submitted to early detection process for alternate processing.

Semantics parser also makes a preliminary determination of content items for assignment for specific analysis. Grid load balancer allocates content for analysis among different machines or processes in cases where a system may have multiple options to perform processing so that certain processors are not overloaded when there are other idle or less busy processors that can perform the tasks. Depending on the identifications made by the semantics processor and the load balancer s assignments analysis for different formats or other categories of content is assigned to one of multiple analysis engines. In the example of analysis engines include image processing text processing video processing and rights processing . Any number type organization or arrangement of analysis engines may be used.

Results from the analysis engines are provided to result aggregator . In a preferred embodiment this is where the processing of acts in is performed to achieve an aggregate score. However in other embodiments such processing can be performed by any one or more processing devices at the same or different places in a system. Results from aggregate scoring and other analysis such as mixed level aggregate scoring are stored in persistent storage and are drawn upon for various types of processing. For example previously calculated raw and aggregate scores for items or groupings may be stored and used for later computations.

Components and illustrate human moderator involvement to review and rate items and groupings dependent upon scores from result aggregator . Actions by human moderators e.g. whitelisting blacklisting may also be used as input to result aggregator to adjust or otherwise modify scores. In this illustrated embodiment human moderators actions are used to remove content from servers as shown at . Reports help manage and improve the accuracy of human moderators. Such reports can be for example ranking of each moderator according to moderators performance relative to other moderators. Email communication can be used to contact users whose content has been modified.

Knowledge base includes various resources to improve data for analysis. For example URLs and items that were previously blacklisted or whitelisted can be stored. A dictionary of objectionable or acceptable terms can be maintained. Classifiers can include metadata about different items groupings users or other entities. Knowledge base data can be used to provide information to other components in the system to improve analysis based upon trends over time or other historical observations. Knowledge base can include information from multiple websites or sources to correlate for example user account scoring across different enterprises or domains. Comfort zone definitions can allow each domain client to specify a tolerance level for a classification. Anything below or alternatively above the level is deemed acceptable. Ad server can retrieve a score for an account or a page which can then be used in determining the type of ad to place on the page. For example a user generated page UGP can be analyzed and certified that there is no offensive content on the page. An advertiser who has negotiated placement of ads only on certified UGP can then have an ad placed on the page. In another approach a certified ad can be selected for inclusion which will guarantee that the ad content meets a specific requirement or term of service. Scores can be used in other way to match ad content to a page such as indicating that the content should be appropriate to anyone over the age of 13 etc.

Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described variations of such embodiments are possible and are within the scope of the invention. For example although embodiments have primarily focused on removing objectionable content it is possible to use features of content classification described herein to identify desirable content. Any type of scoring or ranking measure may be used. Scores may be integers fractions multidimensional sets of values attribute names symbols etc. Although web page examples and social networking sites have been presented features of the invention may be applied to other types of information such as databases that use files records fields and other groupings of their items.

Any suitable programming language can be used to implement the functionality of the present invention including C C Java assembly language etc. Different programming techniques can be employed such as procedural or object oriented. The routines can execute on a single processing device or multiple processors. Although the steps operations or computations may be presented in a specific order this order may be changed in different embodiments unless otherwise specified.
