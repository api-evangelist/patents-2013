title: Shaping the spectrum of random-phase radar waveforms
abstract: The various technologies presented herein relate to generation of a desired waveform profile in the form of a spectrum of apparently random noise (e.g., white noise or colored noise), but with precise spectral characteristics. Hence, a waveform profile that could be readily determined (e.g., by a spoofing system) is effectively obscured. Obscuration is achieved by dividing the waveform into a series of chips, each with an assigned frequency, wherein the sequence of chips are subsequently randomized. Randomization can be a function of the application of a key to the chip sequence. During processing of the echo pulse, a copy of the randomized transmitted pulse is recovered or regenerated against which the received echo is correlated. Hence, with the echo energy range-compressed in this manner, it is possible to generate a radar image with precise impulse response.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 737 416 filed on Dec. 14 2012 entitled SHAPING THE SPECTRUM OF RANDOM PHASE RADAR WAVEFORMS the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

A typical pulse Doppler radar system emits a series of pulses and further can collect echo signals. For each pulse the echo signal s is correlated against the transmitted waveform to provide a range sounding whereby the range soundings are compared against each other across pulses to discern Doppler information. The correlation function may be implemented as an equivalent matched filter or as a direct correlation.

Radar modes that typically operate in this fashion include Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR Inverse SAR ISAR various Moving Target Indicator MTI radars radar systems which are generically range Doppler radars coherent search radar systems etc.

The choice of waveforms to utilize can depend on the objectives of the radar system with respect to ease of waveform generation downstream processing issues and desires for probabilities of detection interception spoofing etc. Typically waveforms are required that offer a large time bandwidth product to afford both high energy and wide bandwidth for improved range resolution. There are a plethora of waveforms from which to choose. These include but are not limited to Linear Frequency Modulated LFM chirp Non Linear FM NLFM chirp stepped frequency systems various phase coded modulation schemes and random and pseudo random noise waveforms. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

A conventional radar system employs a final transmit power amplifier that is normally operated in compression to maximize transmitted power output and or efficiency. However such operation of the amplifier is non linear and accordingly may not faithfully reproduce amplitude modulations etc. and further may act to limit such modulations.

It is well known to a person having skill in the art that the output of a matched filter when input with a signal to which it is matched is the autocorrelation function of the waveform. Furthermore the autocorrelation function is related by the Fourier Transform FT to the Energy Spectral Density ESD of the waveform. That is the autocorrelation function and ESD are FT pairs. Matched filters have a principal advantage of maximizing the Signal to Noise Ratio SNR of energy in a final range Doppler map. Most radar processing seeks to implement matched filters or at least nearly so.

A problem with matched filters for many waveforms is undesirably high processing sidelobe levels in a range Doppler map. The high processing sidelobe levels are usually mitigated with additional filtering often by using data tapering or window functions during the processing. Although this may un match the filter to a degree which can result in a slight degradation of the range Doppler map SNR this tradeoff is usually deemed worthwhile. While the SNR degradation is termed as slight it is typically in the 1 2 dB range.

An alternative is to use waveforms designed to exhibit desirable ESD properties where the autocorrelation of the waveform exhibits desirable or at least acceptable processing sidelobe levels directly that is without additional filtering and the attendant SNR loss.

Various techniques relate to noise radar radar that uses noise as a transmitted waveform however most techniques fail to address issues relating to sidelobe suppression. Where sidelobe suppression is addressed a conventional technique operates on received data only by reducing SNR or operates in a non linear fashion with resultant adverse effects to some subsequent exploitation schemes. Other techniques relate to shaping the ESD but typically such techniques may be limited to specific functions like a Gaussian distribution of frequencies to reduce processing sidelobes in a SAR image.

The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various technologies pertaining to randomizing a waveform are now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that such aspect s may be practiced without these specific details.

That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B.

Additionally as used herein the term exemplary is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something and is not intended to indicate a preference.

The various embodiments presented herein relate to generation of a desired waveform profile in the form of a spectrum of apparently random noise e.g. white noise or colored noise . Hence the shape of a waveform profile that can be readily determined e.g. by a spoofing system is effectively obscured. The obscuration is achieved by dividing the waveform profile into a sequence of chips or slices whereby each chip is a portion of a waveform formed by slicing the waveform into sub portions as a function of any suitable parameter such as frequency time etc. The sequence of chips within a pulse frame can be subsequently randomized. Accordingly the randomized sequence of chips can appear to be a noise transmission. Randomization can be a function of the application of a factor key seed or other randomizing variable s to the chip sequence. During decoding of an echo radar pulse e.g. a reflection off a target of the waveform having the randomized chip sequence received at the radar system the received echo signal is compared against a copy of the transmitted waveform having the same randomized chip sequence. Hence by having knowledge of the specific randomized order of the chips in the transmitted waveform it is possible to regenerate the same chip sequence for comparison to the received echoes and furthermore it is possible to determine any deviation in the reflected pulse from the transmitted waveform and hence identify artifacts or other target characteristics in the reflected pulse to facilitate generation of a radar image. While a single randomized pulse may appear to comprise of a greater degree of noise compared with the desired waveform when a plurality of randomized pulses are averaged e.g. with ensemble averaging the average tends to replicate the desired waveform properties in particular the shape of its ESD. For example the randomization can be applied to a sequence of pulses with a degree of randomization being introduced based upon the number of pulses in the sequence. Hence the randomization of the pulses can also be applied collectively such that the randomization is not only applied to a single pulse in isolation but the randomization is also applied to obtain the desired waveform properties when the randomization of the pulses is averaged by the ensemble average.

It is to be noted that a random phase signal can have a white spectrum or it may have a shaped non white spectrum. Further a sampled data random phase signal can have a non zero ESD over the bandwidth equal to the sampling frequency. Furthermore a random phase signal can also have random phase differences between two independent random phases. A phase increment across a time increment is a phase rate or frequency while a phase rate change can be considered a frequency hop. By controlling the phase rate the characteristics of phase increments it is possible to control the energy spectrum of the random phase signal. In an aspect spectrum precision and sharpness can be enhanced by holding a frequency for a given chip length. Hence when considering digitally generated phase samples the chip length may require a plurality of samples which can be considered a time bandwidth issue. The definition of a plurality can depend on the sharpness desired but several tens of samples may be adequate. Accordingly to facilitate shaping of the ESD of a random phase signal control of the average energy at various phase rates may be required. The ESD shaping can be achieved by controlling the likelihood of specific phase increments controlling the duration of a specific phase increment chip length or a combination thereof. For range Doppler images the 2 dimensional impulse response IPR may be of principal concern. This may tend to average out the random effects of any single pulse.

The various embodiments presented herein facilitate generation of random phase waveforms which are capable of relatively precise IPR shapes in a range Doppler map. The capability is achieved by controlling the statistical characteristics of the phase increments or instantaneous frequencies. Further it is possible to shape the ESD of such a waveform by controlling the instantaneous frequencies themselves or the durations of the frequency chips or both. Furthermore it is possible to shape the ensemble average ESD to match a specified window taper function thereby precisely providing a desired shape to the IPR particularly in the mainlobe in a range Doppler map. Also a range Doppler map or image can tend to average out fluctuations in the ESD of any single pulse. Consequently the coherent processing interval CPI of the random signals can be considered as a whole.

To facilitate understanding of the various embodiments presented herein various random phase waveforms are developed and presented where such random phase waveforms can be compared with frequency modulated FM chirp waveforms that are readily known in the art . Throughout the various examples and embodiments presented herein and unless otherwise noted a digitally generated phase with the following radar parameters is utilized as a reference 

where a sampling frequency f can be a function of a limitation of one or more hardware components utilized during generation of a waveform the waveform bandwidth B can be calculated based upon a required range resolution of a radar system the pulse width T can be chosen to meet timing requirements for the ranges of interest to prevent occlusion and the number of pulses N can be calculated to facilitate achieving Doppler resolution requirements and or SNR requirements. It is to be appreciated that while the various embodiments are presented herein each is based on analyses respectively comprising N 1024 pulsed waveforms the according ensemble averages include according artifacts e.g. lack of a fully smoothed average waveform which may not be present in systems using a greater number of pulsed waveforms. For example a SAR image may be formed from 10 000 100 000 pulses and accordingly the ensemble average will likely be much smoother with the low level artifact of a jagged waveform being smoothed out by averaging over a much larger number of pulses.

In an aspect the various embodiments presented herein can be utilized by a pulse Doppler system e.g. a Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR based system. Further the various examples and embodiments presented herein can be directed towards an IPR sidelobe mitigation technique for example at a level consistent with a 35 dB Taylor weighting 4 . Such an IPR shape is common for SAR. It is to be appreciated that any other characteristic may be chosen e.g. for another mode of operation. Further to facilitate understanding the following presumes no system noise exists in the generated or processed waveforms hence any uncertainty in a waveform is purely a function of the waveform and not of measurement.

Moreover the acts described herein may be computer executable instructions that can be implemented by one or more processors and or stored on a computer readable medium or media. The computer executable instructions can include a routine a sub routine programs a thread of execution and or the like. Still further results of acts of the methodology can be stored in a computer readable medium displayed on a display device and or the like.

At the various parameters for transmission of a signal having the waveform can be identified. Such parameters can include what the sidelobe levels are what window function to utilize etc. In an embodiment a window function can be utilized that minimizes mainlobe width while maintaining a peak sidelobe constraint where such window functions can include a Taylor window a Dolph Tschebysheff window a Hamming window a Gaussian based window etc. For example a Taylor window can approximate a Dolph Tschebysheff window near its mainlobe but unlike the Dolph Tschebysheff window a Taylor window can allow sidelobes to decay at a rate of 1 f beyond some distance from the mainlobe. Sidelobe levels and the point beyond which sidelobes roll off are effectively parameters to the Taylor window. In the various embodiments presented herein a 35 dB Taylor window 4 is utilized.

At the spectral shaping for the desired waveform can be defined whereby sample frequencies of the desired waveform spectrum profile can be assigned to a set of chips. Spectral shaping can include a number of parameters including frequency frequency range frequency distribution etc. In an embodiment the frequency range of the waveform can be divided or sliced into a number or plurality of chips which may also be referred to as slices whereby the chips can form a sequence across the frequency range. For chirp waveforms these chips can also form a sequence across the time duration of the pulse. In an aspect the sequence of chips at this stage can be considered to be an original chip sequence while the later referenced randomized sequence of chips can be considered to be a randomized chip sequence of the original chip sequence. In an embodiment the chips can be of a constant frequency increment across a particular band while in another embodiment the chips can be of a non constant frequency increment across a particular band etc. In an embodiment based upon the chosen frequency distribution the frequency distribution with non constant increments in frequency e.g. a non constant frequency spacing for the sequence of chips can generate the required spectral shaping e.g. required waveform . In another embodiment where a constant increment in frequency is utilized then the required spectral shaping can be obtained as a function of adjusting a duration of a chip adjusting a probability of selection of a chip of a particular frequency or a combination of both to facilitate obtaining a required energy for that particular chip and accordingly the required spectral shaping. In another embodiment a duration for transmission of each individual chip can be configured to facilitate attaining the desired spectral shaping. Hence by determining a frequency for a chip and also a duration of transmission at the chip frequency a spectral shaping can be achieved where a first chip at a first frequency is transmitted for a first duration e.g. to obtain a low magnitude or energy at the first frequency while a second chip at a second frequency is transmitted for a second duration where the second duration can exceed the first duration e.g. to obtain a high magnitude or energy at the second frequency relative to the first frequency .

At a randomization key can be generated. The randomization key can be generated in real time e.g. on the fly or the randomization key can be retrieved from a look up table e.g. retrieved from a data store comprising a plurality of randomization keys to achieve the desired randomization e.g. to achieve a desired result of ensemble averaging . In an aspect the randomization key can be generated as a function of a seed value being applied to an algorithm in a pseudo random number generator whereby the algorithm can be constrained to achieve the desired chip randomization e.g. constrained to a number of chips and the output of the pseudo random number generator is a key or pseudo random code to be applied to the original sequence of the plurality of chips.

At the sequence of the plurality of chips e.g. defined for the set of frequencies for a given duration can be randomized based upon application of the randomization key to the original sequentially defined plurality of chips. The randomization operation can form a randomized sequence of chips.

At the sequence of randomized chips can be compiled to generate and or form a waveform that appears to be comprised of random noise. Such a waveform can be referred to as a radar pulse profile.

At a radar pulse signal having the radar pulse profile can be transmitted whereupon the flow can return to where the next randomization key can be generated and another pulse comprising the randomized sequence of chips can be transmitted.

At a copy of the transmitted waveform is recovered and or regenerated that exhibits the same randomized order in its sequence of chips thereby serving as a reference waveform for the subsequent processing of the reflected radar pulse.

At based upon the recovered and or regenerated copy of the randomized sequence of chips in transmitted pulse the radar received echo pulse can be processed to facilitate detection of a target s etc. For example an energy of a first chip in the randomized sequence of chips can be compared with an energy of the first chip in the received chips which matches the transmitted sequence of chips derived from the reflected echo radar pulse an energy of a second chip in the randomized sequence of chips can be compared with an energy of the second chip in the received chips and so on. Based at least in part on the comparison between a transmitted pulse and an echo pulse at least one characteristic of the target can be determined e.g. a difference in energy between the first chip in the randomized sequence of chips and the first chip in the received chips a difference in energy between the second chip in the randomized sequence of chips and the second chip in the received chips etc. Acts can be performed for multiple radar pulses and thus multiple chip sequences and the difference in energies across all the chip sequences can be utilized to generate a radar image.

As shown in a conventional stepped frequency chirp waveform can be constructed by sequencing across the plurality of frequencies that form the ESD in a monotonic direction whereby each frequency can be held for some duration e.g. its chip length. Further as shown in the spectral energy magnitude can be varied for each sample or chip frequency. For example chip frequency Ccan have a shorter transmission duration or other energy effecting operation than chip frequency C thereby enabling a difference in energy between chip frequency Cand chip frequency C. Further as shown in a randomization key can be obtained e.g. from a pseudo random number generator or from a database and applied to facilitate re ordering of the sequence of chips shown in from the original stepped frequency waveform to a pseudo randomized sequence . A waveform generated from the randomized frequency chips of can be a radar pulse profile. A signal having the radar pulse profile e.g. of waveform can be transmitted and appears to be noise but still retains the essential ESD characteristics of . It is to be appreciated that the lengths of the respective randomized portions are likely much greater than the length of the randomized portions which would be generated in a real application. For example to illustrate the various concepts presented herein waveform ESD has been sampled into approximately 27 chip frequencies however in a real world scenario the number of chip frequencies can be much greater e.g. about 600 samples. Accordingly as shown in the randomized waveform can be formed based on identifying a sample frequency for each randomized time chip and then generating the waveform based upon sequentially moving from a frequency e.g. a sample frequency of a first randomized time chip to a frequency e.g. a sample frequency of a second randomized time chip.

As previously mentioned a signal having the waveform or a close approximation thereto can be transmitted by a radar system reflected off of a target e.g. a landscape building vehicle etc. and subsequently received at the radar system. At the radar system the randomization key can be obtained e.g. by re application of a seed value to the pseudo random number generator or retrieved from a data store and values output thereby can be utilized to reconstruct the original sequence of chips e.g. the transmitted waveform can be recovered regenerated or otherwise reconstructed . This transmitted waveform copy then serves as a reference signal or kernel for matched filter processing of the received echo signals. Based upon a deviation of the received echo waveform in comparison with the transmitted waveform a radar image can be formed e.g. based in part on a variation in energy between the received echo waveform in comparison with the transmitted waveform . Since essential characteristics of the ESD are unaffected by the random order of the sample frequencies i.e. chips the IPR of the matched filter output is essentially unaffected. The pulse averaging afforded by Doppler processing of multiple pulses or related pulse averaging techniques serves to additionally reduce anomalies due to the random nature of the waveforms.

To facilitate understanding of the various concepts presented herein a number of waveforms are presented. In an aspect the series of waveforms can comprise a phase having a random nature and accordingly the waveforms can have a frequency that is to a degree also random. As is known in the art the phase is the integral over time of the frequency. The instantaneous frequency is the time rate of change of phase whereby in a sampled data system the instantaneous frequency is the phase increment per sample time. Thus it is possible to shape the spectrum of a pulse waveform by manipulating the statistics of randomness relating to the phase frequency etc. A form of the phase expression in terms of an accumulated instantaneous frequency can be expressed as 

A waveform having a random phase and random frequency can be defined according to 2 0.5 Eqn. 3 where X i n is the uniformly distributed random value over the interval 0 1 . In the example X i n is a different random selection for each index i and n. presents the energy spectrum of both a single pulse and the average energy spectrum for a plurality of N pulses for a waveform having a random phase energy spectrum. presents an autocorrelation function of the energy spectrum formed with a random phase while illustrates a zoomed version of the central region of . For comparison a Taylor window for a desired compressed pulse response where the reference function is a 35 dB Taylor window with 4 is also evident in . In plot is the reference or ideal waveform plot is the plot for a single waveform and plot is the ensemble average of a plurality of waveforms while in plot is the reference or ideal waveform plot is the plot for a single waveform and plot is the ensemble average of a plurality of waveforms. In the embodiment presented herein the ensemble average of plots and is of pulsed waveforms. As is readily apparent the ESD is essentially flat and further to be noted the sidelobes diminish with ensemble averaging.

Further the frequency increments can be limited by setting 2 0.5 Eqn. 4 which can result in an alteration of the ESD and associated autocorrelation function depending on fractional bandwidth factor b. In the examples b 0.5. presents the energy spectrum of a single pulse and the average energy spectrum for a plurality of N pulses for an energy spectrum formed with limited random phase. presents an autocorrelation function of the energy spectrum formed with limited random phase while illustrates a zoomed version of the central region of . For comparison a Taylor window for a desired compressed pulse response where the reference function is a 35 dB Taylor window with 4 is also evident in . In plot is the reference or ideal waveform plot is the plot for a single waveform and plot is the ensemble average of a plurality of waveforms while in plot is the reference or ideal waveform plot is the plot for a single waveform and plot is the ensemble average of a plurality of waveforms. In the embodiment presented herein the ensemble average of plots and is of pulsed waveforms. In comparison with indicate a sidelobe reduction and mainlobe broadening. It is to be noted that it can be difficult to define an edge to the ESD to readily identify the waveform bandwidth. In other words there is a degree of spillage outside the band of interest. The spillage can be due to the frequency being allowed to change over its entire interval for each increment in index i. To sharpen the edges more correlation from sample to sample may be required. In accordance with the previously described methodology a way to achieve the sharpening is with the concept of a chip e.g. any of chips where the frequency may randomly jump only at chip boundaries where a chip is some number of individual samples. The sharpness of the band edges then becomes a time bandwidth issue for the chip. However as shown in the ESD is beginning to be shaped.

The edges of the spectrum may be sharpened by allowing frequency changes only at chip edge boundaries. This can be modeled as 2 0.5 Eqn. 5 where floor Eqn. 6

Such an approach can be viewed as a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique. Application of the technique can lead to sharpening of the edges of the ESD and thereby shape the associated autocorrelation function accordingly depending on fractional bandwidth factor b. For example b 0.5. illustrates the energy spectrum of a single pulse and the average energy spectrum for a plurality of N pulses for a waveform generated with random frequency chips. It is to be noted that the ensemble average energy spectrum is smoother than the curve for the single pulse . presents the autocorrelation function of the energy spectrum formed with random frequency chips while illustrates a zoomed version of the central region of . For comparison a Taylor window for a desired compressed pulse response where the reference function is a 35 dB Taylor window with 4 is also evident in . In plot is the reference or ideal waveform plot is the plot for a single waveform and plot is the ensemble average of a plurality of waveforms while in plot is the reference or ideal waveform plot is the plot for a single waveform and plot is the ensemble average of a plurality of waveforms. In the embodiment presented herein the ensemble average of plots and is of pulsed waveforms. It is to be noted that the autocorrelation function depicted in has a sin c nature with attendant undesirable high sidelobes.

Spectrum shaping may be further achieved by altering the statistics of the selected random values. Hence the instantaneous frequency function can be modeled as 2 0.5 Eqn. 7 where X i n is the shaped distribution random value over the interval 0 1 .

Accordingly X i n can have a Probability Density Function PDF with the same shape as the desired window taper function for the ESD. For example the window can be a 35 dB Taylor window with 4.

In the preceding examples the random frequencies were selected from within the continuum of the passband. However the frequencies can be limited to a finite set that are uniformly arrayed within the passband. Although the frequencies themselves are quantized to a linear spacing the likelihood of selecting a particular frequency is still adjusted to shape the spectrum. The instantaneous frequency function can be modeled accordingly as 2 0.5 Eqn. 8 where the quantization function is presumed to allow the same number K steps as there are individual chips that is 

In the previous examples random frequencies have been selected within the passband without regard for any prior choices. That is each chip s frequency was chosen independent of any other chip s frequency. Consequently for any one pulse a particular part of the desired spectrum might be over represented and another part of the spectrum might be under represented purely as a matter of chance. Only in the aggregate of all pulses in a statistical sense would the desired spectrum be filled in with the appropriate shaping.

Another constraint to the randomness of chip frequencies and their energies is now considered where each individual pulse contains chips with frequencies that within the pulse cover the entire desired passband. A NLFM stepped chirp is considered with the chips randomly shuffled. Each pulse can be shuffled differently but each pulse will still contain the same set of chips identical in both frequency and duration. The instantaneous frequency of the new waveform will still have form Eqn. 10

However the quantization function of index i is now adjusted in a constrained random fashion. Based upon K total chips with linearly increasing index K 2 k

Accordingly a chip s frequency can be drawn from the shuffled finite set of allowable frequencies and the duration of that chip is still corresponding to the actual frequency drawn specifically its position in the passband.

For the examples b 0.5 K 160 and w k embodies the Taylor window function. It is to be noted that the rounding operation needs to facilitate the constraint that the sum of all steps equals the total number of waveform samples hence 

An algorithm to facilitate random selection without replacement of a frequency chip with equal likelihood of selection as utilized to generate can force a particular chip frequency to appear once and only once within a pulse. The once criterion facilitates formation of a complete spectrum for each pulse as desired. However it is to be appreciated that the only once aspect can be relaxed without compromising the formation of the complete spectrum for each pulse. For example if each chip frequency appeared exactly twice albeit with proper duration but equal probability then similar results would be achieved. Of course if any chip frequency appeared say twice then for a given pulse width there would need to be a corresponding reduction in the duration of any one chip or a coarsening of the frequency quantization. These effects would have to be evaluated with respect to the IPR. Such an approach can be considered akin to choosing a card from two combined and shuffled decks where each deck is a complete set of chip frequencies. In a further embodiment any number of decks can be shuffled together to extend this concept. Furthermore other variations might also be employed. For example in an embodiment a number of decks of integer N where N is an integer greater than zero for a single pulse can be shuffled together with a random subset of an additional deck. Or in another embodiment a deck of frequency chips can be dealt across multiple pulses. Other combinations are also conceived based on the various embodiments presented herein.

Based on the preceding a particular structure of random phase waveforms can be designed in accord with the following 

The resulting structure is illustrated in whereby the depicted embodiment can cause each frame e.g. frame 1 frame 2 . . . frame M to have the same spectral characteristics as the entire pulse e.g. pulse n pulse n 1 etc. . Such an approach enables a fraction of an entire pulse to offer the same resolution as the entire pulse. In an aspect it may be desired that the waveform segments in individual frames do not correlate well with each other as this would cause enhanced undesirable sidelobes in the overall waveform autocorrelation function. Furthermore the embodiment presented in may be preferred for longer pulses to mitigate quantization effects in both time duration and frequency. In an exemplary embodiment the overall compound pulse width is T 20.48 s but is made of two equal length individual frames with each frame exhibiting b 0.5 K 160 and w k embodies the Taylor window function.

The various embodiments presented herein may be further modified or enhanced in any of a number of ways including but not limited to the following 

 c Individual frames need not have the same frequency chip set including in either quantization bandwidth or spectral regions.

A parameter component can be utilized to facilitate specification of the various waveform parameters where such waveform parameters can include pulse width bandwidth number of frames number of chips sampling frequency etc. It is to be noted that a chip may be as few as one sample. Based at least in part on the entered parameters a base waveform can be generated by the parameter component .

A chip frequency component can based on the parameters entered in the parameter component determine and specify the allowable chip frequencies e.g. as exhibiting desired waveform ESD Based thereon a frequency or frequency range etc. can be assigned to each chip. For example based upon the number of chips and the desired waveform the frequency for each chip can be defined to facilitate formation of the waveform with ESD . The chip frequencies can be selected based on the entered parameters or other applicable statistics to facilitate ESD shaping of a pulse waveform.

A chip duration component can also based on the parameters entered in the parameter component determine and specify a required duration for each chip for example to achieve a required energy at the frequency for the chip. Chip durations may be selected based on desired statistics to facilitate ESD shaping of a waveform e.g. waveform ESD . For example with reference to chip Cin a lower ESD region of plot the duration of transmission of this chip can be maintained for a shorter time than the duration of transmission for another chip e.g. chip C in the higher ESD region of the plot .

A chip randomizer component can be utilized to randomize the chip sequence. With individual chip characteristics defined e.g. frequency frequency range energy etc. the chips can be randomized with regard to their order and subsequently concatenated into a larger pulse. In some cases specific subsets of the chips may first be concatenated into frames and then the frames concatenated into a larger pulse. As previously described e.g. in a key or seed can be generated whereby the random sequence is based upon the key . In an embodiment the chip randomizer component can be a pseudo random code generator.

Once the frequencies have been chosen for each sample time for each pulse a phase accumulator component can be utilized to accumulate the frequencies within a pulse to provide a phase function of sample index.

A read only memory ROM component can be utilized to convert the phase samples into amplitudes. In an embodiment ROM component can be a lookup table which can contain a cycle of a sine waveform a cosine waveform or portions thereof in an embodiment the conversion can utilize both sine and cosine functions of the phase for quadrature outputs single sideband mixing or in another embodiment one of sine or cosine functions of the phase can be utilized for single ended output double sideband mixing .

As shown in one or a plurality of pulse waveform s generated in accord with one or more embodiments presented herein can be subsequently forwarded to a transceiver component for transmission. The transmitted pulse s are reflected off the target with echo pulses received at transceiver component for subsequent radar processing. As shown at the appropriate reference time a copy of the transmitted waveform is regenerated originating with the same key used to form the transmitted waveform. This copy is the reference waveform for a correlator whereby a received echo pulse is processed and compressed to form a radar image . It is to be appreciated that while transceiver component is depicted as a single component performing transmitting and receiving operations the transceiver component can comprise of separate components a first component associated with transmission of a radar pulse and a second component associated with reception of an echo pulse.

Referring now to a high level illustration of an exemplary computing device that can be used in accordance with the systems and methodologies disclosed herein is illustrated. For instance the computing device may be utilized to perform any of the functions presented herein relating to the various embodiments where such functions can include deriving waveform parameters receiving parameter input determining chip frequency determining chip duration generation of a randomization key retrieval and application of a randomization key randomization of the waveform processing of the waveform etc. The computing device includes at least one processor that executes instructions that are stored in a memory .
