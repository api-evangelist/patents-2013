The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Pat. Application Ser. No. 61 608 838 filed Mar. 9 2012 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention generally relates to mobile devices and in particular to content display on mobile devices.

With mobile devices such as smart phones being able to perform more and more functions users are using smart phones more than ever. However with all the advances and improvements with smart phone capabilities many users may become frustrated with navigating or progressing through a mobile app to accomplish the desired result due to various reasons such as the small display size the small keyboard keypad and not understanding what the user needs to do next.

For example a user can make a payment through the smart phone which typically requires many steps for the user to go through. At different points in the process the user may enter information not accepted by the app or not even know what to do next. As a result the user may simply give up or refuse to use the specific app again.

Therefore a need exists to help guide the user through problematic stages of a flow on mobile device.

Wherever possible the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like elements.

According to one embodiment when a user shakes a mobile device such as a smart phone new content is shown on the display of the mobile device. In one embodiment the content depends on the page or location the user is currently on within the mobile app or mobile browser page. For example if the user is on a page that is asking the user to select or enter funding source information the content resulting from shaking the device may be a help page with information about how to select a funding source possible funding sources and even advantages disadvantages of different funding sources. The content may also include frequently asked questions FAQs or other information that may be helpful to the user such as links to send an email to call or send feedback.

In other embodiments the content can depend on other factors or a combination of factors including but not limited to the particular page or location in the app the amount of time the user has been on the particular page or location in the app the location of the device the time and or day the physical environment detectable by the phone the state of other applications such as SMS notifications emails running apps etc. desired user behavior data data not on the phone e.g. in the cloud that can be accessed remotely personal identifiable information user transaction history etc. The user will then be presented with content after shaking the device that is tailored to the situation and or the user.

However in one embodiment the content is the same regardless of any of the factors above. This provides a more simplified analysis as the same page or content is displayed when the user shakes a device regardless of the user the device or page location. In one embodiment a help comment screen is displayed any time a user shakes the mobile device. The screen also allows the user to go back to the previous screen if the help comment screen is not needed. The help comment screen may include links to send feedback call a help number or send an email.

Thus a user such as a frustrated or confused user can easily to get a content display that may enable the user to resolve any issues questions with the current page or screen.

Thus the service provider receives data from an intentional shake of the user device. The user may intentionally shake the mobile device due to frustration at a certain page or location of an app on the mobile device. Or the user may simply shake the device with the intent of receiving helpful content on the mobile device display.

Data received from a shake may simply convey information about the device such as its phone number or other device ID. Other information may include one or more of the following content on or about the particular page or location in app the user is viewing when the device is shaken the amount of time the user has been on the particular page or location in the app when the device is shaken the location of the device when the device is shaken the time and or day when the device is shaken the physical environment at the time the device is shaken that is detectable by the phone the state of other applications such as SMS notifications entails running apps etc. when the device is shaken merchant information associated with the app or page the user is viewing information associated with the user of the device etc. The type and or amount or data received may depend on the service or content provider associated with the app or site. More data may result in a more user specific content display but may also require more analyzing processing and time.

After receiving data from the mobile device the service provider processes the data at step . Processing may include first determining whether the data is intended to be received i.e. whether it was from an intentional or inadvertent device movement. Even with different ways to minimize unintentional data from being sent there may still be times when an inadvertent shake transmits data to the service provider. If data received is not what the service provider would expect to receive from an intentional shake the service provider may ignore the data or send a message such as by text asking whether the user intended to shake the device or request certain content. Note that in other embodiments the service provider may process any data received to determine content to be provided without processing to determine whether the data was from an intended or unintended device movement.

Once it is determined that the data received was intended the service provider may further process the data by determining what information content the user may be interested in based on the information received. For example a default may be that the user wants general help which could be indicated by the user shaking the mobile device regardless of any other data received. However for a more detailed determination the system may look at one or more of the information above. For example if the user is at a payment page and requesting to enter funding source information when the shake occurs the system may determine that the user wishes help with selecting a funding source. If the user is determined to be an experienced user e.g. with many transactions the system may decide the user is seeking help on a more advanced issue such as selecting multiple funding sources to fund the payment. If the user is inexperienced or new the system may decide that the user just needs the basic information about how to select a funding source.

In another example if the user s home account is in California but the device is in China when the shake occurs the system may decide that the user may want information about currency conversion for the transaction. In another example if the user is on an early location of the app such as a start page the system may decide that the user wants more information about the app and how to navigate from the start page. As can be seen by those of ordinary skill in the art there are countless possibilities because there may be so many different combinations of input data that the system processes. In general the more information the system receives and is able to properly analyze the better it can determine what the user is seeking from the shake. Again the content to be provided by the service provider based on the device shake can be user specific or based only on the content of the page or app the user is on when the device is shaken.

Once the system determines what the user may be seeking the system determines the content or information to provide to the user device at step . For example if the determination is that the user is simply seeking an easy way to get help or to provide comment or feedback the system may determine that content with help comment information should be presented. In another example the system may determine that the user may want help with selecting one or more funding sources how to convert currency advanced help with a shipping address introductory information about the app how to sign in the app how to change a user setting etc. Another example is that the new content may differ depending whether the user has been on a page or location for a long time as opposed to a short time. For the latter the new content may be a more top level or overview information while for the former the content may be more detailed as the user may have spent more time and be more frustrated with the current content.

After the type of content is determined the system or service provider presents the content to the user on the user mobile device at step . The content on the mobile device when the user shook the device is now replaced or overlayed with the new content determined at step . In one embodiment the information or content is in context or contextual with the page the user is on. are exemplary screen shots of a display on a mobile device showing different content that may be displayed to the user.

In a general help comment screen is shown on a mobile device display. After shaking the user sees a new content or display that gives the user various options to help or commenting such as a send feedback button a call button and an email button. Selecting a desired button directs the user to an appropriate display to continue. For example tapping or otherwise selecting the Send Feedback button may give the user one or more options to provide feedback to the service provider or custodian of the app or site. Options may include a text box to enter text either by voice or key entry or a list of feedback the user can choose from such as from a drop down menu or list. Selecting the Call button may automatically dial a customer service number which when connected the user may speak to a person with knowledge of the user s situation. Selecting the Email button may launch an email application or function with a help email address already populated. The user would then simply need to enter a message and send the email. Note that screen shot in also includes a Back button that allows the user to go back to the previous screen in case the user did not intend to shake the device and see the help feedback display or that the user does not want to use any of the options on the help feedback display.

In another example shown in a new content is displayed in after shaking the device from the display shown in . In the user may be looking at the user s account information from a payment provider app or site and in particular to recent activity on the user account with the service provider. The service provider may determine based on the screen content the user is looking for a description of recent activity or additional information on recent activity associated with the account. shows one possible new content screen that provides additional information about recent history of the user account. Note that the content or new information is displayed as an overlay to the previous screen instead of completely replacing the previous content. The user may exit the new content by tapping the done button or other means such as tapping an area of the display e.g. overlying the original content .

In upon shaking the device the service content provider may determine that the user wants more information about the submit button which may be due in part to the fact that the user is a new or inexperienced user who has not gone through such a payment flow before with the service provider. As a result the user is presented with content that provides information about the submit button. Note that the content also includes a customer service number to call which may especially useful for a new user. As with the previous example the new content is displayed as an overlay to the previous content. The user may exit the new content by tapping on an area of the display showing the previous content or by other means.

Note that the service provider does not need to be a payment provider but can be virtually any entity associated with a mobile app including gaming companies merchants retailers etc. Also one or more steps described herein may be omitted performed in a different sequence or combined as desired or appropriate.

In one embodiment user identifier may be used by a payment service provider to associate user with a particular account maintained by the payment provider. A communications application with associated interfaces enables user device to communicate within system .

Merchant server may be maintained for example by a merchant or seller offering various items products and or services through an online site or app. Generally merchant server may be maintained by anyone or any entity that receives money which includes charities as well as retailers and restaurants. Merchant server includes a database identifying available products and or services e.g. collectively referred to as items which may be made available for viewing and purchase by user . Merchant server also includes a marketplace application which may be configured to serve information over network to browser of user device and or payment provider server In one embodiment user may interact with marketplace application to view various items available for purchase from the merchant.

Merchant server also includes a checkout application which may be configured to facilitate the purchase by user of goods or services identified by marketplace application . Checkout application may be configured to accept payment information from or on behalf of user through payment service provider server over network . For example checkout application may receive and process a payment confirmation from payment service provider server as well as transmit transaction information to the payment provider and receive information from the payment provider e.g. a transaction ID . Checkout application may also be configured to accept one or more different funding sources for payment. Merchant server may be in communication with payment provider server and user device so that content presented on user device can be communicated to a content provider one or more merchants the payment provider etc. when user device is shaken.
