Especially oxide semiconductor films comprising indium oxide zinc oxide are brought to attention in light of their ease of manufacture price or outstanding properties. Specifically oxides comprising indium oxide gallium oxide zinc oxide or oxide semiconductor films comprising those oxides as a major component have a benefit concerning mobility property which is higher than that of amorphous silicon films. Such oxide semiconductors are usually produced by a sputtering method using a sputtering target composed of each oxide such as indium oxide gallium oxide zinc oxide Patent Documents 1 and 2 .

Patent Document 4 discloses a compound of InGaO ZnO and a method for producing the compound and the presence of the compound is confirmed. However there is no disclosure about bulk resistance value and there is a problem to use the compound for a sputtering target Patent Document 4 . In addition as for a target comprising one homologous structure a target comprising InGaO ZnO see Patent Document 2 and of Patent Document 1 and a target comprising InGaO ZnO see of Patent Document 1 are known but there is no discussion about a target comprising two or more homologous structures or an effect thereof.

Furthermore for example a sputtering target comprised of indium oxide gallium oxide zinc oxide using the compound of InGaO ZnO an oxide sintered body showing a crystalline structure of homologous phase causes an abnormal electrical discharge by anomalous growth of the compound shown by InGaO ZnO during sputtering and thus there was a problem about defects on the obtained film see Patent Document 2 . In addition as for a sputtering target composed of indium oxide gallium oxide zinc oxide a target comprising a compound containing an zinc oxide of ABO 2 ZnO 1

The present invention provides a sputtering target having properties such as good appearance with less possibility of forming White spot good stability in sputtering reduced formation of particles or dusts of sputtering material during sputtering and accelerated sputtering rate.

The present invention allows to form two kinds of homologous crystals simultaneously by the specific production method or the specific production conditions such as sintering temperature or sintering time .

The present invention also provide a sputtering target comprising both an oxide crystal represented by InGaZnOand an oxide crystal represented by InGaZnO and then the present invention can solve the above mentioned problems suitably.

The sputtering target of the present invention is used for producing semi conductors to make an excellent oxide semi conductors or TFTs.

A sputtering target of the present invention comprises an oxide sintered body containing two or more homologous crystal structures.

The term homologous crystal structure means a crystal structure composed of a natural superlattice structure having long period lapping several crystal layers of different material. If crystal period or thickness of each layer is around nanometer order particular properties can be obtained by the combination of chemical composition or thickness of each layer which properties are different from those obtained from a crystal of a single material or of a unified mixture of each layer. A crystal structure of a homologous phase can be confirmed for example from the fact whether or not X ray diffraction pattern of a target ground powder corresponds to X ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase which pattern is expected from its composition ratio. Specifically it is confirmed from the correspondence between the pattern and X ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of a homologous phase obtained from JCPDS Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards cards.

In this connection an oxide sintered body containing only one homologous crystal structure has disadvantages such as reduction on bending strength JIS R1601 reduction on relative density taking a long time for sintering and increase of White spots pinholes compared with those of the oxide sintered body containing two or more homologous crystal structures.

Meanwhile as is the case with the present invention by co presence of two or more homologous crystals in an oxide sintered body it becomes difficult to form White spots good appearance is obtained sputtering becomes stable forming of particles is reduced and sputtering rate becomes higher. Although it is not so clear the reason why the sputtering rate becomes higher the reason would be based on that charge up during sputtering is reduced by uniformly dispersing crystal particles having slightly different resistances.

The oxide crystal having the homologous crystal structure includes an oxide crystal shown by RAO MO . R is a positive tervalent metal element such as In Ga Al Fe or B. A is a positive tervalent metal element other than R such as Ga Al or Fe. M is a positive bivalent metal element such as Zn or Mg. Each of R A and M may independently be the same metal element as one another or a different metal element from one another. m is for example integer preferably 0.1 to 10 further preferably 0.5 to 7 and more preferably 1 to 3.

The homologous crystal structure of the oxide sintered body of the present invention may preferably be an InMO ZnO type crystal structure or a YbFeO FeO type crystal structure. M is a positive tervalent metal element for example metal elements in Group IIIB such as Ga Al or B. More preferably M is Al or Ga further preferably M is Ga. In addition M may be partially substituted by a metal element other than Al Ga or Fe. If M is tervalent the homologous crystal structure shows an InMO ZnO type crystal structure. m is for example integer preferably 0.5 to 10 further preferably 1 to 8 more preferably 1 to 3 and especially 1. If m is 8 or under the atom ratio of Zn in ZnO is 80 or less bending strength is not reduced bulk resistance is not going up relative density is not reduced.

Among Zn M and In which constitute the homologous crystal structure at least a part of the one of elements may be substituted by another element. For example valence of an element to be substituted by Zn is preferably two or more. Valence of an element to be substituted by M or In is preferably three or more. By substituting at least a part of the one of elements selected from Zn M and In to another element an electron is injected into an oxide. The substitution of at least a part of the one of elements selected from Zn M and In to another element can be confirmed by a shift of lattice constant interstitial distance calculated from X ray diffraction or structural analysis using high brightness emitted light. Specifically the lattice constant is decided by Rietveld analysis.

A part of In which constitutes the homologous crystal structure is preferably partially substituted by a metal element X having positive four or more valences. The metal element X having positive four or more valences may comprises for example one or more elements selected from tin zirconium germanium cerium niobium tantalum molybdenum tungsten and titanium. The substitution of at least a part of the one of elements selected from In to the metal element X having positive four or more valences can be confirmed by shift of interstitial distance calculated from X ray diffraction or structural analysis using high brightness emitted light. Specifically lattice constant is decided by Rietveld analysis.

The homologous crystal structure of the oxide sintered body of the present invention is preferably an InGaO ZnO 1 type crystal structure and an InGaO ZnO type crystal structure. These m1 and m2 are different from each other either or both of m1 and m2 are for example integer preferably 0.5 to 10 further preferably 1 to 8 more preferably 1 to 3 in particular preferably 1.

Specifically the oxide sintered body of the present invention is preferably an InGaZnOcrystal phase indicating InMO ZnO type crystal structure and an InGaZnO or InGaO ZnO crystal phase indicating a YbFeO FeO type crystal structure where m has the same definition as that of the above mentioned m. The InMO ZnO type crystal structure and a YbFeO FeO type crystal structure are basically an octahedral structure of InO. Since these crystal structures have such an octahedral structure of InO it can be expected that an oxide semi conductor obtained by sputtering a sputtering target composed of the oxide sintered body of the present invention which comprises these crystal structures forms an electrically conducting path within the semi conductor itself to have high carrier mobility.

In addition crystal phases indicating the homologous crystal structure of the present invention may include for example InGaO ZnO InAlO ZnO InFe ZnO InGaO ZnO InO ZnO wherein m has the same definition as that stated above.

At least one of the oxide crystals indicating the homologous crystal structures is preferably an oxide crystal phase shown by InGaO ZnO m is for example integer preferably 1 to 8 more preferably 1 to 3 . If the oxide sintered body of the present invention contains such an at least one or more oxide crystals a sputtering target composed of the oxide sintered body can be used for making an excellent oxide semi conductor and then a thin film transistor having good carrier mobility and good TFT properties such as on off ratio.

Relative amount of each crystal structure may be confirmed based on strength ratio at the maximum peak of X ray diffraction. Although any X ray diffraction may be used for the diffraction for example 2 reflection method is desirable. In the strength ratio at the maximum peak the maximum peak is strength at an angle where JCPDS pattern identified by each crystal shows maximum strength. For example when the oxide sintered body of the present invention has two kinds of crystal structure corresponding to the maximum peak strengths P 1 and P 2 strength ratio at the maximum peak of each crystal structure P 1 P 2 is generally 0.01 to 100 preferably 0.05 to 20 more preferably 0.2 to 5 further preferably 0.4 to 2.5 and especially preferably 0.5 to 2. When the oxide sintered body of the present invention includes two kinds of crystal structure of InMO ZnO type and YbFeO FeO type strength ratio at the maximum peak of each crystal structure is generally 0.01 to 100 preferably 0.05 to 20 more preferably 0.2 to 5 further preferably 0.4 to 2.5 especially preferably 0.5 to 2. If the strength ratio at the maximum peak is 0.05 to 20 variation for a transistor obtained by sputtering the oxide sintered body of the present invention is not widened bulk resistance is reduced bending strength HS R1601 is increased relative density is increased and then a sputtering target without defective appearance such as White spot may be provided.

Drawings of crystal structures are shown to explain the difference of crystal structures of InMO ZnO type and YbFeO FeO type.

The oxide of the present invention includes Indium element In Gallium element Ga and Zinc element Zn . More preferably the oxide includes a metal element X having positive four or more valences. The metal element X having positive four or more valences comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of tin zirconium germanium cerium niobium tantalum molybdenum tungsten and titanium. When these metal elements X are added to the oxide of the present invention bulk resistance of the oxide itself is reduced and abnormal electrical discharge appeared on a sputtering target during sputtering the oxide is also reduced.

An oxide thin film obtained from a sputtering target using an oxide of the present invention is an amorphous film. Added quadrivalent metals provide a film having no doping effect and sufficiently reduced electron density. Therefore if this oxide membrane film is used as a oxide semiconductor film higher stability is obtained Vth shift caused by bias stress is restrained and operation as a semi conductor is stabilized.

The Vth is voltage at rise of drain current when gate voltage drain voltage is applied. The Vth shift is movement of Vth when gate voltage drain voltage is applied. If the Vth shift is small it can be said that the operation as a semi conductor is stabilized.

Atom ratio of each element among Indium element In Gallium element Ga and Zinc element Zn preferably meets the following relationships 1 to 3 . 0.1 In In Ga Zn 0.9 1 0.05 Ga In Ga Zn 0.6 2 0.05 Zn In Ga Zn 0.9 3 wherein In Ga or Xn means number of atoms for Indium element In Gallium element Ga or Zinc element Zn respectively.

If In In Ga Zn is 0.1 or higher relative density is not reduced and carrier mobility of a thin film transistor TFT obtained from the sputtering target is increased and thus it is preferable. 0.9 or less is also preferable so that nodules are not created and off current is not increased.

If Ga In Ga Zn is 0.05 or higher White spot is not appeared and off current at the making of a thin film transistor TFT obtained from the sputtering target is not increased and thus it is preferable. 0.6 or less is also preferable so that relative density is increased with reducing bulk resistance and carrier mobility is also increased.

If Zn In Ga Zn is 0.05 or higher White spot is not appeared and there is no adverse effect at the making of a thin film transistor TFT obtained from the sputtering target or at the time of wet etching and thus it is preferable. 0.9 or less is also preferable because there is no chemical unstability and no reduction on moisture resistance at the making of a thin film transistor TFT obtained from the sputtering target.

More preferably 0.2 In In Ga Zn 0.5 1 0.1 Ga In Ga Zn 0.5 2 0.25 Zn In Ga Zn 0.5 3 are met and particularly 0.3 In In Ga Zn 0.5 1 0.3 Ga In Ga Zn 0.5 2 0.3 Zn In Ga Zn 0.5 3 are preferable.

In addition if Ga In Ga Zn 0.38 is met bulk resistance value can be readily reduced even if no element having positive four valences such as Sn or Ge is contained. If such an reduced effect is required Ga In Ga Zn 0.32 is more preferable and Ga In Ga Zn 0.23 is particularly preferable.

It is preferable that when the oxide of the present invention includes a metal element X having positive four or more valences and when total of Indium element In Gallium element Ga Zinc element Zn and the metal element X having positive four or more valences In Ga Zn X are 100 additive amount atom ratio of the metal element X having positive four or more valences is 100 to 10000 ppm preferably 200 ppm to 5000 ppm further preferably 500 ppm to 3000 ppm. If the amount is 100 ppm or higher an effect for the addition is sufficiently obtained. If the amount is 10000 ppm or less an oxide thin film having sufficient stability is obtained then carrier mobility is increased and thus it is preferable.

Among Indium element In Gallium element Ga and Zinc element Zn each of which is contained in the oxide sintered body of the present invention a part of In or Ga is preferably replaced with the metal element X having positive four or more valences. Specifically an oxide sintered body comprising an InGaZnO m crystal phase indicating InMO ZnO type crystal structure in which a part of In or Ga is replaced with the above mentioned metal element having positive four or more valences or an InGaZnOcrystal phase indicating a YbFeO FeO type crystal structure in which a part of In or Ga is replaced with the above mentioned metal element having positive four or more valences is adequate. When the element having positive four or more valences replaces a part of In the element can reduce bulk resistance of a target by producing a carrier.

The fact of the replacement by the aforesaid metal element having positive four or more valences can be confirmed by a shift of interstitial distance calculated from X ray diffraction or by structural analysis using high brightness emitted light.

The oxide sintered body of the present invention preferably has an InGaZnO m crystal phase indicating InMO ZnO type crystal structure or an InGaZnOcrystal phase indicating a YbFeO FeO type crystal structure. The inclusion of these crystal phases in the oxide sintered body of the present invention can be confirmed by checking if X ray diffraction pattern of the oxide of the present invention such as the pattern of a target ground powder corresponds to X ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase which pattern is expected from its composition ratio. Specifically it is confirmed when the pattern corresponds to X ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase obtained from JCPDS Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards cards. For instance whether or not an oxide sintered body includes an InGaZnOcrystal phase and an InGaZnOcrystal phase each of which is one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention can be decided by the correspondence of X ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure with JCPDS card No. 38 1104 and No. 38 1097.

The amount of each crystal phase of a crystal structure of homologous phase of the oxide sintered body of the present invention may be confirmed by strength ratio at the maximum peak of X ray diffraction. Specifically a peak strength of each crystal phase is determined by X ray diffraction and then the amount ratio of the crystal phase of the present invention is obtained from the ratio of the peak area. For example by using an X ray analyzation equipment Ultima III provided by RIGAKU Co. an oxide sintered body is subjected by the X ray analyzation equipment. Assuming that a maximum peak strength for a certain crystal phase is P 1 and that a maximum peak strength for another crystal phase is P 2 a peak strength ratio of P 1 P 2 is preferably 0.05 to 20 more preferably 0.2 to 5 further preferably 0.4 to 2.5 and especially preferably 0.5 to 2. The peak strength ratio calculated above is equal to the content ratio mass ratio of the crystal phases.

If the peak strength ratio content ratio is in 0.05 to 20 bulk resistance is kept in lower level relative density is increased and the appearance of White spot is prevented and thus it is preferable.

More specifically when the maximum peak strength for the oxide crystal represented by InGaZnOis P 1 and when the maximum peak strength for the oxide crystal represented by InGaZnO or InGaZnO is P 2 the peak strength ratio P 1 P 2 is preferably 0.05 to 20 more preferably 0.2 to 5 further preferably 0.4 to 2.5 and especially preferably 0.5 to 2.

The average particle diameter for each oxide crystal is preferably 20 m or less more specifically 0.1 to 10 m and especially preferably 0.2 to 5 m. If the average particle diameter for an oxide crystal is 20 m or less no pores or no hollow foams are produced in a sintered body and no abnormal discharge between a sputtering target and an electrode is occurred during sputtering and thus it is preferable. The average particle diameter means an average particle diameter for the maximum particle diameter and the maximum particle diameters is determined by for example embedding an obtained sintered body in a resin polishing the surface of the body by aluminum particles having particle size of 0.05 and then measuring a maximum particle diameter of Ga In Ocrystal particles at five locations observed within 50 m 50 m square frame of the sintered body surface which is magnified 5000 times by X ray microanalyzer EPMA named JXA 8621MX JOEL Ltd. . Average of the maximum values of the maximum particle diameters in each location the maximum particle diameter for the biggest particle within each location is the average particle diameter for the maximum particle diameters. In this connection a circumscribed diameter the longest diameter for the specific particle is the maximum particle diameter.

A particle diameter ratio between two or more crystals is preferably 0.25 to 4 and more preferably 0.5 to 2. If the particle diameter ratio is 0.25 to 4 no pores or no hollow foams are produced in a sintered body and no abnormal discharge between a sputtering target and an electrode is occurred during sputtering and thus it is preferable.

Each crystal phase for InMO ZnO type and YbFeO FeO type may have an excessive oxygen or an insufficient oxygen oxygen defect as long as its structure is decided by X ray diffraction pattern may meet or not meet stoichiometric ratio but each crystal phase preferably has an oxygen defect. A crystal phase having an oxygen defect is preferable since it can excellently keep bulk resistance when the crystal phase is used for a sputtering target.

The surface of the oxide sintered body of the present invention preferably has no pinhole. The pinhole is a void created between oxide particles during the preparation of the oxide of the present invention by sintering the oxide particles. Presence or absence of the pinhole can be evaluated by horizontal Feret diameter. When the pinhole is deemed as a particle the horizontal Feret diameter is a distance between two parallel lines toward a certain direction in which the lines are clipping the particle. The horizontal Feret diameter can be determined by observing a SEM image. The horizontal Feret diameter of the surface of the oxide of the present invention is preferably 50 pinholes mmor less where the pinholes have 2 m or greater Feret diameter present in an oxide per unit area 1 mm 1 mm . 20 pinholes mmor less is more preferable and 5 pinholes mmor less is further preferable. If the number of pinholes having 2 m or greater Feret diameter is 50 pinholes mmor less and if the oxide of the present invention is used as a sputtering target no abnormal electrical discharge is appeared during sputtering and smoothness of the obtained sputtering film is increased.

Relative density of the oxide sintered body of the present invention is for example 75 or more usually 80 or more preferably 90 or more more preferably 95 or more and especially preferably 99 or more. If relative density is 75 or more when the oxide sintered body of the present invention is used as a sputtering target the target is less breakable and no abnormal electric discharge is occurred and thus it is preferable. The relative density is density relatively calculated from theoretical density obtained by weighted average. A density calculated by weighted average of the density of each crude powder is the theoretical density which density is set as 100 .

It is desirable that the range of variation of the relative density of the oxide sintered body is in 3 and preferably in 1 . The variation is a value indicated by standard deviation against an average value. For example the average and standard deviation are obtained by cutting 20 or more of small pieces out of an oxide and then determining density of each piece.

Bulk resistance of the oxide sintered body of the present invention is for example 0.1 to 17 m cm preferably 0.2 to 10 m cm and more preferably 0.3 to 5 m cm. If the bulk resistance is 0.1 m cm or more no abnormal discharge between particles of a sputtering material during sputtering is caused and thus it is preferable. If the bulk resistance is 17 m cm or less it is preferable since the target is less breakable discharge is not unstable and particles are not increase even when the oxide of the present invention is used as a sputtering target.

In addition it is desirable that the range of variation uniformity of the bulk resistance of the oxide is in 3 and preferably in 1 . The variation is a value indicated by standard deviation against an average value of the bulk resistance. The bulk resistance is determined by for example measuring an oxide surface at 50 or more of equally spaced points by four point probe method using LORESTA Mitsubishi chemical Co. .

It is desirable that the range of variation of the number of positive metal elements other than zinc contained in the oxide sintered body is in 0.5 and preferably in 0.1 . The variation means a value indicated by standard deviation against an average value. For example the average and standard deviation are obtained by cutting 20 or more of small pieces out of an oxide and then determining a content of each positive metal element other than zinc by a plasma emission spectrometer ICP and thus the variation is determined.

Surface roughness Ra of the sputtering target of the present invention is desirably Ra 0.5 m preferably Ra 0.3 m and more preferably Ra 100 nm. No directional character on a polished surface is preferable so that no abnormal discharge is caused and the presence of particles can be reduced. If the surface roughness Ra is 0.5 m or less abnormal discharge during sputtering is inhibited creation of dusts particles of a sputtering material is reduced and thus it is preferable. The surface roughness means center line average roughness.

Bending strength of the spattering target of the present invention is for example preferably 4 kg mmor more more preferably 6 kg mmor more and especially preferably 8 kg mmor more. The bending strength is also known as crossbreaking strength. The bending strength is estimated based on JIS R1601 by using a bending strength tester. If the bending strength is 4 kg mmor more the sputtering target is less breakable during sputtering and the sputtering target is less damaged even when a backing plate as a support of the sputtering target is adhered to the sputtering target or when the sputtering target is transferred.

In addition the sputtering target of the present invention may be prepared by a method including the following essential steps and the following optional steps.

 a an essential step for mixing a crude oxide powder composed of at least indium oxide gallium oxide and zinc oxide mixing step 

 a an optional step for heating the obtained mixture at 500 to 1200 C. for 1 to 100 hours calcining step 

 e an optional step for processing the sintered body to a configuration suitable for loading the body to a sputtering device processing step .

Mixing step is an essential step for mixing metal oxides used as crude materials for a sputtering target.

Crude materials may comprise metal oxides such as oxides of Indium element In Gallium element Ga Zinc element Zn and a metal element X having positive four or more valences.

The crude materials normally use powder such as indium oxide powder zinc oxide powder and gallium oxide powder but an elementary substance thereof a compound thereof or a composite oxide thereof may also be used as the crude materials.

A metal zinc powder zinc powder is preferably used as a part of the crude materials. If zinc powder is used as a part of the crude materials appearance of White spot can be inhibited.

An average diameter of a zinc compound a powder used as the crude material is preferably smaller than that of an indium compound powder. The average diameter of a metal oxide powder for the crude materials can be measured by a method described in JIS R 1619. Indium compounds include for example indium oxide and indium hydroxide. Zinc compounds include for example zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide. Oxide is preferable for each compound because of its ease of sintering or its rareness of remaining by products.

Each of the above crude materials is mixed and ground by known mixing or grinding processes. Purity of each crude material is normally 99.9 3N or more preferably 99.99 4N or more further preferably 99.995 or more and especially preferably 99.999 5N or more. If the purity of each crude material is 99.9 3N or more properties of a semi conductor is not declined by impurities and thus credibility is sufficiently kept. Specifically if Na content is less than 100 ppm credibility at the time of making a thin film transistor is preferably going up.

The above mentioned crude oxide powder is mixed. The mixing is preferably conducted by using a normal mixing and grinding machine for example a wet type ball mill a beads mill or an ultrasonic device so as to mix and grind it uniformly. Average particle diameter of the mixture obtained after the mixing and grinding is usually 10 m or less preferably 1 to 9 m and especially preferably 1 to 6 m. If the average particle diameter is 10 m or less density of a sputtering target to be obtained is preferably high. The average particle diameter can be determined by a method described in JIS R 1619.

Specific surface area of the crude oxide powder is for example 2 to 10 m g and preferably 4 to 8 m g. The difference in the specific surface areas for each crude oxide powder is 5 m g or less preferably 3 m g. If the difference in the specific surface area is smaller the crude oxide powder can be ground and mixed more efficiently and especially it is preferable that no gallium oxide particle is remained in an obtained oxide. In addition it is preferable that the specific surface area for an indium oxide powder is substantially the same as that for a gallium oxide powder so that the crude oxide powder can be ground and mixed more efficiently. In this connection the specific surface area can be determined by for example BET method.

It is preferable that the crude material is a mixed powder comprising an oxide indium powder an oxide gallium powder a zinc powder or a complex oxide powder having the specific surface area of 3 to 16 m g in which the specific area of the whole powder is 3 to 16 m g. The specific surface area of each oxide powder is preferably almost the same as one another. This crude material makes grinding and mixing more effectively. Specifically a ratio of the specific surface area is preferably in to 4 times especially preferably in to 2 times.

The mixed powder is mixed and ground by for example a wet type medium agitating mill. In this connection the mixed powder is preferably ground so that the specific surface area after the grinding is 1.0 to 3.0 m g higher than that of the crude mixed powder or so that an average median diameter after the grinding is around 0.6 to 1 m. By using such a crude powder controlled by the above an oxide sintered body having a high density can be obtained without any calcining step. A reducing step is also unnecessary.

It is preferable that increase in the specific surface area of the above mentioned crude mixed powder is 1.0 m g or more or that the average median diameter after grinding the crude mixed powder is 1 m or less since sintered density is sufficiently high. It is also preferable that increase in the specific surface area of the crude mixed powder is 3.0 m g or less or that the average median diameter after grinding the crude mixed powder is 0.6 m or more since contamination the amount of impurity contaminated from grind devices during grinding is not increase.

The value of the specific surface area for each powder is determined by BET method. The value of the median diameter of grain size distribution for each powder is determined by a grain size distribution meter. These values can be adjusted by grinding the powder using a dry type grinding method or a wet type grinding method.

During the mixing and grinding water or ethanol containing about 1 vol. of polyvinyl alcohol PVA may be used as a medium.

Median diameter d50 of the crude oxide powder is for example 0.5 to 20 m and preferably 1 to 10 m. The median diameter d50 of the crude oxide powder is preferably 0.5 m or more so that sintered density is not reduced so as not to make any air vessels in a sintered body. The median diameter d50 of the crude oxide powder is preferably 20 m or less so that particle diameter of the sintered body is not increased.

A method for preparing a sputtering target of the present invention may contain a step for calcining the obtained mixture after the step a .

In this calcining step the mixture obtained by the above mentioned a step is calcined. By the calcining density of a sputtering target obtained at the end can be readily increased.

The mixture obtained by a step is desirably heated at 500 to 1200 C. preferably at 800 to 1200 C. for 1 to 100 hours and preferably for 2 to 50 hours at the calcining step. Such a heating condition at 500 C. or more for 1 hour or more is desirable since thermal decomposition of an indium compound a zinc compound and a tin compound is sufficiently conducted. A heating condition at 1200 C. or less for 100 hours or less is also desirable since particles rarely create a bulk.

The obtained calcined products are preferably ground before the following forming step and the sintering step. This grinding of the calcined products is preferably conducted by a ball mill a roll mill a palm mill or a jet mill. Average particle diameter of the calcined products after the grinding is for example 0.01 to 3.0 m and preferably 0.1 to 2.0 m. It is preferable that the average particle diameter of the calcined products is 0.01 m or higher since sufficient bulk specific gravity is retained and it is easy to handling it. It is also preferable that the average particle diameter of the calcined products is 1.0 m or less since density of a sputtering target obtained at the end can be readily increased.

The average particle diameter of the calcined products can be determined by a method described in JIS R 1619.

The forming step is a step of press forming the mixture of metal oxides or the calcined products if the above calcining step is present so as to make a formed body. By this step the mixture or calcined products is formed in a configuration appropriate for a sputtering target. If there is a calcining step micro powders of the obtained calcined products may be granulated and then formed in a desirable configuration by a press forming.

Forming processing which can be used in the present invention includes for example uniaxial compression metal molding casting forming injection molding and so on. In order to obtain a sintered body a sputtering target having high sintered density forming by cold isostatic press CIP is preferable.

During the forming processing a forming auxiliary agent such as polyvinyl alcohol methyl cellulose polywax or oleic acid may be used.

The press forming may be conducted by wet processes and dry processes which were known in the art. The dry processes include Cold Press method and Hot Press method.

The press forming is also conducted at ambient temperature 25 C. under 100 to 100000 kg cm and preferably 500 to 10000 kg cm.

The Cold Press method and Hot Press method are explained in detail below. By the Cold Press method a mixed powder is filled in a forming die to prepare a formed body and then the body is sintered. By the Hot Press method a mixed powder is directly sintered in a forming die. In the Hot Press method a mixed powder is directly sintered usually at 700 to 1000 C. for 1 to 48 hours and preferably at 800 to 950 C. for 3 to 24 hours.

As for the Cold Press method of the dry processes a crude material obtained after a grinding step is dried by a spray dryer and so on and then formed. The forming may be conducted by methods known in the art for example press forming cold isostatic press metal molding casting forming or injection molding. In order to obtain a sintered body a sputtering target having high sintered density the forming is preferably conducted by a method accompany with cold isostatic press CIP . During the forming processing a forming auxiliary agent such as polyvinyl alcohol methyl cellulose polywax or oleic acid may be used.

Next a formed product obtained by the above is sintered and then provide a sintered body. The sintering is desirably conducted under oxygen atmosphere by flowing oxygen or conducted under compression. By sintering under these conditions zinc transpiration is inhibited and a sintered body having no void cavity can be obtained. The sintered body produced by the above has high density so that fewer nodules or fewer particles are made. Therefore an oxide semi conductor film having excellent film properties is prepared.

Rate of temperature increase up to 1000 C. is preferably 30 C. hour or more and rate of temperature decrease for cooling is preferably 30 C. hour or more. If the rate of temperature increase is 30 C. hour or more decomposition of oxides does not progress and no pinhole is appeared. If the rate of temperature decrease for cooling is 30 C. hour or more the composition ratio of In or Ga does not change.

A filtering forming method see Japanese published unexamined application No. 11 286002 is preferably used as the above mentioned wet processes. This filtering forming method uses a filtering forming die comprising a water insoluble material which is used for obtaining a formed body by vacuum pumping water out from ceramic crude material slurry. The body comprises a lower forming die having one or more drain holes a filter having water flowable property in which filter is placed on the lower forming die and a forming die flame which clips the filter from the upper side through a seal material for sealing it. Each of the lower forming die the forming die flame the sealing material and the filter is disassemblably structured. By using the filtering forming die which vacuum pumps water in the slurry out only from the filter side slurry containing mixed powder ion exchange water and an organic additive is prepared. This slurry is injected in the filtering forming die and then a formed body is prepared by vacuum pumping water in the slurry out only from the filter side. After the obtained ceramic formed body is dry delipidated the body is sintered.

In order to homogenize bulk resistance of the sintered body obtained by the dry or wet processes as a whole oxide a reducing step is preferably contained. The applicable reducing step includes for example a method using a reducing gas reduction by vacuum heating or reduction by an inert gas. The reducing process by a reducing gas may use hydrogen methane carbon monoxide or a mixed gas containing these gases and oxygen. The reducing process by sintering in an inert gas may use nitrogen argon or a mixed gas containing these gases and oxygen. Temperature at the reducing step is usually 300 to 1200 C. and preferably 500 to 800 C. Time period for the reducing process is usually 0.01 to 10 hours preferably 0.5 to 5 hours.

An oxide sintered body may become a target by processing such as grinding. Specifically the sintered body is ground by a flat surface grinding machine to make surface roughness Ra of it up to 5 m. The surface roughness is preferably Ra 0.3 m and especially preferably Ra 0.1 m. Furthermore mirror like finishing is provided on a sputter side of the target and then average surface roughness Ra of it is preferably 1000 angstrom or less. The mirror like finishing grinding may be conducted by known grinding techniques such as mechanical grinding chemical grinding mechanochemical grinding combination of mechanical grinding and chemical grinding . For example a fixed abrasive grain polisher polish liquid water is used for polishing 2000 or more or a free abrasive grain lap abrasive SiC paste etc. is used for lapping and then the abrasive may be changed to a diamond paste so as to lap and obtain an end product. However such a grinding method is not limited to the above.

A cleaning processing of a target may use air blow flowing water cleaning etc. Eliminating foreign substances by the air blow can be efficiently conducted by vacuuming air using a dust collector from the opposite side of a nozzle.

That is the target of the present invention can be used as a conductive film. The reducing may contain hydrogen plasma processing nitrogen plasma processing argon plasma processing vacuum superheating superheating under hydrogen atmosphere or UV irradiation.

Prior to a sputtering a sputtering target is adhered bonding on a support. This is for fixing a target to a sputtering device.

Sputtering is carried out using the bonded sputtering target to obtain an amorphous oxide thin film containing In Ga and Zn oxides as major ingredients on a substrate.

Although a crystalline material a multi crystalline material or an amorphous material may be used a multi crystalline material or an amorphous material each of which is readily produced is preferable. It is especially preferable that a protective layer is an amorphous material. If a protective layer is an amorphous material interfacial smoothness is improved high carrier mobility is kept and neither threshold voltage nor S value becomes too high.

The S value Swing Factor is a value for indicating steepness of drain current which rises rapidly from OFF position to ON position when gate voltage is increased from Off position. As defined by the following formula increment of gate voltage when drain current increases single digit 10 times is S value. value log 

Lower S value means high steepness in rising cf. Yasuhiro Ukai Hakumaku trangista gijutu no subete All about Thin Film Transistor Technique Kogyo Chosa Kai 2007 . If S value is high high gate voltage is required for switching from ON to OFF and then there is possibility that electric power consumption becomes high.

S value is preferably 0.8V dec or less more preferably 0.3V dec or less further preferably 0.25V dec or less and especially preferably 0.2V dec or less. If S value is more than 0.8V dec there is possibility that driving voltage becomes high and then electric power consumption also becomes high. Especially when the thin film transistor is used for an organic light emitting display because of direct current drive S value is preferably 0.3V dec or less so as to enormously reduce electric power consumption.

Substrate 1 such as a grass substrate is prepared and then Ti having thickness of 1 to 100 nm a contact layer Au having thickness of 10 to 300 nm a connecting layer and Ti having thickness of 1 to 100 nm a contact layer are laminated in this order. The laminated layers are formed a gate electrode 2 by a photo lithography method and a lift off method.

In this connection by changing order of steps making of a protective film as shown in FIGS. and etching stopper may be conducted prior to the preparation of the above source electrode and drain electrode.

The amorphous oxide thin film obtained above may be used as is or by heating treatment used as a thin film transistor a channel layer for a thin film transistor or a semi conductor film of a solar cell or a gas sensor.

 4 1 The thin film transistor prepared by the present invention is explained below. The thin film transistor includes a substrate a semi conductor layer a protective layer for a semi conductor layer a gate insulation film or an electrode.

As for a substrate any substrate known in the present technical field may be used without limitation. For example a glass substrate such as alkaline silicate type glass alkali free glass or quartz glass a silicon substrate a resin substrate such as acryl polycarbonate or polyethylene naphthalate PEN or a polymer film base material such as polyethylene terephthalate PET or polyamide can be used. Thickness of substrate or base material is usually 0.1 to 10 mm preferably 0.3 to 5 mm. If a grass substrate is used a chemically or thermally enhanced grass substrate is preferable. If transparency or smoothness is required a glass substrate and a resin substrate are preferable and a glass substrate is especially preferable. If weight saving is required a resin substrate or a polymer base material is preferable.

A semi conductor layer includes a composite oxide of In indium Zn zinc and Ga gallium . Such a semi conductor layer can be prepared for example by forming a thin film using a composite oxide target of the present invention a target for a semi conductor .

In the present invention the semi conductor layer is preferably an amorphous film. By using such an amorphous film its contact property to an insulation film or a protective layer has improved and then uniform transistor property can be easily obtained even if it is large area. Whether or not the semi conductor layer is an amorphous film can be confirmed by X ray crystal structure analysis. If no clear peak is monitored the semi conductor layer is amorphous.

Electric carrier concentration of the semi conductor layer is preferably 10to 10 cm and especially preferably 10to 10 cm. If electric carrier concentration is in the above range the semi conductor layer becomes readily a non degeneration semi conductor and then balance between mobility and ON OFF ratio is preferably improved when it is used as a transistor. Band gap is preferably 2.0 to 6.0 eV and more preferably 2.8 to 5.0 eV. If the band gap is 2.0 eV or more a field effect type transistor causes less improper operation by absorbing visible light. If the band gap is 6.0 eV or less a field effect type transistor rarely lose its function by less supplement of carrier.

A semi conductor layer is preferably a non degeneration semi conductor having thermal active property. If a non degeneration semi conductor is used some disadvantages such as off current and gate leak current increase caused by excess of carrier or normally ON caused by negative threshold can be avoided. Whether or not the semi conductor layer is a non degeneration semi conductor can be confirmed by measuring mobility and carrier density as a result of temperature changes using Hall effect. In order to make a semi conductor layer being a non degeneration semi conductor partial pressure for oxygen during preparing a film is adjusted and carrier density is optimized by post treatment for controlling the number of oxygen defects.

Surface roughness of the semi conductor layer RMS is preferably 1 nm or less more preferably 0.6 nm or less and especially preferably 0.3 nm or less. If RMS is 1 nm or less mobility would not be reduced.

The semi conductor layer is preferably an amorphous film maintaining at least a part of an edge sharing structure in a bixbite structure of indium oxide. Whether the amorphous film containing indium oxide maintains at least a part of an edge sharing structure in a bixbite structure of indium oxide may be confirmed by radial distribution function RDF obtained by Grazing Incidence X ray Scattering GIXS in which a peak showing In X X is In or Zn is in 0.3 to 0.36 nm specifically see F. Utsuno et al. Thin Solid Films Volume 496 2006 pp. 95 98 .

Assuming that the maximum value of RDF where atomic distance is between 0.30 and 0.36 nm is A and that the maximum value of RDF where atomic distance is between 0.36 nm and 0.42 nm is B A B 0.7 is preferable A B 0.85 is more preferable A B 1 is further preferable and A B 1.2 is especially preferable.

If A B is 0.7 or more mobility is rarely reduced and threshold or S value is rarely increased too high. Small A B seems to reflect poor short distance orderliness in an amorphous film.

Average bond distance of In In is preferably 0.3 to 0.322 nm and especially preferably 0.31 to 0.32 nm. Average bond distance of In In can be measured by X ray absorption spectroscopy. The measurement by the X ray absorption spectroscopy shows extended X ray absorption fine structure EXAFS expanded from rising to a high energy portion such as several hundred eV higher. EXAFS is caused by backscattering of electrons by atoms surrounding excited atoms. Interference effect between releasing electron wave and backscattered wave is occurred. The interference depends on wavelength of electron state and light path length traversing between surrounding excited atoms. Radial distribution function RDF is obtained by conducting Fourier transform of EXAFS. Average bond distance can be estimated from RDF peak.

Film thickness of the semi conductor layer is normally 0.5 to 500 nm preferably 1 to 150 nm more preferably 3 to 80 nm and especially preferably 10 to 60 nm. If the thickness is 0.5 nm or more industrial uniform film forming is possible. If the thickness is 500 nm or less film forming time is not too long. If the thickness is between 3 and 80 nm TFT properties such as mobility or ON OFF ratio are especially improved.

Preferred embodiment of the present invention is that the semi conductor layer is an amorphous film and that energy width E of delocalized level is 14 meV or less. The energy width E of delocalized level of the semi conductor layer is preferably 10 meV or less more preferably 8 meV and especially preferably 6 meV. If the energy width E of delocalized level is 14 meV or less and if the semi conductor layer is used as an active layer for a transistor mobility is rarely reduced and threshold or S value is rarely increased too high. High energy width E of delocalized level of the semi conductor layer seems to reflect poor short distance orderliness in an amorphous film.

The thin film transistor preferably has a protective layer of a semi conductor. If there is a protective layer of a semi conductor oxygen in a surface layer of a semi conductor is not left even under vacuum or low pressure off current is not increased and threshold voltage does not become negative. There is no environmental effect such as humidity even under atmospheric pressure and there is no risk of increasing variation in transistor properties such as threshold voltage.

There is no limitation for selecting material to form the protective layer of a semi conductor. Any material commonly used may be chosen unless feature of the present invention is lost. For example SiO SiNx AlO TaO TiO MgO ZrO CeO KO LiO NaO RbO ScO YO HfO CaHfO PbTi BaTaO SrTiO AlN etc. Among these oxides SiO SiNx AlO YO HfO and CaHfOare preferably used SiO SiNx YO HfO and CaHfOare more preferable SiO YO HfO and CaHfOare especially preferable. Number of oxygen in these oxides does not always have to correspond to stoichiometric ratio e.g. SiOas well as SiOx are allowed . SiOx may contain hydrogen element.

Such a protective film may have a laminated structure containing two or more different kinds of insulation film. The protective film may be a crystalline material a multi crystalline material or an amorphous material. A multi crystalline material or an amorphous material each of which is readily industrially produced is preferable. It is especially preferable that the protective layer is an amorphous material. If a protective layer is an amorphous material interfacial smoothness is improved mobility is not lowered and neither threshold voltage nor S value becomes too high.

The protective layer of a semi conductor layer is preferably an amorphous oxide or an amorphous nitride and an amorphous oxide is especially preferable. If the protective layer is an oxide oxygen in a semi conductor does not transfer to a protective layer side OFF current does not become high and there is no risk to show normally OFF caused by negative threshold voltage. The protective layer of the semi conductor layer may use an organic insulation film such as poly 4 vinylphenol PVP or parylene. The protective layer of the semi conductor layer may have two or more layer laminated structure including an inorganic insulation film and an organic insulation film.

There is no limitation for selecting material to form the gate insulation film. Any material commonly used may be chosen unless feature of the invention related to the present embodiment is lost. For example SiO SiNx AlO TaO TiO MgO ZrO CeO KO LiO NaO RbO ScO YO HfO CaHfO PbTi BaTaO SrTiO AlN etc. Among these oxides SiO SiNx AlO YO HfO and CaHfOare preferably used SiO SiNx YO HfO and CaHfOare more preferable. Number of oxygen in these oxides does not always have to correspond to stoichiometric ratio e.g. SiOas well as SiOx are allowed . SiOx may contain hydrogen element.

Such a gate insulation film may have a laminated structure containing two or more different kinds of insulation film. The gate insulation film may be a crystalline material a multi crystalline material or an amorphous material. A multi crystalline material or an amorphous material each of which is readily industrially produced is preferable. The gate insulation film may use an organic insulation film such as poly 4 vinylphenol PVP or parylene. The gate insulation film may have two or more layer laminated structure including an inorganic insulation film and an organic insulation film.

There is no limitation for selecting material to form each electrode such as a gate electrode a source electrode and a drain electrode. Any material commonly used may be chosen unless feature of the present invention is lost.

For example the material includes a transparent electrode such as indium tin oxide ITO indium zinc oxide ZnO or SnO a metal electrode such as Al Ag Cr Ni Mo Au Ti Ta or Cu or an alloyed metal electrode contained thereof. These materials are preferably laminated two or more layers to reduce contact resistance and to enhance interface strength. In order to reduce contact resistance of a source electrode and a drain electrode the interface between them and an electrode of a semi conductor may be subject to plasma treatment and ozone treatment so as to control their resistance.

The making method of the present invention is characterized by using the sputtering target of the above mentioned present invention and by comprising a step for forming a semi conductor layer and a step for heat treating it at 70 to 350 C. after forming the semi conductor layer.

In this connection each contractual element layer of the above mentioned thin film transistor may be formed by any method known in the present technical field.

Specifically a film forming method includes a chemical film forming method such as a spray method a dip method or a CVD method and a physical film forming method such as a sputter method a vacuum deposition method an ion plating method or a pulse laser deposition method. A physical film forming method is preferable since carrier density is readily controlled and film quality is easily improved. A sputter method is more preferable because of its high productivity.

Sputtering includes a method using a sintered target of a composite oxide a method using a cosputter by multiple sintered targets and a method using a reactive sputter by an alloy target. A sintered target of a composite oxide is preferably used. RF DC or AC sputtering known in the art is also useful. DC or AC sputtering is preferable in view of uniformity and mass productivity facility costs .

In the present invention a semi conductive film is preferably formed using the target of the present invention by DC or AC sputtering. By using DC or AC sputtering damage at the film forming can be reduced in comparison with an RF sputtering. Therefore in a case with a field effect type transistor reduction of threshold voltage shift enhancement of mobility reduction of threshold voltage reduction of S value and so on can be expected.

In the present invention heat treatment is preferably conducted at 70 to 350 C. after film forming of a semi conductor layer. Especially the heat treatment is preferably conducted at 70 to 350 C. after forming a semi conductor layer and a protective layer of the semi conductor layer. If the temperature is 70 C. or more the obtained transistor may keep its sufficient heat stability heat resistance and sufficient mobility and there is no rick to become S value or threshold voltage too high. If the temperature is 350 C. or less a substrate having no heat resistance can be used and facility cost for heat treatment is not necessary.

Heat treating temperature is more preferably 80 to 260 C. further preferably 90 to 180 C. and especially preferably 100 to 150 C. Specifically if the heat treating temperature is 180 C. or less it is preferable because a resin substrate having low heat resistance such as PEN can be used as a substrate.

Heat treating time is usually preferably 1 second to 24 hours but it is also preferable that the heat treating time is controlled based on treating temperature. For example when the temperature is from 70 to 180 C. 10 minutes to 24 hours is more preferable 20 minutes to 6 hours is further preferable and 30 minutes to 3 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 180 to 260 C. 6 minutes to 4 hours is more preferable and 15 minutes to 2 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 260 to 300 C. 30 seconds to 4 hours is more preferable and 1 minute to 2 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 300 to 350 C. 1 second to 1 hour is more preferable and 2 seconds to 30 minutes is especially preferable.

Heat treatment is preferably conducted in an inert gas under 10Pa or less of oxygen partial pressure or after a semi conductor layer is covered with a protective layer. If either of conditions is selected reproducibility is improved.

In the thin film transistor of the present invention mobility is preferably 1 cmNs or more more preferably 3 cm Vs or more and especially preferably 8 cmNs or more. If the mobility is 1 cmNs or more switching rate does not become slow and then the transistor is preferably used for big screen high fineness display.

OFF current is preferably 2 pA or less and more preferably 1 pA or less. If the OFF current is 2 pA or less sufficient contrast is obtained and excellent uniformity of display is also obtained when the transistor is used for TFT of the display.

Gate leak current is preferably 1 pA or less. If the gate leak current is 1 pA or more excellent contrast is obtained when the transistor is used for TFT of the display.

Threshold voltage is usually 0 to 10V preferably 0 to 4V more preferably 0 to 3V and especially preferably 0 to 2V. If the threshold voltage is 0V or more normally ON is avoided no voltage is needed during OFF and then electric power consumption can be kept lower. If the threshold voltage is 10V or more driving voltage can be kept lower electric power consumption can be kept lower and mobility can also be kept lower.

S value is preferably 0.8V dec or less more preferably 0.3V dec or less further preferably 0.25V dec or less and especially preferably 0.2V dec or less. If S value is 0.8V dec or less driving voltage does not become higher and then electric power consumption becomes lower. Especially when the transistor is used for an organic light emitting display because of direct current drive if S value is 0.3V dec or less electric power consumption is preferably and enormously reduced.

Threshold voltage shift between before and after applying 10 pA of direct current voltage at 50 C. for 100 hours is preferably 1.0V or less and more preferably 0.5V or less. If the shift is 1.0V or less image quality does not change if the transistor is used for a transistor of an organic light emitting display.

Ratio of channel width W and channel length L W L is normally 0.1 to 100 preferably 0.5 to 20 and especially preferably 1 to 8. If W L is 100 or less leak current does not increase ON OFF ratio would be lowered. If W L is 0.1 or more field effect mobility is not lowered and pinch off becomes clear. The channel length L is normally 0.1 to 1000 m preferably 1 to 100 m and more preferably 2 to 10 m. If the channel length L is 0.1 m or more there is no possibility to become industrial manufacture difficult and to become leak current higher. If the channel length L is 1000 m or less an element does not become too big.

The field effect type transistor of the present invention preferably has a structure for shading a semi conductor layer. If there is a structure for shading a semi conductor layer e.g. a shading layer there is no possibility to excite a carrier electron when light comes in the semi conductor layer and then to become OFF current higher. The shading layer preferably includes a thin film having absorption between 300 nm and 800 nm. The shading layer may be located on either upper or lower portion of the semi conductor layer but the shading layer is preferably located on both upper and lower portions. The shading layer may also be used as a gate insulation film and a black matrix. If the shading layer is present only on one side it is necessary to improve its structure not to radiate light to a semi conductor layer from another side where no shading layer is present.

The field effect type transistor of the present invention may have a contact layer between a semi conductor layer and a source electrode or a drain electrode. The contact layer preferably has lower resistance than that of a semi conductor layer. Forming materials of the contact layer may include a composite oxide having similar composition to that of the above mentioned semi conductor layer. That is the contact layer preferably contains each element such as In Zn or Zr. If these elements are included transfer of elements between the contact layer and the semi conductor layer is not occurred and threshold voltage shift during stress test etc. does not become too big.

There is not limitation for a preparation method of the contact layer but a contact layer having the same composition ratio as that of the semi conductor layer may be formed by changing film forming conditions a layer having different composition ratio from that of the semi conductor layer may be formed a layer may be constructed by heightening resistance at a portion contacting with an electrode of the semi conductor by plasma treatment or ozone treatment or a layer having higher resistance by varying film forming conditions such as partial pressure for oxygen may be formed during forming a semi conductor. The field effect type transistor of the present invention preferably contains an oxygen resistance layer having a resistance higher than that of the semi conductor layer between a semi conductor layer and a gate insulation layer and or between a semi conductor layer and a protective layer. If there is an oxide resistance layer OFF current is not detected normally ON caused by negative threshold can be avoided and there is no deterioration on properties caused by changing semi conductor s quality during post treating step such as forming a protective film or etching.

The composition ratio for the element X is preferably higher than that of the semi conductor layer.

The oxide resistance layer is preferably an oxide containing In and Zn. If these elements are contained transfer of elements between the oxide resistance layer and the semi conductor layer is not occurred and threshold voltage shift during stress test etc. does not become too big.
