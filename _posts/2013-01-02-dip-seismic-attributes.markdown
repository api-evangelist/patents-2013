Seismic interpretation is a process that may examine seismic data e.g. with respect to location and time or depth in an effort to identify subsurface structures e.g. horizons faults geobodies etc. . Structures may be for example stratigraphic formations indicative of hydrocarbon traps or flow channels. In the field of resource extraction enhancements to seismic interpretation can increase accuracy of a model of a geologic environment which in turn may improve seismic volume analysis for purposes of resource extraction. Various techniques described herein pertain to processing of seismic data for example for analysis of such data e.g. for identifying structures in a geologic environment .

A method can include receiving a request for a dip value for a location within a sub surface volume responsive to the request locating complementary dip values for locations within the sub surface volume where the location for the requested dip value lies within bounds defined by the locations for the complementary dips values and interpolating a value for the requested dip value based on the complementary dip values. In such a method where the requested dip value is a value for a positive dip the complementary dip values may be for negative dips and where the requested dip value is a value for a negative dip the complementary dip values may be for positive dips. A system can include one or more processors memory and instructions to instruct the system to responsive to a request for a dip value for a location within a sub surface volume locate complimentary dip values for locations within the sub surface volume where the location for the requested dip value lies within bounds defined by the locations for the complementary dips values and interpolate a value for the requested dip value based on the complementary dip values. Computer readable storage media can include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to receive estimated dip values determined using volumetric seismic data and a dip estimation technique calculate interpolated dip values based on the received estimated dip values and render the interpolated dip values to a display. Various other apparatuses systems methods etc. are also disclosed.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the implementations. The scope of the described implementations should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims.

Seismic interpretation is a process that involves examining seismic data e.g. with respect to location and time or depth to identify one or more types of subsurface structures e.g. horizons faults geobodies etc. . When performing seismic interpretation seismic data may be provided in the form of traces where for example each trace is an amplitude versus time recording of energy emitted by a source that has interacted with various subsurface structures. An interpretation process may involve visual display of seismic data and interaction using one or more tools e.g. executable instruction modules stored in memory and executed by one or more processors . An interpretation process may consider vertical seismic sections inline and crossline directions horizontal seismic sections called horizontal time slices etc. Seismic data may optionally be interpreted with other data such as for example well log data.

As an example an interpretation process may include accessing seismic data from a data store e.g. via a network or other connection . Seismic data may be formatted according to one of the SEG Y format standards Society of Exploration Geophysicists the ZGY format standard e.g. a bricked format or another format. As an example seismic data may be stored with trace header information which may assist in analysis of the seismic data. Seismic data may optionally be accessed for example according to a number of traces e.g. in an inline crossline or inline and crossline directions which may be entire traces or portions thereof e.g. for one or more particular times or depths . As an example given a number of traces across a region a process may access some of those traces in a sub region by specifying inline and crossline indexes e.g. or geographic or grid coordinates as well as a time or depth window.

An interpretation process may include determining one or more seismic attributes. A seismic attribute may be considered for example a way to describe quantify etc. characteristic content of seismic data. As an example a quantified characteristic may be computed measured etc. from seismic data. A seismic attribute may be a rate of change of a quantity or quantities with respect to time space or both time and space. As an example a seismic attribute may provide for examination of seismic data in an amplitude domain in a time domain or in another manner. As an example a seismic attribute may be based on another seismic attribute e.g. a second derivative seismic attribute may be based on a first derivative seismic attribute etc. .

An interpretation framework may include modules e.g. processor executable instructions stored in memory to determine one or more seismic attributes. Seismic attributes may optionally be classified for example as volume attributes or surface attributes. As an example a volume attribute may be an attribute computed from a seismic cube and may result in a new seismic cube that includes information pertaining to the volume attribute. As an example a surface attribute may be a value associated with a surface of a seismic cube that includes information pertaining to a volume attribute.

A seismic interpretation may be performed using displayable information for example by rendering information to a display device a projection device a printing device etc. As an example one or more color schemes e.g. optionally including black and white or greyscale may be referenced for displayable information to enhance visual examination of the displayable information. A color scheme may include a palette a range etc. A look up table LUT or other data structure function e.g. linear or non linear etc. may allow for mapping of values associated with one or more seismic attributes to intensity colors e.g. RGB YCbCr etc. etc. Where the human eye will be used or is used for viewing displayable information a display scheme may be selected to enhance interpretation e.g. to increase contrast provide for blinking etc. .

A module for determining one or more seismic attributes may include one or more parameters. As an example a module may include one or more parameters that may be set via a graphic user interface a specification file etc. In such an example an interpreter may wish to examine a seismic attribute for seismic data using one or more values of a parameter. As an example such a module may provide a default value and a field graphical control etc. that allows for input of a value other than the default value.

As an example seismic interpretation may be performed using seismic to simulation software such as the PETREL seismic to simulation software framework Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. which includes various features to perform attribute analyses e.g. with respect to a 3D seismic cube a 2D seismic line etc. . While the PETREL seismic to simulation software framework is mentioned other types of software frameworks etc. may be employed for purposes of attribute analyses.

In the example of the management components include a seismic data component an additional information component e.g. well logging data a processing component a simulation component an attribute component an analysis visualization component and a workflow component . In operation seismic data and other information provided per the components and may be input to the simulation component .

In an example embodiment the simulation component may rely on entities . Entities may include earth entities or geological objects such as wells surfaces reservoirs geobodies etc. In the system the entities can include virtual representations of actual physical entities that are reconstructed for purposes of simulation. The entities may include entities based on data acquired via sensing observation interpretation etc. e.g. the seismic data and other information .

In an example embodiment the simulation component may rely on a software framework such as an object based framework. In such a framework entities may include entities based on pre defined classes to facilitate modeling and simulation. A commercially available example of an object based framework is the MICROSOFT .NET framework Redmond Wash. which provides a set of extensible object classes. In the .NET framework an object class encapsulates a module of reusable code and associated data structures. Object classes can be used to instantiate object instances for use in by a program script etc. For example borehole classes may define objects for representing boreholes based on well data geobody classes may define objects for representing geobodies based on seismic data etc. As an example an interpretation process that includes generation of one or more seismic attributes may provide for definition of a geobody using one or more classes. Such a process may occur via user input e.g. user interaction semi automatically or automatically e.g. via a feature extraction process based at least in part on one or more seismic attributes .

In the example of the simulation component may process information to conform to one or more attributes specified by the attribute component which may include a library of attributes. Such processing may occur prior to input to the simulation component . Alternatively or in addition the simulation component may perform operations on input information based on one or more attributes specified by the attribute component . In an example embodiment the simulation component may construct one or more models of the geologic environment which may be relied on to simulate behavior of the geologic environment e.g. responsive to one or more acts whether natural or artificial . In the example of the analysis visualization component may allow for interaction with a model or model based results attributes etc. In an example embodiment output from the simulation component the attribute component or one or more other components may be input to one or more other workflows as indicated by a workflow component e.g. for triggering another process .

In an example embodiment the management components may include features of a commercially available simulation framework such as the PETREL seismic to simulation software framework. The PETREL framework provides components that allow for optimization of exploration and development operations. The PETREL framework includes seismic to simulation software components that can output information for use in increasing reservoir performance for example by improving asset team productivity. Through use of such a framework various professionals e.g. geophysicists geologists and reservoir engineers can develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes. Such a framework may be considered an application and may be considered a data driven application e.g. where data is input for purposes of simulating a geologic environment .

In an example embodiment various aspects of the management components may include add ons or plug ins that operate according to specifications of a framework environment. For example a commercially available framework environment marketed as the OCEAN framework environment Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. allows for seamless integration of add ons or plug ins into a PETREL framework workflow. The OCEAN framework environment leverages .NET tools Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. and offers stable user friendly interfaces for efficient development. In an example embodiment various components e.g. or modules may be implemented as add ons or plug ins that conform to and operate according to specifications of a framework environment e.g. according to application programming interface API specifications etc. .

The model simulation layer may provide domain objects act as a data source provide for rendering and provide for various user interfaces . Rendering may provide a graphical environment in which applications can display their data while the user interfaces may provide a common look and feel for application user interface components.

In the example of the domain objects can include entity objects property objects and optionally other objects. Entity objects may be used to geometrically represent wells surfaces reservoirs geobodies etc. while property objects may be used to provide property values as well as data versions and display parameters. For example an entity object may represent a well where a property object provides log information as well as version information and display information e.g. to display the well as part of a model .

In the example of data may be stored in one or more data sources or data stores generally physical data storage devices which may be at the same or different physical sites and accessible via one or more networks. The model simulation layer may be configured to model projects. As such a particular project may be stored where stored project information may include inputs models results and cases. Thus upon completion of a modeling session a user may store a project. At a later time the project can be accessed and restored using the model simulation layer which can recreate instances of the relevant domain objects.

In the example of the geologic environment may be outfitted with any of a variety of sensors detectors actuators etc. For example equipment may include communication circuitry to receive and to transmit information with respect to one or more networks . Such information may include information associated with downhole equipment which may be equipment to drill acquire information assist with resource recovery etc. Other equipment may be located remote from a well site and include sensing detecting emitting or other circuitry. Such equipment may include storage and communication circuitry to store and to communicate data instructions etc. The geologic environment also shows various wells e.g. wellbores and . In the example of the downhole equipment may include a drill for drilling the well .

The framework may provide for modeling the geologic environment including the wells and as well as stratigraphic layers lithologies faults etc. The framework may create a model with one or more grids for example defined by nodes where a numerical technique can be applied to relevant equations discretized according to at least one of the one or more grids. As an example the framework may provide for performing a simulation of phenomena associated with the geologic environment using at least a portion of a grid. As to performing a simulation such a simulation may include interpolating geological rock types interpolating petrophysical properties simulating fluid flow or other calculating e.g. or a combination of any of the foregoing .

Seismic interpretation may aim to identify and classify one or more subsurface boundaries based at least in part on azimuth and dip e.g. dip angle . Dip is the angle of slope of a plane from a horizontal plane e.g. an imaginary plane measured in a vertical plane in a specific direction. A dipping plane may be defined by dip angle e.g. also known as magnitude or amount and azimuth e.g. also known as direction . As shown in the diagram of azimuth may be defined as a direction with respect to a surface whereas dip angle e.g. or dip may be defined as the angle of that surface. In terms of attitude strike direction may be defined as a compass bearing of a horizontal line on a dipping layer where dip may be the angle of the inclination of the bed measured perpendicular to the strike direction. Azimuth e.g. direction may be specified by a compass direction e.g. 0 degrees to 360 degrees for example based on the strike of a dipping plane. As an example dip can be defined as the steepest angle of descent of a tilted bed or feature relative to a horizontal plane and may be specified using an angle between 0 degrees and 90 degrees and optionally a letter e.g. N S E and W or other moniker to denote an approximate direction in which the bed is dipping. As an example various types of features may be described at least in part by dip at least in part by azimuth etc. e.g. sedimentary bedding faults and fractures cuestas igneous dikes and sills metamorphic foliation etc. .

Some additional terms related to dip and strike may apply to an analysis for example depending on circumstances orientation of collected data etc. One term is true dip . True dip is the dip of a plane measured exactly perpendicular to strike and also the maximum possible value of dip magnitude. Another term is apparent dip . Apparent dip may be the dip of a plane as measured in any other direction except in the direction of true dip however it is possible that the apparent dip is equal to the true dip. For example the term apparent dip e.g. in an analysis for a particular dipping plane may be equivalent to the true dip of that particular dipping plane.

As shown in the diagram of a geobody may be present in a geologic environment see also e.g. the geologic environment of . For example the geobody may be a salt dome. A salt dome may be a mushroom shaped or plug shaped diapir made of salt and may have an overlying cap rock. Salt domes can form as a consequence of the relative buoyancy of salt when buried beneath other types of sediment. Hydrocarbons may be found at or near a salt dome due to formation of traps due to salt movement in association evaporite mineral sealing. Buoyancy differentials can cause salt to begin to flow vertically e.g. as a salt pillow which may cause faulting. In the diagram the geobody is met by layers which may each be defined by a dip angle .

As mentioned seismic data may be acquired for a region in the form of traces. In the example of the diagram shows acquisition equipment emitting energy from a source e.g. a transmitter and receiving reflected energy via one or more sensors e.g. receivers strung along an inline direction. As the region includes layers and a geobody energy emitted by a transmitter of the acquisition equipment can reflect off the layers and the geobody . Evidence of such reflections may be found in the acquired traces. As to the portion of a trace energy received may be discretized by an analog to digital converter that operates at a sampling rate. For example the acquisition equipment may convert energy signals sensed by sensor Q to digital samples at a rate of one sample per approximately 4 ms. Given a speed of sound in a medium or media a sample rate may be converted to an approximate distance. For example the speed of sound in rock may be on the order of around 5 km per second. Thus a sample time spacing of approximately 4 ms would correspond to a sample depth spacing of about 10 meters e.g. assuming a path length from source to boundary and boundary to sensor . As an example a trace may be about 4 seconds in duration thus for a sampling rate of one sample at about 4 ms intervals such a trace would include about 1000 samples where latter acquired samples correspond to deeper reflection boundaries. If the 4 second trace duration of the foregoing example is divided by two e.g. to account for reflection for a vertically aligned source and sensor the deepest boundary depth may be estimated to be about 10 km e.g. assuming a speed of sound of about 5 km per second .

In the example of the system includes one or more memory storage devices one or more computers one or more networks and one or more modules . As to the one or more computers each computer may include one or more processors e.g. or cores and memory for storing instructions e.g. modules for example executable by at least one of the one or more processors. As an example a computer may include one or more network interfaces e.g. wired or wireless one or more graphics cards a display interface e.g. wired or wireless etc.

In the example of the one or more memory storage devices may store seismic data for a geologic environment that spans kilometers in length and width and for example around 10 km in depth. Seismic data may be acquired with reference to a surface grid e.g. defined with respect to inline and crossline directions . For example given grid blocks of about 40 meters by about 40 meters a 40 km by 40 km field may include about one million traces. Such traces may be considered 3D seismic data where time approximates depth. As an example a computer may include a network interface for accessing seismic data stored in one or more of the storage devices via a network. In turn the computer may process the accessed seismic data via instructions which may be in the form of one or more modules. As an example a dip attribute module may be provided for processing seismic data.

In the example of the geometrical attributes include one or more dip attributes one or more azimuth attributes one or more continuity attributes and one or more other attributes . Such attributes may be part of a structural attributes library see e.g. the attribute component of . Structural attributes may assist with edge detection local orientation and dip of seismic reflectors continuity of seismic events e.g. parallel to estimated bedding orientation etc. As an example an edge may be defined as a discontinuity in horizontal amplitude continuity within seismic data and correspond to a fault a fracture etc. Geometrical attributes may be spatial attributes and rely on multiple traces.

As mentioned as an example seismic data for a region may include one million traces where each trace includes one thousand samples for a total of one billion samples. Resources involved in processing such seismic data in a timely manner may be relatively considerable by today s standards. shows a 2D diagram and a 3D diagram of a dip scan approach which involves processing seismic data with respect to discrete planes e.g. a volume bounded by discrete planes . Depending on the size of the seismic data such an approach may involve considerable resources for timely processing. The approach shown in may look at local coherence between traces and their amplitudes and therefore may be classified in the category of apparent dip. 

Referring to the diagram of a 2D search based estimate of coherence is shown with respect to a range of discrete dip angles. Such an approach may estimate coherence using semblance variance principle component analysis PCA or another statistical measure along a discrete number of candidate dips and arrive at an instantaneous dip based on a coherence peak. The diagram of shows a 3D search based estimate of coherence which is analogous to the 2D approach shown in the diagram and may use an inline vector and a crossline vector for time dip e.g. along coherent peaks in inline and crossline directions . In the example of as shown in the 3D diagram dip angle with maximum coherence may be stored as a dip magnitude and dip direction azimuth see e.g. the diagram of .

3D or volumetric dip can assist in processes such as structural restoration workflows which may aim to invert relative depositional history of individual layers in a volume. As an example given a priori information and well data a relative depositional history may be converted into geological time for individual layers e.g. to assist exploration workflows . As an example an approach may involve human interaction in a semi automated manner that includes interpretation of horizons in a subterranean formation via user identification and selection of horizon features. Such an approach can be time consuming and may focus on a relatively small region of the sub surface. While efforts to increase automation may try to leverage estimates of structural dip a precise format for such estimated dips may not exist for example because structural dip may be defined based on direction e.g. dip magnitude and dip direction azimuth of surface normal at any point in the volume see e.g. the diagram of .

In approaches where the surface normal is constructed by averaging of the positive dip e.g. from current trace to the next trace and the negative dip e.g. from current trace to the previous trace in inline and crossline directions such a format has half the resolution of a positive negative dip representation. An approach for volumetric dip that offers a full theoretical resolution is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 891 859 entitled Consistent Dip Estimation for Seismic Imaging Pub. No. US 2011 0118985 of May 19 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein .

Dip estimation techniques that assume that a sub surface volume conforms to a layer cake model i.e. that the sub surface is just a stack of laterally infinitely continuous surfaces possibly with close to zero thickness at some locations can fail to account for sub surface objects e.g. channels salt bodies etc. that can have finite lateral extents e.g. structural discontinuities can outline boundaries of such objects . In such situations where a discontinuity may exist the concept of a discontinuity dip attribute is lacking as dip is defined as a spatial derivative of a structure and the derivative is per definition undefined at discontinuities. For example for a reflector positive dip and negative dip for a location with respect to a trace may not be equal such that a reflector normal vector for a peak at that location may be pointing vertically indicating a zero dip at that location which may be inaccurate.

The approach described in the aforementioned application US 2011 0118985 can decouple dip through definition of a positive dip and a negative dip. Thus for example at a given point in a volume the positive dip e.g. to the right and the negative dip e.g. to the left may not necessarily have uniform slope across the given point. Such an approach can alleviate first derivative concerns especially where a boundary may exist within a subsurface volume e.g. channel fault body etc. .

As an example for a volumetric dip model such as the model described in US 2011 0118985 the following information may be provided for points e.g. p i j k in a sub surface volume i positive inline dip ii negative inline dip iii positive crossline dip iv negative crossline dip and v dip uncertainty. With respect to data structure or data storage demands such an approach can be represented for example using five volumes e.g. of similar size as an input seismic data volume that represent the sub surface environment e.g. as imaged by seismic data . As an example a unit for dip can be defined as millisecond per trace or meter per trace or another isomorphic unit of choice e.g. angle . In such an example a lateral coordinate system may be indexed by inline and crossline numbers noting that another coordinate system could be used e.g. based on row column numbers geographical position in x y coordinates etc. .

As to the method a trace T i and a trace T i 1 are considered as being related by equation . By applying a Taylor series expansion the equation can be represented as equation . By rearranging the equation the equation is provided which can be solved for z z which represents a time or depth displacement for z between trace T i and trace T i 1 which may be stored as a negative dip value for the trace T i and a location defined by the sample z . As an example a feature exists at z in the trace T i and evidence of that feature exists in the trace T i 1 at a location displaced by a distance or time from that of the trace T i where the displacement is represented by z. As that displacement is with respect to a prior trace with respect to the inline coordinate for trace T i that displacement is a negative dip for the trace T i . Equations may be applied for a positive dip for the trace T i for example with respect to the trace T i 1 . Further equations may applied for both negative dip and positive dip with respect to the crossline coordinate e.g. T j T j 1 and T j 1 . In such a manner values for four of the five volumes may be determined. As to the uncertainty data volume as an example it may include quality control data consistency data inconsistency data or other data that indicates uncertainty as to one or more dip values e.g. at a location or locations in a sub surface volume .

As indicated in the example of a method may implement a Taylor series expansion technique for calculating time depth varying timing difference e.g. structural dip between traces in positive and negative directions. As an example a method may implement a technique other than a Taylor series expansion for calculating time depth varying timing difference e.g. structural dip between traces. For example a cross correlation technique may be implemented a technique based on a phase shift analysis between traces etc. As an example a method may implement a Taylor series expansion technique and another technique for calculating time depth varying timing difference e.g. structural dip between traces.

The series of traces correspond to a series of inline traces for a given crossline index value. For the trace T i j a positive dip value can be defined with respect to the trace T i 1 j and a negative dip value can be defined with respect to the trace T i 1 j . As indicated a negative dip value can be defined for the trace T i 1 j with respect to the trace T i j and a positive dip value can be defined for the trace T i 1 j with respect to the trace T i j .

In the example of a positive dip T at trace T i 1 is equal to a negative dip T at trace T i and a positive dip at trace T i is equal to a negative dip at trace T i 1 . Such equalities may be deemed natural consistencies where otherwise if one started to follow a signed path out from a starting point and then follow the signed path backwards the resulting end point would be different than the starting point.

In vector calculus curl is a vector operator that describes infinitesimal rotation of a 3D vector field where at points in the field the curl of that field can be represented by a vector e.g. length and direction that characterize rotation at a point . The aforementioned natural consistencies may be defined using curl.

Direction of curl is an axis of rotation e.g. as determined by the right hand rule and magnitude of curl is magnitude of rotation. In fluid dynamics a vector field whose curl is zero is referred to as irrotational. Curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields that has a corresponding form in Stokes theorem which relates surface integral of curl of a vector field to a line integral of a vector field around a boundary curve. Alternative terminology rotor or rotational and alternative notations rot F and F e.g. del operator and cross product may be used for curl and curl F .

As an example a positive dip can assuming a reasonably vertically smooth dip model be reconstructed from negative dip estimates where positive and negative dips abide by the natural consistencies e.g. they are consistent . Accordingly curl of a surface defined by integration of the dip fields is zero e.g. or tends to zero given some small amount of error . Thus for a given sample where a reliable dip estimate exists and one follows the sample along the given negative dip to a new position in a previous trace then the positive dip at that new position will be equal to the negative dip that led to that new position from the starting position.

Given the natural consistencies or curl properties a type of symmetry exists between positive and negative dips. As described with respect to a method can include reconstructing a positive dip from negative dips or the opposite reconstructing a negative dip from positive dips. Further such a method can include one or more uncertainty checks for example to determine if sufficient reliable dip estimates exist at one or more locations. With respect to the technique of such checks may include accessing uncertainty data e.g. or consistency data inconsistency data etc. for example as stored in a dip uncertainty volume.

A consequence of the aforementioned symmetry is that a positive dip volume can be constructed from a negative dip volume and vice versa and consequently three volumes may be persisted rather than five volumes. Thus a technique such as the technique of may maintain its dip model resolution by persisting e.g. saving to memory for example the following three volume sets i negative inline dip ii negative crossline dip and iii dip uncertainty e.g. or consistency inconsistency etc. . As an example alternatively resolution may be maintained by persisting e.g. saving the following three volume sets i positive inline dip ii positive crossline dip and iii dip uncertainty e.g. or consistency inconsistency etc. .

By persisting three volume sets rather than five volume sets as an example a theoretical 40 reduction in memory e.g. disk volume and a theoretical 40 decrease in I O cost e.g. as transfer speed between a disk based storage device and memory may be realized. An added cost would be incurred for example for reconstruction of positive dip fields from negative dip fields or vice versa. For circumstances where a processor outpaces a memory bus e.g. processor idle time while waiting for data time to re compute positive dips from negative dips can be smaller than time to read pre computed positive dip data from a disk based storage device.

As to the method it includes a reception block for receiving a request for a dip value a locate block for locating complementary dip values and an interpolate block for interpolating a value for the requested dip value based on the located complementary dip values. As to a complimentary dip such a dip is a positive dip where a negative dip has been requested and a negative dip where a positive dip has been requested. For example as to the series of traces if a positive dip is requested for the trace T i j then a complementary dip would be a negative dip of the trace T i 1 j . As another example as to the series of traces if a negative dip is requested for the trace T i j then a complementary dip would be a positive dip of the trace T i 1 j . As to interpolation two complementary dips may be located and used to provide a value for a requested dip.

The method is shown in in association with various computer readable media CRM blocks and . Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors or processor cores to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for at least in part performance of various actions of the method . As an example a computer readable medium CRM may be a computer readable storage medium. As an example the memory of may provide for storage of instructions executable by one or more of the one or more processors of . Thus the memory may be a CRM as in .

As an example a method can include interpolating negative dips to output a positive dip or vice versa. Thus given an array of negative dip values an algorithm may be provided and implemented to generate a positive dip value a selected sample position.

With such an algorithm as an example a method can iterate over samples and traces in a dip model and construct a positive inline dip field and a positive crossline dip field via repeated calls to the algorithm and access to a negative inline dip field and a negative crossline dip field respectively e.g. or vice versa . As mentioned where a computing system is configured for parallel processing e.g. using processor cores of a CPU processor cores of a GPU etc. processing may occur in parallel to construct such fields.

As an example a method can include receiving a request for a dip value for a location within a sub surface volume responsive to the request locating complementary dip values for locations within the sub surface volume where the location for the requested dip value lies within bounds defined by the locations for the complementary dip values and interpolating a value for the requested dip value based on the complementary dip values. In such a method receiving may include receiving a request for a positive dip value and locating may include locating negative dip values as complementary dip values. Furthermore receiving may include receiving a request for a negative dip value and locating may include locating positive dip values as complementary dip values. Such a method may include repeating for a plurality of requests for example for region of the sub surface volume or the entire sub surface volume.

As an example locating can include accessing a data set that includes negative inline dip values negative crossline dip values and uncertainty values for the sub surface volume or for example accessing a data set that includes positive inline dip values positive crossline dip values and uncertainty values for the sub surface volume.

As an example a method can include performing a path analysis for a location of the requested dip value using at least two paths within the sub surface volume. In such an example path analysis may determine if path invariance exists for the location of the requested dip value based on curl of a dip field.

As an example a method can include providing a dip model derived from seismic data using a Taylor series expansion technique. For example such a dip model may be derived using a Taylor series expansion technique as described with respect to . As to examples of other techniques a method may implement a cross correlation technique a phase based technique etc.

As an example a system can include one or more processors memory and instructions stored in the memory and executable by at least one of the one or more processors to instruct the system to responsive to a request for a dip value for a location within a sub surface volume locate complementary dip values for locations within the sub surface volume where the location for the requested dip value lies within bounds defined by the locations for the complementary dips values and interpolate a value for the requested dip value based on the complementary dip values. For example the system of may include instructions such as instructions associated with the method of .

As to examples of techniques other than Taylor series instructions may be provided for implementation of a cross correlation technique a phase based technique etc.

As an example one or more computer readable storage media can include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to receive dip values determined based on volumetric seismic data and Taylor series expansion calculate interpolated dip values based on the received dip values and render the interpolated dip values to a display. As an example such one or more storage media may include instructions to calculate curl values for a dip field defined by the interpolate dip values and for example render the curl values to the display. As to examples of techniques other than Taylor series instructions may be provided for implementation of a cross correlation technique a phase based technique etc.

As an example one or more computer readable storage media can include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to receive positive dip values and negative dip values based on volumetric seismic data and Taylor series expansion and where the interpolated dip values include positive dip values calculate difference values between the interpolated dip values and the received positive dip values and where the interpolated dip values include negative dip values calculate difference values between the interpolated dip values and the received negative dip values. As an example instructions may also be stored to render such difference values to the display e.g. for a workflow analysis interpretation etc. .

In the example of where the decision block decides to proceed to the locate block negative dip values e.g. negative dips are located. Such values may be stored in a data storage device which may be local or remote and correspond to volume data e.g. volumetric seismic attribute data . In the example of the method shows various blocks for determining a single positive dip value from negative dip values e.g. negative dips . Where multiple dip values are requested a process to determine positive dips from negative dips may proceed in a parallel manner or a serial manner. For example where parallel processing is available various blocks of the method may be implemented in parallel.

In the example of after locating negative dip values the method continues at a selection block to select a positive dip for determination for example for a seismic trace T 1 and at a location defined by sample k . In response the method continues at a load block that loads negative dip values from the located negative dip values for example for a seismic trace T and at locations defined by samples kk and kk . Prior to proceeding to determination of the positive dip value for trace T 1 at the location defined by sample k the method continues at two decision blocks and for deciding whether the location defined by sample k is within certain location bounds defined by samples kk and kk . Specifically the decision block decides if kk NegDip kk is less than or equal to k while the decision block decides if kk NegDip kk is greater than k. In the decision block and the NegDip kk and the NegDip kk identify in conjunction with kkand kklocations with respect to trace T 1 . If the decision block or decides that the location defined by k for the trace T 1 does not meet their respective criterion then the method continues to a termination or next block . For example where a request is for a single positive dip value the method may terminate whereas if the request is for multiple positive dip values the method may essentially skip the instant determination for a positive dip value e.g. for the trace T 1 at sample location k and move on to a next positive dip value at another trace another sample location etc.

In the example of where the decision blocks and decide that the location defined by the sample k meets the conditions then the method continues at an interpolation block for interpolating a positive dip value for the trace T 1 at the location defined by the sample k based at least in part on the negative dip values for the trace T and locations defined by the samples kk and kk . After such an interpolation the method may continue to the termination or next block .

The method is shown in in association with various computer readable media CRM blocks and . Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors or processing cores to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for at least in part performance of various actions of the method . As an example a computer readable medium CRM may be a computer readable storage medium. As an example the memory of may provide for storage of instructions executable by one or more of the one or more processors of . Thus the memory may be a CRM as in .

As an example the data may be uncertainty measure data for the positive dip data as calculated by a technique such as the technique of . As an example the data may be quality control data. In the example of the data shows that uncertainty is higher in chaotic areas e.g. lower portion of the plot of uncertainty values with respect to inline and depth time and along major faults e.g. upper portion of the plot of uncertainty values with respect to inline and depth time .

In the example of the positive dip data as mentioned is calculated based on interpolation calculations such as those of interpolation block of the method to output a positive dip.

In the difference data corresponds to absolute values of differences between the positive dip data and calculated positive dip data e.g. using interpolations based on negative dip data . In the example of interpolation fails to construct positive dips from negative dips in some areas for example where the underlying technique see e.g. technique of failed to converge to a stable dip model e.g. via an iterative process that aims to output a dip model . In this example as the underlying negative dip data not shown upon which interpolation operates to calculate positive dip data see the data has associated high uncertainty e.g. lack of consistency even the positive dip data at those locations have high uncertainty. Where the underlying technique that generates a negative dip field or a positive dip field generates data with high uncertainty interpolation of that field to generate a positive dip field or a negative dip field will likewise have high uncertainty.

As to areas where the underlying dip estimation technique did not converge to a stable dip model error introduced by saving negative dip values and constructing positive dip values therefrom via interpolation is on average of the order of about 0.004 ms per trace e.g. of the order of about 1 1000 of sample distance for a sample rate of 4 milliseconds . For the example of the error tends to be substantially smaller e.g. several orders of magnitude smaller than accuracy of various dip estimation techniques. In such an example given that the error tends to be quite small in comparison to accuracy of dip estimation techniques persisting saving accessing loading etc. a positive dip field or a negative dip field for construction of a corresponding negative dip field or a corresponding positive dip field such an approach may be considered substantially loss less e.g. in terms of the approach being akin to an approach for compression and decompression .

As an example the difference data may be available as an edge attribute a chaos attribute etc. as it can highlight one or more chaotic areas large faults etc. A graphical user interface application configuration file etc. may provide for options as to one or more attributes. For example depending on a workflow or task a user may select one or more options to determine one or more attributes. Such attributes may include attributes that output data such as the uncertainty data the positive dip data e.g. or negative dip data the difference data etc. If a task is facilitated by edge detection a user may select or configure a configuration file to provide difference data such as the difference data . Such a task may for example be a task where an edge attribute is input to a fault fracture mapping workflow. Such a task may itself not leverage the benefits of compact storage in that for example a positive dip field and a negative dip field are available and another positive dip field is generated from the available negative dip field.

As an example an isomorphic result may be performed on an input dip model for example to serve as an additional quality control check on the input dip model for a compression process or decompression process. For example for an inline i crossline j and depth z be calculated using an algorithm such as 

Accordingly if one takes a step to the right in the input dip model and then takes a step to the left for the dips at those locations one should be returned to the starting place. Such an algorithm can apply to inline and crossline directions. Such an approach may be referred to as a 2D dip inconsistency attribute.

As to the RMS derivative data this may be data for quality control edge analysis etc. As mentioned an assumption for implementing an interpolation algorithm may be that estimated positive negative dips in inline and crossline directions are relatively smooth vertically with the meaning they are sufficiently low frequency that for example a linear interpolation scheme between samples may be appropriate. Such an assumption can be reasonable as layers in a sub surface volume e.g. outside one or more chaotic areas tend to be reasonably parallel. The notion of layers being reasonably parallel stems from a theory for natural depositional processes for sediments.

As an example data such as the RMS derivative data may provide an indication as to areas within a sub surface volume where an interpolation method may be beneficial e.g. will produce reasonably reliable or useful output and for example where it may fail to provide desired reliability. As an example the RMS derivative data may be considered an attribute generated by an attribute method that assess frequency content vertically in a small time depth window above below each sample for each dip component output from a chosen dip estimation method. Such a method may be accomplished in one or more manners. For example a method to analyze frequency content may include Fourier transform statistical measurements e.g. variance entropy etc. etc.

In the example of the RMS derivative data stems from an attribute method that takes a vertical derivative of one or more dip components inline crossline positive negative components and use an RMS value of the desired vertical derivatives for example as a measure of vertical smoothness. Such an attribute method may be considered a two sample method for example to help ensure a maximum vertical resolution of a quality control field e.g. as a quality control attribute . Specifically the RMS derivative data is the RMS of d dt negative inline dip and d dt negative crossline dip .

As an example the RMS derivative data may be compared to the difference data . Such a comparison may notes some features that appear in both data and data . Thus as attributes corresponding attribute methods may be implemented for complementary comparisons of output. As an example the two attribute methods can provide two different measures to quantify the same underlying quality of estimated dip for example on a sample by sample basis. Such an approach may be used for example as a robust chaos indicator fault indicator chaos and fault indicator etc. For example a workflow may be defined to include one or more worksteps where one or more attribute methods are called upon to generate data such as the data the data or the data and .

As to an attribute method that includes one or more derivatives for example to generate data such as the data may be referred to as a dip derivative attribute. As mentioned another attribute may be referred to as a 2D dip inconsistency attribute and yet another attribute may be referred to as a difference attribute. As an example such attributes may be optional and depend on desires of a user for example type of workflow desired result type of interpretation etc. As mentioned various attributes while constructing a positive dip from negative dips or a negative dip from positive dips may include accessing data sets that may not necessarily reduce data storage demands data I O demands etc. However as an example after implementation of such an attribute method or attribute methods e.g. quality control edge detection etc. additional processing may occur where data storage demands data I O demands etc. are reduced.

As shown in the example of the trace at T includes a sample at kand a sample at k which may correspond to time or depth while the trace at T 1 includes a sample at kkand a sample at kk which may correspond to time or depth. Given such definitions the diagram and the equations of show that PosDip T k can be approximated by NegDip T 1 kk .

As shown in the equations for the example data given the PosDip T k NegDip T 1 101 w k NegDip T 1 100 1 w k where w k k 99.5 101.5 99.5 . Such equations may be implemented in conjunction with conditions such as kk NegDip T 1 kk k where kk 101 e.g. kk kk 1 . Such conditions may be applied for example in one or more decision blocks see e.g. the decision blocks and of and for negative dip the decision block and of .

Thus in the example of one may assume that the unit of the dip is samples per trace with floating point precision and the polarity convention is that a positive value for a positive dip means that the implicit layer interface is moving deeper in the trace to the right. Given such an example a positive value for a negative dip means that the implicit layer is to be found at a more shallow position in the trace to the left. For example if negative dip for a position kk 100 e.g. for sample 100 in trace i is equal to 0.5 then the positive dip for trace i 1 at location 99.5 e.g. 100 0.5 is also 0.5. Further if negative dip for position kk 101 e.g. for sample 100 in trace i is equal to 0.5 then the positive dip for trace i 1 at location 101.5 i.e. location 101 0.5 is also 0.5. Given the foregoing numbers assuming linearity between neighboring sample positions since positive dip at position 99.5 is 0.5 and since the positive dip at position 101.5 is 0.5 then through interpolation it is possible to calculate the positive dip for a position k between in the interval between 99.5 and 101.5 for example using the equation in equations PosDip k 0.5 w k 0.5 1.0 w k where w k k 99.5 101.5 99.5 .

To calculate the positive dip for a sample k in trace i 1 a method can include locating a sample position kkin trace i as well as locating the sample position kkwhere kk kk 1 in trace i such that kk NegDip kk k and kk 1 NegDip kk 1 k followed by interpolation e.g. a linear or other interpolation .

As an example once a sample position kk as outlined above an algorithm such as described by the pseudo code below may be implemented 

In the example of the diagram shows a sample in a dip model open circle where a method such as the method can calculate a two way time depth difference from the origin of the sample to any of its neighboring locations following two different paths. In the diagram a Path A starts out in the inline direction dashed lines and a Path B starts out in the crossline direction dotted lines . For each visited point a method can include calculating the altitude difference from the two paths and taking the maximum altitude difference from its visited neighbors to be the reconstruction uncertainty measurement for the starting point.

As an example such a method may include starting at a given depth z and then summing up altitude difference for each step where e.g. assuming the dip is stored as altitude difference per trace when taking one step to the right the method includes adding the positive crossline dip the for the current position and when taking one step to the left the method includes subtracting of negative crossline dip for that location e.g. by implication . In such a method a step up can imply subtracting of the negative inline dip and a step down can imply adding of the positive inline dip for a current location.

In the example of the diagram shows paths followed from a selected sample to validate path independence e.g. path invariance for a search radius e.g. block wise of two traces in both inline and crossline direction. As an example a search radius may be defined as a parameter for a construction or reconstruction uncertainty process e.g. an uncertainty attribute method . Thus as shown in a path independence curl concept can be implemented as a measure of quality.

As an example a method can include integrating a dip field in a circle e.g. or square pattern e.g. with a default or user specified radius around each location in an effort to determine whether one would end up at the same altitude depth as a start location.

As an example a method can include calculating a path invariance e.g. curl attribute for a full dip model. In such an example a dip model may be provided its estimated positive and negative dips and inline and crossline directions where a curl attribute method is applied to quantify how well the dip model estimation process honors path independence e.g. path invariance .

As to the method it includes a selection block for selecting a starting point a selection block for selecting Path A a selection block for selecting Path B an arrival block for arriving at a point via Path A an arrival block for arriving at a point via Path B and a decision block for deciding if the altitude of the arrival points for Path A and Path B are the same e.g. within some error tolerance . Based on the decision block the method decides whether to continue at a block indicating that curl is OK path invariance or to continue at a block indicating that curl is not OK lack of path invariance . As an example a difference block may be provided that calculates a difference or differences for Path A and Path B e.g. as to altitude and that stores displays etc. the difference e.g. as a quality control or other metric .

As an example one or more dip quality control edge detection etc. attributes may be run either on an input dip model on a reconstructed dip model e.g. construction of one type of dip from another type of dip etc. As mentioned a dip attribute may include a 2D dip inconsistency attribute a 3D dip inconsistency attribute a dip derivative attribute or other type of attribute described herein.

As to the attributes these can include a 2D inconsistency attribute a 3D inconsistency attribute a 3D derivative attribute and one or more other attributes . The attributes can include corresponding methods for calculation of such attributes for example from one or more of the data sets and . In the example of the attributes may be provided as modules for example instructions in one or more computer readable media for implementation using one or more processors configured to execute the instructions.

As to the method it includes a reception block for receiving estimated dip values a calculation block for calculating interpolated dip values a render block for rendering interpolated dip values to a display and a calculation block for calculating another metric which may be rendered to a display e.g. as part of an analysis workflow etc. .
