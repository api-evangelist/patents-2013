title: Multiple shell multi faceted graphical user interface
abstract: A multi faceted graphic user interface with multiple shells or layers may be provided for interaction with a user to speech enable interaction with applications and processes that do not necessarily have native support for speech input. The shells may be components of an operating system or of a parent application which supports such shells. Each shell has multiple facets for displaying applications and processes, and typically speech and other input is directed the application or process in the facet which has focus within the active shell. These multiple shells lend themselves to grouping of input or grouping of related applications and processes. For example, input from a speech recognizer, a mouse and a keyboard may each be directed at different shells; or a user may group related windows within various shells, such that all documents are displayed in one shell and all windows of an instant messaging application are displayed in another, thereby enabling better organization of work and work flow.
