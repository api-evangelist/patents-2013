title: Identifying entries in a location store associated with a common physical location
abstract: A social networking system generates a location store based on information received from its users. The location store includes entries having a physical location description and one or more terms associated with the physical location description. One or more entries associated with physical location descriptions within an area are identified. A local frequency of occurrence of each term in the identified entry is determined, and a global frequency of occurrence of each term in the identified entries within the location store is determined. Trending terms in the identified entries are determined based on the local frequencies and the global frequencies. Identified entries are compared to each other, with a score based on differing terms in compared entries and whether the differing terms are trending terms is generated. If a score is less than a threshold value, a combined entry is generated from the compared entries.

This invention generally relates to social networking systems and more particularly to maintaining a database of location information received from social networking system users.

A social networking system allows its users to connect to and communicate with other social networking system users. Users may create profiles on a social networking system that are tied to their identities and include information about the users such as interests and demographic information. Additionally users may provide a social networking system information specifying their current geographic locations or geographic locations they previously visited. This user location information may be presented to other social networking system users subject to user specified privacy settings to enhance user interaction with the social networking system.

For example a social networking system receives and stores information describing geographic locations from various users creating a database of location information. To allow a user to more easily identify a geographic location the social networking system allows a user to select information from the created database. However because the information in the created database is provided by social networking system users multiple entries in the database may differently refer to the same geographic location. This increases the complexity of a user selecting a geographic location by providing the user with different information associated with the geographic location.

Users of a social networking system may provide the social networking system with information associated with a user s current location or associated with locations that the user has previously visited. Based on information associated with locations received from various users the social networking system generates a location store including location information. Each entry in the location store includes a physical location description e.g. latitude and longitude city state etc. and one or more terms associated with the physical location description. For example terms associated with a physical location description include a descriptive name or other information associated with the physical location description. However as the location store is generated from user provided information multiple users may provide information associated with a single physical location hence the location store may include multiple entries having a common physical location description associated with different terms. Identifying duplicate entries describing the same physical location and combining the duplicate entries into a combined entry allows users to more easily identify entries best describing a physical location from the location store.

To improve user selection of information associated with a physical location from the location store the social networking system identifies entries in the location store associated with the same physical location description. In one embodiment the social networking system identifies entries in the location store having a physical location description within an area. For example entries having a physical location description within a threshold distance of a specified physical location are identified. A local frequency of a term included in an identified entry is determined based on a number of times the term occurs within the identified entries. Additionally a global frequency associated with each term in the identified entries is determined where the global frequency of a term is based on a number of times the term occurs within the location store as a whole.

Based on the local frequency of a term and the global frequency of a term the social networking system determines if the term is a trending term. For example a ratio of the local frequency of a term to the global frequency of the term is determined and if the ratio is at least a threshold value the term is identified as a trending term. Alternatively a distribution of various terms in the location store across areas including different physical location descriptions is determined and trending terms are identified as terms having at least a threshold density of occurrence in an area from the distribution.

An identified entry is compared to an additional identified entry and a score for the identified entry is determined based on the comparison. In one embodiment terms in the identified entry are compared to terms in the additional identified entry with a cost associated with a difference between a term in the identified entry and a term in the additional identified entry determined based in part on the global frequency and local frequency of the term in the identified entry. The cost of a difference between the term in the identified entry and the term in the additional identified entry is based in part on whether the term is a trending term. For example a cost associated with a difference between a trending term in the identified entry and a term in the additional identified entry is discounted the discount may be based at least in part on a ratio between the local frequency of the term and the global frequency of the term. Costs associated with differences between various terms in the identified entry and the additional identified entry are combined to generate the score for the identified entry. In one embodiment the score determined from comparing the identified entry to the additional identified entry is proportional to the difference between the identified entry and the additional identified entry. Hence if the score determined from comparing the identified entry to the additional identified entry is less than a threshold value the identified entry and the additional identified entry are combined. Alternatively an additional entry including the physical location description from the identified entry and the additional identified entry and terms from the identified entry and the additional identified entry if the score is less than a threshold value is created.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system which is further described below in conjunction with . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party system may also communicate information to the social networking system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party system .

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding social networking system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the social networking system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the social networking system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the social networking system for connecting and exchanging content with other social networking system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the social networking system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the social networking system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Social networking system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence social networking system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the social networking system through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the social networking system .

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as with other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the social networking system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of a social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as in the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the social networking system to the social networking system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the social networking system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or another user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest for an object interest or other user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The location store includes entries describing locations based on information received from users of the social networking system . In one embodiment each entry includes a physical location description and one or more terms associated with the physical location description. Examples of the physical location description include a latitude and longitude a city a state a physical address or other suitable information identifying a physical location. Terms included in an entry may include a descriptive name or other information associated with the physical location description. The terms in an entry of the location store are received from user actions such as check in actions content provided to the social networking system and associated with a location by a user or from other suitable user actions.

Because entries in the location store are generated from user actions multiple entries may be associated with a common physical location description. To allow users to more easily identify terms associated with a physical location from the location store the location analysis module analyzes entries in the location store to combine entries associated with a common physical location description. Additionally the location analysis module identifies one or more descriptive terms associated with a physical location description based on terms included in entries of the location store as further described below in conjunction with . Descriptive terms associated with a physical location description are terms from which a user has an increased likelihood of identifying the physical location description when presented with the descriptive terms.

As further described below in conjunction with the location analysis module identifies entries associated with a physical location description within an area and determines a global frequency with which each term in the identified entries appears in the location store . Additionally the location analysis module determines a local frequency with which each term in the identified entries appears in the identified entries. Based on the global frequencies and local frequencies associated with terms the location analysis module identifies trending terms from the identified entries where a trending term has a local frequency exceeding its global frequency by a threshold amount. Terms in an identified entry and an additional identified entry are compared and a score is generated for the identified entry based on the comparison as further described below in conjunction with . If the score is less than a threshold value the identified entry and the additional identified entry are combined to generate a combined entry.

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or BlackberryOS.

Because the location store is generated based on user provided information multiple entries each including different terms may be associated with a physical location description. Additionally different users may provide terms that describe a physical location description with varying levels of description. To improve selection of information from the location store the social networking system analyzes entries associated with a physical location description to identify one or more terms from the entries providing a maximum amount of information associated with a physical location description. For example the social networking system identifies one or more descriptive terms associated with a physical location description from entries associated with a physical location description. The one or more descriptive terms provide information most closely associated with the physical location description increasing a likelihood of a user identifying the physical location description when presented with the one or more descriptive terms.

To determine descriptive terms associated with a physical location description the social networking system selects entries from the location store associated with a physical location. In one embodiment entries having a physical location matching a specified physical location description are selected . For example entries in the location store having a physical location description matching a specified physical location description of Times Square New York City are selected .

The social networking system determines a global frequency associated with each term in the selected entries. A term s global frequency is based on a number of times the term occurs in all entries included in the location store . For example the global frequency is a count of the number of occurrences of the term throughout the location store . Alternatively a term s global frequency is a ratio of its number of occurrences throughout the location store to a total number of terms in the location store however in other embodiments a term s global frequency may be any suitable value based on a number of times the term occurs throughout the location store .

Candidate descriptive terms are identified from the terms in the selected entries based at least in part on the determined global frequencies. In one embodiment the social networking system determines a global frequency of each term in a selected entry and identifies a candidate descriptive term from the selected entry as the term in the selected entry having a minimum global frequency. Hence a candidate descriptive term is identified from each selected entry as a term in a selected entry having a minimum global frequency. Typically a term in an entry with a minimum global frequency more uniquely describes the characteristics or local context associated with a physical location associated with the entry. For example words describing the functional aspects of a location such as Museum Gallery or Arcade typically have higher global frequencies. Conversely terms more closely associated with a particular physical location have lower global frequencies for example terms such as Guggenheim or Broadway have a lower global frequency because they are associated with specific physical locations making these terms better suited to identify particular physical locations.

For example a selected entry associated with a physical location description of Times Square New York includes the terms Corbin Building Broadway another selected entry includes the terms Trinity Church Broadway and an additional selected entry includes the terms Starbucks Broadway. Based on global frequencies associated with each term in the selected entry including the terms Corbin Building Broadway Broadway has the lowest global frequencies in the selected entry and is identified as a candidate descriptive term. Similarly Broadway has the minimum global frequency of the terms in the selected entry including the terms Starbucks Broadway and is also identified as a candidate descriptive term. In the selected entry including the terms Trinity Church Broadway the term Trinity has the minimum global frequency of terms in the selected entry so Trinity is identified as a candidate term. Accordingly candidate terms identified from these selected entries are Broadway and Trinity. 

Alternatively rather than use global frequencies associated with terms to identify candidate descriptive terms weights are associated with each term based on the number of times a term occurs in the selected entries and a number of times the term occurs in the location store . For example a weight associated with a term is a ratio of a number of times the term occurs in the selected entries to a number of times the term occurs in the location store . One or more candidate terms are identified based on the weights associated with the terms. For example terms associated with the lowest weights are identified as candidate terms.

A measure of descriptiveness is determined for each of the candidate terms. The measure of descriptiveness associated with a candidate term is a value describing how closely the candidate terms are associated with the physical location description. Various methods may be used to determine the measure of descriptiveness for each candidate term. For example a frequency at which each candidate term occurs in the candidate terms is determined. In the preceding example where the candidate terms Broadway and Trinity are identified Broadway has a frequency of occurring in the candidate terms of 2 while Trinity has a frequency of occurrence in the candidate terms of 1. Candidate terms having a maximum frequency of occurrence in the candidate terms are identified as descriptive terms associated with the physical location description. Alternatively candidate terms are ranked based at least in part on their frequency of occurrence in the candidate terms and candidate terms having at least a threshold position in the ranking are identified as descriptive terms associated with the physical location description.

In another embodiment category terms are identified based on the measures of descriptiveness of the candidate terms. Category terms may be terms that are associated with different physical location descriptions so they provide a relatively small amount of information for identifying a physical location description. For example candidate terms with the minimum frequency of occurrence in the candidate terms are identified as category terms. Alternatively category terms are identified as candidate terms having less than at threshold position in a ranking of candidate terms based at least in part on their frequency of occurrence in the identified candidate terms.

The social networking system may iteratively perform the above described steps to more accurately identify descriptive terms or category terms. As an example the social networking system performs the above described steps a specified number of times and identifies descriptive terms associated with a physical location description after performing the steps the specified number of times. Alternatively global frequencies associated with each candidate term are modified based on the measures of descriptiveness associated with the candidate terms and an additional candidate term is selected from each selected entry. An additional candidate term is selected from a selected entry based on the modified global frequencies of terms in the entry previously identified as a candidate term and the global frequencies of terms in the entry not previously identified as a candidate term. For example a global frequency associated with a term identified by a candidate term is divided by the measure of descriptiveness associated with the candidate term or is modified by another value based at least in part on the measure of descriptiveness associated with the candidate term. As described above additional candidate terms are identified as a term in an entry having a minimum global frequency or modified global frequency. A measure of descriptiveness is then determined for each of the additional candidate terms as described above. Selection of additional candidate terms may be iterated until one or more conditions are satisfied. For example global frequencies are modified and additional candidate terms are selected until the measures of descriptiveness determined for candidate terms and additional candidate terms is unchanged for a specified number of iterations.

In the example of the term Guggenheim has the minimum global frequency from the terms in entry A and is identified as a candidate term. Similarly the term Guggenheim also has the minimum global frequency of terms in entry B as well as in entry C and is identified as a candidate term associated with entry B and entry C. In entry D Starbucks has the minimum global frequency of the terms in entry D so Starbucks is identified as a candidate term associated with entry D.

The frequency of each candidate term among the identified candidate terms is determined. Terms having at a high or at least a threshold frequency amongst the identified candidate terms are terms that are most descriptive of the physical locations associated with the entries A B C and D. In the example of Guggenheim appears 3 times in the identified candidate terms while Starbucks appears a single time in the identified candidate terms. Accordingly Guggenheim and Starbucks are identified as descriptive terms A B associated with the physical location associated with the entries A B C D. In one embodiment the descriptive terms A B are stored in the location store and associated with a physical location description associated with the entries A B C D.

To identify duplicate entries in the location store associated with a physical location description entries in the location store associated with a physical location description within an area are identified . In one embodiment entries having a physical location description within a threshold distance of a specified physical location are identified . For example entries in the location store having a physical location description within a threshold distance of Times Square New York City are identified .

One or more trending terms in the identified entries are determined based on a global frequency of each term in the identified entries within the location store in its entirety and a local frequency of each term in the identified entries within the identified entries. A trending term is a term having a local frequency exceeding its global frequency by at least a threshold amount hence a trending term is a term having a threshold popularity relative to the identified area. For example if the terms Times and Square appear more frequently in entries having physical locations within an area than in the location store as a whole the terms Times and Square are determined to be trending terms for the area.

In one embodiment a ratio of a term s local frequency to its global frequency is used to determine if the term is a trending term. Hence the term s global frequency is determined based on the number of times the term occurs in all entries in the location store and the term s local frequency is determined based on the number of times the term occurs in entries identified as associated with physical location descriptions within the area. For example a database of terms included in entries of the location store is maintained that associates a number of occurrences in the location store with a term the number of occurrences associated with a term is incremented each time a new entry in the location store includes the term. Similarly a term is identified from the identified entries within the area and a number of entries in the identified entries including the identified term are computed to determine the local frequency of the term.

Based on a local frequency of a term and a global frequency associated with a term in the identified entries the social networking system determines if the term is a trending term. For example a ratio of the local frequency of a term to the global frequency of the term is determined and the term is determined to be a trending term if the ratio has at least a threshold value. Alternatively a distribution describing a frequency of one or more terms across entries in the location store associated with physical descriptions of locations within different areas is determined and a trending term associated with the area is determined as terms having at least a threshold frequency of occurrence in the area. For example a distribution indicates that the term Menlo Park is a trending term among entries in the location store having a physical location description within a threshold distance from San Francisco Calif.

After determining trending terms in the entries associated with physical location descriptions within the area an identified entry is compared to another identified entry referred to herein as an additional identified entry. Terms in the identified entry are identified and compared to terms in the additional identified entry. In one example string alignment is used to align terms within the identified entry and terms within the additional identified entry and the terms in the identified entry are compared to the terms in the additional identified entry after alignment. For example the identified entry includes the terms Coffee Shop A and Downtown NYC and the additional identified entry includes the terms Coffee A and Downtown New York. In one embodiment these example entries may be aligned by deleting the term Shop from the identified entry.

In one embodiment weights are associated with terms in the identified entry and in the additional identified entry based on the local frequencies and or global frequencies associated with the terms. For example a weight associated with a term is based on the local or global frequency associated with the term. Alternatively a weight is associated with a term based on the global frequency of the term and the weight is modified to a value based on a local frequency of the term associated with the term when the term is included in entries of the location store having a physical location description within an area. For example when an entry including the terms New York and City has a physical location description within a threshold distance of a physical location the weights associated with New York and City are based on the local frequencies associated with each of the terms.

In another embodiment candidate terms are identified from the identified entries within the area and a measure of descriptiveness is determined for each candidate term as discussed in conjunction with . For example a frequency with which each candidate term occurs in the candidate terms is determined and a candidate term is identified as a descriptive term or as a category term based on the frequency with which the candidate term occurs in the candidate terms as described above in conjunction with . A weight may be associated with a term in an in the identified entry based on whether the term is identified as a descriptive term or is identified as a category term alternatively a weight associated with a term in an identified entry is based on a measure of descriptiveness associated with the term.

An identified entry and an additional identified entry are selected and terms in the identified entry are compared to terms in the additional identified entry. In one embodiment terms in the identified entry are aligned with terms in the additional identified entry and the aligned terms are compared to identify differences. An addition or deletion based metric may be used to determine costs of differences between two aligned terms. For example while comparing the terms coffee and coffeeAB the cost associated with the difference between the two terms is 2 based on removing the letters A and B from the second term. In one embodiment the cost is discounted based on a factor if the term is a trending term for example the cost of a difference between terms may be discounted by a factor based at least in part on a ratio of the term s local frequency to the term s global frequency if the term is identified as a trending term. Alternatively weights associated with each term based at least in part on the global frequency and local frequency of a term are used to determine the cost of a difference between a term in the identified entry and a term in the additional identified entry. For example the cost of a difference between a term in the identified entry and a term in the additional identified entry is based on its value and the number of differences between characters in a term e.g. a cost is a product of the weight of the term in the identified entry and the number of differences between the term in the identified entry and the term in the additional identified entry . In other examples the costs of differences between terms in an identified entry and terms in an additional identified entry may be determined in other suitable methods based on the weights associated with the terms in each entry and differences between the terms.

The costs of differences between terms in the identified entry and in the additional identified entry are combined to generate a score representing a similarity between the identified entry and the additional identified entry. For example the costs are summed to generate the score although any suitable method may be used to generate the score from the costs. In one embodiment the social networking system determines if the score is less than a threshold value. If the score is less than the threshold value the social networking system generates a combined entry associated with the same physical location description in the identified entry and in the additional identified entry and including terms from the identified entry and from the additional identified entry. The threshold value may be specified using any suitable method. If the score is not less than the threshold value the identified entry and the additional identified entry are maintained as separate entities in the location store . In other embodiments different methods such as machine learning may be used to determine whether to generate a combined entry from an identified entry and an additional identified entry. For example different spellings of the same term may be learned over time to identify similar terms for generating a combined entry. The preceding steps may be repeated for various combinations of identified entries to reduce the number of entries in the location store associated with physical location descriptions within the area.

The terms in each of the entries A B C are aligned to generate aligned entries A B C. Aligned entry A includes the terms Starbucks and Menlo Park. Aligned entry B is generated by removing the terms Caf and CA from entry B resulting in aligned entry B including the terms Starrbucks and M. Park. Additionally aligned entry C includes the terms Peets and Menlo Park. Terms in various aligned terms are compared to each other to generate scores associated with comparisons of different pairs of aligned terms . For example when comparing aligned entry A to aligned entry B costs associated with the differences between Starbucks and Starrbucks and Menlo and M. are determined. In one embodiment 1 deletion is identified as the difference between Starbucks and Starrbucks while 4 deletions and one insertion are identified as the differences between Menlo and M. Because Menlo is identified as a trending term the costs associated with the differences between Menlo and M. are attenuated or discounted. Additionally the inclusion of the term CA in aligned entity B and not in aligned entry A is also discounted because CA is also identified as a trending term. The single deletion between Starbucks and Starrbucks results in a small cost associated with the difference while the inclusion of Caf in aligned entry B and not in aligned entry A results in another cost. By combining the costs a score associated with the comparison of aligned entry A and aligned entry B is generated. In the example of the score is less than a threshold value so a combined entry is generated that includes the terms from entry A and from entry B.

As another example terms in aligned entry A are compared to terms in aligned entry C. In this example the terms Menlo and Park appear in aligned entry A and aligned entry C so there is no cost or a negligible cost associated with these terms. However there are 14 differences between the terms Starbucks and Peets in aligned entry A and in aligned entry C based on additions and deletions. Based on the cost associated with these differences a score is determined. In the example of the score is greater than the threshold value so entry C which corresponds to aligned entry C is not combined with entry A.

The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
