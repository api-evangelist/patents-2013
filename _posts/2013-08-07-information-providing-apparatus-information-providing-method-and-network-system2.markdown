Specifically when transmitting the share panel acquisition request to the SNS server corresponding to Step S of the terminal apparatus also transmits the share panel acquisition request to the URL of the web page which is currently being displayed. In this case the distribution unit of the SNS server acquires the share panel into which the URL received from the terminal apparatus is not inserted among the share panels stored in the share panel storage unit and distributes the share panel to the terminal apparatus . In this way the terminal apparatus can display the share panel moved to a web page different from the web page which is currently being displayed.

The invention is not limited to the above mentioned example. For example the SNS server may transmit a plurality of share panels to the terminal apparatus and the terminal apparatus may display an arbitrary share panel among the share panels received from the SNS server . In this case the terminal apparatus displays the share panel into which the URL of the web page which is currently being displayed is not inserted. Therefore the terminal apparatus can display the share panel moved to another web page.

In the above described embodiment as in the example illustrated in the share panel is displayed in the sharing advertisement frame C of the web page. However the share panel may not be displayed in the sharing advertisement frame C but information which can be browsed when the user logs in the SNS server may be displayed in the sharing advertisement frame C. For example the sharing advertisement frame C may be displayed such that it can be scrolled and the page or share panel which is posted to the SNS server by the friend may be displayed in the sharing advertisement frame C. In this case the user of the terminal apparatus can also browse the share panel which is posted to the SNS server by the friend.

In the above described embodiment as in the example illustrated in the information providing apparatus stores the template of the share panel in advance. However the template stored in the information providing apparatus may be provided by an advertiser such as a company. This will be described with reference to .

The advertiser apparatus is an information processing apparatus such as a PC used by an advertiser for example a company and provides the template of the share panel to the information providing apparatus . For example the advertiser apparatus provides a template including an advertisement article or an image related to a product or a service to be advertised to the information providing apparatus .

In this example the template storage unit of the information providing apparatus stores the templates for each advertiser. illustrates an example of the template storage unit according to the modification. As illustrated in the template storage unit according to the modification includes items such as an advertiser ID a type and a template . The advertiser ID indicates an identifier for identifying the advertiser. The type indicates the type to which the advertiser belongs and corresponds to for example the type to which the product or service advertised by the advertiser belongs. The template indicates the template provided by the advertiser apparatus .

That is illustrates an example in which the advertiser identified by an advertiser ID X belongs to a type car and provides templates TP and TP . As such the advertiser apparatus may provide a plurality of templates to the information providing apparatus . However the invention is not limited thereto but the advertiser apparatus may provide one template to the information providing apparatus .

When the template TP is selected by the user the generation unit generates a share panel in which a photograph image is incorporated into the driver s seat of the car. Therefore the advertiser who provides the template TP can distribute the share panel as the advertisement of its own product or service. As described above the user is likely to click the content posted by the friend. Therefore the advertiser can provide the template related to its own product or service to the information providing apparatus to distribute advertisements with high customer appeal.

The information provider who manages the information providing apparatus may determine the amount of money paid to the advertiser on the basis of the rate of utilization of the template provided from the advertiser. Alternatively the information provider may determine the amount of money paid to the advertiser on the basis of for example the click through rate CTR the number of displays impression or the conversion rate CVR of the share panel which is generated using the template provided from the advertiser.

In the example illustrated in the generation unit of the information providing apparatus may transmit a template related to the attributes of the web page which is the link destination of the share panel to the terminal apparatus . For example when generating the share panel of the web page into which articles related to the car are inserted the generation unit acquires the template corresponding to the type car from the template storage unit illustrated in and transmits the template to the terminal apparatus . Therefore the information providing apparatus can generate the share panel with a high relation with the web page which is a link destination. As a result it is possible to distribute the share panel with high customer appeal.

In the example illustrated in the information providing apparatus may not store the template provided from the advertiser apparatus but may instruct the advertiser apparatus to transmit the template to the terminal apparatus when the share panel is generated.

In the above described embodiment the generation unit of the information providing apparatus generates the share panel including the title of the article the comments of the user and the photograph image to which the user is tagged. However the share panel generated by the generation unit is not limited to this example. Next another example of the share panel will be described.

For example the generation unit may incorporate the URL of the web page which is a link destination into the share panel. In this case a URL display frame in which the URL of the web page is displayed is provided in the template of the share panel and the generation unit incorporates the URL of the web page into the URL display frame. The invention is not limited to this example but the generation unit may incorporate the URL of the web page into for example the title frame PA.

For example the generation unit may not generate the share panel including all of the title of the article the comments of the user and the tagged photograph image but may generate a share panel including one or two of the above mentioned items. In addition the information providing apparatus stores only one template. In this case the generation unit generates the share panel using the template without allowing the user to select the template.

For example the generation unit may incorporate the image displayed in the web page into the share panel. In this case an in page image display frame in which the image in the web page is displayed is provided in the template of the share panel and the generation unit incorporates the image in the web page into the in page image display frame.

For example in some cases an article related to a product and the image of the product are inserted into the article display frame C of the web page. In this case the generation unit incorporates both the image of the product and the title of the article into the share panel. In this way it is possible to generate a share panel capable of improving the advertising effect of the product.

In some cases the image of the stock chart of a predetermined company is inserted into the article display frame C of the web page. In this case the generation unit incorporates the image of the stock chart into the share panel. In this way it is possible to generate a share panel for recording the stock of the company in addition to improving the advertising effect. This will be described with reference to . is a diagram illustrating an example of the share panel according to the embodiment.

In the example illustrated in a web page W includes the stock price of an AAA company is 30 050 yen and is up 1 310 yen from the day before as the title of the stock and a stock chart image G is inserted into the web page W. In this case as illustrated on the right side of the generation unit incorporates the chart image G into the in page image display frame to generate a share panel PN.

The invention is not limited to the example illustrated in . For example the generation unit may generate a share panel in which a search result screen of a search site is incorporated into the in page image display frame or a share panel in which the image of an article for sale at auction in an auction site is incorporated into the in page image display frame.

In the above described embodiment a single share panel is displayed in the web page. However a plurality of share panels may be displayed in the web page. In this case when transmitting a share panel acquisition request to the SNS server corresponding to Step S of the terminal apparatus may notify the SNS server of the number of share panels to be acquired. Then the distribution unit of the SNS server may acquire the share panels corresponding to the number of share panels notified by the terminal apparatus from the share panel storage unit and may distribute all of the acquired share panels to the terminal apparatus .

In addition the terminal apparatus may not notify the SNS server of the number of share panels to be acquired but the distribution unit of the SNS server may distribute a predetermined number of for example 10 share panels to the terminal apparatus . Then the terminal apparatus may select arbitrary share panels corresponding to the number of sharing advertisement frames C from a plurality of share panels received from the distribution unit and display the selected share panels in the corresponding sharing advertisement frames C.

The information providing apparatus may associate a plurality of share panels related to the same web page. Specifically when a second share panel is generated in a web page which appears by pressing a first share panel displayed in the sharing advertisement frame C the information providing apparatus notifies the SNS server of the second share panel and information indicating that the second share panel is associated with the first share panel. This will be described with reference to . is a diagram illustrating an example of the display of a plurality of share panels according to the embodiment. In the following description it is assumed that a panel ID for identifying the share panel is inserted into tag information in the share panel.

Then it is assumed that the distribution unit of the SNS server receives a share panel acquisition request from the terminal apparatus of the user who is a friend of the user who has posted the share panel PN and the user who has posted the share panel PN corresponding to Step S of . In this case when acquiring the share panel PN from the share panel storage unit the distribution unit also acquires the share panel PN associated with the share panel PN and distributes the acquired share panels PN and PN to the terminal apparatus . Then as illustrated in the terminal apparatus displays the share panels PN and PN which are associated with each other in the web page.

As such the information providing apparatus associates a plurality of share panels related to the same web page which makes it possible to instruct the terminal apparatus to display the share panels which are associated with each other. Therefore the user who browses a plurality of share panels associated with each other can browse the comments of a plurality of users at a time. As a result the information providing apparatus can distribute the share panel with high customer appeal.

When a share panel acquisition request is received the distribution unit of the SNS server may not acquire the overlapping share panels which are associated with each other from the share panel storage unit contrary to the above mentioned process. In other words the distribution unit may acquire the share panels which are not associated with each other from the share panel storage unit . In this case the share panels moved to different web pages are displayed on the terminal apparatus and the user can browse the share panels related to a plurality of kinds of web pages.

The invention is not limited to the example illustrated in but the information providing apparatus may associate a plurality of share panels in a predetermined order. For example the information providing apparatus may give a story to each of the share panels posted by a plurality of users and associate a plurality of share panels in the order of the stories. This will be described with reference to . is a diagram illustrating an example of the display of a plurality of share panels according to the embodiment.

MiShare buttons B to B are displayed in a web page W illustrated in . The miShare buttons B to B have a function of giving a story to each of the share panels posted by a plurality of users. For example among introduction development turn and conclusion forming a story the miShare button B corresponds to the introduction the miShare button B corresponds to the development the miShare button B corresponds to the turn and the miShare button B corresponds to the conclusion .

In the example illustrated in it is assumed that when the miShare button B corresponding to the introduction is pressed the generation unit of the information providing apparatus generates a share panel PN. In this case the generation unit inserts information indicating the introduction among the introduction the development the turn and the conclusion into the share panel PN. For example the generation unit sets information indicating the introduction to the tag information of the share panel PN. Then the transmitting unit of the information providing apparatus transmits the share panel PN to the SNS server .

Then as illustrated in it is assumed that a web page W including the share panel PN is displayed on the terminal apparatus of the user who is a friend of the user who has posted the share panel PN. Then it is assumed that when the share panel PN is pressed in the web page W a web page W is displayed as illustrated in . In this case the miShare buttons B to B corresponding to the development the turn and the conclusion other than the introduction inserted into the share panel PN which is a transition source are displayed in the web page W illustrated in .

In the example illustrated in it is assumed that when the miShare button B is pressed the generation unit of the information providing apparatus generates a share panel PN. In this case the generation unit acquires the panel ID of the share panel PN which is the transition source of the web page W from the terminal apparatus . In addition the generation unit inserts information indicating the development among the introduction the development the turn and the conclusion into the share panel PN. Then the transmitting unit transmits the share panel PN and the panel ID of the share panel PN to the SNS server . In this case similarly to the example illustrated in the storage unit of the SNS server stores the share panel PN in the share panel storage unit and stores the panel ID of the share panel PN and the panel ID of the share panel PN in a predetermined storage unit so that the panel IDs are associated with each other.

In this way the information providing apparatus allows a plurality of users to post the share panels corresponding to introduction development turn and conclusion as the share panels of the web page W. Then when receiving a share panel acquisition request from the terminal apparatus of the user who is a friend of all users who have posted each share panel the information providing apparatus distributes the share panels corresponding to introduction development turn and conclusion to the terminal apparatus . Then the terminal apparatus displays the share panels corresponding to introduction development turn and conclusion in the web page. In this case the terminal apparatus may display the share panels corresponding to introduction development turn and conclusion in this order from the upper side of a sharing advertisement frame C or it may display the share panels in the same sharing advertisement frame C in the order of introduction development turn and conclusion while changing the share panels at a predetermined time interval.

In this way the information providing apparatus can display a plurality of share panels with stories on the terminal apparatus . In the example illustrated in the information providing apparatus can generate a share panel such as a four frame comic strip. Therefore it is possible to improve the power to appeal to the user who browses the share panel.

In the above described embodiment the template of the share panel stored in the information providing apparatus is not limited to that illustrated in the drawings. For example the information providing apparatus may store a template in which a newscaster or a desk news desk used by the newscaster is drawn as the template having the image of a news program. In this case the generation unit incorporates the photograph image into for example a part image frame PA of the face of the newscaster. In addition the information providing apparatus may store the templates related to tourist spots or specialties. For example the information providing apparatus may store a template including the image of Mount Fuji.

As described in the example illustrated in the generation unit of the information providing apparatus may allow the user to select the template used to generate the share panel among the templates related to the attributes of the web page which is the link destination of the share panel. For example when generating a share panel for the web page of a news article such as economy the generation unit inserts the template including the image of the news desk into a template selection screen W. When generating a share panel for the web page related to a tourist spot or a specialty the generation unit inserts the template including the image of the tourist spot or the specialty into a template selection screen W.

The generation unit may change the template included in the template selection screen W depending on the time when the share panel is generated. For example when the share panel is generated in the morning for example six o clock to nine o clock the generation unit inserts the template that conjures up a fresh image into the template selection screen W.

When the terminal apparatus is a mobile terminal the generation unit may acquire positional information indicating the current position from the terminal apparatus and change the template included in the template selection screen W depending on the acquired positional information. For example when the terminal apparatus is located in the vicinity of a tourist spot during the generation of the share panel the generation unit inserts the template related to the tourist spot into the template selection screen W.

In the above described embodiment the generation unit allows the user to input share panel information in the order of but the invention is not limited thereto. For example the generation unit may allow the user to input comments to the comment input screen W and then allow the user to select the template on the template selection screen W. In this case the generation unit may change the template included in the template selection screen W depending on the comments input to the comment input screen W. For example the generation unit may perform morphological analysis for the comments. When the input comments include words indicating emotions for example joy and sorrow the generation unit may insert the template corresponding to the emotions into the template selection screen W. In addition the generation unit may process the photograph image selected from the share image selection screen W into a photograph corresponding to the emotions. For example when the comments include the word sorrow the generation unit may overlap the image of a tear on the eye of the user who is drawn in the photograph image.

For example the generation unit may allow the user to select the photograph image from the share image selection screen W and then allow the user to select the template from the template selection screen W. In this case the generation unit may change the template included in the template selection screen W based on the photograph image selected from the share image selection screen W. For example the generation unit may analyze the photograph image to estimate the emotions of the user drawn in the photograph image and insert the template corresponding to the estimated emotions into the template selection screen W. In addition the generation unit may process the photograph image selected from the share image selection screen W into a photograph corresponding to the estimated emotions.

The information providing apparatus may store the number of times the template is selected by the user or the frequency of the selection for each template. In this case the generation unit may preferentially insert the template which is frequently selected by the user among the templates stored in the template storage unit into the template selection screen W. In this way the information providing apparatus can provide a popular template to the user.

The information providing apparatus may store combinations of the templates and the photograph images which were selected by each user in the past as history information for each user. Then the generation unit may preferentially insert the template which has been frequently selected together with the photograph image selected from the share image selection screen W among the templates stored in the template storage unit into the template selection screen W. In addition when the photograph image is selected after the template is selected the generation unit may preferentially insert the photograph image which has been frequently selected together with the selected template into the share image selection screen W.

In the above described embodiment the information providing apparatus may store the click rate of each share panel the ratio of the number of clicks to the number of times the share panel is displayed or the number of clicks as history information for each share panel. Alternatively the information providing apparatus may display the share panel together with an evaluation button for evaluating the share panel in the web page and store the evaluation value of each share panel for each share panel. Then the generation unit may preferentially insert the template used for a share panel with a high click rate the template used for a share panel which is frequently clicked or the template used for a share panel with a large evaluation value among the templates stored in the template storage unit into the template selection screen W. In this way the generation unit can generate a share panel which is likely to be clicked.

The information providing apparatus may store the click rate or the number of clicks or the evaluation value of the share panel as the history information for each web page that is the web page to be advertised which is the link destination of the share panel. Then when generating a new share panel to be linked to a predetermined web page the generation unit may preferentially insert the template used for a share panel with a high click rate or which is frequently clicked or a large evaluation value among the generated share panels to be linked to the web page into the template selection screen W. The invention is not limited to this example. For example the information providing apparatus may store the click rate or the number of clicks or the evaluation value of the share panel as the history information for each attribute of the web page which is the link destination of the share panel. The attributes of the web page are classified into for example a news site a finance site a weather site and a shopping site. The attributes of the web page may be classified in more detail. For example the attributes of the web page correspond to the attributes of the articles inserted into the web page for example politics sports and entertainment or the attributes of products inserted into the web page for example appliances and foodstuffs . Then when generating a new share panel to be linked to a predetermined web page the generation unit may preferentially insert the template used for a share panel with a high click rate or which is frequently clicked or a large evaluation value among the generated share panels to be linked to a web page with attributes identical to the attributes of the predetermined web page into the template selection screen W. Therefore the generation unit can recommend the user the template which has high compatibility with the web page which is the link destination of the share panel and is likely to be clicked. As a result the generation unit can generate the share panel which is likely to be clicked.

In the above described embodiment the SNS server may store the click rate or the number of clicks of each share panel as the history information for each share panel. In addition when the evaluation button for evaluating the share panel is displayed as described above the SNS server may store the evaluation value of each evaluation value for each share panel. Then when a share panel acquisition request is received from the terminal apparatus the distribution unit of the SNS server may preferentially distribute a share panel with a high click rate or which is frequently clicked or a share panel with a large evaluation value among the share panels posted by the user who is a friend of the user of the terminal apparatus to the terminal apparatus . That is when there are a plurality of share panels to be linked to the same web page the distribution unit may preferentially distribute the share panel with a high click rate or a large evaluation value to the terminal apparatus . In this case the click rate or the evaluation is likely to be greatly changed depending on the user who generates the share panel even in the same web page which is a link destination. Therefore the SNS server can distribute the share panel which is more likely to be clicked to the terminal apparatus .

Contrary to the above mentioned example when there are a plurality of share panels to be linked to the same web page the distribution unit may preferentially distribute the share panel with a low click rate or a small evaluation value to the terminal apparatus . The reason is as follows. When the share panel has a low click rate or a small evaluation value but is generated by the friend it is more likely to be clicked than general advertising content. That is the information providing apparatus according to the embodiment allows the user to browse the share panel generated by the friend. Therefore even when the share panel with a low click rate or a small evaluation value is preferentially displayed it is possible to improve the click rate. In addition when the click rate or evaluation value of a web page which is a link destination is less than the click rate or evaluation value of another web page which is a link destination the distribution unit may preferentially distribute the share panel linked to the web page which is a link destination to the terminal apparatus . The reason is as follows. When the share panel has a low click rate or a small evaluation value but the share panel is generated by the friend it is likely to be clicked.

In the above described embodiment the share panel is displayed in the sharing advertisement frame C of the web page. However when there is no advertising content to be displayed in the general advertisement frame C the share panel may be displayed in the general advertisement frame C.

In the above described embodiment the photograph image incorporated into the share panel is not limited to the tagged photograph image. For example the photograph image which is posted to the SNS server by the user who generates the share panel or a fiend of the user may be incorporated into the share panel.

In the above described embodiment the information providing apparatus generates the share panel of the web page which is provided by the information providing apparatus . However the information providing apparatus may generate the share panel of the web page which is generated by an apparatus for example the advertiser apparatus other than the information providing apparatus . For example the apparatus of the advertiser apparatus distributes the web page including the miShare button B which is linked to the information providing apparatus to the terminal apparatus . When the user presses the miShare button B the terminal apparatus accesses the information providing apparatus and generates the share panel as in the example illustrated in .

In the above described embodiment the share panel is the link information to the web page. However the share panel may be link information to content other than the web page. For example the share panel may be link information to a still image a moving image or music data.

Among the processes according to the above described embodiment some or all of the processes which are automatically performed may be manually performed or some or all of the processes which are manually performed may be automatically performed by a known method.

For example in the above described embodiment the information providing apparatus and the SNS server may be the same apparatus. That is the information providing apparatus may be a server apparatus which distributes the web pages and provides the social networking service. In this case the information providing apparatus illustrated in does not need to include the transmitting unit and includes the same processing units as the storage unit and the control unit illustrated in .

As described above the information providing apparatus according to the embodiment includes the receiving unit and the distribution unit . The receiving unit receives an access request for accessing a web page corresponding to an example of first content from the terminal apparatus used by the first user. When the receiving unit receives the access request the distribution unit distributes to the terminal apparatus a web page including the share panel corresponding to an example of link information posted by the second user related to the first user in a predetermined social networking service corresponding to an example of a communication service among the share panels linked to another web page corresponding to an example of another content .

Therefore the information providing apparatus according to the embodiment can distribute the share panel which is likely to be clicked by the user as advertisements. Specifically the information providing apparatus displays the share panel processed by the friend in the web page which makes it possible to distribute advertisements with high customer appeal.

In the network system according to the embodiment when the user needs to log in the SNS server in order to generate the share panel it is possible to increase the number of members of the SNS server . In the network system according to the embodiment since the tagged photograph image is inserted into the share panel it is possible to facilitate the tagging of the user to tag the photograph image. That is in the network system according to the embodiment it is possible to improve the rate of utilization of the SNS server .

In the information providing apparatus according to the embodiment the distribution unit distributes the web page in which the share panel including user information for example the tagged photograph image for identifying the second user is displayed.

Therefore the information providing apparatus according to the embodiment enables the user who browses the share panel to recognize the user who has posted the share panel. As a result it is possible to improve the possibility that the share panel will be clicked.

In the information providing apparatus according to the embodiment the generation unit generates a share panel including information for example a title indicating a predetermined web page or user information for example the tagged photograph image for identifying the first user as the share panel to be linked to the predetermined web page in response to the operation of the first user of the terminal apparatus which has received the predetermined web page.
