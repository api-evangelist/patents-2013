The subject matter described relates generally to the interfacing with computer and mechanical devices by a user and more particularly to devices used to interface with computer systems and electronic devices and which provide haptic feedback to the user.

Humans interface with electronic and mechanical devices in a variety of applications and the need for a more natural easy to use and informative interface is a constant concern. In the context humans interface with computer devices for a variety of applications. One such application is interacting with computer generated environments such as games simulations and application programs. Computer input devices such as mice and trackballs are often used to control a cursor within a graphical environment and provide input in these applications.

In some interface devices force feedback or tactile feedback is also provided to the user collectively known herein as haptic feedback. For example haptic versions of joysticks mice gamepads steering wheels or other types of devices can output forces to the user based on events or interactions occurring within the graphical environment such as in a game or other application program.

In portable computer or electronic devices such as laptop computers mice typically too large a workspace to be practical. As a result more compact devices such as trackballs are often used. A more popular device for portable computers are touchpads which are small rectangular planar pads provided near the keyboard of the computer. The touchpads senses the location of a pointing object by any of a variety of sensing technologies such as capacitive sensors or pressure sensors that detect pressure applied to the touchpad. The user contacts the touchpad most commonly with a fingertip and moves his or her finger on the pad to move a cursor displayed in the graphical environment. In other embodiments the user can operate a stylus in conjunction with the touchpad by pressing the stylus tip on the touchpad and moving the stylus.

One problem with existing touchpads is that there is no haptic feedback provided to the user. The user of a touchpad is therefore not able to experience haptic sensations that assist and inform the user of targeting and other control tasks within the graphical environment. The touchpads of the prior art also cannot take advantage of existing haptic enabled software run on the portable computer.

An embodiment is directed to a haptic feedback planar touch control used to provide input to a computer system. The control can be a touchpad provided on a portable computer or can be a touch screen found on a variety of devices. The haptic sensations output on the touch control enhance interactions and manipulations in a displayed graphical environment or when controlling an electronic device.

More specifically the embodiment relates to a haptic feedback touch control for inputting signals to a computer and for outputting forces to a user of the touch control. The control includes a touch input device including an approximately planar touch surface operative to input a position signal to a processor of said computer based on a location of user contact on the touch surface. The computer positions a cursor in a graphical environment displayed on a display device based at least in part on the position signal. At least one actuator is also coupled to the touch input device and outputs a force on the touch input device to provide a haptic sensation to the user contacting the touch surface. The actuator outputs the force based on force information output by the processor to the actuator.

The touch input device can be a touchpad separate from a display screen of the computer or can be included in a display screen of the computer as a touch screen. The touch input device can be integrated in a housing of the computer or handheld device or provided in a housing that is separate from the computer. The user contacts the touch surface with a finger a stylus or other object. The force is preferably a linear force output approximately perpendicularly to a plane of the touch surface of the touch input device and the actuator can include a piezo electric actuator a voice coil actuator a pager motor a solenoid or other type of actuator. In one embodiment the actuator is coupled between the touch input device and a grounded surface. In another embodiment the actuator is coupled to an inertial mass wherein said actuator outputs an inertial force on the touch input device approximately along an axis perpendicular to the planar touch surface. A touch device microprocessor separate from the main processor of the computer can receive force information from the host computer and provide control signals based on the force information to control the actuator.

The haptic sensations such as a pulse vibration or spatial texture are preferably output in accordance with an interaction of a controlled cursor with a graphical object in the graphical environment. For example a pulse can be output when the cursor is moved between menu elements in a menu moved over said icon or moved over a hyperlink. The touch input device can include multiple different regions where at least one of the regions provides the position signal and at least one other region provides a signal that is used by the computer to control a different function such as rate control function of a value or a button press. Different regions and borders between regions can be associated with different haptic sensations.

An embodiment advantageously provides haptic feedback to a planar touch control device of a computer such as a touchpad or touch screen. The haptic feedback can assist and inform the user of interactions and events within a graphical user interface or other environment and ease cursor targeting tasks. Furthermore an embodiment allows portable computer devices having such touch controls to take advantage of existing haptic feedback enabled software. The haptic touch devices disclosed herein are also inexpensive compact and consume low power allowing them to be easily incorporated into a wide variety of portable and desktop computers and electronic devices.

These and other advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following specification and a study of the several figures of the drawing.

Computer may include the various input and output devices as shown including a display device for outputting graphical images to the user a keyboard for providing character or toggle input from the user to the computer and a touchpad . Display device can be any of a variety of types of display devices flat panel displays are most common on portable computers. Display device can display a graphical environment based on application programs and or operating systems that are running such as a graphical user interface GUI that can include a cursor that can be moved by user input as well as windows icons and other graphical objects well known in GUI environments. Other devices may also be incorporated or coupled to the computer such as storage devices hard disk drive DVD ROM drive etc. network server or clients game controllers etc. In alternate embodiments the computer can take a wide variety of forms including computing devices that rest on a tabletop or other surface stand up arcade game machines other portable devices or devices worn on the person handheld or used with a single hand of the user etc. For example host computer can be a video game console personal computer workstation a television set top box or a network computer or other computing or electronic device.

Touchpad device preferably appears externally to be similar to the touchpads of the prior art. Pad includes a planar rectangular smooth surface that can be positioned below the keyboard on the housing of the computer as shown or may be positioned at other areas of the housing. When the user operates the computer the user may conveniently place a fingertip or other object on the touchpad and move the fingertip to correspondingly move cursor in the graphical environment .

In operation the touchpad inputs coordinate data to the main microprocessor s of the computer based on the sensed location of an object on or near the touchpad. As with many touchpads of the prior art touchpad can be capacitive resistive or use a different type of sensing. Some existing touchpad embodiments are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 521 336 and 5 943 044. Capacitive touchpads typically sense the location of an object on or near the surface of the touchpad based on capacitive coupling between capacitors in the touchpad and the object. Resistive touchpads are typically pressure sensitive detecting the pressure of a finger stylus or other object against the pad where the pressure causes conductive layers traces switches etc. in the pad to electrically connect. Some resistive or other types of touchpads can detect the amount of pressure applied by the user and can use the degree of pressure for proportional or variable input to the computer . Resistive touchpads typically are at least partially deformable so that when a pressure is applied to a particular location the conductors at that location are brought into electrical contact. Such deformability can be useful since it can potentially amplify the magnitude of output forces such as pulses or vibrations on the touchpad. Forces can be amplified if a tuned compliant suspension is provided between an actuator and the object that is moved as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 680 729. Capacitive touchpads and other types of touchpads that do not require significant contact pressure may be better suited in many embodiments since excessive pressure on the touchpad may in some cases interfere with the motion of the touchpad for haptic feedback. Other types of sensing technologies can also be used in the touchpad. Herein the term touchpad preferably includes the surface of the touchpad as well as any sensing apparatus included in the touchpad unit.

Touchpad preferably operates similarly to existing touchpads where the speed of the fingertip on the touchpad correlates to the distance that the cursor is moved in the graphical environment. For example if the user moves his or her finger quickly across the pad the cursor is moved a greater distance than if the user moves the fingertip more slowly. If the user s finger reaches the edge of the touchpad before the cursor reaches a desired destination in that direction then the user can simply move his or her finger off the touchpad reposition the finger away from the edge and continue moving the cursor. This is an indexing function similar to lifting a mouse off a surface to change the offset between mouse position and cursor. Furthermore many touchpads can be provided with particular regions that are each assigned to particular functions that can be unrelated to cursor positioning. Such an embodiment is described in greater detail below with respect to . In some embodiments the touchpad may also allow a user to tap the touchpad rapidly touch and remove the object from the pad in a particular location to provide a command. For example the user can tap or double tap the pad with a finger while the controlled cursor is over an icon to select that icon.

The touchpad is provided with the ability to output haptic feedback such as tactile sensations to the user who is physically contacting the touchpad . Various embodiments detailing the structure of the haptic feedback touchpad are described in greater detail below. Preferably the forces output on the touchpad are linear or approximately linear and oriented along the z axis approximately perpendicular to the surface of the touchpad and the top surface of computer . In a different embodiment forces can be applied to the touchpad to cause side to side e.g. x y motion of the pad in the plane of its surface in addition to or instead of z axis motion although such motion is not preferred.

Using one or more actuators coupled to the touchpad a variety of haptic sensations can be output to the user who is contacting the pad. For example jolts vibrations varying or constant amplitude and textures can be output. Forces output on the pad can be at least in part based on the location of the finger on the pad or the state of a controlled object in the graphical environment of the host computer and or independent of finger position or object state. Such forces output on the touchpad are considered computer controlled since a microprocessor or other electronic controller is controlling the magnitude and or direction of the force output of the actuator s using electronic signals. Preferably the entire pad is provided with haptic sensations as a single unitary member in other embodiments individually moving portions of the pad can each be provided with its own haptic feedback actuator and related transmissions so that haptic sensations can be provided for only a particular portion. For example some embodiments may include a touchpad having different portions that may be flexed or otherwise moved with respect to other portions of the pad.

In other embodiments the touchpad can be provided in a separate housing that is connected to a port of the computer via a cable or via wireless transmission and which receives force information from and sends position information to the computer . For example Universal Serial Bus USB Firewire or a standard serial bus can connect such a touchpad to the computer . In such an embodiment the computer can be any desktop or stationary computer or device and need not be a portable device.

One or more buttons can also be provided on the housing of the computer to be used in conjunction with the touchpad . The user s hands have easy access to the buttons each of which may be pressed by the user to provide a distinct input signal to the host computer . Typically each button corresponds to a similar button found on a mouse input device so that a left button can be used to select a graphical object click or double click a right button can bring up a context menu etc. In some embodiments one or more of the buttons can be provided with tactile feedback as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 184 868 and 6 563 487. Other features of these disclosures may also be used.

Furthermore in some embodiments one or more moveable portions of the housing of the computer device can be included which is contacted by the user when the user operates the touchpad and which can provide haptic feedback. Having a moveable portion of a housing for haptic feedback is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 184 868 and 6 088 019. Thus both the housing can provide haptic feedback e.g. through the use of an eccentric rotating mass on a motor coupled to the housing and the touchpad can provide separate haptic feedback. This allows the host to control two different tactile sensations simultaneously to the user for example a vibration of a low frequency can be conveyed through the housing to the user and a higher frequency vibration can be conveyed to the user through the touchpad . Each other button or other control provided with haptic feedback can also provide tactile feedback independently from the other controls.

The host application program s and or operating system preferably displays graphical images of the environment on display device . The software and environment running on the host computer may be of a wide variety. For example the host application program can be a word processor spreadsheet video or computer game drawing program operating system graphical user interface simulation Web page or browser that implements HTML or VRML instructions scientific analysis program virtual reality training program or application or other application program that utilizes input from the touchpad and outputs force feedback commands to the touchpad . For example many games and other application programs include force feedback functionality and may communicate with the touchpad using a standard protocol drivers such as I Force FEELit or Touchsense available from Immersion Corporation of San Jose Calif.

The touchpad can include circuitry necessary to report control signals to the microprocessor of the host computer and to process command signals from the host s microprocessor. For example appropriate sensors and related circuitry are used to report the position of the user s finger on the touchpad . The touchpad device also includes circuitry that receives signals from the host and outputs tactile sensations in accordance with the host signals using one or more actuators. In some embodiments a separate local microprocessor can be provided for the touchpad to both report touchpad sensor data to the host and or to carry out force commands received from the host such commands including for example the type of haptic sensation and parameters describing the commanded haptic sensation. Alternatively the touchpad microprocessor can simply pass streamed data from the main processor to the actuators. The term force information can include both commands parameters and streamed data. The touchpad microprocessor can implement haptic sensations independently after receiving a host command by controlling the touchpad actuators or the host processor can maintain a greater degree of control over the haptic sensations by controlling the actuators more directly. In other embodiments logic circuitry such as state machines provided for the touchpad can handle haptic sensations as directed by the host main processor. Architectures and control methods that can be used for reading sensor signals and providing haptic feedback for a device are described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5 734 373 and co pending application Ser. Nos. 60 156 354 60 133 208 09 376 649 U.S. Pat. No. 6 639 581 and 60 160 401.

In one application the controlled apparatus can be a computer system such as Web TV from Microsoft Corp. or other computing device which displays a graphical user interface and or web pages accessed over a network such as the Internet. The user can control the direction of the cursor by moving a finger or other object on the touchpad . The cursor can be used to select and or manipulate icons windows menu items graphical buttons slider bars scroll bars or other graphical objects in a graphical user interface or desktop interface. The cursor can also be used to select and or manipulate graphical objects on a web page such as links images buttons etc. Other force sensations associated with graphical objects are described below with reference to .

The piezoelectric actuators can each output a small pulse vibration or texture sensation on the touchpad and to the user if the user is contacting the touchpad. The entire touchpad is preferably moved with the forces output by actuator s . Preferably the forces output on the touchpad are linear or approximately linear and along the z axis approximately perpendicular to the surface of the touchpad and the top surface of computer . In a different embodiment as mentioned above forces can be applied to the touchpad to cause side to side e.g. x y motion of the pad in the plane of its surface in addition to or instead of z axis motion. For example one linear actuator can provide motion for the x axis and a second linear actuator can provide motion for the y axis and or the x axis.

The frequency of a vibration output by an actuator can be varied by providing different control signals to an actuator . Furthermore the magnitude of a pulse or vibration can be controlled based on the applied control signal. If multiple actuators are provided a stronger vibration can be imparted on the touchpad by activating two or more actuators simultaneously. Furthermore if an actuator is positioned at an extreme end of the touchpad and is the only actuator that is activated the user may experience a stronger vibration on the side of the touchpad having the actuator than on the opposite side of the touchpad. Different magnitudes and localized effects can be obtained by activating some but not all of the actuators. Since the tip of a user s finger that is touching the pad is fairly sensitive the output forces do not have to be of a high magnitude for the haptic sensation to be effective and compelling.

Besides using a finger to contact the touchpad the user may also hold other objects that directly contact the touchpad. Any haptic sensations output on the pad can be transmitted through the held object to the user s hand. For example the user can hold a stylus having a point that contacts the touchpad more precisely than a finger. Other objects may also be used. In some embodiments specialized objects can be used to enhance the haptic sensations. For example a stylus or other object having a flexible portion or compliance may be able to magnify at least some of the touchpad haptic sensations as experienced by the user.

The piezoelectric actuators have several advantages for the touchpad . These actuators can be made very thin and small allowing their use in compact housings that are typical for portable electronic devices. They also require very low power and are thus suitable for devices with limited power e.g. powered by batteries . In some embodiments described herein power for the actuators can be drawn off a bus connecting the computer to the touchpad or touch screen . For example if the touchpad is provided in a separate housing a Universal Serial Bus can connect the pad to the computer and provide power from the computer to the pad as well as data e.g. streaming force data force commands etc. .

The touchpad can be coupled only to the actuator or can be additionally coupled to the housing of the computer device at other locations besides the actuators . Preferably the other couplings are compliant connections using a material or element such as a spring or foam. If such connections are not made compliant then the touchpad itself preferably has some compliance to allow portions of the pad to move in response to actuator forces and to convey the haptic sensations to the user more effectively.

Since the touchpad is directly coupled to the actuator any produced forces are directly applied to the touchpad . The electric signal preferably is obtained from a microprocessor and any circuitry required to convert the microprocessor signal to an appropriate signal for use with the actuator .

An actuator is also coupled to the touchpad to impart forces on the touchpad and cause the touchpad to move along the z axis. In the present embodiment actuator is a linear voice coil actuator where the moving portion bobbin of the actuator is directly coupled to the touchpad . The actuator is grounded to the computer housing and outputs a linear force on the touchpad and thus drives the touchpad along the z axis. A short pulse or jolt can be output or the moving portion of the actuator can be oscillated to provide a vibration having a particular desired frequency. The springs cause the touchpad to return to a rest position after a force from the actuator causes the touchpad to move up or down. The springs can also provide a compliant suspension for the touchpad and allow forces output by the actuator to be amplified as explained above. Different types of spring elements can be used in other embodiments to couple the touchpad to the rigid housing such as leaf springs foam flexures or other compliant materials.

In some embodiments the user is able to push the touchpad along the z axis to provide additional input to the computer . For example a sensor can be used to detect the position of the touchpad along the z axis such as an optical sensor magnetic sensor Polhemus sensor etc. The position on the z axis can be used to provide proportional input to the computer for example. In addition other types of forces can be output along the z axis such as spring forces damping forces inertial forces and other position based forces as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 563 487. In addition 3 D elevations can be simulated in the graphical environment by moving the pad to different elevations along the z axis. If the pad can be used as an analog input depending on the distance the entire pad is moved along the z axis and or if kinesthetic force feedback is applied in the z axis degree of freedom then a greater range of motion for the pad along the z axis is desirable. An elastomeric layer can be provided if the touchpad is able to be pressed by the user to close a switch and provide button or switch input to the computer e.g. using contact switches optical switches or the like . If such z axis movement of the pad is allowed it is preferred that the z axis movement require a relatively large amount of force to move the pad at least initially since such z axis movement may not be desired during normal use of the pad by the user.

The voice coil actuator preferably includes a coil and a magnet where a current is flowed through the coil and interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet to cause a force on the moving portion of the actuator the coil or the magnet depending on the implementation as is well known to those skilled in the art and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 184 868. Other types of actuators can also be used such as a standard speaker an E core type actuator as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 704 001 a solenoid a pager motor a DC motor moving magnet actuator described in provisional application No. 60 133 208 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 704 001 or other type of actuator. Furthermore the actuator can be positioned to output linear motion along an axis perpendicular to the z axis or along another direction different from the z axis rotary or linear where a mechanism converts such output motion to linear motion along the z axis as is well known to those skilled in the art.

The touchpad can also be integrated with an elastomeric layer and or a printed circuit board in a sub assembly where one or more actuators are coupled to the printed circuit board to provide tactile sensations to the touchpad . Helical springs can also be provided to engage electrical contacts. Or multiple voice coil actuators can be positioned at different locations under the touchpad . These embodiments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 563 487. Any of the actuators described in that patent can also be used.

Touchpad can be compliantly mounted to the rigid housing of the computer device similarly to the embodiments described above. For example one or more spring elements can be coupled between the touchpad and the housing. These springs can be helical or leaf springs a compliant material such as rubber or foam flexures etc.

One or more actuators are coupled to the underside of the touchpad . In the embodiment of a piezoelectric actuator is shown. One portion of each actuator is coupled to the touchpad and the other portion is coupled to a mass . Thus when the portion is moved relative to the portion the mass is moved with the portion . The mass can be any suitable object of the desired weight such as plastic or metal material. The mass is moved approximately along the z axis and is not coupled to the housing allowing free motion. The motion of the mass along the z axis causes an inertial force that is transmitted through the actuator to the touchpad and the touchpad moves along the z axis due to the compliant coupling . The motion of the touchpad is felt by the user contacting the touchpad as a haptic sensation.

In different embodiments other types of actuators can be used. For example a linear voice coil actuator as described for can be used in which an inertial mass is coupled to the linear moving portion of the voice coil actuator. Other actuators can also be used such as solenoids pager motors moving magnet actuators E core actuators etc. Many actuators used for inertial haptic sensations are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 211 861. Furthermore a rotary actuator can be used where the rotary output force is converted to a linear force approximately along the z axis. For example the rotary force can be converted using a flexure as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 697 043.

In the preferred linear force implementation the direction or degree of freedom that the force is applied on the touchpad with respect to the inertial mass is important. If a significant component of the force is applied in the planar workspace of the touchpad i.e. along the X or Y axis with respect to the inertial mass a short pulse or vibration can interfere with the user s object motion in one or both of those planar degrees of freedom and thereby impair the user s ability to accurately guide a controlled graphical object such as a cursor to a given target. Since a primary function of the touchpad is accurate targeting a tactile sensation that distorts or impairs targeting even mildly is undesirable. To solve this problem the touchpad device applies inertial forces substantially along the Z axis orthogonal to the planar X and Y axes of the touchpad surface. In such a configuration tactile sensations can be applied at a perceptually strong level for the user without impairing the ability to accurately position a user controlled graphical object in the X and Y axes of the screen. Furthermore since the tactile sensations are directed in a third degree of freedom relative to the two dimensional planar workspace and display screen jolts or pulses output along the Z axis feel much more like three dimensional bumps or divots to the user that come out or go into the screen increasing the realism of the tactile sensations and creating a more compelling interaction. For example an upwardly directed pulse that is output when the cursor is moved over a window border creates the illusion that the user is moving a finger or other object over a bump at the window border.

The cursor control region of the pad can cause forces to be output on the pad based on interactions of the controlled cursor with the graphical environment and or events in that environment. The user moves a finger or other object within region to correspondingly move the cursor . Forces are preferably associated with the interactions of the cursor with displayed graphical objects. For example a jolt or pulse sensation can be output which is a single impulse of force that quickly rises to the desired magnitude and then is turned off or quickly decays back to zero or small magnitude. The touchpad can be jolted in the z axis to provide the pulse. A vibration sensation can also be output which is a time varying force that is typically periodic. The vibration can cause the touchpad or portions thereof to oscillate back and forth on the z axis and can be output by a host or local microprocessor to simulate a particular effect that is occurring in a host application.

Another type of force sensation that can be output on the touchpad is a texture force. This type of force is similar to a pulse force but depends on the position of the user s finger on the area of the touchpad and or on the location of the cursor in the graphical environment. Thus texture bumps are output depending on whether the cursor has moved over a location of a bump in a graphical object. This type of force is spatially dependent i.e. a force is output depending on the location of the cursor as it moves over a designated textured area when the cursor is positioned between bumps of the texture no force is output and when the cursor moves over a bump a force is output. This can be achieved by host control e.g. the host sends the pulse signals as the cursor is dragged over the grating . In some embodiments a separate touchpad microprocessor can be dedicated for haptic feedback with the touchpad and the texture effect and be achieved using local control e.g. the host sends a high level command with texture parameters and the sensation is directly controlled by the touchpad processor . In other cases a texture can be performed by presenting a vibration to a user the vibration being dependent upon the current velocity of the user s finger or other object on the touchpad. When the finger is stationary the vibration is deactivated as the finger is moved faster the frequency and magnitude of the vibration is increased. This sensation can be controlled locally by the touchpad processor if present or be controlled by the host. Local control by the pad processor may eliminate communication burden in some embodiments. Other spatial force sensations can also be output. In addition any of the described force sensations herein can be output simultaneously or otherwise combined as desired.

Different types of graphical objects can be associated with tactile sensations. Tactile sensations can output on the touchpad based on interaction between a cursor and a window. For example a z axis bump or pulse can be output on the touchpad to signal the user of the location of the cursor when the cursor is moved over a border of a window. When the cursor is moved within the window s borders a texture force sensation can be output. The texture can be a series of bumps that are spatially arranged within the area of the window in a predefined pattern when the cursor moves over a designated bump area a bump force is output on the touchpad. A pulse or bump force can be output when the cursor is moved over a selectable object such as a link in a displayed web page or an icon. A vibration can also be output to signify a graphical object which the cursor is currently positioned over. Furthermore features of a document displaying in a window can also be associated with force sensations. For example a pulse can be output on the touchpad when a page break in a document is scrolled past a particular area of the window. Page breaks or line breaks in a document can similarly be associated with force sensations such as bumps or vibrations.

Furthermore a menu items in a displayed menu can be selected by the user after a menu heading or graphical button is selected. The individual menu items in the menu can be associated with forces. For example vertical z axis bumps or pulses can be output when the cursor is moved over the border between menu items. The sensations for certain menu choices can be stronger than others to indicate importance or frequency of use i.e. the most used menu choices can be associated with higher magnitude stronger pulses than the less used menu choices. Also currently disabled menu choices can have a weaker pulse or no pulse to indicate that the menu choice is not enabled at that time. Furthermore when providing tiled menus in which a sub menu is displayed after a particular menu element is selected as in Microsoft Windows pulse sensations can be sent when a sub menu is displayed. This can be very useful because users may not expect a sub menu to be displayed when moving a cursor on a menu element. Icons can be associated with textures pulses and vibrations similarly to the windows described above. Drawing or CAD programs also have many features which can be associated with similar haptic sensations such as displayed or invisible grid lines or dots control points of a drawn object etc.

In other related interactions when a rate control or scrolling function is performed with the touchpad through use of the cursor a vibration can be displayed on the device to indicate that scrolling is in process. When reaching the end of a numerical range that is being adjusted such as volume a pulse can be output to indicate that the end of the range has been reached. Pulse sensations can be used to indicate the location of the ticks for discrete values or settings in the adjusted range. A pulse can also be output to inform the user when the center of the range is reached. Different strength pulses can also be used larger strength indicating the more important ticks. In other instances strength and or frequency of a vibration can be correlated with the adjustment of a control to indicate current magnitude of the volume or other adjusted value. In other interactions a vibration sensation can be used to indicate that a control function is active. Furthermore in some cases a user performs a function like selection or cutting or pasting a document and there is a delay between the button press that commands the function and the execution of the function due to processing delays or other delays. A pulse sensation can be used to indicate that the function the cut or paste has been executed.

Furthermore the magnitude of output forces on the touchpad can depend on the event or interaction in the graphical environment. For example the force pulse can be a different magnitude of force depending on the type of graphical object encountered by the cursor. For example pulses of higher magnitude can be output when the cursor moves over windows while pulses of lower magnitude can be output when the cursor moves over icons. The magnitude of the pulses can also depend on other characteristics of graphical objects such as an active window as distinguished from a background window file folder icons of different priorities designated by the user icons for games as distinguished from icons for business applications different menu items in a drop down menu etc. The user or developer can also preferably associate particular graphical objects with customized haptic sensations.

User independent events can also be relayed to the user using haptic sensations on the touchpad. An event occurring within the graphical environment such as an appointment reminder receipt of email explosion in a game etc. can be signified using a vibration pulse or other time based force. The force sensation can be varied to signify different events of the same type. For example vibrations of different frequency can each be used to differentiate different events or different characteristics of events such as particular users sending email the priority of an event or the initiation or conclusion of particular tasks e.g. the downloading of a document or data over a network . When the host system is thinking requiring the user to wait while a function is being performed or accessed usually when a timer is displayed by the host it is often a surprise when the function is complete. If the user takes his or her eyes off the screen he or she may not be aware that the function is complete. A pulse sensation can be sent to indicate that the thinking is over.

A software designer may want to allow a user to be able to select options or a software function by positioning a cursor over an area on the screen using the touchpad but not require pressing a physical button or tapping the touchpad to actually select the option. Currently it is problematic to allow such selection because a user has physical confirmation of execution when pressing a physical button. A pulse sent to the touchpad can act as that physical confirmation without the user having to press a button or other control for selection. For example a user can position a cursor over a web page element and once the cursor is within the desired region for a given period of time an associated function can be executed. This is indicated to the user through a tactile pulse sent to the pad .

The above described force sensations can also be used in games or simulations. For example a vibration can be output when a user controlled racing car is driving on a dirt shoulder of a displayed road a pulse can be output when the car collides with another object and a varying frequency vibration can be output when a vehicle engine starts and rumbles. The magnitude of pulses can be based on the severity of a collision or explosion the size of the controlled graphical object or entity and or the size of a different graphical object entity that is interacted with etc. Force sensations can also be output based on user independent events in the game or simulation such as pulses when bullets are fired at the user s character.

The above haptic sensations can be similar to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 243 078 and 6 211 861. Other control devices or grips that can include a touchpad in its housing include a gamepad mouse or trackball device for manipulating a cursor or other graphical objects in a computer generated environment or a pressure sphere or the like. For example the touchpad can be provided on the housing of a computer mouse to provide additional input to the host computer. Furthermore selective disturbance filtering of forces as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 020 876 and shaping of force signals to drive the touchpad with impulse waves as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 959 613 can be used. Such impulses are also effective when driven with stored power in a battery on the computer or from a bus such as USB connected to a host computer.

The touchpad can also be provided with different control regions that provide separate input from the main cursor control region . In some embodiments the different regions can be physically marked with lines borders or textures on the surface of the pad and or sounds from the computer so that the user can visually audibly and or or tactilely tell which region he or she is contacting on the pad.

For example scroll or rate control regions and can be used to provide input to perform a rate control task such as scrolling documents adjusting a value such as audio volume speaker balance monitor display brightness etc. or panning tilting the view in a game or virtual reality simulation. Region can be used by placing a finger or other object within the region where the upper portion of the region will increase the value scroll up etc. and the lower portion of the region will decrease the value scroll down etc. In embodiments that can read the amount of pressure placed on the pad the amount of pressure can directly control the rate of adjustment e.g. a greater pressure will cause a document to scroll faster. The region can similarly be used for horizontal left right scrolling or rate control adjustment of a different value view etc.

Particular haptic effects can be associated with the control regions and . For example when using the rate control region or a vibration of a particular frequency can be output on the pad . In those embodiments having multiple actuators an actuator placed directly under the region or can be activated to provide a more localized tactile sensation for the active currently used region. As a portion of a region is pressed for rate control pulses can be output on the pad or region of the pad to indicate when a page has scroll by a particular value has passed etc. A vibration can also be continually output while the user contacts the region or

Other regions can also be positioned on the touchpad . For example each of regions provides a small rectangular area like a button which the user can point to in order to initiate a function associated with the pointed to region. The regions can initiate such computer functions as running a program opening or closing a window going forward or back in a queue of web pages in a web browser powering the computer or initiating a sleep mode checking mail firing a gun in a game cutting or pasting data from a buffer selecting a font etc. The regions can duplicate functions and buttons provided in an application program or provide new different functions.

Similarly to regions the regions an each be associated with haptic sensations for example a region can provide a pulse sensation when it has been selected by the user providing instant feedback that the function has been selected. Furthermore the same types of regions can be associated with similar feeling haptic sensations. For example each word processor related region can when pointed to cause a pulse of a particular strength while each game related region can provide a pulse of different strength or a vibration. Furthermore when the user moves the pointing object from one region or to another a haptic sensation such as a pulse can be output on the pad to signify that a region border has been crossed.

In addition the regions are preferably programmable in size and shape as well as in the function with which they are associated. Thus the functions for regions can change based on an active application program in the graphical environment and or based on user preferences input to and or stored on the computer . Preferably the size and location of each of the regions can be adjusted by the user or by an application program and any or all of the regions can be completely removed if desired. Furthermore the user is preferably able to assign particular haptic sensations to particular areas or types of areas based on types of functions associated with those areas as desired. Different haptic sensations can be designed in a tool such as Immersion Studio available from Immersion Corporation of San Jose Calif.

It should be noted that the regions and need not be physical regions of the touchpad . That is the entire touchpad surface need merely provide coordinates of user contact to the processor of the computer and software on the computer can designate where different regions are located. The computer can interpret the coordinates and based on the location of the user contact can interpret the touchpad input signal as a cursor control signal or a different type of signal such as rate control button function etc. The local touchpad microprocessor if present may alternatively interpret the function associated with the user contact location and report appropriate signal or data to the host processor such as position coordinates or a button signal thus keeping the host processor ignorant of the lower level processing. In other embodiments the touchpad can be physically designed to output different signals to the computer based on different regions marked on the touchpad surface that are contacted by the user e.g. each region can be sensed by a different sensor or sensor array.

In one embodiment of a device a display screen typically covers a large portion of the surface of the computer device Screen is preferably a flat panel display as is well known to those skilled in the art and can display text images animations etc. in some embodiments screen is as functional as any personal computer screen. Display screen is preferably a touch screen that includes sensors which allow the user to input information to the computer device by physically contacting the screen i.e. it is another form of planar touch device similar to the touchpad . For example a transparent sensor film can be overlaid on the screen where the film can detect pressure from an object contacting the film. The sensor devices for implementing touch screens are well known to those skilled in the art.

The user can select graphically displayed buttons or other graphical objects by pressing a finger or a stylus to the screen at the exact location where the graphical object is displayed. Furthermore some embodiments allow the user to draw or write on the screen by displaying graphical ink images at locations where the user has pressed a tip of a stylus finger or other object. Handwritten characters can be recognized by software running on the device microprocessor as commands dada or other input. In other embodiments the user can provide input additionally or alternatively through voice recognition where a microphone on the device inputs the users s voice which is translated to appropriate commands or data by software running on the device. Physical buttons can also be included in the housing of the device to provide particular commands to the device when the buttons are pressed. Many PDA s are characterized by the lack of a standard keyboard for character input from the user rather an alternative input mode is used such as using a stylus to draw characters on the screen voice recognition etc. However some PDA s also include a fully functional keyboard as well as a touch screen where the keyboard is typically much smaller than a standard sized keyboard. In yet other embodiments standard size laptop computers with standard keyboards may include flat panel touch input display screens and such screen similar to screen of can be provided with haptic feedback.

The touch screen provides haptic feedback to the user similarly to the touchpad described in previous embodiments. One or more actuators be coupled to the underside of the touch screen to provide haptic feedback such as pulse vibrations and texture for example an actuator can be positioned near each corner of the screen as shown in . Other configurations of actuators can also be used. The user can experience the haptic feedback through a finger or a held object such as a stylus that is contacting the screen .

As shown in the touch screen is preferably coupled to the housing of the device by one or more spring or compliant elements such as helical springs leaf springs flexures or compliant material foam rubber etc. The compliant elements allows the touch screen to move approximately along the z axis thereby providing haptic feedback similarly to the touchpad embodiments described above. Actuators can be piezo eletric actuators voice coil actuators or any of the other types of actuators described above for the touchpad embodiments. As shown in the actuators are directly coupled to the touch screen similarly to the touchpad embodiment of alternatively an inertial mass can be moved to provide inertial feedback in the z axis of the touch screen similarly to the touchpad embodiment of . Other features described above for the touchpad are equally applicable to the touch screen embodiment .

In the embodiments of touch input devices touchpad and touch screen described herein it is also advantageous that contact of the user is detected by the touch input device. Since haptic feedback need only be output when the user is contacting the touch device this detection allows haptic feedback to be stopped actuators turned off when no objects are contacting the touch input device. This feature can conserve battery power for portable devices. If a local touch device microprocessor or similar circuitry is being used in the computer such a microprocessor can turn off actuator output when no user contact is sensed thus alleviating the host processor of additional computational burden.

While the subject matter has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments it is contemplated that alterations permutations and equivalents thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the specification and study of the drawing. For example many different types of actuators can be used to output tactile sensations to the user. Furthermore many of the features described in one embodiment can be used interchangeably with other embodiments. Furthermore certain terminology has been used for the purposes of descriptive clarity and not to be limiting.
