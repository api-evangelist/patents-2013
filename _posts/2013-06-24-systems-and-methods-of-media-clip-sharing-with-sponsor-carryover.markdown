Advances in technologies have made the practice of sharing clips of media programs among people convenient. For example a consumer of a media program may conveniently share a clip of the media program to a social network by posting the clip and or a link to the clip to a social networking site.

Unfortunately a sponsor of the media program may not benefit at least not directly from the clip being shared to the social network by the consumer. For example the shared clip and or link to the clip may be devoid of any association with the sponsor of the media program. Accordingly members of the social network may be entirely unaware of a sponsorship of the media program by the sponsor.

Examples of systems and methods of media clip sharing with sponsor carryover are described herein. The exemplary systems and methods described herein may include a media clip sharing system receiving from an end user of a media distribution service that distributes a media program a request to share a clip of the media program to a social network e.g. by way of a social media service and in response to the request to share the clip of the media program to the social network identifying a sponsor of the media program in the media distribution service and sharing the clip of the media program and data representative of the identified sponsor to the social network.

In this or a similar manner a sponsor of a media program in a media distribution service may be carried over to a social network along with a clip of the media program that is shared to the social network. The sponsor carryover may benefit the sponsor at least by extending the reach of the sponsor s advertising from the media distribution service to the social network. The sponsor carryover may further benefit a producer of the media program and or an operator of the media distribution service such as by increasing revenues paid by sponsors for extended exposure to the social network. Additionally or alternatively the sponsor carryover may benefit the user who shared the media clip such as by the user receiving financial benefit for sharing the clip e.g. by being paid for each person in the social network who accesses the clip . These and or other benefits may be provided by the exemplary systems and methods described herein.

Examples of systems and methods of media clip sharing with sponsor carryover as well as exemplary views of media clip sharing graphical user interfaces GUIs provided by the systems and methods will now be described in reference to the accompanying drawings.

Storage facility may be configured to store data generated and or used by clip sharing facility and or sponsor carryover facility . For example storage facility may store share request data representative of one or more requests to share one or more clips of one or more media programs to one or more social networks media clip data representative of one or more clips of one or more media programs e.g. clips to be shared to one or more social networks and sponsor data representative of one or more sponsors of one or more media programs. Storage facility may store additional or alternative data as may serve a particular implementation.

The data stored by storage facility may be accessed by system from any suitable source including a source internal or external to system . Storage facility may permanently or temporarily store data. In certain examples system may access certain data from a source external to system and temporarily store the data in storage facility for use by clip sharing facility and or sponsor carryover facility . In certain examples data generated by clip sharing facility and or sponsor carryover facility may be stored permanently or temporarily to storage facility .

Clip sharing facility may be configured to perform any of the media clip sharing operations described herein. For example clip sharing facility may receive a request to share a clip of a media program to a social network. Clip sharing facility may receive the request in any suitable way such as from an end user of a media distribution service that distributes the media program to the end user as described herein.

Clip sharing facility may share the clip of the media program to the social network in response to the request. Clip sharing facility may share the clip of the media program to the social network in any suitable way. For example clip sharing facility may transmit to user computing devices associated with members of the social network or to a social media service configured to distribute social media to members of the social network data representative of the clip of the media program and or other data e.g. hyperlink data media index data etc. configured for use by members of the social network to access the clip of the media program.

Sponsor carryover facility may be configured to perform any of the sponsor carryover operations described herein. For example sponsor carryover facility may identify a sponsor of the media program in response to the request to share the clip of the media program to the social network. Sponsor carryover facility may identify the sponsor of the media program in any suitable way including in any of the exemplary ways described herein.

Sponsor carryover facility may share data representative of the identified sponsor to the social network in response to the request to share the clip of the media program to the social network. Sponsor carryover facility may share the data representative of the sponsor to the social network in any suitable way. For example sponsor carryover facility may transmit to user computing devices associated with members of the social network or to a social media service configured to distribute social media to members of the social network the data representative of the sponsor. Sponsor carryover facility may transmit the data representative of the sponsor together with or separate from the clip shared to the social network in a manner configured to facilitate the data representative of the sponsor being associated with the shared clip by a recipient of the shared clip and the data representative of the sponsor.

In certain embodiments system may be configured to communicate with media distribution service and or social network via one or more communication networks not shown which may include without limitation one or more wireless networks Wi Fi networks wireless communication networks mobile telephone networks e.g. cellular telephone networks closed media networks open media networks closed communication networks open communication networks wide area networks e.g. the Internet local area networks and any other networks capable of carrying data and or communications signals between system and media distribution service and or between system and social network e.g. between system and computing devices associated with social network .

Alternatively system may communicate with media distribution service and or social network in another way such as by direct connections between system and media distribution service and or social network .

Social network may include a group of one or more members which may include entities such as individuals and or organizations. Social network may represent relationships and flows between the members in the group. In certain examples social network may include a group of one or more members who have a defined relationship with an end user of media distribution service who requests to share a clip of a media program. For instance social network may include a group of members who have a relationship with the end user of the media distribution service through a social media service e.g. the end user of the media distribution service and the members of the group may all be end users of the social media service and or may have defined relationships one with another within the social media service . As an example the end user of the media distribution service and the members of the group may be friends contacts or have another defined relationship within a social media service such as a social networking service and or any other social media service examples of which are described herein.

Media distribution service may include any service configured to facilitate consumption of media programs by one or more end users of media distribution service . For example media distribution service may be configured to distribute media programs to one or more end users of media distribution service e.g. one or more subscribers to media distribution service for consumption e.g. viewing recording etc. by the end users. Media distribution service may be associated with e.g. operated by a provider of media distribution service a media distribution service provider . Through media distribution service an end user of media distribution service may discover access and or consume media programs distributed by way of media distribution service .

Media distribution service may include and or be provided by an appropriately configured media distribution service system which may include any combination of computing devices and or other equipment configured to distribute media programs to end users of media distribution service . Media distribution service may include any type of media distribution service configured to distribute any format of media programs by way of any suitable media distribution medium or channel. In certain examples for instance media distribution service may include a television programming distribution service configured to distribute television programming e.g. in accordance with a linear television programming schedule an on demand media distribution service configured to distribute media programs on demand a physical media distribution service configured to distribute physical copies of media programs e.g. a media disc rental and or purchase service a digital media distribution service configured to distribute digital copies of media programs e.g. a digital download and or streaming service and or any other type of service that distributes media programs to end users of media distribution service .

As used herein the term media program may refer to any television program on demand media program pay per view media program broadcast media program e.g. broadcast television program multicast media program e.g. multicast television program narrowcast media program e.g. narrowcast video on demand program IPTV media program advertisement video movie audio program radio program or any other media program that a user may access by way of media distribution service . Such media programs that are made available for user consumption by media distribution service may be accessed and or played back by an appropriately configured user device e.g. a media player device for presentation to an end user of media distribution service .

A media program distributed by media distribution service may have one or more sponsors within media distribution service . As used herein the term sponsor may refer to any entity e.g. a person a company a government etc. that sponsors a media program within media distribution service e.g. a sponsor that sponsors the distribution of the media program within media distribution service . The term sponsor may additionally or alternatively refer to any sponsorship of a media program within media distribution service . A sponsor may sponsor a media program within media distribution service in any suitable way such as by paying at least a portion of the cost to distribute the media program paying for a sponsorship of the media program paying for distribution of an advertisement in association with the media program and or otherwise contributing specifically or generally toward the distribution of the media program by media distribution service and or a sponsorship of the media program within media distribution service in any other suitable way.

Conventionally sponsorship of a media program within media distribution service is confined within media distribution service . Accordingly a sponsor sponsoring a media program within media distribution service has conventionally expected the sponsorship to be limited to media distribution service . For example a sponsor may pay for distribution of an advertisement in a commercial break of a television program that is distributed by media distribution service in accordance with a linear television programming schedule. Media distribution service then distributes the advertisement for presentation within the commercial break of the television program.

An end user of media distribution service may want to share a clip of a media program distributed by media distribution service . For example end user may want to share a clip of a media program to social network . Media distribution service and or system may provide one or more clip sharing tools for use by end user to initiate sharing of a clip of a media program to social network . In certain examples the clip sharing tools may include any tools configured to facilitate definition of the clip of the media program by end user . Accordingly end user may utilize such tools to define a clip of a media program that end user wants to share to social network .

As used herein the term clip of a media program may refer to any portion of the media program literally or figuratively clipped from the media program. For example a clip of a media program such as a television program may include a defined segment or combination of segments of the television program.

Additionally or alternatively the clip sharing tools may be configured for use by end user to define a request to share a clip of a media program to social network . Accordingly end user may utilize such tools to define a request to share a clip of a media program to social network . The request may include any information that may be used by system to process the request as described herein. In certain examples for instance the request may include data representative of the clip data representative of the media program data representative of one or more sponsors of the media program data representative of social network data representative of a social media service or any combination or sub combination of such data.

System may receive data representative of a request to share a clip of a media program to social network which request may be defined by end user as described above. System may receive the request in any suitable way such as by receiving one or more communications indicative of the request from media distribution service or by detecting one or more operations performed by clip sharing facility in relation to the definition of the request by end user .

System may be configured to perform one or more operations in response to receiving the request to share the clip of the media program to social network . For example clip sharing facility may be configured to perform in response to the share request one or more clip sharing operations to share the clip of the media program to social network .

The clip sharing operations may include clip sharing facility identifying the clip based on the share request. For example clip sharing facility may use data e.g. actual media clip program data and or media program index data included in the request to identify the clip of the media program that is to be shared.

The clip sharing operations may include clip sharing facility sharing the clip to social network . The sharing may be performed in any suitable way. As an example clip sharing facility may transmit data carrying the actual clip to computing devices associated with social network . As another example clip sharing facility may transmit data indicative of the clip to computing devices associated with social network for use by the computing devices to access the actual clip e.g. from media distribution service . For instance clip sharing facility may transmit hyperlink data for use by the computing devices to link to and access the clip from media distribution service .

The above described examples of sharing the clip to social network are illustrative only. Clip sharing facility may share the clip to social network in any other way configured to facilitate members of social network accessing and consuming the clip.

In conjunction with the sharing of the clip to social network sponsor carryover facility may be configured to perform in response to the share request one or more sponsor carryover operations to carryover a sponsor of the media program from media distribution service to social network . As used herein a carryover of a sponsor of a media program from media distribution service to social network may include sponsor carryover facility identifying a sponsor of the media program and sharing data representative of the identified sponsor of the media program to social network in response to a request to share a clip of the media program to social network . Examples of how the sponsor may be carried over from media distribution service to social network will now be described.

As mentioned sponsor carryover facility may be configured to identify a sponsor of a media program in media distribution service in response to a request to share a clip of the media program to social network . In certain examples the identifying of the sponsor may include sponsor carryover facility identifying a commercial break in the media program and a sponsor of advertising content associated with the commercial break.

To illustrate shows a media stream that carries a media program. Media stream includes media program content segments e.g. segments through that contain various segments of the media program. Media stream further includes commercial breaks e.g. commercial breaks through . Each commercial break may include or may be otherwise associated with advertising content sponsored by one or more sponsors. Segments and commercial breaks are arranged in line with one another along a time axis such that during a linear playback of the media program segment is configured to be played back first followed sequentially by advertising content included in commercial break and so on along media stream .

Sponsor carryover facility may be configured to identify a commercial break included in media stream in any suitable way. As an example sponsor carryover facility may be configured to analyze media stream such as by analyzing analog and or digital signaling associated with media stream and or content of such signaling to identify a commercial break. For instance sponsor carryover facility may analyze packet headers and or commercial break cues e.g. cue tones included in media stream . As another example sponsor carryover facility may be configured to access a data structure e.g. a database a data table etc. and identify a commercial break included in media stream based on data included in the data structure. Such a data structure may be maintained by system and or as part of media distribution service .

In certain examples the identifying of a commercial break in media stream may include sponsor carryover facility selecting the commercial break based on a temporal proximity within the media program and or media stream of the commercial break to the clip of the media program. For example sponsor carryover facility may be configured to select the commercial break in media stream that is nearest by temporal proximity to the clip . In for instance of the commercial breaks in media stream commercial break is nearest by temporal proximity to the clip . A temporal proximity between the clip and the commercial break is illustrated in .

By selecting a commercial break that is nearest by temporal proximity to the clip sponsor carryover facility factors the temporal position of the clip within the media program and or media stream into the identifying of a sponsor of the media program to carry over to social network in conjunction with the shared clip . In certain examples sponsor carryover facility may be configured to search only forward in time only backward in time or both forward and backward in time along time axis to identify a commercial break that is nearest by temporal proximity to the clip . In any other suitable way the temporal position and or one or more other attributes of the clip may be factored into the identifying of a sponsor to carry over to social network with the shared clip .

In certain examples sponsor carryover facility may be configured to identify one or more sponsors associated with the identified commercial break such as sponsors of advertising content associated with the commercial break . The sponsors may be identified in any suitable way including by analysis of the advertisement content included in the commercial break analysis of media stream e.g. analysis of closed captioning information and or any other information included in media stream and or analysis of data included in a data structure that specifies sponsor information for the media program and or the commercial break .

In certain examples sponsor carryover facility may identify multiple sponsors associated with the media program and or the identified commercial break and select from the multiple sponsors a particular sponsor to carry over to social network with the clip . Sponsor carryover facility may be configured to select a particular sponsor to carry over to social network based on a predefined sponsor selection heuristic which may specify one or more conditions to be used to select a sponsor to carryover to social network with clip . Examples of such conditions may include conditions related to temporal proximity of a sponsorship to the clip in the media program attributes of sponsors and or sponsorships content of sponsored advertisements terms of agreements between a provider of system and sponsors terms of agreements between a provider of media distribution service and sponsors and or any other conditions that may be used by sponsor carryover facility to select a particular sponsor of a media program to carry over to social network with the shared clip .

In certain examples sponsor carryover facility may be configured to select in turn a different one of multiple sponsors of a media program. For example sponsor carryover facility may be configured to use randomized selection logic e.g. randomized selection logic that takes into account a time that a share request is received to select a sponsor. As another example sponsor carryover facility may be configured to rotate through the sponsors of the media program such as with a round robin selection process.

While certain examples described herein relate to identifying a sponsor associated with a commercial break in a media program these examples are illustrative only. Sponsor carryover facility may be configured to identify any sponsor of a media program in any suitable way and based on any suitable criteria. For example sponsors may sponsor the media program in ways other than sponsoring placement of advertising content in commercial breaks . For instance a sponsor may sponsor a presentation of a banner advertisement as an overlay presented during presentation of a segment of the media program in media distribution service . Another sponsor may sponsor a product placement within a scene of the media program. These and or other sponsors of the media program may each or all be considered for carryover to social network with a shared clip of the media program.

As mentioned in certain examples sponsor carryover facility may identify a sponsor of a media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network with a shared clip of the media program by analyzing media stream that carries the media program in media distribution service and determine based on the analysis the sponsor of the media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network . Additionally or alternatively sponsor carryover facility may identify a sponsor of a media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network with a shared clip of the media program by accessing a data structure and determining based on data included in the data structure the sponsor of the media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network .

The data structure may include data representative of information about the media program including data indicating one or more sponsors of the media program. In certain examples the data structure may indicate a sponsor as a pre designated carryover sponsor for the media program such as a pre designated carryover sponsor for a particular social media service.

The data structure may include any suitable type of data structure such as a data table a database etc. The data structure may be generated and or maintained in any suitable way by system as part of media distribution service and or by a provider of system or media distribution service .

Within a section of information about commercial break sponsors sponsor identifiers IDs for six sponsors are depicted along with time index information for each sponsor. The time index information may indicate playback times within a playback of the media program that advertisements sponsored by the commercial break sponsors are scheduled to be played back. Advertisements sponsored by the first three commercial break sponsors are scheduled for playback within a first commercial break and advertisements sponsored by the next three commercial break sponsors are scheduled for playback within a second commercial break .

Within a section of information about other sponsors sponsor IDs for two other sponsors are depicted along with time index information for each sponsor. The time index information may indicate playback times associated with sponsored content e.g. presentation of a banner advertisement a product placement in a scene of the media program etc. .

Sponsor carryover facility may be configured to access either or both data table and data table and determine based on data included in either or both data table and data table a sponsor to be carried over to social network with a shared clip of a media program such as described herein.

Sponsor carryover facility may be configured to identify a sponsor of a media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network with a shared clip of the media program in any of the exemplary ways described herein. However the examples described herein are illustrative only. Sponsor carryover facility may identify a sponsor of a media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network with a shared clip of the media program in any suitable way. The identifying of the sponsor may include sponsor carryover facility using data generated and or maintained by system and or communicating with media distribution service to access data generated and or maintained by media distribution service . Such data may include a media stream a data structure and or any other data that may be used by sponsor carryover facility to identify a sponsor of a media program in media distribution service to be carried over to social network with a shared clip of the media program.

As mentioned sponsor carryover operations may include sponsor carryover facility sharing data representative of an identified sponsor of the media program in media distribution service to social network in response to a request to share a clip of the media program to social network .

The sharing may be performed in any suitable way. For example sponsor carryover facility may transmit data representative of the sponsor to computing devices associated with social network . The data representative of the sponsor may be transmitted to computing devices associated with social network together with or separate from data representative of the clip transmitted to computing devices associated with social network by clip sharing facility .

The data representative of the sponsor may include any data configured for use by computing devices associated with social network to present information about the sponsor to social network . For example the data representative of the sponsor may include data representative of a sponsor image e.g. a logo advertisement text and or any other information configured to be presented to convey to social network that the shared clip of the media program and or the media program is sponsored by the sponsor.

In certain examples system may be configured to share a clip of a media program and data representative of a sponsor of the media program to social network by sharing the clip of the media program and the data representative of the sponsor of the media program to a social media service configured to distribute social media to social network . To illustrate shows an exemplary configuration in which system is in communication with media distribution service and a social media service . System may be in communication with media distribution service and social media service by way of any suitable communication technologies including any of those mentioned herein.

Social media service may include any service configured to facilitate distribution of social media to one or more end users of social media service . Social media service may be associated with e.g. operated by a provider of social media service a social media service provider . Through social media service an end user of social media service such as a member of social network may post and or access social media content.

Social media service may include and or be provided by an appropriately configured social media service system which may include any system of computing devices and or other equipment configured to receive and distribute social media to end users of social media service . Social media service may include any type of social media service configured to distribute any format of social media by way of any suitable social media distribution medium. In certain examples for instance social media service may include a service provided by a social networking site e.g. a social networking website a weblog a social media blog a social media micro blog an Internet forum a wiki a social broadcasting service and or any other type of social media service. Examples of social media services include without limitation social media services provided by FACEBOOK TWITTER FOURSQUARE PINTEREST and YOUTUBE.

Social media service may receive a shared clip of a media program and data representative of a sponsor of the media program from system . The shared clip of the media program and the data representative of the sponsor of the media program may be configured to be distributed by social media service to social network . Social media service may perform one or more operations to distribute the shared clip and the data representative of the sponsor of the media program to social network in any manner configured to convey to social network that the shared clip of the media program and or the media program is sponsored by the sponsor of the media program.
