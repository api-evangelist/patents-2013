The preferred system herein described is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. They are chosen and described to explain the principles of the invention and the application of the method to practical uses so that others skilled in the art may practice the invention.

The present invention includes a system using an algorithm for converting LANDSAT TM multispectral signals into images showing different values of Coliform including bacteria colonies per milliliter of water. This system and method were tested in Lake Erie and its wider tributaries detect coliform bacteria in the waters of Lake Erie to analyze the changes in water populations as they affect human activities. By gathering water samples during the period of time the satellite passes over Lake Erie and applying test kits the level of coliform populations was determined. The preferred algorithm combines 2 ratios of three of the six spectral bands within silicon detector range one to determine chlorophyll and the other turbidity .

The method of the present invention may be carried out using any sensing appropriate light sensing devices adapted to capture the algorithm relevant frequencies as described herein including satellite and surface sensors such as a wireless multispectral coliform detector or WIMCOD for detection of coliform and bacteria.

An algorithm that may be used in the present invention which may be carried out by computer instructions for producing a particular type of image that can be used to map a particular substance from a remote sensing platform in space in an aircraft or on the ground may be determined as follows.

LANDSAT Thematic Mapper TM is a sensor that has 8 spectral bands 6 of which have a 30 meter spatial resolution and which detect visible and infrared radiation sunlight reflected off the Earth s surface. The following bands were employed with the wavelength limits in micrometers or m of their spectral band widths given below for the LANDSAT 7 version of TM called ETM and the LANDSAT 4 and 5 versions called TM 

For instance band 2 of the LANDSAT 7 version of the TM sensor called ETM has wavelength limits of 0.53 0.61 m band 3 has limits of 0.63 0.69 m and band 4 has limits of 0.78 0.90 m. When mapping phycocyanin pigment coliform bacteria and bacteria in Lake Erie and its tributaries with LANDSAT 7 data it had to be determined which or how many of bands 1 5 and 7 which have 30 m spatial resolution and relatively narrow spectral bands as opposed to the 60 m spatial resolution of band 6 and the relatively wide band width of the 15 m resolution band 8 to use. A mathematical procedure multiple regressions was applied to seek the best combinations of those bands to correlate with each one of these targets phycocyanin coliform and separately. It was determined that the use of the single band radiances even if they were reduced to spectral reflectances from theoretical atmospheric models as inputs to this procedure the resulting algorithm would not be very robust i.e. repeatable under different solar illumination and atmospheric conditions . Therefore spectral ratios ratios of spectral bands after empirical correction for atmospheric haze through a process referred to as dark object subtraction were input to the mathematical procedure for each pixel from which a water sample had been collected. These 15 non reciprocal ratios R21 R31 R32 R41 . . . R75 became the dependent variables and phycocyanin or coliform or became the independent variable which was the result of lab analysis of the water samples. For the LANDSAT 7 overpass 30 water samples were collected which were measured for both phycocyanin and coliform content. The best subsets of spectral ratios were determined and then the ones with the highest R Adjusted values were tested to see if they passed the Durbin Watson test. The model with the highest R Adjusted that also passed the Durbin Watson test was the model that was considered to be the best.

Visual inspection of the water samples particularly one collected during a microcystis bloom on Aug. 19 2003 and with the aid of a microscope revealed bacteria range from 0.5 1.0 micrometers in size and I don t know if we are observing them directly or whether we are seeing what they feed on such as fecal matter in the water.

The wavelengths of light in bands 2 3 and 4 are about the size of bacteria so it is at least possible that it is the bacteria themselves that are being detected by the coliform and algorithms but it will take some lab experimentation to prove what is being mapped by the algorithms. However the models clearly show that the predicted and actual values of coliform content in one case and content in the other case are pretty well correlated.

Unlike the preferred phycocyanin and algorithms the preferred coliform algorithm only uses spectral ratios of TM bands 2 3 and 4 which are in the wavelength range of silicon detectors. Therefore very inexpensive sensors are available such as the ones used for video cameras. The algorithms for and phycocyanin however require use of TM bands 5 and or 7 and they can be done with more expensive sensors on or near the Earth s surface.

Having shown and described a preferred embodiment of the invention those skilled in the art will realize that many variations and modifications may be made to affect the described invention and still be within the scope of the claimed invention. Thus many of the elements indicated above may be altered or replaced by different elements which will provide the same result and fall within the spirit of the claimed invention. It is the intention therefore to limit the invention only as indicated by the scope of the claims.
