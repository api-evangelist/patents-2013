title: Intra-platform networking
abstract: Technologies for communicating with local components of a computing device include intercepting a name resolution request from a host application, resolving a hostname included in the name resolution request to obtain a network address assigned to a target destination of the network packet, and transmitting the network address to the host application in response to the name resolution request. Such technologies may also include receiving the network packet from the host application destined for the network address, determining, whether the target destination of the network packet includes a local component of the computing device based on the network address, and transmitting the network packet to the local component of the computing device via a platform network in response to the network packet being destined for the local component of the computing device.

A computing device generally includes an operating system which manages the various hardware and software resources of the computing device. Operating systems typically utilize one or more device drivers to control a particular hardware device of the computing device. Device drivers are software programs that act as an interface between the operating system of the computing device. Most operating systems natively expose hardware devices providing baseline capabilities of the computing device e.g. Universal Serial Bus wireless networking system memory access etc. to applications executed by the operating system via one or more application programming interfaces APIs or defined interfaces which may communicate with one or more device drivers. However to expose hardware devices providing new and or additional capabilities to the computing device many operating systems require that the hardware vendor provide a proprietary device driver which must be registered with the operating system during boot.

An increasing trend among operating system providers is to limit the number and or type of non native operating system capabilities allowed to be registered. For example an operating system vendor may only permit a platform vendor e.g. an original equipment manufacturer to choose and register a fixed number of device drivers with the operating system. One reason for doing this is to commoditize the functionality of the computing device hardware. Security concerns may be another reason for limiting the number of non native operating systems capabilities allowed to be registered. Whatever the reason may be this practice threatens the ability of hardware vendors to continue developing new hardware devices and or functionality. Additionally such practice empowers operating system vendors and or original equipment manufacturers to unilaterally decide which hardware devices and or functionalities are available on a platform without input from hardware vendors.

While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described herein in detail. It should be understood however that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives consistent with the present disclosure and the appended claims.

References in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment an illustrative embodiment etc. indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature structure or characteristic but every embodiment may or may not necessarily include that particular feature structure or characteristic. Moreover such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further when a particular feature structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.

The disclosed embodiments may be implemented in some cases in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof. The disclosed embodiments may also be implemented as instructions carried by or stored on a transitory or non transitory machine readable e.g. computer readable storage medium which may be read and executed by one or more processors. A machine readable storage medium may be embodied as any storage device mechanism or other physical structure for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a volatile or non volatile memory a media disc or other media device .

In the drawings some structural or method features may be shown in specific arrangements and or orderings. However it should be appreciated that such specific arrangements and or orderings may not be required. Rather in some embodiments such features may be arranged in a different manner and or order than shown in the illustrative figures. Additionally the inclusion of a structural or method feature in a particular figure is not meant to imply that such feature is required in all embodiments and in some embodiments may not be included or may be combined with other features.

Referring now to in an illustrative embodiment a system for intra platform communications includes a computing device and in some embodiments an external network and an external computing device . The computing device includes one or more local components e.g. the platform components and a platform router . The one or more local components may be embodied as one or more hardware components software components and or a combination of hardware and software components of the computing device . Additionally the one or more local components may be communicatively coupled to the platform router via one or more existing logical and or physical communication links e.g. point to point links bus links wires cables light guides printed circuit board traces etc. to form a platform network . The platform router may be embodied as one or more hardware components software components and or a combination of hardware and software components of the computing device . For example in some embodiments the platform router is embodied as a logical entity of the computing device . In such embodiments the functionality of the platform router may be provided by a single local component of the computing device e.g. the platform component E or it may be provided by more than one of the local components of the computing device e.g. the platform component A and the platform component E . Thus the functionality of the platform router and therefore the platform router itself may be implemented in either a centralized or a decentralized manner.

In use the platform router of the computing device is configured to receive a network packet from a host operating system and or an application executing on the computing device . The platform router may determine whether the network packet is destined for one of the local components or an external computing device e.g. a device in communication with the computing device via the external network and in response may forward or otherwise send the network packet to the appropriate component and or device. To do so the platform router may first intercept or otherwise receive a name resolution request from the host operating system and or an application being executed by the host operating system . The name resolution request includes the hostname of a target destination which in some embodiments may be a hostname that has been assigned to one of the local components e.g. the platform component A . In response to intercepting the name resolution request the platform router may resolve or otherwise lookup the network address corresponding to the target destination e.g. the platform component A based at least in part on or otherwise as a function of the hostname. The corresponding network address may thereafter be sent to the host operating system and or the application being executed by the host operating system in response. Subsequently the platform router may receive or otherwise intercept a network packet destined for the target destination e.g. the platform component A . The network packet received from the host operating system and or the application being executed by the host operating system may include the network address for the target destination e.g. the platform component A as a destination address. Based on the destination address the platform router may determine that the network packet is destined for one of the local components e.g. the platform component A or a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . Upon making such determination the platform router may forward or otherwise send the network packet to the appropriate component and or device via the platform network which as discussed may include one or more logical and or physical communication links e.g. point to point links bus links wires cables light guides printed circuit board traces etc. between the local components of the computing device and the platform router .

In some embodiments each of the one or more local components may include network protocol functionality and as a result may support receiving messages formatted as network packets. However in other embodiments one or more of the local components may not include network protocol functionality and therefore may not support receiving messages formatted as network packets e.g. legacy components or other components lacking network protocol functionality . As such in some embodiments the platform router may further be configured to determine whether the target destination of a received network packet e.g. the platform component A supports network protocol functionality. If the target destination of the received network packet e.g. the platform component A lacks network protocol functionality the platform router may first translate the received network packet into a format that is supported by the target destination e.g. the platform component A . The transmitted network packet may then be transmitted to the target destination e.g. the platform component A in the supported format. If however the target destination of the received network packet e.g. the platform component A supports network protocol functionality the platform router may send or otherwise forward the network packet to the target destination e.g. the platform component A without translation.

As discussed the platform router may intercept a name resolution request sent by the host operating system and resolve a hostname included therein to determine a corresponding network address which may be assigned to one of the local components e.g. the platform component A and or a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . The platform router may subsequently receive a network packet from the host operating system and or an application being executed by the host operating system . In response to receiving the network packet the platform router may determine whether the destination network address included therein corresponds to one of the network addresses assigned to one or more of the local components e.g. the platform component A . In response to making such a determination the platform router may send the received network packet to the corresponding local component e.g. the platform component A via the platform network using one or more network protocols e.g. Internet Protocol etc. which may be substantially similar to those required to communicate over the external network . In that way an additional and or alternate communication channel e.g. the platform network may be provided to facilitate communications between the host operating system or an application executed by the host operating system and the one or more local components e.g. the platform component A in instances wherein the provider of the host operating system prevents the one or more local components from being exposed to the host operating system or an application executed by the host operating system . Of course it should be appreciated that the additional and or alternate communication channel e.g. the platform network may be provided to facilitate communications between the host operating system or an application executed by the host operating system and the one or more local components e.g. the platform component A in instances wherein the provider of the host operating system permits one or more of the local components from to exposed to the host operating system or an application executed by the host operating system . For example in some embodiments the platform network may be provided to supplement conventional communications between the host operating system or an application executed by the host operating system and the one or more local components e.g. the platform component A .

Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments the platform router may also be configured to receive a name resolution request and a network packet from one or more of the local components e.g. the platform component B which as discussed may be embodied as one or more hardware components software components and or a combination of hardware and software components of the computing device . In such embodiments the platform router may determine whether the network packet is destined for another one of the local components e.g. the platform component A or a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . In response to determining that the network packet is destined for another one of the local components e.g. the platform component A the platform router may send the received network packet to the corresponding local component e.g. the platform component A via the platform network using one or more network protocols e.g. Internet Protocol etc. . To do so the platform router may be configured to perform a process similar to the one discussed in more detail below.

The computing device may be embodied as any type of computing device capable of performing the functions described herein including but not limited to a desktop computer a set top box a smart display device a server a mobile phone a smart phone a tablet computing device a personal digital assistant a consumer electronic device a laptop computer a smart display device a smart television and or any other computing device.

Of course the computing device may include other or additional components such as those commonly found in a computer and or server e.g. various input output devices in other embodiments. In some embodiments one or more of the illustrative components may be incorporated in or otherwise from a portion of another component. For example the memory or portions thereof may be incorporated in the processor in some embodiments.

Additionally as discussed above the computing device includes one or more local components e.g. the platform components which may be embodied as one or more hardware components software components and or a combination of hardware and software components of the computing device . As such each of the local components may embody a different one of the processor the memory the I O subsystem the data storage and the communication circuitry of the computing device . For example in some embodiments the platform component A may embody the processor the platform component B may embody the I O subsystem the platform component C may embody the memory the platform component D may embody the data storage and the platform component E may embody the communication circuitry . Of course it should be understood that the one or more local components may embody additional or different hardware and or software components of the computing device such as a graphics card. RAID controller and or other computing device components.

The processor may be embodied as any type of processor capable of performing the functions described herein. For example the processor may be embodied as a single or multi core processor s digital signal processor microcontroller or other processor or processing controlling circuit. Similarly the memory may be embodied as any type of volatile or non volatile memory or data storage capable of performing the functions described herein. In operation the memory may store various data and software used during operation of the computing device such as operating systems applications programs libraries and drivers. The memory is communicatively coupled to the processor via the I O subsystem which may be embodied as circuitry and or components to facilitate input output operations with the processor the memory and other components of the computing device . For example the I O subsystem may be embodied as or otherwise include memory controller hubs input output control hubs firmware devices communication links i.e. point to point links bus links wires cables light guides printed circuit board traces etc. and or other components and subsystems to facilitate the input output operations. In some embodiments the I O subsystem may form a portion of a system on a chip SoC and be incorporated along with the processor the memory and other components of the computing device on a single integrated circuit chip.

The communication circuitry of the computing device may be embodied as any type of communication circuit device interface or collection thereof capable of enabling communications between the computing device the external computing device and or other computing devices. For example the communication circuitry may be embodied as one or more network interface controllers NICs in some embodiments. The communication circuitry may be configured to use any one or more communication technologies e.g. wireless or wired communications and associated protocols e.g. Ethernet Wi Fi WiMAX etc. to effect such communication.

In some embodiments the computing device and the external computing device may communicate with each other over the external network . The external network see may be embodied as any number of various wired and or wireless communication networks. For example the external network may be embodied as or otherwise include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a cellular network or a publicly accessible global network such as the Internet. Additionally the external network may include any number of additional devices to facilitate communication between the computing device the external computing device and or the other computing devices.

The external computing device may be embodied as any type of computing device capable of performing the functions described herein. As such the external computing device may include devices and structures commonly found in computing devices such as processors memory devices communication circuitry and data storages which are not shown in for clarity of the description. In some embodiments the external computing device is configured to send and receive network packets to and from the computing device over the external network . As discussed in more detail below the network packets sent to and received from the computing device may be embodied as network packets formatted according to one or more network communication protocols e.g. Internet Protocol etc. .

Referring back to the data storage may be embodied as any type of device or devices configured for short term or long term storage of data such as for example memory devices and circuits memory cards hard disk drives solid state drives or other data storage devices. In some embodiments the data storage may include one or more network address records. As described in more detail below each of the network address records may correspond to a different one of the one or more local components and may include among other things information indicative of the hostname and network address assigned the corresponding local component . In this way the data storage may include a mapping of the hostnames and the network addresses assigned to each of the one of more local components of the computing device . Of course it should be appreciated that the data storage may also include information indicative of the hostname and network address assigned a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device in some embodiments. The data storage may also include any other type of information required for operation of the computing device . For example in some embodiments the data storage may also include a list of network addresses currently assigned to the one or more local components of the computing device . As discussed in more detail below the list of assigned network addresses may be used by the computing device to facilitate determining whether a network packet is destined for one of the local components or a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . Additionally or alternatively the data storage may include information indicative of whether each of the one or more local components includes network protocol functionality.

Additionally in some embodiments the computing device may further include one or more peripheral devices . Such peripheral devices may include any type of peripheral device commonly found in a computing device such as additional data storage speakers a hardware keyboard input output devices peripheral communication devices and or other peripheral devices.

As discussed in more detail below in some embodiments a host operating system and or an application executing on the host operating system may communicate with each of the local components e.g. the processor the memory the I O subsystem the data storage and the communication circuitry via the platform network using a network protocol e.g. Internet Protocol . In such embodiments the host operating system the platform router and each of the local components may include network protocol functionality. For example the host operating system the platform router and each of the local components may be configured with a network protocol stack e.g. Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP to facilitate communications via the platform network . In some embodiments however one or more of the local components may be a legacy component or otherwise not include network protocol functionality. That is one or more of the local components may not be configured with a network protocol stack and as a result may not support communicating with the host operating system via the platform network using a network protocol e.g. Internet Protocol . As discussed in more detail below the platform router may translate network communications e.g. network packets received from the host operating system into a format supported by those local components that do not include network protocol functionality. Of course it should be appreciated that the platform router may also translate communication messages received from one or more of the local components that do not include network protocol functionality into one or more network packets which may subsequently be sent by the platform router to the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system via the platform network .

Referring now to in use the platform router of the computing device establishes an environment during operation. The illustrative environment includes a communication module a filtering module a name resolution module and address assignment module a firewall module and interface translation module and an address translation module . Each of the modules of the environment may be embodied as hardware software firmware or a combination thereof. Of course it should be appreciated that the platform router may include other components sub components modules and devices commonly found in a computing device which are not illustrated in for clarity of the description. Additionally although the illustrative environment is described below as facilitating communications between the host operating system or an application being executing by the host operating system and one or more of the local components it should be appreciated that the environment may additionally or alternatively facilitate communications between one of the local components e.g. the platform component B and another one of the local components e.g. the platform component A in other embodiments.

The communication module of the platform router facilitates communications between components or sub components of the computing device and the external computing device and or the other computing devices. For example in some embodiments the communication module facilitates communications between the host operating system and one or more of the local components via the platform network . In such embodiments the communications between the host operating system and the one or more local components via the platform network may be embodied as one or more network packets e.g. Internet Protocol packets and or communication messages in a format supported by the one or more local components e.g. messages formatted according to the Peripheral Component interconnect PCI standard messages formatted according to the Universal Serial Bus USB standard etc. . In some embodiments the communication module also facilities communications over the external network between the computing device the host operating system and or one or more applications executing on the host operating system and the external computing device . In such embodiments the communications between the computing device the host operating system and or one or more applications executing on the host operating system and the external computing device may be embodied as one or more network packets e.g. Internet Protocol packets .

The filtering module may be configured to intercept network communications generated by the host operating system and or one or more applications being executed by the host operating system . For example in some embodiments the filtering module may intercept a name resolution request generated by the host operating system and or the one or more applications being executed by the host operating system . The name resolution request includes the hostname of a target destination which as discussed may correspond one of the local components of the computing device or the external computing device . In some embodiments the name resolution request is embodied as a Domain Name System DNS request. Of course it should be appreciated that although the illustrative name resolution request is embodied as a DNS request the name resolution request may be embodied as other any other type of name resolution request e.g. a request to query a locally stored hosts file etc. .

The filtering module may be further configured to intercept or otherwise receive a network packet generated by the host operating system and or one or more applications being executed by the host operating system . In some embodiments the network packet received from the host operating system and or the application includes the network address assigned to the target destination as the destination address. The network address assigned to the target destination may be embodied as an Internet Protocol IP address e.g. and IPv4 or an IPv6 or it may be embodied as any other type of network address suitable for communicating via the platform network and or the external network . Additionally or alternatively the filtering module may also be configured to intercept or otherwise receive an address request from one or more of the local components to be assigned a network address for communications via the platform network .

In embodiments wherein the intercepted network packet includes the network address assigned to the target destination as destination address the filtering module may further be configured to determine whether the network packet is destined for one of the local components of the computing device or whether it is destined for an external device e.g. the external computing device . To do so the filtering module may determine whether the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components . In some embodiments the filtering module may compare the destination address against a list including the network addresses currently assigned to one or more of the local components of the computing device . In such embodiments the filtering module may determine that the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components in response to matching the destination address with one of the network addresses included in the list. If however the filtering module is unable to match the destination address with one of the network addresses included in the list the filtering module may instead determine that the destination address corresponds to a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device .

The filtering module may also be configured to transmit or otherwise forward the received network packet to the appropriate target destination device e.g. one of more of the local components or the external computing device . For example in embodiments wherein it is determined that the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components the filtering module may transmit or otherwise forward the network packet to the corresponding one of the local components via the platform network which as discussed may include one or more existing logical and or physical communication links e.g. point to point links bus links wires cables light guides printed circuit board traces etc. of the computing device e.g. as illustratively shown by data flow of . However in embodiments wherein it is determined that the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to an external computing device e.g. the external computing device the filtering module may instead forward or otherwise facilitate the transmission of the network packet to the external computing device over the external network e.g. as illustratively shown by data flow of . To do so the filtering module may send the externally bound network packet to one or more components of the computing device for further processing. For example in some embodiments the filtering module may send the network packet to a network protocol stack of the communication circuitry e.g. as illustratively shown by data flow of which may subsequently forward the message to the external computing device via the external network .

Additionally in some embodiments the filtering module may determine the particular local component and corresponding network protocol stack to which the externally bound network packet should be sent based at least in part on an earlier determination made by the host operating system . For example in embodiments wherein the communication circuitry includes one or more network interface controllers NICs e.g. two or more NICs the host operating system may first determine which of the two or more NICs should handle e.g. further process the network packet upon initial receipt. Thereafter in response to later determining the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to an external computing device e.g. the external computing device the filtering module may send the externally bound network packet to the network protocol stack corresponding to the network interface controller NIC originally chosen by the host operating system to handle e.g. further process the packet. Of course it should be appreciated that in other embodiments the filtering module may instead send the externally bound network packet to a network protocol stack corresponding to another NIC e.g. a different NIC than the one originally chosen by the host operating system .

As discussed in some embodiments the filtering module is configured to receive or otherwise intercept a name resolution request generated by the host operating system and or the one or more applications being executed by the host operating system . The name resolution request e.g. the DNS request includes the hostname of a target destination which as discussed may correspond one of the local components of the computing device or the external computing device . In such embodiments the name resolution module is configured to translate the included hostname into the network address assigned to the target destination. To do so the name resolution module may resolve or otherwise lookup the hostname to obtain the corresponding network address assigned to the target destination e.g. one of the local components or the external computing device . In some embodiments the name resolution module may compare the hostname included in the received name resolution request with the hostnames included in each of the network address records stored in the data storage . In such embodiments the name resolution module may retrieve the corresponding network address from the network address record including a hostname that matches the hostname included in the name resolution request. In response to resolving the hostname included in the name resolution request the name resolution module may send a response to the host operating system and or the one or more applications being executed by the host operating system that includes the corresponding network address.

Additionally in some embodiments the name resolution module may be configured to only resolve or otherwise lookup hostnames that correspond to one or more of the local components of the computing device . For example in some embodiments the hostname included in the name resolution request may include a pseudo top level domain e.g. .local etc. appended thereto. Thus the hostname included in the name resolution request may be embodied as a fully qualified domain name FQDN e.g. hostname.local componentA.local etc. . In such embodiments the name resolution module may be configured to determine whether the hostname corresponds to one of the local components of the computing device based at least in part on the hostname e.g. the FQDN . In embodiments wherein the hostname e.g. the FQDN included in the name resolution request does not correspond to one of the local components of the computing device the name resolution module may instead determine that the hostname e.g. the FQDN corresponds to a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . As a result the name resolution module may be configured to forward or other facilitate the transmission of e.g. via the communication module and or the communication circuitry the name resolution request to an external name resolution server not shown for further processing.

As discussed in some embodiments the filtering module is configured to receive or otherwise intercept an address request from one or more of the local components to be assigned a network address for communications via the platform network . In response to an address assignment request being received from one of the local components the address assignment module may be configured to assign a network address e.g. an IPv4 network address an IPv6 network address etc. to the local component requesting assignment. In some embodiments the address assignment module may be configured to assign network addresses to one or more of the local components according to any suitable network address assignment protocol or procedure e.g. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP Bootstrap Protocol BOOTP etc. . Additionally the address assignment module may assign either a public network address e.g. accessible by devices and components external to the computing device or a private network address e.g. only accessible by local devices and components of the computing device capable of communicating via the platform network to one or more of the local components requesting assignment of a network address.

The firewall module may be configured to protect the one or more local components from being accessed by an unauthorized source. For example in some embodiments the firewall module may monitor network packets received from the host operating system one or more applications executing on the host operating system and or one or more devices external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . The firewall module may determine whether any of the received network packets are destined for one of the local components of the computing device . In response to determining that one or more of the received network packets are destined for one of the local components the firewall module may determine whether the source of the network packet e.g. the host operating system one or more applications executing on the host operating system and or the devices external to the computing device are authorized to communicate with the local component of the computing device . To do so the firewall module may determine whether the source of the network packet is permitted to communicate with the local component based at least in part on or otherwise as a function of one or more rules or policies regarding the security of the one or more local components . For example in one embodiment the firewall module may determine from a rule and or a policy that a particular source of an incoming network packet is only permitted to communicate with a particular local component e.g. the platform component A of the computing device in response to determining that the source is either the host operating system or another one of the local components e.g. the platform components B E of the computing device . As another example the firewall module may deny access based on a rule and or a policy to the one or more local components in response to determining that the source of an incoming network packet is a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device or a particular component of the computing device e.g. the communication circuitry . Of course it should be appreciated that the firewall module may use any number of different policies or rules to either permit or deny communication access to one or more of the local components . Additionally it should be appreciated that although the firewall module prevents other components and or devices from communicating with the local components in the illustrative embodiment the firewall module may also permit and or deny communications originating from the local components themselves in other embodiments. It that way the firewall module may be embodied as a bidirectional firewall.

In some embodiments the interface translation module may be configured to translate communications between one or more of the local components and the host operating system and or an application executing on the host operating system . As discussed one or more of the local components may be a legacy component or otherwise not include network protocol functionality e.g. not include a corresponding network protocol stack . For example in some embodiments one or more of the local components may only support communications transmitted in accordance with a local bus communication standard or protocol e.g. the Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI standard the Universal Serial Bus USB standard etc. . In such embodiments the interface translation module may be configured to translate a network packet received from the host operating system and or an application executing on the host operating system into a format supported or otherwise understood by the targeted local component e.g. the platform component A . For example the interface translation module may remove the header information e.g. TCP header IP header Network Interface header Media Access Control address etc. from the network packet to extract the data encapsulated therein which may be in a format supported by the targeted local component e.g. the platform component A . Of course it should be appreciated that the interface translation module may also translate data in a format supported by a source local component e.g. the platform component B into a network packet which may be transmitted or otherwise forwarded to the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system . For example the interface translation module may encapsulate or otherwise repackage the data from the source local component e.g. the platform component B into a network packet including the necessary network packet header information e.g. TCP header IP header Network Interface header Media Access Control address etc. .

As discussed in some embodiments the address assignment module may assign a private network address e.g. only accessible by local devices and components of the computing device capable of communicating via the platform network to one or more of the local components . In such embodiments the address translation module may be configured to translate between one or more private network addresses assigned to one or more of the local components and a public network address which may be assigned to the platform router . To do so in some embodiments the address translation module may receive a network packet destined for one of the local components . The received network packet may include the public network address of the platform router as a destination address and a port number which may correspond to the local component destination e.g. the platform component A . In such embodiments the address translation module may replace e.g. translate the destination address of the received network packet e.g. the public network address of the platform router with the private network address assigned to the local component destination e.g. the platform component A based on the port number corresponding to the local component destination e.g. the platform component A . Thereafter the address translation module may forward or otherwise transmit the received network packet to the appropriate local component destination e.g. the platform component A . Of course it should be appreciated that the address translation module may be configured to operate bidirectionally. That is in some embodiments the address translation module may be configured to receive an outgoing network from a local component e.g. the platform component A configured with a private network address. In such embodiments the address translation module may replace the source address of the outgoing network packet e.g. the private network address of the platform component A with the public address of the platform router . In doing so the address translation module may also include a source port address e.g. the port address assigned to the platform component A in the outgoing network packet. Of course it should be appreciated that the address translation module may be configured to translate between network addresses according to any suitable network address translation protocol or procedure e.g. Network Address Translation NAT Network Address and Port Translation NAPT etc. .

Referring now to in use the computing device of the system may execute a method for communicating with the local components of the computing device via the platform router . The method begins with block in which the platform router intercepts or otherwise receives a name resolution request from the host operating system and or an application executing on the host operating system . The name resolution request may include the hostname of a target destination which in some embodiments may be a hostname that has been assigned to one of the local components e.g. the platform component A . After intercepting the name resolution request the method advances to block .

In block the platform router generates and transmits a response to the name resolution request. To do so the platform router resolves or otherwise looks up the hostname included in the received name resolution request to determine a corresponding network address e.g. the network address corresponding to the hostname . In some embodiments the platform router may compare the hostname included in the received name resolution request with the hostnames included in each of a plurality of network address records stored in the data storage . As discussed each of the plurality of network address records may correspond to a different one of the one or more local components and may include among other things information indicative of the hostname and network address assigned the corresponding local component . After determining the network address corresponding to the hostname included in the received name resolution request the platform router may generate and transmit a response including the determined network address to the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system .

In block the platform router receives or otherwise intercepts a network packet transmitted by the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system . The network packet received from the host operating system may include the network address for the target destination as a destination address. After receiving the network packet from the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system the method advances to block .

In block the platform router determines whether the network packet is destined for one of the local components e.g. the platform component A or a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . To do so the platform router may determine whether the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components . In some embodiments the platform router may compare the destination address against a list including the network addresses currently assigned to one or more of the local components of the computing device . In such embodiments the platform router may determine that the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components e.g. the platform component A in response matching the destination address with one of the network addresses included in the list. If however the platform router is unable to match the destination address with one of the network addresses included in the list the platform router may instead determine that the destination address corresponds to a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device . Additionally or alternatively the platform router may determine that the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components as a function of one or more of the network address records maintained in the data storage . If in block the platform router determines that the destination address of the received network packet corresponds to one of the local components the method advances to block . If however the platform router instead determines that the destination address of the received network packet does not correspond to one of the local components the method advances to block in which the platform router transmits or otherwise forwards the received network packet to another component of the computing device e.g. the communication circuitry etc. and or a device external to the computing device e.g. the external computing device .

In block the platform router determines whether the target destination of the received network packet e.g. the platform component A supports network protocol functionality. If in block the platform router determines that the target destination of the received network packet e.g. the platform component A supports network protocol functionality the method advances to block in which the platform router sends or otherwise forwards the network packet to the target destination e.g. the platform component A as is. If however the platform router determines instead that the target destination of the received network packet e.g. the platform component A lacks network protocol functionality the method advances to block .

In some embodiments the platform router may receive in block a response to the network packet from the target destination e.g. the platform component A . In such embodiments in block the platform router transmits or otherwise forwards the response network packet to the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system .

In block the platform router translates the received network packet into a format supported by the target destination e.g. the platform component A . To do so in some embodiments the platform router removes the header information from the network packet e.g. TCP header IP header Network Interface header Media Access Control address etc. to extract the data encapsulated therein which may be in a format supported by the target destination e.g. the platform component A . After extracting the data encapsulated within the network packet the method advances to block in which the platform router sends or otherwise forwards the extracted data to the target destination e.g. the platform component A .

Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments the platform router may receive in block a response to the extracted data the target destination e.g. the platform component A . The response to the extracted data may be embodied as a communication message in a format supported by the target destination e.g. the platform component A . In such embodiments in block the platform router translates or otherwise encapsulates the response communication message into a response network packet including the necessary network packet header information e.g. TCP header IP header Network Interface header Media Access Control address etc. . After encapsulating the response communication message into a response network packet the platform router in block transmits or otherwise forwards the response network packet to the host operating system and or the application executing on the host operating system .
