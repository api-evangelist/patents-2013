The present invention relates generally to gaming apparatus and methods and more particularly to gaming apparatus and methods that display images having dynamically changing paths.

Gaming terminals such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for gaming machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.

According to aspects of the present invention gaming apparatus and methods display images having dynamically changing shapes. For example in one embodiment a wagering game displays three dimensional reel images having dynamically changing paths.

According to one embodiment a gaming system includes a display device configured to display a screen for a wagering game. The screen presents at least one reel and a graphical object. The at least one reel indicates a randomly determined outcome for the wagering game. The screen presents a graphical interaction between the graphical object and the at least one reel. The at least one reel changes from a first shape to a second shape in response to the graphical interaction between the graphical object and the at least one reel. The gaming system also includes a processor configured to determine the second shape for the at least one reel according to a physical simulation. The physical simulation programmatically associates the at least one reel and the graphical object with non rendered rigid body objects and conducts a simulated interaction between the rigid body objects to determine how the at least one reel changes in the graphical interaction.

In some cases the first shape may be defined by a first spline and the second shape may be defined by a second spline. The first spline is defined by one or more curves passing through a first set of control points. The second spline is defined by one or more curves passing through a second set of control points. The processor is configured to determine the second set of control points according to the physical simulation. In addition the physical simulation may programmatically associate the first set of control points and the graphical object with the rigid body objects and may conduct a simulated interaction between the rigid body objects to determine how the at least one reel changes in the graphical interaction.

In other cases the screen may present the at least one reel and the graphical object in a rendered three dimensional environment and the physical simulation conducts a simulated three dimensional interaction between the rigid body objects. In addition the at least one reel may be disposed in a foreground of the three dimensional environment and the screen presents the graphical object moving from a first position in a background of the three dimensional environment to a second position in the foreground where the graphical object interacts with the at least one reel by moving to the second position.

The screen displays the first image transitioning from following the first spline to following the second spline.

In some cases the screen presents a graphical interaction involving the first image and the processor is configured to determine the second set of control points in response to the graphical interaction involving the first image. The processor may be configured to determine the second set of control points according to a physical simulation the physical simulation programmatically associating the first image with non rendered rigid body objects and conducting a simulated interaction with the rigid body objects based on the graphical interaction. The physical simulation may programmatically associate the first set of control points with the rigid body objects and conduct the simulated interaction to determine how the rigid body objects change based on the graphical interaction where the second set of control points are determined by the change in the rigid body objects. The graphical interaction on the screen may occur between the first image and a second image. Alternatively the gaming system further includes a player input device configured to receive an input from a player where the input causes the graphical interaction with the first image.

In a further embodiment one or more physical machine readable storage media include instructions which when executed by one or more processors cause the one or more processors to perform operations including determining a first set of control points to define a first spline for a first image the first spline being defined by one or more curves passing through the first set of control points the first image following the first spline displaying the first image on a screen for a wagering game determining a second set of control points to define a second spline for the first image the second spline being defined by one or more curves passing through the second set of control points and changing the first image on the screen to follow the second spline.

In some cases the operations performed by the one or more processors further comprise displaying a graphical interaction involving the first image wherein determining the second set of control points occurs in response to the graphical interaction involving the first image. The operations performed by the one or more processors may include programmatically associating the first image with non rendered rigid body objects and conducting a simulated interaction between the rigid body objects based on the graphical interaction wherein the second set of control points are determined from the simulated interaction. The operations performed by the one or more processors may include programmatically associating the first set of control points with non rendered rigid body objects and conducting a simulated interaction to determine how the rigid body objects change based on the graphical interaction the second set of control points being determined by the change in the rigid body objects. The graphical interaction on the screen may occur between the first image and a second image. Alternatively the operations performed by the one or more processors further comprise receiving an input from a player and determining the graphical interaction from the input.

Input devices such as the touch screen buttons a mouse a joystick a gesture sensing device a voice recognition device and a virtual input device accept player input s and transform the player input s to electronic data signals indicative of the player input s which correspond to an enabled feature for such input s at a time of activation e.g. pressing a Max Bet button or soft key to indicate a player s desire to place a maximum wager to play the wagering game . The input s once transformed into electronic data signals are output to a CPU for processing. The electronic data signals are selected from a group consisting essentially of an electrical current an electrical voltage an electrical charge an optical signal an optical element a magnetic signal and a magnetic element.

Turning now to there is shown a block diagram of the gaming terminal architecture. The gaming terminal includes a central processing unit CPU connected to a main memory . The CPU may include any suitable processor s such as those made by Intel and AMD. By way of example the CPU includes a plurality of microprocessors including a master processor a slave processor and a secondary or parallel processor. CPU as used herein comprises any combination of hardware software or firmware disposed in or outside of the gaming terminal that is configured to communicate with or control the transfer of data between the gaming terminal and a bus another computer processor device service or network. The CPU comprises one or more controllers or processors and such one or more controllers or processors need not be disposed proximal to one another and may be located in different devices or in different locations. The CPU is operable to execute all of the various gaming methods and other processes disclosed herein. The main memory includes a wagering game unit . In one embodiment the wagering game unit may present wagering games such as video poker video black jack video slots video lottery etc. in whole or part.

The CPU is also connected to an input output I O bus which can include any suitable bus technologies such as an AGTL frontside bus and a PCI backside bus. The I O bus is connected to various input devices output devices and input output devices such as those discussed above in connection with . The I O bus is also connected to storage unit and external system interface which is connected to external system s e.g. wagering game networks .

In yet other aspects the external system may comprise a player s portable electronic device e.g. cellular phone electronic wallet etc. and the external system interface is configured to facilitate wireless communication and data transfer between the portable electronic device and the CPU such as by a near field communication path operating via magnetic field induction or a frequency hopping spread spectrum RF signals e.g. Bluetooth etc. .

The gaming terminal optionally communicates with the external system such that the terminal operates as a thin thick or intermediate client. In general a wagering game includes an RNG for generating a random number game logic for determining the outcome based on the randomly generated number and game assets e.g. art sound etc. for presenting the determined outcome to a player in an audio visual manner. The RNG game logic and game assets are contained within the gaming terminal thick client gaming terminal the external system thin client gaming terminal or are distributed therebetween in any suitable manner intermediate client gaming terminal .

The gaming terminal may include additional peripheral devices or more than one of each component shown in . Any component of the gaming terminal architecture may include hardware firmware or tangible machine readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine readable storage media includes any mechanism that stores information and provides the information in a form readable by a machine e.g. gaming terminal computer etc. . For example machine readable storage media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory etc.

Referring now to there is illustrated an image of a basic game screen adapted to be displayed on the primary display area or the secondary display area . The basic game screen portrays a plurality of simulated symbol bearing reels . Alternatively or additionally the basic game screen portrays a plurality of mechanical reels or other video or mechanical presentation consistent with the game format and theme. The basic game screen also advantageously displays one or more game session credit meters and various touch screen buttons adapted to be actuated by a player. A player can operate or interact with the wagering game using these touch screen buttons or other input devices such as the buttons shown in . The CPU operate s to execute a wagering game program causing the primary display area or the secondary display area to display the wagering game.

In response to receiving a wager the reels are rotated and stopped to place symbols on the reels in visual association with paylines such as paylines . The wagering game evaluates the displayed array of symbols on the stopped reels and provides immediate awards and bonus features in accordance with a pay table. The pay table may for example include line pays or scatter pays. Line pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear along an activated payline typically in a particular order such as left to right right to left top to bottom bottom to top etc. Scatter pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear anywhere in the displayed array without regard to position or paylines. Similarly the wagering game may trigger bonus features based on one or more bonus triggering symbols appearing along an activated payline i.e. line trigger or anywhere in the displayed array i.e. scatter trigger . The wagering game may also provide mystery awards and features independent of the symbols appearing in the displayed array.

In accord with various methods of conducting a wagering game on a gaming system in accord with the present concepts the wagering game includes a game sequence in which a player makes a wager and a wagering game outcome is provided or displayed in response to the wager being received or detected. The wagering game outcome is then revealed to the player in due course following initiation of the wagering game. The method comprises the acts of conducting the wagering game using a gaming apparatus such as the gaming terminal depicted in following receipt of an input from the player to initiate the wagering game. The gaming terminal then communicates the wagering game outcome to the player via one or more output devices e.g. primary display or secondary display through the display of information such as but not limited to text graphics static images moving images etc. or any combination thereof. In accord with the method of conducting the wagering game the CPU transforms a physical player input such as a player s pressing of a Spin Reels touch key into an electronic data signal indicative of an instruction relating to the wagering game e.g. an electronic data signal bearing data on a wager amount .

In the aforementioned method for each data signal the CPU e.g. CPU is configured to process the electronic data signal to interpret the data signal e.g. data signals corresponding to a wager input and to cause further actions associated with the interpretation of the signal in accord with computer instructions relating to such further actions executed by the controller. As one example the CPU causes the recording of a digital representation of the wager in one or more storage media e.g. storage unit the CPU in accord with associated computer instructions causing the changing of a state of the storage media from a first state to a second state. This change in state is for example effected by changing a magnetization pattern on a magnetically coated surface of a magnetic storage media or changing a magnetic state of a ferromagnetic surface of a magneto optical disc storage media a change in state of transistors or capacitors in a volatile or a non volatile semiconductor memory e.g. DRAM etc. The noted second state of the data storage media comprises storage in the storage media of data representing the electronic data signal from the CPU e.g. the wager in the present example . As another example the CPU further in accord with the execution of the instructions relating to the wagering game causes the primary display other display device or other output device e.g. speakers lights communication device etc. to change from a first state to at least a second state wherein the second state of the primary display comprises a visual representation of the physical player input e.g. an acknowledgement to a player information relating to the physical player input e.g. an indication of the wager amount a game sequence an outcome of the game sequence or any combination thereof wherein the game sequence in accord with the present concepts comprises acts described herein. The aforementioned executing of computer instructions relating to the wagering game is further conducted in accord with a random outcome e.g. determined by a RNG that is used by the CPU to determine the outcome of the game sequence using a game logic for determining the outcome based on the randomly generated number. In at least some aspects the CPU is configured to determine an outcome of the game sequence at least partially in response to the random parameter.

As shown in the symbol bearing reels of the basic game screen are displayed as linear and vertical columns in a side by side arrangement. In the illustrated example the arrangement results in a two dimensional three by five array of symbols. When the reels are rotated in response to a wager the symbols on the reels appear to move i.e. up or down along the vertical and linear columns defined by their respective reels. When the reels stop rotating their symbols appear in the same three by five array. Video presentations of reels have traditionally attempted to simulate the operation of mechanical reels. As such video presentations have been typically limited to showing reels such as the reels as linear and vertical columns in a side by side arrangement.

For example the reels may dynamically transition from the arrangement of vertical and linear columns shown in to any of the paths shown in . In particular the reels in remain side by side but now follow curved paths. In one embodiment the reels may follow the vertical and linear paths shown in and in response to a wager the reels dynamically transition to the curved paths shown in . As the paths of the reels change the symbols on the reels may simultaneously move along the changing shapes of their respective reels until the symbols stop in positions that determine the outcome of the wagering game. The speed of the movement of the symbols along the path of the reels may also be varied for additional visual effect.

In other embodiments the paths of the reels change at random times or in response to other events or aspects of the wagering game. In other words a wager is not necessary to trigger changes to the shape of the reels . For example the reels may continuously change shape as a visual effect to attract players when the gaming terminal is idle. In another example the reels follow the vertical and linear paths shown in when the player is playing a basic game but if the player earns a bonus game the reels may change shape to visually signal bonus gameplay. In yet another example the gaming terminal may provide different basic games e.g. with different pay tables gameplay features etc. and the reels may change paths in response to a selection of a particular basic game by the player.

While the reels in all appear to have similar curved shapes different subsets of the reels can have varying respective curved shapes in other embodiments. For example shows that the reels have a first curved shape while the reels have a different second curved shape.

Furthermore shows that the game screen is not limited to displaying the reels and may include other graphical objects. In particular the game screen includes a graphical object . The shapes of the reels accommodate the shape of graphical object . In one embodiment the reels and in dynamically change shape e.g. bend in opposing directions in response to the appearance of the graphical object . The change in the reel paths ensures for example that the symbols on the reels remain visible and are not covered by the graphical object . The graphical object may be associated with the theme of the wagering game. Additionally the graphical object may be used for some aspect of the gameplay. For example it may appear as a part of a bonus game indicate enhanced awards etc.

While the reels in may be non overlapping illustrates an example in which the paths of the reels and interact with each other to overlap and criss cross. In one embodiment in response to a wager the paths of the reels and change while the symbols move along the reels to determine the outcome of the wagering game. As such the symbols and on the reel effectively switch positions with the symbols and on the reel even though the symbols and remain on their respective reels and . The change in reel paths in changes the arrangement of the symbols relative to the paylines and appears to change the outcome s . In alternative embodiments reels may cross or otherwise overlap other reels more than once.

The relative movement and positioning of the reels and shows that the reels on the game screen can move three dimensionally. In addition to moving horizontally and vertically along the plane of the display area the reels appear to move into and out of the plane of the display area. Thus according to aspects of the present invention the reels shown in the game screen may follow any three dimensional path.

In the embodiments above the symbols remain on and move with their respective reels even as the reels transition between paths. On the other hand illustrate an embodiment in which the symbols on a given reel may change with the change in the path of the reel. shows that the reels have a first curved shape while the reels have a different second curved shape. also shows however that the game screen includes a stand alone reel symbol positioned between the reels and . The reels and also curve to accommodate the shape of isolated real symbol

According to aspects of the present invention the path of the reels such as the reels in the embodiments above are based on programmatically generated splines where the path of a reel is defined by a series of control points. Splines in general combine one or more curves to smoothly fit the series of control points. For example a spline may employ a Bezier curve which is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields.

For a given reel a corresponding spline fits curves to a set of defined control points and the reel follows a path defined by the fit curves. In effect the set of control points limits the possible paths that the reel may follow. Any of the defined control points however can be altered to generate a new set of possible paths for the reel. In addition various parameters for the spline can be set to define the manner in which the curves fit the control points. For example one parameter may define a tension between control points. In particular a cardinal spline is defined by a set of control points and a tension parameter. A greater tension generally results in a smaller rate of curvature between two control points. A lower tension generally results in a greater rate of curvature between control points and gives the appearance of greater slack. The tension can be varied for the curves fitting the different pairs of control points to provide a desired visual effect e.g. more curvature in one section of the reel and less curvature in another section of the reel. For some splines a large amount of slack may even result for example in an oscillating shape between the control points.

A reel appears to move when its path transitions between different splines. For example the reel in follows a first spline defining the a first curved path and then can move until it follows a second spline defining a second curved path shown in . The first spline is defined by a first set of control points and the second spline is generated according to a second set of control points. As described above the graphical object appears in the game screen shown in . As such the second set of control points are set so that they accommodate the position of the graphical object and prevent the reel from overlapping the graphical object when its path changes from the first spline to the second spline. In general the control points apply constraints on the paths of the reels and can limit movement of the reels in any degree of freedom. Thus the reel can move again to follow a path defined by a third spline but the third set of control points continues to keep the reel from moving into the space defined by the graphical object .

In some embodiments the paths of the reels are randomly determined and dynamically rendered in real time i.e. on the fly. The basic definition of the spline may be programmed in advance but the definition is altered to generate new paths for the reels. At runtime the path of the reels can be altered for any gameplay by repositioning the control points of the splines programmatically. Advantageously the use of splines provides a flexible approach for dynamically generating any number of possible reel paths during actual gameplay. Alternatively the paths of the reels may be determined in advance. In particular during the setup of the game screen the paths of the reels may be generated in batch by varying spline definitions and then the generated paths are stored for use by the game screen.

In the example of the game screen displays a three dimensional underwater environment. As shown in graphical objects are displayed in the background of the game screen . In particular the game screen displays fish swimming through the background . Meanwhile the reels are separately displayed in the foreground . Thus the fish in appear to be swimming behind the reels .

In however the game screen displays the fish in the background moving from behind the reels to the foreground . In particular the fish attempts to swim between the reels and . To accommodate the fish the paths of the reels change dynamically. Specifically the paths of the reels transition from the splines shown in to splines shown in .

According to aspects of the present invention graphical objects such as the fish can move three dimensionally through the environment displayed by the game screen. As such the graphical objects in the environment can interact with the reels such as the reels and cause any of the reel paths to change.

In some embodiments the interaction between the graphical objects and the reels may appear to alter the outcome s of the wagering game. For example shows that the reel includes symbols sea castle shell fish and sand dollar . also shows that the reel includes treasure chest sand castle sand dollar and shell . The symbols and are positioned relative to the other symbols and in an arrangement that can be conventionally evaluated to determine the outcome s of the wagering game.

As illustrates however the fish is randomly selected to interact with the reels and to change the paths of the reels and and correspondingly the arrangement of the symbols and . In particular the fish causes the paths of the reels and to stretch and bow three dimensionally outward. The reels and and in response also change paths to a lesser extent. The stretching of the paths causes the spacing between the symbols and on the reels and respectively to increase. As a result shows that the symbols and have changed positions relative to the other symbols and while the symbols and are no longer shown on the game screen . The changes to the arrangement of the symbols and caused by the fish also changes how the outcome s of the wagering game are evaluated.

Thus to provide the outcome of a wagering game a game screen may initially show the result of a reel spin and then alter the result by showing an interaction between one or more graphical objects such as the fish and the reels. This interaction changes the position of the reel symbols relative to the paylines. The interaction between the one or more graphical objects may also occur in a rendered three dimensional environment.

Although the graphical object appears to alter the outcome of the wagering game the final outcome in some embodiments may be determined at the time of the wager and the interaction between the graphical object and the reels may be one of a plurality of randomly selected ways to display the predetermined outcome. In other words the final outcomes in some embodiments do not actually depend on the interaction between the graphical object and the reels. The outcome would generally be the same regardless of how the outcome is displayed on the game screen with changing reel paths.

The game screen also includes the fish which swim in the background as shown in . In act the fish located at a first position xi yi zi is selected to interact with the reels . Like the control points for the splines the fish is also programmatically associated with a sphere or other shaped object that has rigid body information and occupies space in the three dimensional environment. In act a second position x2 y2 z2 is determined and in act the fish is shown to move from the first position xi yi zi to the second position x2 y2 z2 in the three dimensional environment of the game screen .

By moving to the second position x2 y2 z2 the fish moves into space occupied by the reels and . In act five sets of control points are defined for the splines which in turn define new paths for the reels in response to the new position of the fish

According to one embodiment the rigid body and spatial information associated with the spheres for the control points and the fish are employed in a physics simulation. In particular the simulation determines how the spheres associated with the reels would behave in a three dimensional world according to physical laws if the sphere associated with the fish were to move to the specified position between the reels and . The physics simulation determines final positions for the spheres associated with the reels and the final positions are used to define the five sets of control points in act .

According to one embodiment the physics simulation imparts the properties of cloth on the reels so that the fish appears to part the reels like curtains when it moves into the foreground . Various parameters may be employed to constrain aspects of the reels . For example if the reels have the properties of cloth specified parameters e.g. higher tension values may prevent the simulation from twisting the reels thereby ensuring that the reel symbols remain visible on one side of the reels . It is understood however that the reels may have the properties of other materials and may behave according to different parameters. For example the reels may have the elastic properties of rubber or a flexible plastic.

An example of a simulation system that may be employed to apply physics to the control points is provided by Havok www.havoksimulation.com . The simulation system may provide a runtime software development kit and toolset that controls the movements of objects in a two dimensional or three dimensional scene e.g. by simulating the collision of the objects. The simulation system may generate the control points for the splines in real time or offline before the wagering game is played. In one embodiment the CPU of the gaming terminal may access in real time the generated control points through an application programming interface API for the simulation system.

In act the reels are rendered on the game screen to follow the splines as shown in . In effect when the fish moves into the foreground in the three dimensional environment the fish pushes the control points associated with the reels and dynamically changes the path of the reels as shown in .

In the example of the interaction between the fish and the reels may be triggered at random times and or in response to an event in the wagering game such as the appearance of one or more triggering symbols on the reels. In one embodiment the fish may be selected by the player e.g. by a touch screen to cause a change in the paths of the reels . The reel game is combined with aspects of a picking game where the player s selection in the picking game results in a change in the outcome of the reel game. As shown in the background includes a plurality of fish the visibility of which may be enhanced by making the reels semi transparent. The player can select one of the fish which then moves to the foreground to a random second location x2 y2 z2 to change the path of the reels to achieve possibly a better outcome for the wagering game. The resulting control points for the splines depends on the second location x2 y2 z2 . Additionally the rigid body information sphere associated with each fish may vary with the size of the fish. As such the selection of a larger fish may result in a greater change in the paths of the reels . Of course other factors may also be taken into account to determine how the paths of the reels change. For example a larger wager may provide a greater number and variety of fish from which the player can select.

Although game screen shown in triggers one of the fish to alter the paths of the reels it is understood that other game themes may be employed and other graphical objects effects may alter the paths of the reels. In another aquatic theme for example the game screen displays reels that float along in a moving stream. The forces associated with the moving water in the stream cause the reels to change paths. Also obstacles such as rocks fish and the like in the stream may apply additional forces to the reels to change their paths as the reels move downstream.

In another example a game screen may display an explosion behind the reels. Like the fish above the explosion applies a force to the reels resulting in a change in the control points defining the splines for the reels. Other graphical objects effects may include wind projectiles other animated characters or any object that can contact apply a physical force to the reels.

In some embodiments the player can provide an input to trigger a change in the paths of the reels e.g. cause a change in control points for splines defining the paths of the reels. As described above for example the fish may be selected by the player in a picking game to cause a change in the paths of the reels . Thus the player may trigger a graphical object on the game screen to interact with the reels and cause a change in their paths. In some cases the player selects the graphical object and the processor determines how the graphical object behaves and interacts with the reels. In other cases the player selects the graphical object and manipulates it to interact with the reels e.g. selects the graphical object via a touch screen and drags the graphical object to a position that causes it to contact the reels.

In another example the player may interact directly with the reels to cause a change in their paths. In other words a graphical object like the fish is not required to trigger a change in the reel paths. In some cases the player may cause the reels to change by touching an area proximate to the reels on a touch screen. For instance the input from the player is translated into a physical force applied to the control points of the splines for the reels and the simulated result is shown on the game screen. The player s touch may appear to push the reels aside to areas around the player s touch.

In other cases the player may touch a reel and drag portions of the reel in different directions to define a new path for the reel. For instance the input from the player drags the control points of the splines for the reels in the different directions.

Thus in general a player may provide a direct or indirect input that results in a graphical interaction with aspects of the game screen e.g. the reels or other graphical object. It is understood that the player s input is not limited to direct interaction with the reels or other graphical images through a touch screen. Other approaches for player input may include use of buttons a mouse a joystick touch pad keyboard and or a voice recognition device etc. Additional approaches may include use of a wireless controller a gesture sensing device or similar device that translates the player s hand or body motions into an input on the game screen.

In other embodiments an interaction with a graphical object and or an input from the player is not required to cause a change in reel paths. In some cases the processor dynamically redefines the splines mathematically without such interaction to achieve an effect on the reels and or change the evaluation of the reel positions. In one example a game screen includes a plurality of reels that follow paths defined by splines that extend vertically across the game screen and when the reels are spinning the reel symbols move downwardly and vertically along the reel paths. While spinning the reel paths dynamically change to follow splines that extend horizontally across the game screen. The reel paths may change but the orientation of the reel symbols may remain the same. As a result the reel symbols move sideways along the new reel paths. No interaction involving a graphical object and or player input is required the processor automatically initiates vector math to redefine the reel paths and movement of the reel symbols during a reel spin.

As described above the reels may have the properties of various materials and may behave according to different parameters. Correspondingly the reels can also have shapes that are more complex than those shown in the previous embodiments. For example illustrates a single reel that loops around as it extends downwardly. The reel symbols follow the loop. In particular as shown in the symbol W moves downward toward the position of the symbol M . The symbol enters the bottom of the loop and begins to move upwardly toward the symbol S . The symbol is at the top of the loop and begins to move downwardly toward the symbol 1 .

In another example shows a single reel that twists in a helical shape as it extends downwardly. The reel symbols follow the helical shape. In particular as shown in the symbol W moves downward toward the symbol M . A front surface of the symbol completely shows the letter W. The symbol twists as it moves downward toward the symbol S . Because it is twisted half of the front side of the symbol is shown and half of the back side of the symbol is shown. Correspondingly half of the letter M is shown from the front side and half of the letter M is shown from the back side. The symbols may be semitransparent so that the letter number on one side can be seen through the other side or the symbols have opaque sides where each side includes a letter number. The symbol is almost completely twisted around as it moves toward the symbol 1 so that the letter S is shown completely from the back side. The symbol is twisted from the orientation of the symbol so that the number 1 is completely shown from the front side.

The looping or twisting paths of the reels in emphasize the three dimensional nature of the reels and the game screen environment. The reels can be employed in combination with other reels on a game screen. In addition the paths may be the result of an interaction between the reels and another graphical object on the game screen similar to the interaction shown in .

In summary according to aspects of the present invention gaming apparatus and methods display images having dynamically changing shapes. For example in some embodiments a wagering game displays three dimensional reel images having dynamically changing paths. In some cases the paths are defined by splines that are defined by one or more curves passing through a set of control points. The paths may take any shape constrained by the set of control points. In other cases the paths change dynamically in response to interaction with other graphical objects. In further embodiments the paths are determined by a physical simulation that associates the set of control points and the graphical object with non rendered rigid body objects and conducts a simulated interaction between the rigid body objects to determine how the reels change.

Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention which is set forth in the following claims. Moreover the present concepts expressly include any and all combinations and subcombinations of the preceding elements and aspects.
