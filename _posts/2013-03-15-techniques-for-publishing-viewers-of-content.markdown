The present application relates generally to data processing techniques and in one specific example to techniques for publishing various information about viewers of content.

Many network based applications and services that are currently in use or in development including network based question and answer applications and services have a social aspect. For example users of these applications are encouraged to establish connections with other users or follow other users for the purpose of forming virtual communities or forums via which the users can interact with one another and exchange information. Similarly users of these applications may be encouraged to follow certain content sources or subscribe to receive information relating to certain topics answers to certain questions and so forth. Many of these network based applications and services rely partially and in some cases almost entirely on user generated content that is content generated by the end users of the particular application or service. The value of such applications and services to the users and thus the success of any organization providing such applications and services is heavily dependent upon the ability to attract and retain users who are willing to participate for example by consuming content and or interacting with other users by generating desirable quality content that is to be shared with others.

Example methods and systems for publishing various information about viewers of content are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

As described in various embodiments herein a viewer publication system is configured to generate aggregate and publish various information about viewers of content items. Consistent with some embodiments a content item may correspond to a question content item or an answer content item posted on a question and answer service such as Quora.com which is owned and operated by Quora Inc. of Mountain View Calif. According to various exemplary embodiments when a content author posts a question on a question and answer service the viewer publication system may publish the identities of the viewers of the content item and describe how those viewers came upon that particular content item. Thus the content author is able to understand who in the community is viewing their content and how those members of the community reached that content e.g. what led those members to see the content how did it come to their attention etc. . Accordingly instead of simply notifying the content author of how many views their content item has received the viewer publication system provides a unique and informative type of feedback for the content author.

At the same time the publication of information about viewers of content items must be carefully balanced against the need to protect the privacy of such viewers. Thus according to various exemplary embodiments the publication of information about viewers of content items may be controlled in accordance with various privacy control systems of a viewer publication system described herein. For example according to various embodiments described herein a viewer publication system is configured to detect when a user is viewing a particular content item such as a question posted on the question and answer service. Thereafter the viewer publication system may determine a privacy value associated with the viewing event such as a privacy value of low or high . The aforementioned privacy value indicates how private the viewing event was from the perspective of the viewing user and or an inferred sensitivity of the viewing user to publication of the viewing event. Put another way the privacy value indicates whether a publication of the viewing event could be considered by that viewer user as disclosure of private information about the viewing user.

According to various embodiments described herein a viewer publication system is configured to detect when a user is viewing a particular content item such as a question posted on the question and answer service. Thereafter the viewer publication system determines view reason information describing for example how the user accessed the viewed content item how the user was notified of the content item how the content item came to the user s attention what led the user to view the content item etc.

According to various exemplary embodiments the viewer publication system may generate metadata describing each viewing event. The metadata for a given viewing event may describe for example a viewing date time a location IP address of a device having a web browser through which the content item was viewed a location city state country etc. corresponding to the aforementioned IP address a name of the viewing user a link to the profile of the viewing user and a link to the content item viewed. According to various exemplary embodiments the metadata may also include privacy values associated with the viewing event. According to various exemplary embodiments the metadata may also include view reason information describing for example how the user accessed the viewed content item how the user was notified of the content item how the content item came to the user s attention what led the user to view the content item etc.

According to various exemplary embodiments the viewer publication system may aggregate all metadata describing viewing events corresponding to a particular content item and associate this aggregated metadata with the content item. Thereafter the viewer publication system may display a views page that may be linked to the content item and that may list viewers of the content item. The views page may also describe how the identified viewers came upon that particular content item. According to various exemplary embodiments some of the viewers and or view reasons may be fully identified while other viewers and or view reasons may be anonymized based on the privacy values or view reasons associated with each viewer s interaction with the underlying content item.

As is understood by skilled artisans in the relevant computer and Internet related arts each module or logic component shown in represents a set of executable software instructions and the corresponding hardware e.g. memory and processor s for executing the instructions. To avoid obscuring the inventive subject matter with unnecessary detail various functional modules and or logic components that are not germane to conveying an understanding of the inventive subject matter have been omitted from . However a skilled artisan will readily recognize that various additional functional modules and logic components may be used with a network or web based application such as that illustrated in to facilitate additional functionality that is not specifically described herein. Furthermore the various functional modules and logic components depicted in may reside on a single server computer or may be distributed across several server computers in various arrangements.

As illustrated in the client computer executes a web browser application to access the web based question and answer application or service over a network. In various alternative embodiments the client computer may be a mobile computing device to include a laptop mobile phone e book reader or tablet computer. As such with some embodiments the question and answer application or service may have an interface that is customized for display in a browser or mobile application of a mobile device. Furthermore with some embodiments the client based application may not be browser based but instead may be customized to suit the particular operating system of the device on which it is executing. For instance a customized application may utilize one or more application programming interfaces APIs that are unique to the particular device and operating system on which the customized application resides and executes.

As shown in the question and answer service includes three separate content delivery or distribution channels by which content may be communicated to users. For purposes of the present disclosure a channel is a content delivery or distribution mechanism by which content can be communicated and presented to a user. A content distribution channel may leverage an underlying communication mechanism such as a web server module an email or messaging platform a short messaging service SMS a micro blogging service a telephone based service and so forth. In the particular embodiment of three separate content distribution channels are shown including a content feed notifications and email or messaging . Of course with other embodiments different content distributions channels may also be used.

The question and answer application logic shown in includes a variety of application modules not shown that provide some of the core functionality of the application to include a content posting module a messaging and notifications module and an ask to answer module. In general the content posting module enables users to post questions answers and comments as well as other content related items of information. The messaging and notifications module operates in conjunction with the content posting module to facilitate the generation and communication of messages and notifications which are communicated to one or more users via one of the content distribution channels . Accordingly when a first user posts an answer to a second user s question via the content posting module the messaging and notifications module will cause a message or notification to be communicated to the second user informing the second user of the newly posted answer to the question. The ask to answer module analyzes a variety of information to suggest to a user the names of other users who for various reasons may be persons to whom a question should be directed. Of course the application logic may include a number of other modules and logic components that perform a variety of other tasks and functions beyond the immediate scope of the present inventive subject matter. In particular the inventive concepts described herein might be implemented with a question and answer application or service consistent with any one or more of the features and functionality described in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 795 482 entitled Methods and Systems for Merging Topics Assigned to Content Items in an Online Community filed Jun. 7 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 983 056 entitled Methods and Systems for Soliciting an Answer to a Question filed Dec. 31 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 983 062 entitled A Multi Functional Navigation Bar filed on Dec. 31 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 766 417 entitled Techniques For Facilitating The Promotion Of Organic Content filed on Feb. 13 2013. However to avoid obscuring the inventive subject matter with unnecessary detail various functional modules and logic components have not been included in .

The question and answer service may be connected to a database management server and or various databases managed by the database management server . A variety of data may be stored in various databases . For example as shown in databases or database tables may exist for storing user profile data . Generally user profile data includes personal information about each user such as their name email address telephone number place of employment educational background and or any other type of personal information that might be commonly found on a resume or curriculum vitae. With some embodiments the user profile data may additionally include location information indicating the geographical location of a residence or workplace of a user information indicating a user s experience e.g. work study accomplishments awards received etc. and or information indicating one or more topics on which a user has expertise.

In addition to user profile data social graph data may be stored in a database . The social graph data includes information about the various relationships that exist between users of the service and the content e.g. questions answers comments blog posts etc. that each user has subscribed to or follows. For example with some embodiments users can follow another user a type of unilateral relationship and then be informed about information posted to the service by the user that is being followed. In some instances two users may follow one another a bilateral relationship sometimes referred to as a direct connection. Moreover any user generated content to include any of the various content items that might be promoted and presented in a content feed are stored in a database . The user generated content stored in the database tables include for example the text of questions answers comments and so forth.

In the context of the present disclosure a channel is a content delivery and presentation mechanism by which content including system generated and or user generated content can be communicated and or presented to users. Various social media applications utilize a variety of different types of content delivery distribution channels to present content to users. For instance one particular channel is referred to herein as a content feed but may also be commonly referred to and known by others as an activity stream content stream status update stream news feed or simply a data feed.

Using a content posting module a user can post or publish some content e.g. a blog post a message a picture a question an answer etc. to the content feeds of other users. Once posted the content will appear in the personalized content feeds of any other users who may be connected to or following the particular user or any users who are following a topic to which the posted or published content is related. For example in the specific case of a question and answer service a user may follow a question such that when an answer to the question is posted or published the answer will automatically be presented in the content feed of the user who is following the question.

Another example of a content delivery distribution channel is email or messaging where each user has an inbox and is provided with the ability to send and receive emails messages. With some embodiments email may provide both a mechanism by which users can communicate with one another and by which application or system generated content can be communicated to users. Furthermore the email or messaging platform may be web based or may use any of a variety of conventional email or messaging protocols to allow access by remote client applications. In yet another example an application or service may provide a system of notifications. A notification channel may for example push certain system generated content to users. For instance a notification may be generated upon detecting certain conditions or events. When a user provides a comment regarding a content item indicates that he or she likes a particular content item or votes up or down a particular content item a notification may be generated and communicated to the user who authored the particular content item. Similarly in the particular context of a question and answer service a user may receive a notification for example when another user posts an answer to a question that the user is following. A notification channel may be configured to leverage one or more underlying communication mechanisms. For example notifications may be communicated via email SMS a mobile application or any other applicable means.

Many of the examples and illustrations provided herein describe or present the inventive subject matter in the particular context of a network or web based question and answer application or service. However skilled artisans will immediately recognize a vast number of other contexts including other network based applications and services to which the inventive concepts are applicable. In particular the inventive concepts described herein will find application in a wide variety of network or web based services particularly those that host and encourage user generated content and or implement or leverage a social media platform enabling users to interact with and exchange information via one or more content distribution channels including a content feed or stream email or messaging platform and system of notifications. Some of the specific types of network based applications or services to which the inventive concepts are applicable include but are not limited to email applications social network services including business and professional network services music and video services photograph sharing applications and services blog hosting services and many others. Similarly the inventive concepts described herein are applicable not only to web based applications and services accessed via a web browser application but also mobile applications as well as more traditional desktop client applications.

Turning now to a viewer publication system which may correspond to the viewer publication system illustrated in includes a determination module a metadata management module and a database . The modules of the viewer publication system may be implemented on a single device such as a viewer publication device or on separate devices interconnected via a network. The aforementioned viewer publication device may correspond to for example a client machine e.g. the client machine illustrated in or a server e.g. the processor based server s implementing the question and answer service illustrated in .

Referring back to in the determination module detects a viewing event corresponding to a user viewing a content item. The content item may correspond to for example a question page including a question and any corresponding answers posted on a network based or web based question and answer service or application such as the question and answer service illustrated in . An example of such a question and answer service is Quora.com which is owned and operated by Quora Inc. of Mountain View Calif. illustrates an example of a content item corresponding to a question page posted on a network based or web based question and answer service. The question page includes a question How hard is it to learn to sail and two corresponding answers answer posted by user Sandra Liu Huang and answer posted by user Tudor Achim . The question page identifies topics associated with the question e.g. Self teaching Sailing Boats etc. . The question page permits the viewing user John Smith to add an answer to the posted question via the text entry window .

The determination module may detect a viewing event in any one of various ways understood by those skilled in the art. For example the determination module may detect the viewing event when a web browser such as web browser application illustrated in transmits user authentication information corresponding to an account of a user to the question and answer service in order to login to the user s account on the question and answer service . Thereafter the web browser may access a reference link e.g. uniform resource locator or URL corresponding to the question page indicating that the user is viewing the question page .

In the example described above and in various examples described throughout this disclosure the content item corresponds to a webpage in its entirety such as the question page in in the interests of simplicity and clarity. However as apparent to those skilled in the art a web page may include multiple content items wherein each of the content items corresponds to a particular component portion sub portion area section etc. included or displayed in the webpage. Thus a viewing user may be viewing multiple content items on a webpage simultaneously in a case where the viewing user is viewing a webpage that includes the multiple content items. Thus if the determination module determines that a user is viewing a webpage that includes multiple content items each piece of content being viewed by the user may be associated with a separate viewing event in accordance with various embodiments described throughout.

While various embodiments of this disclosure describe content items posted on a question and answer service such as question content items answer content items content feeds profile pages topics and so on it is understood that the techniques described in various embodiments are not limited to such exemplary content items. For example the techniques described in various embodiments throughout are applicable to various types of online and offline content including webpages websites blogs bulletin boards discussion forums posts reviews articles publications presentations profile pages news feeds content feeds etc. where such content items may be distributed or disseminated in any online or offline format via any online or offline distribution or delivery channel including electronic communications such as e mails text messages such as short message service SMS text messages or multimedia messaging service MMS text messages instant messages chat messages video chat messages and so on.

Turning now to various exemplary aspects of the question and answer service will now be described with reference to the examples in . The question and answer service may include various types of content including question pages such as the question page illustrated in as well as user profile pages associated with users of the question and answer service personalized content feeds for each user of the question and answer service and topic specific content feeds associated with various topics.

For example illustrates a profile page of a user John Smith . The user profile page identifies various types of questions topics or users that may be followed by the user John Smith. For example the question and answer service may enable the user to follow a specific question a specific topic or a specific user in order to receive updates regarding the aforementioned questions topics or users in the form of a personalized content feed such as the personalized content feed of the user John Smith illustrated in . The user profile page indicates that the user John Smith is following one other user Joel Lewenstein and is following one topic Food and is following one question Music who are the best living classical pianists . Accordingly the personalized content feed of the user John Smith illustrated in displays various updates to the aforementioned user topic and question being followed by the user John Smith. For example the content feed indicates that the followed user Joel Lewenstein has followed a question promoted a question voted up or a voted down an answer to a question followed a topic added an answer to a question added a question and so on. Further the content feed indicates that for the followed topic of Food a question has been added to the topic another question has been promoted in the topic an answer has been added in response to a question in the topic and so on. Moreover the content feed indicates that for the followed question Music who are the best living classical pianists another user has promoted the question an answer has been added to the question another user has voted up or a voted down an answer to the question and so on. The personalized content feed may include various other information as understood by those skilled in the art.

The question and answer service may also include topic specific webpages or topic specific content feeds displaying updates associated with specific topics. For example illustrates a topic specific content feed for the topic of Food wherein the topic specific content feed displays updates associated with the topic of Food similar to some of the updates included in the general content feed in . Since the user John Smith is already following the topic of Food the topic specific content feed includes an Unfollow user interface element that upon selection enables the user John Smith to stop following the topic of Food and thereby stop receiving updates regarding this topic in the personalized content feed . As another example illustrates a topic specific content feed for the topic of Cars and Automobiles wherein the topic specific content feed displays updates associated with the topic of Cars and Automobiles. Since the user John Smith is not already following the topic of Cars and Automobiles the topic specific content feed includes a Follow user interface element that upon selection enables the user John Smith to follow the topic of Cars and Automobiles and thereby receive updates regarding this topic in the personalized content feed .

The question and answer service may also include profile webpages for each of the users of the question and answer service . For example illustrates a profile page for user Joel Lewenstein wherein the profile page displays updates associated with user Joel Lewenstein similar to some of the updates in the general content feed in . Since the user John Smith is already following the user Joel Lewenstein the topic specific content feed includes an Unfollow user interface element that upon selection enables the user John Smith to stop following the user Joel Lewenstein and thereby stop receiving updates regarding this user in the personalized content feed . As another example illustrates a user profile page for the user Adam D Angelo wherein the profile page displays updates associated with the user Adam D Angelo. Since the user John Smith is not already following the user Adam D Angelo the profile page includes a Follow user interface element that upon selection enables the user John Smith to follow the user Adam D Angelo and thereby receive updates regarding this user in the personalized content feed .

Returning back to the method in after the determination module detects a viewing event corresponding to a user viewing a content item in the determination module determines a privacy value associated with the viewing event in . According to various embodiments the privacy value may indicate an inferred sensitivity of the user to publication of the viewing event. According to an embodiment the privacy value may be one of two values in a binary system such as 0 or 1 true or false low or high etc. According to another embodiment the privacy value may be a value selected from a range of values such as a number in the range 0 to 10 a letter in the range of A to Z any one of low medium or high etc.

The aforementioned privacy value indicates an inferred value of how private the viewing event was from the perspective of the viewing user and or indicates an inferred sensitivity of the viewing user to publication of the viewing event. Put another way the privacy value indicates whether a publication of the viewing event could be considered by the viewing user as disclosure of private information about the viewing user. For example if the privacy value associated with the viewing event is low this indicates that the viewing user likely does not consider their viewing of the content item a private event and or the viewing user is probably not averse to the publication of the viewing event. In such a case the publication of the viewing event is likely not considered by the viewing user as disclosure of private information about the viewing user. On the other hand if the privacy value associated with the viewing event is high this indicates that the viewing user likely does consider their viewing of the content item a private event and or the viewing user is probably averse to the publication of the viewing event. In such a case the publication of the viewing event is likely considered by the viewing user as disclosure of private information about the viewing user. The determination module may determine the privacy value based on any one of various techniques described herein.

According to various embodiments the determination module may determine the privacy value based on content included in a content item being viewed. For example the determination module may access a privacy policy that lists keywords perhaps in the format of the lookup table that represent subject matter classified as private. For example illustrates privacy policy information corresponding to one or more privacy policies where the privacy policy information may be stored in for example database see or database see . As illustrated in a privacy policy in the privacy policy information lists the private keywords Healthcare Romance and Adult as representing subject matter classified as private. Accordingly the determination module may access data included in a content item e.g. metadata or HTML code associated with the question page and perform a keyword search for any of the private keywords defined in the privacy policy information . If the determination module detects any of these private keywords in the content item then the determination module may classify the content item as private and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a high value. On the other hand if the determination module does not detect any of these private keywords in the content item then the determination module may classify the content item as public and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a low value.

According to various embodiments the private keywords identified in for example the privacy policy information may represent a set of global private keywords that identify subject matter that is considered globally private e.g. based on global sensitivities . Thus the determination module may determine that any viewing events of subject matter containing global private keywords is private regardless of the identity of the viewing user that is viewing the underlying subject matter. According to another exemplary embodiment the privacy policy information may include a set of personal private keywords that identify subject matter that is considered personally private for a particular user e.g. based on the personal sensitivities of that user . For example multiple user specific privacy policies may exist where each user specific privacy policy identifies a set of personal private keywords specified by that user. Privacy policies may store a set of personal private keywords instead of or in addition to the set of global private keywords. Accordingly if the determination module determines that a particular user Arthur Smith is viewing a content item including the keyword Exercise and a privacy policy for Arthur Smith indicates that the word Exercise has been added as a personal private keyword then the determination module may determine that the privacy value associated with Arthur Smith viewing the content item is for example a high value even though Exercise may not be in the set of global private keywords . On the other hand if the determination module determines that a particular user Annabel Smith is viewing the same content item including the keyword Exercise and a privacy policy for Annabel Smith does not indicate that the word Exercise is a personal private keyword then the determination module may determine that the privacy value associated with Annabel Smith viewing the content item is for example a low value assuming Exercise is not in the set of global private keywords either .

According to various embodiments the determination module may determine the privacy value based on a topic associated with the content item being viewed. For example the determination module may access a privacy policy that lists topics perhaps in the format of the lookup table that represent subject matter classified as private. For example a privacy policy in the privacy policy information see lists the private topics Healthcare Romance and Adult as representing subject matter classified as private. Accordingly the determination module may access data included in a content item e.g. metadata or HTML code associated with the question page and determine any topics that the content item is associated with. For example with reference to the exemplary question page illustrated in the determination module will determine that the question page is associated with the topics Self teaching Sailing and Boats . If the determination module determines that the content item is associated with any of the private topics listed in the privacy policy information then the determination module may classify the content item as private and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a high value. On the other hand if the determination module determines that the content item is not associated with any of the private topics identified in the privacy policy information then the determination module may classify the content item as non private and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a low value.

According to various embodiments the private topics identified in for example the privacy policy information may represent a set of global private topics that identify subject matter that is considered globally private e.g. based on global sensitivities . Thus the determination module may determine that any viewing events of subject matter associated with global private topics are private regardless of the identity of the viewing user that is viewing the underlying subject matter. According to another exemplary embodiment the privacy policy information may include a set of personal private topics that identify subject matter that is considered personally private for a particular user e.g. based on the personal sensitivities of that user . For example multiple user specific privacy policies may exist where each user specific privacy policy identifies a set of personal private topics specified by that user. Privacy policies may store a set of personal private topics instead of or in addition to the set of global private topics. Accordingly if the determination module determines that a particular user Arthur Smith is viewing a content item associated with the topic Exercise and a privacy policy for Arthur Smith indicates that the topic Exercise has been added as a personal private topic then the determination module may determine that the privacy value associated with Arthur Smith viewing the content item is for example a high value even though Exercise may not be in the set of global private topics . On the other hand if the determination module determines that a particular user Annabel Smith is viewing the same content item associated with the topic Exercise and a privacy policy for Annabel Smith does not indicate that the topic Exercise is a personal private topic then the determination module may determine that the privacy value associated with Annabel Smith viewing the content item is for example a low value assuming Exercise is not in the set of global private topics either .

Accordingly consistent with various embodiments the determination module may determine the privacy value based on a content distribution channel see via which the user is notified of the content item. For example consider a case in which the user profile page is accessible by other users with accounts on the question and answer service and perhaps other users without accounts on the question and answer service in such case the contents of the user profile page including the information about users topics and questions being followed by the user may be considered public information. Accordingly a set of privacy rules in the privacy rule information may indicate that any question pages accessed directly from a personalized content feed such as personalized content feed of the user John Smith or a weekly digest e mail including similar content as the personalized content feed may be considered a non private viewing event. In other words publication of the fact that the user John Smith has viewed any of the questions accessed from the personalized content feed or a weekly digest e mail is likely not a disclosure of private information if the information included in the user John Smith s content feed or a weekly digest e mail is sourced from the topics questions and people already being followed by the user John Smith because such topics questions and people being followed is already public information identified in the user profile page of the user John Smith . For example publication of the fact that John Doe viewed a question page for a question Who are the best psychiatrists is likely not a disclosure of private information if John Doe is publicly following the topic Psychiatrists as indicated on his public profile page and if he accessed this question page because it was included in his personalized content feed. On the other hand if the user John Smith accesses a content item such as a question page for a question Who are the best psychiatrists directly e.g. by entering the URL of the question page directly into an address bar of a web browser the publication of this view may reveal private information about the browsing history of the user. As another example if the user John Smith accesses a content item such as a question page for a question Who are the best psychiatrists via browsing or surfing through various other webpages the publication of this view viewing may reveal private information about the browsing history of the user.

Accordingly consistent with various embodiments the determination module may determine the privacy value based on a content distribution channel see via which the user is notified of the content item. Examples of content distribution channels include content feeds weekly digests notifications emails text messages e.g. short message service or SMS messages multimedia messaging service or MMS messages etc. instant messages chat messages video chat messages video conferencing and so on. For example the determination module may access a privacy policy that lists content distribution channels perhaps in the format of the lookup table as being classified as either public or private. For example a privacy policy in the privacy policy information see indicates that information accessed via the content distribution channels of a content feed or e mail messages e.g. weekly digests are public whereas information accessed via the content distribution channel of notifications are private. Thus if the determination module determines that the viewer accessed the content item as a result of selecting a reference link included in a content feed or e mail message then the determination module may classify the content item as public and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a low value. On the other hand if the determination module determines that the viewer accessed the content item as a result of selecting a reference link included in a notification then the determination module may classify the content item as private and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a high value. An example of a content feed of the user John Smith is illustrated in .

According to various embodiments the determination module may determine the privacy value based on a previous content item viewed by the user before the user viewed the current content item where the user accessed the current content item from a reference link in the previous content item. For example the determination module may access a privacy policy that lists content items such as webpages or a webpage URLs perhaps in the format of the lookup table that are classified as either public or private. For example a privacy policy in the privacy policy information see indicates that content items accessed via a link included in a a content feed webpage or b a topic specific content feed webpage of a topic that a user is already following are public whereas content items accessed via links from any other webpages are private. Thus the determination module may access browsing history information of the viewing user in order to determine if the user is viewing a current content item e.g. question page as a result of selecting a reference link from one of the public webpages in the privacy policy information . For example if the determination module determines that the viewer accessed the content item as a result of selecting a reference link included in a content feed then the determination module may classify the content item as public and may therefore determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a low value. An example of a content feed of the user John Smith is illustrated in . On the other hand if the determination module determines that the viewer accessed the content item as a result of for example a entering the URL for the content item directly into an address location bar of a web browser b clicking on a link in a webpage other than one of the public webpages listed in the privacy policy information which may include miscellaneous browsing through various webpages and links e.g. clicking on the related questions in or c entering a search query into a search bar and clicking on one of the search results in a search results page then the determination module may determine that the privacy value associated with these viewing events is for example a high value.

According to various embodiments the determination module may determine the privacy value based on public interaction events between the user and the content item being viewed by the user. For example if the user takes some public action on the content item that is published to other users of the question and answer service such as posting the content item posting a response to the content item following the content item or voting on the content item then it can be inferred that the user s underlying viewing of the content item is not a private event. For example the determination module may access a privacy policy that lists interaction events perhaps in the format of the lookup table that are classified as either public or private. For example a privacy policy in the privacy policy information see indicates that interaction events involving a question e.g. question page such as posting the question posting an answer in response to the question following the question or a voting on the question are classified as public. For example if the determination module determines that the viewer performed any of the aforementioned public interaction events with the particular content item then the determination module may determine that the privacy value associated with the viewing of the content item in is for example a low value.

Information included in the privacy policy information of is merely illustrative and it is understood that any of the privacy policies are completely customizable and configurable. For example according to various exemplary embodiments the viewer publication system may provide a user interface allowing a user e.g. an administrator employee or user of the question and answer service to adjust any of the privacy policies as desired. Moreover privacy policy information may be generated on a per user basis based on settings requests or preferences of individual users.

According to various exemplary embodiments described in greater detail below the viewer publication system may generate metadata describing each viewing event. The metadata for a given viewing event may describe for example a viewing date time a location IP address of a device having a web browser through which the content item was viewed a location city state country etc. corresponding to the aforementioned IP address a name of the viewing user a link to the profile of the viewing user and a link to the content item viewed. According to various exemplary embodiments the metadata may also include privacy values associated with each viewing event. According to various exemplary embodiments the metadata may also include view reason information describing how for example the user accessed the viewed content item or how the user was notified of the content item.

Moreover according to various exemplary embodiments described in more detail below the viewer publication system may aggregate all metadata describing viewing events corresponding to a particular content item and associate this aggregated metadata with the content item. Thereafter the viewer publication system may display a views page that may be linked to the content item and that may list viewers of the content item where some of the viewers may be fully identified while other reviewers may be anonymized based on the privacy values and or view reasons associated with each viewer s interaction with the underlying content item. The views page may also describe how various viewers came upon that particular content item based on the view reason information included in the metadata describing each of the viewing events.

For example is a flowchart illustrating an example method according to various embodiments. The method may be performed at least in part by for example the viewer publication system illustrated in and are similar to and in the method illustrated in . For example in the determination module detects a viewing event corresponding to a user viewing a content item and in the determination module determines a privacy value associated with the viewing event that was detected in . The privacy value may indicate an inferred sensitivity of the user to publication of the viewing event that was detected in . In the metadata management module generates metadata describing the viewing event. In the metadata management module associates the metadata generated in with the content item that was viewed in . In the metadata management module generates a display via a user interface in a device such as the client computer illustrated in of a list of one or more viewers of a content item based on metadata associated with views of the content item such as the metadata generated in . According to various exemplary embodiments the operation in the method is optional. According to various other exemplary embodiments the operations and in the method are optional. Each of the aforementioned operations will now be described in greater detail.

After the determination module determines a privacy value associated with the viewing event in the metadata management module generates metadata describing the viewing event in . illustrates exemplary portions of metadata each of which describes an exemplary viewing event having a low privacy value. Each of the metadata portions includes for a given viewing event a viewing date time a location IP address of a device having a web browser through which the content item was viewed a location city state country etc. corresponding to the aforementioned IP address a name of the viewing user a link to the profile of the viewing user and a link to the content item viewed. Each of the metadata portions associated with a particular viewing event may also optionally include the privacy value associated with that event.

As illustrated in the metadata generated by the metadata management module may also optionally include a viewing reason or view reason information that identifies how the user was notified of the content item and or how the content item came to the user s attention. For example if the content item is the question page illustrated in and if the user accessed the question by accessing the link in the content feed then the view reason information may identify the user Joel Lewenstein. In other words the view reason information may identify another person followed by or connected to the user where the user became aware of the content or was led to the content via the other person. This view reason indicates that an entry with a reference link in the user s content feed notified the user of an interaction between the other person followed by the user and a content item and the user viewed the content item as a result of clicking the associated reference link in the content feed. An example of metadata generated by the metadata management module that describes such a viewing event is the metadata portion in which includes the view reason via Joel Lewenstein .

As another example if the content item viewed by the user is the question What is the weirdest looking fruit corresponding to the reference link in the content feed and if the user accessed this question page by accessing the link in the content feed then the view reason information may identify the topic Food. In other words the view reason information may identify a topic followed by or connected to the user where the user became aware of the content or was led to the content via the topic. This view reason indicates that an entry with a reference link in the user s content feed notified the user of an association between a content item and a topic followed by the user and the user viewed the content item as a result of clicking the associated reference link in the content feed. An example of metadata generated by the metadata management module that describes such a viewing event is the metadata portion in which includes the view reason via Food .

As another example if the content item viewed by the user is the question Music who are the best living classical pianists included in a Weekly Digest transmitted to the user and if the user accessed this question page by accessing a link in the Weekly Digest then the view reason information may identify the Weekly Digest. In other words the view reason information may identify a content distribution channel via which the user is notified of the content item. Examples of content distribution channels include content feeds weekly digests notifications emails text messages e.g. short message service or SMS messages multimedia messaging service or MMS messages etc. instant messages chat messages video chat messages video conferencing and so on. An example of metadata generated by the metadata management module that describes such a viewing event is the metadata portion in which includes the view reason via Weekly Digest .

As another example if the content item was viewed by the user while the user took some public action with respect to the content item e.g. posting the content item post a response to the content item following the content item or voting on the content item etc. then the view reason information may identify the question itself. An example of metadata generated by the metadata management module that describes such a viewing event is the metadata portion in which includes the view reason via the Question .

While the aforementioned metadata portions described viewing events having a low privacy value the metadata management module may also generate similar metadata portions for viewing events having high privacy values. For example illustrates metadata portions describing viewing events having high privacy values. As illustrated in each of the metadata portions includes privacy values as well as view reasons indicating how the user was notified of the content item how the content item came to the user s attention how the user accessed the content item etc. For example metadata portion includes a view reason of via Notification where the user was notified of the content item through a notification message transmitted to the user e.g. via the question and answer service and where the user accessed the content item by selecting a reference link to the content item included in the notification message. As another example metadata portion includes a view reason of via Direct URL Entry where the user accessed the content item by entering the URL for the content item directly into an address location bar of a web browser. As another example metadata portion includes a view reason of via Browsing Links where the user accessed the content item by selecting a link in a webpage e.g. other than one of the public webpages listed in the privacy policy information which may include miscellaneous browsing through various webpages and links e.g. clicking on the Related Questions in . As another example metadata portion includes a view reason of via Search Results where the user accessed the content item by entering a search query into a search bar e.g. a search bar of the question and answer service and clicking on one of the search results in a search results page. It is understood that the metadata portions in in are merely exemplary and the metadata generated by the metadata management module may include other information in addition to or instead of the information illustrated in in . For example the metadata generated by the metadata management module does not need to include the privacy value or view reason information.

Referring back to the method in in the metadata management module associates the metadata generated in with the content item. For example the metadata management module may store the metadata describing the viewing event in association with stored metadata associated with the content item e.g. user generated content stored in database illustrated in . The association may also include inserting into the metadata describing the viewing event a link to the content item see . The association may also include inserting into metadata associated with the content item a reference link to the metadata describing the viewing event.

In of the metadata management module generates a display via a user interface in a device such as the client computer illustrated in of a views page associated with the particular content item that includes a list of viewers of the content item. The views page may be generated based on metadata associated with views of the content item such as the metadata generated by the metadata management module in . According to various exemplary embodiments the views page may also describe how various viewers came upon that particular content item based on the view reason information included in the metadata describing each of the viewing events.

According to various exemplary embodiments some of the viewers may be fully identified while other viewers may be anonymized based on the privacy values associated with each viewer s interaction with the underlying content item. For example if a viewing event performed by a particular user has a low privacy value as indicated by the privacy value included in the metadata describing that viewing event as depicted in then the views page may include identification information of the user e.g. user name and the view reason information associated with the viewing event based on the metadata describing that viewing event. For example illustrates an example of a views page associated with the question page illustrated in . The views page may be displayed in response to user selection of the user interface element e.g. a reference link in the question page . In the views page the identification of the user John Smith is generated based on the metadata portion in in a case where the user John Smith viewed the question page after clicking on the link in the personalized content feed see . Thus the identification includes identification information of the user John Smith and the view reason via Joel Lewenstein for this viewing event based on the metadata portion in . On the other hand if a viewing event performed by a given user has a high privacy value as indicated by the privacy value included in the metadata describing that viewing event as illustrated in then the views page may simply list an anonymous user e.g. visitor . As illustrated in the view reason information itself may also be omitted from the listings for anonymous users such as the anonymous user listing . Alternatively it is possible that the views page may include the view reason information in the listings for anonymous users.

Referring back to note that various ones of operations may be omitted or re arranged according to various non limiting embodiments. For example illustrates a method A according to an exemplary non limiting embodiment where the method A is a variation of the method of . In the method A the operation may occur at any time between operations and . Likewise the operations and may also occur at any time between operations and . In other words the operation may occur before simultaneously or after operation and or operation . This is because the operations and may not be dependent on the operation and or because the operation may not be dependent on the operations and according to various non limiting embodiments.

As described above the determination of whether viewers should be fully identified or anonymized in the views page may be made based on privacy values. According to various exemplary embodiments the determination of whether viewers should be fully identified or anonymized in the views page may instead or in addition be made based on the view reason information included in the metadata describing a viewing event. For example this may be the case when metadata portions describing viewing events do not include privacy values therein. The metadata management module may access a set of rules or policies indicating that viewing events associated with specific types of view reasons should be fully identified in the views page such as views page illustrated in whereas viewing events associated with other specific types of view reasons should be anonymized in the views page.

According to various exemplary embodiments described above the metadata management module may generate the identification information and or the view reason information for inclusion in metadata describing the viewing event see in regardless of whether the privacy value associated with the viewing event is high or low. According to other exemplary embodiments the generation of the metadata in may be controlled or adjusted based on the privacy value determined in . For example if the determination module determines that the privacy value associated with the viewing event is low indicating that the user has a low inferred sensitivity to the publication of the viewing event then the metadata management module may generate metadata that includes identification information that identifies the user and or viewing reason information that indicates how the viewing user came across that particular portion of content how the user was notified of the content how the content came to the user s attention etc. Examples of identification information are name username screen name telephone number e mail address street address etc. Examples of metadata generated by the metadata management module that describes such viewing events are the metadata portions in . On the other hand if the determination module determines that the privacy value associated with a viewing event is high the metadata management module may refrain from including the identification information and or the view reason information in metadata describing the viewing event. An example of metadata generated by the metadata management module that describes such a viewing event is the metadata portion in which does not include identification information of the user and does not include a view reason.

In in the metadata management module generates metadata describing the viewing event that was detected in . The metadata generated in may include the view reason information determined in . Examples of metadata describing viewing events and including view reason information associated with each of the viewing events is illustrated in . According to various exemplary embodiments described elsewhere in this disclosure the metadata management module may also generate privacy values associated with the viewing events and include such privacy values in the metadata. According to various other exemplary embodiments the metadata management module need not generate privacy values and the metadata generated by the metadata management module in need not include privacy values. In the metadata management module associates the metadata generated in with the content item that was viewed in .

In the metadata management module generates a display via a user interface in a device such as the client computer illustrated in of a views page with a list of one or more viewers of a content item based on metadata associated with views of the content item such as the metadata generated in . The views page may also describe how the identified viewers came upon that particular content item. An example of a views page indicating a list of one or more viewers of the content item and associated view reasons is illustrated in . According to an exemplary embodiment the views page may include a list of all the viewers and associated view reasons of the content item.

According to another exemplary embodiment some of the viewers and or view reasons may be anonymized or eliminated from the views page based on the view reason information included in the metadata describing the viewing event. For example the metadata management module may access a set of rules or policies indicating that viewing events associated with specific types of view reasons should be fully identified in the views page such as views page illustrated in whereas viewing events with other specific types of view reasons should be removed from the views page or have anonymous viewers listed . According to various exemplary embodiments the operation in the method is optional.

According to various exemplary embodiments the metadata management module is configured to display a viewership summary page. For example each content author of the question and answer service may generate one or more questions by for example posting question pages such as the question page illustrated in . Accordingly the metadata management module may display a page summarizing all the viewers of all the question pages hosted by a single content author. For example illustrates a viewership summary page that identifies all the viewers that have viewed the various content items authored by a particular content author. As illustrated in the viewership summary page may organize the viewers based on the timing of the view such as for example in the past week or the past month . For each viewer the viewership summary identifies the content item viewed by the viewer and view reason information describing how the viewer was notified of the specific content item or how the viewer accessed the specific content item. The generation of view reason information is described elsewhere in this disclosure.

According to various exemplary embodiments the viewership summary page can also display other types of statistical information demographic information or analytic information based on the view reason information included in the metadata describing each viewing event e.g. see metadata portions in . For example illustrates another example of a viewership summary page displaying a chart that illustrates the percentage of all of the views of a particular content author s content that can be attributed to a particular view reason. For example as seen in the chart it can be seen that a large percentage of views came from the topic of Physics in comparison to a relatively small percentage of views that came via the topic of Math. Similarly it can be seen that a relatively large percentage of views came via the user Jane Doe in comparison to a relatively small percentage of views that came via the user John Smith. Similarly it can be seen that a relatively large percentage of views came via Browsing in comparison to a smaller percentage of views that came via Search Results and an even smaller percentage of views that came via Direct URL Entry and so forth.

Moreover illustrates another example of a viewership summary page that includes a chart illustrating the percentage of all the views of a particular content author s content that can be attributed to public views or private views e.g. view events associated with low privacy values or high privacy values as described elsewhere in this disclosure . Moreover illustrates another example of a viewership summary page that includes a chart illustrating the percentage of all of the public views of a particular content author s content that can be attributed to a particular view reason. Moreover illustrates another example of a viewership summary page that includes a chart illustrating the percentage of all of the private views of a particular content author s content that can be attributed to a particular view reason.

Moreover while the viewership summary pages depicted in illustrate information regarding all the views of a single content author s content the viewer publication system of this disclosure can generate similar viewership summary pages based on a views for content associated with a set of one or more authors owners users e.g. a set of authors owners users having a common demographic or biographic characteristic b views for content associated with one or more specific topics c views for content associated with one or more specific keywords d views for a single piece of content or any combination thereof etc.

Thus based on the statistical and analytic data included in the various viewership summaries described herein users can better understand how various viewers are being led to various content items. For example specific users or topics can be identified as hubs or channels within an information network or knowledge repository such as the question and answer service if many viewers are viewing a particular type of content via these users or topics. This provides content authors with valuable information for generating and promoting content. For example content can be generated promoted and targeted at specific topics or specific users in order to maximize the number of viewers of the content or in order to reach specific kinds of viewers etc.

In the metadata management module generates a display via a user interface in a device such as the client computer illustrated in of the viewership summary based on the metadata aggregated in . Examples of viewership summary pages are illustrated in . The metadata management module may also filter the information included in the viewership summary based on the time of each view. For example as illustrated in different portions of the viewership summary may be generated based on metadata portions see and having a viewing date time field that falls within a predetermined time interval.

While various embodiments of this disclosure describe content items posted on a question and answer service such as question content items answer content items content feeds profile pages topics and so on it is understood that the techniques described in various embodiments are not limited to such exemplary content items. For example the techniques described in various embodiments throughout are applicable to various types of online and offline content including webpages websites blogs bulletin boards discussion forums posts reviews articles publications presentations profile pages news feeds content feeds etc. where such content items may be distributed or disseminated in any online or offline format via any online or offline distribution or delivery channel including electronic communications such as e mails text messages such as short message service SMS text messages or multimedia messaging service MMS text messages instant messages chat messages video chat messages video conferencing and so on.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied 1 on a non transitory machine readable medium or 2 in a transmission signal or hardware implemented modules. A hardware implemented module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware implemented module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware implemented module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily or transitorily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware implemented modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware implemented modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware implemented module at a different instance of time.

Hardware implemented modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware implemented modules. Accordingly the described hardware implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware implemented modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware implemented modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware implemented modules have access. For example one hardware implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware implemented module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. Application Program Interfaces APIs . 

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard or a touch sensitive display screen a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine readable media include non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a communications network using a transmission medium. The instructions may be transmitted using the network interface device and any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP . Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet mobile telephone networks Plain Old Telephone POTS networks and wireless data networks e.g. WiFi and WiMax networks .
