title: Automated transient image cytometry
abstract: A method, system, and instrument for automatically measuring transient activity in cells uses image time sequences to identify transients in cells. Preferably, the transient activity is stimulated or provoked in synchronism with acquisition of the image time sequences. A cell mask is applied to each image of an image time sequence in order to localize the transient activity with respect to each cell. Localization enables cell-by-cell analysis of properties of the transient activity.

The field is processes systems and instruments for automatically measuring transient activity in cells using image sequences. More specifically the field includes use of image cytometry to automatically measure calcium transients in cardiomyocytes.

Automated image cytometry is increasingly used in high content screening HCS to automatically measure characteristics of objects in magnified images of cellular material. Typically an automated image cytometry system includes tools to perform analysis of images and analysis of data acquired from the images. Image analysis may include staining material with one or more dyes each selected to bind with a particular structure or component of the material. For example samples in a multi well screening experiment related to obesity may be stained with one dye that binds specifically with cell nuclei a second dye that binds specifically with cell cytoplasm and a third dye that binds with lipid droplets. Magnified images of well contents may be selectively processed according to color in order to classify image objects such as nuclei cell perimeters and lipid droplets. Once classification is complete data may be extracted from the classification results in order to quantify various properties of the objects. See for example the related US publication 2008 0144895 A1.

Heart failure due to hypertension infarction or other factors is a leading killer of men and women in modern society and involves at its base a debilitating loss of cardiomyocytes. Encouraging recent studies indicate the feasibility of regenerating lost cardiomyocytes for example by transplanting embryonic stem cell derived cardiac myocytes ESCMs or mobilizing resident stem cells. To realize the potential of stem cell based therapies it would be extremely beneficial to develop technology and instruments for high throughput high content screening HCS of drugs and genes for their ability to stimulate the formation of functional contractile cardiomyocytes.

The contractile cycle of cardiomyocytes shown in adapted from Donald M. Bers Cardiac excitation contraction coupling Vol 415 pp 198 205 2002 is divided into an abrupt shortening phase systole induced by a rapid rise in the intracellular calcium concentration Ca due to calcium entry via voltage dependent L type calcium channels and calcium induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum SR . Contraction is followed by relaxation of the cell diastole and the decline of Ca . Decline of Ca during diastole is controlled primarily by re sequestration of calcium back into the SR by SERCA2 an ATPase associated with the SR membrane.

Calcium transients have been recorded from cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem cells both from mouse and from human . For example calcium transients in fura 2 loaded cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells hESC CM were observed in spontaneously contracting embryoid bodies K. Dolnikov et al. Functional Properties of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Derived Cardiomyocytes 1047 pp 66 75 2005 . hESC CMs cultured on mouse visceral endoderm like cells showed similar calcium transients and spontaneous contractions at 0.6 to 1.5 Hz Mummery et al. Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells to Cardiomyocytes Circulation. 107 pp 2733 2740 2003 . Fluo 4 a fluorescent dye has been used to record calcium transients from murine ESCMs which exhibited spontaneous contraction rates of approximately 1 Hz Grey et al. Fine tuning in Ca homeostasis underlies progression of cardiomyopathy in myocytes derived from genetically modified embryonic stem cells 14 10 pp 1367 1377 2005 . Consistent with the wide spread observation of spontaneous beating in experiments designed to elicit the appearance of ESCMs myocytes with pace maker activity have been observed in contracting cell clusters serving to drive the contractions of neighboring cells Mery et al. Initiation of Embryonic Cardiac Pacemaker Activity by Inositol 1 4 5 Trisphosphate dependent Calcium Signaling 16 5 pp 2414 23 2005 . These studies indicate that ESCMs typically exhibit calcium transients and contractile characteristics similar to neonatal rat ventricular myocytes NRVMs rather than adult cardiomyocytes.

Automated high content screens allow for a wealth of information to be gathered from a given experimental study. If the hardware and controlling software are present researchers may be able to fine tune hardware performance to directly match their experimental needs. Unfortunately this is not always the case and researchers are usually forced to either tweak their experimental design or are required to build customized tools to conduct their experiments. Thus it would be extremely desirable to be able to record Ca transients on a cell by cell basis in a manner that is easily integrated into current laboratory setups. A desirable Calcium Transient Image Cytometer CTIC would interface easily into available high content microscopy workstations which already perform multi well plate scanning and image acquisition to enable video burst acquisition and analysis of calcium transients in a fully automated high throughput screening mode. It is desirable that the CTIC electrically stimulate or pace the cells record the resulting Ca transients from cells in microtiter plates e.g. with 96 wells and automatically quantify characteristics such as the duration of the Ca waves on a cell by cell basis in a fully automated manner on large scale screens e.g. tens to hundreds of thousands of compounds .

A method system and instrument for automatically measuring transient activity in cells uses image time sequences to identify transients in cells. Preferably the transient activity is stimulated or provoked in synchronism with acquisition of the image time sequences. A cell mask is applied to each image of an image time sequence in order to localize the transient activity with respect to each cell. Localization enables cell by cell analysis of properties of the transient activity.

in order to obtain information about a transient event like the contractile cycle of cardiomyocytes on a cell by cell basis in an automated image cytometry system a video stream constituted of time sequenced magnified images is acquired and an averaged image is obtained from averages of all images in the video stream. The averaged image is segmented to obtain a cell periphery mask. A set of transient data for each cell is obtained by applying the mask to each image of the video stream. For example but without limiting the scope of application presume a video stream of magnified images is obtained which is constituted of a time series sequence of frames containing magnified images of the same field of view showing cells marked with a dye bound to elements active in a transient event. For example presume that the time series sequence includes magnified images of fluo 4 loaded cardiac myocytes. With reference to the time series sequence of frames includes images A and B among other images. Image A is a raw image of NRVMs prior to stimulation of a Ca transient by application of an electrical signal low Ca dim fluo 4 . Image B is an image with the same field of view as Image A but later in time immediately after stimulation when Ca is high and fluo 4 is bright. All of the images in the video stream are averaged to obtain the averaged image denoted as Image C. Using known algorithms cell periphery masks are segmented from the averaged image. The segmented masks are illustrated in Image D wherein each cell mask is labeled with a unique gray scale intensity for illustration of this description.

Once a cell periphery mask is generated it is applied to each image in the time series sequence of images at the location of the cell it represents and the fluo 4 intensity within the mask is measured and recorded. As per showing tabular recording of intensity data for illustration only each row in the table represents a frame or image in the video sequence where an image is obtained and each column represents a cell. Thus each data entry in a column represents the fluo 4 intensity I of the corresponding cell at a particular time of a Ca transient.

The intensity data points for a cell may be processed by known means to yield corresponding transient magnitude points which in turn may be used to plot a Ca transient for the cell. Transients plotted using such data points are shown in for a control NRVM and for a NRVM maintained in 100 nM thyroid hormone. The transients are normalized to their minimum 0 and maximum values 100 . Kinetic parameters which may be derived from the transients include Full Width at Half Max FWHM which is the time required for progression from the 50 point on the upstroke to 50 point on the downstroke T which is the time from the 50 point to 100 on the upstroke and T which is the time period from the 100 point to the 50 point on the decay phase.

An instrument illustrated in the schematic block diagram of may be used to acquire one or more video streams for processing images as illustrated in . The instrument includes a robotic inverted microscope outfitted for fluorescent microscopy. The microscope has an objective and a mechanical stage adapted to support a multi well plate or dish. Conventional stage control mechanization causes the mechanical stage to be moved in three dimensions. The stage control mechanization causes the mechanical stage to move in a predetermined pattern to bring wells of a multi well plate or dish into position in the field of view of the microscope objective when a well is positioned in the field of view of the objective the stage control mechanization moves the stage vertically for autofocus the autofocus position is held while a video clip is obtained. The mechanical stage is conventionally adapted to support a multi well plate or dish for being moved with respect to the field of view of the objective . Such a plate may be one constructed with a transparent bottom so that the contents of its wells are visible to the objective . For example a glass bottomed 96 well plate may be used.

When transient activity analysis requiring stimulation of well contents is to be conducted the instrument of may be further adapted to accommodate the requirement. Such accommodation may support stimulation of well contents by light pressure electrical potential material and so on. In addition a multi well plate may be adapted to couple such stimulation to its wells. For example it may be desirable to stimulate cells by application of an electrical voltage. In this case the instrument of may be adapted by provision of a coupling electrode assembly mounted on a moveable arm that moves the coupling electrode assembly vertically with respect to the objective . Control mechanization for positioning the coupling electrode assembly may be conventional. That is to say a control mechanization for positioning the moveable arm to which the coupling electrode assembly is mounted may include for example a motor and a control routine for operating the motor to move the arm when the coupling electrode assembly is to be raised or lowered. The coupling electrode assembly includes electrically conductive electrodes and disposed in a spaced parallel relationship. A stimulator applies a voltage across the electrodes and and a polarity reverser reverses the polarity of the voltage. In some aspects the stimulator and polarity reverser are constructed to operate in response to a controller by causing the electrodes and to deliver one or more shaped stimulus signals. In some aspects the shaped stimulus signals may be pulses preferably rectangular in shape of electrical voltage.

The instrument of may couple electrical stimulation to the contents of wells in a multi well plate or dish by moving the electrodes and into and out of each well positioned in the field of view of the objective . However the electrodes might have to be cleaned after being withdrawn from a well so as not to contaminate the contents of the next well. According to an alternate embodiment each well may be provided with a set of electrodes that are adapted to couple to the electrodes and so that no set of electrodes enters more than a single well. This solution is illustrated in by a lid for a multi well plate or dish. In this regard a lid seats on the top of the glass bottomed 96 well plate . The lid has multiple pairs of lid electrodes mounted to it each pair being positioned to extend into a respective well when the lid is seated on the top of the plate . The lid electrode pairs extend fully into their respective wells and protrude above the lid preferably they are flexible electrically conductive elements and may be retained in place at least partially by spring loading. The electrodes of each pair of lid electrodes are retained by the lid in the spaced parallel relationship of the electrodes and so that when a well is positioned in the field of view of the objective the electrodes and are longitudinally aligned with the lid electrode pair for that well. Lowering the coupling electrode assembly carries the electrodes and into electrical contact with the lid electrode pair of the positioned well raising the assembly carries the electrodes and out of contact and permits the plate to be repositioned. In some aspects the electrodes and may include respective end receptacles A and A shaped to facilitate coupling to lid electrode pairs. For example the end receptacle of each coupling electrode may be shaped with a wide mouth and an internal tapered cone to capture and make electrical contact with flexible and spring loaded lid electrode tips that protrude above the lid.

In the automated instrumentation system is constructed and programmed to perform automated image processing image data management and image data analysis operations of HCS and or HTS systems. For example the instrumentation system may be or may reside in or may be associated with a microscopy system including the microscope with the motorized automatically moveable stage on which a carrier with biological material may be disposed for observation by way of the microscope . The carrier may be the multi well plate discussed above whose wells are disposed in a two dimensional array. For example and without limitation the multi well plate may be a ninety six well micro titer plate in each well of which there is biological material that has been cultured activated fixed and stained. A light source provides illumination for operation of the microscope by way of an optical filter and a fiber optic cable . The moveable stage may be intermittently or continuously moved to enable the acquisition of one or more video streams each constituted of a time series sequence of magnified images. Images in the field of view of the objective are directed by mirrors and lenses to a high resolution digital camera . The camera obtains and buffers video streams and transfers them on an interface to a processor . The interface may be for example and without limitation a universal serial bus USB .

The frames of each video stream are constituted of digital images which may be provided in some standard format comprising an N M array of pixels to the processor . The processor receives the digital images and stores them in image files. The digital images are processed by the processor and output digital images may be provided by the processor for display on an output device with a display .

With further reference to the processor may be a programmed general purpose digital processor having a standard architecture such as a computer work station. The processor includes a processing unit CPU that communicates with a number of peripheral devices by way of a bus subsystem . The peripheral devices include a memory subsystem MEMORY a file storage subsystem FILE user interface devices USER an input device INPUT and an interface device INTERFACE . It is not necessary that the processor be connected directly to the microscope it may receive images produced by the camera from a portable storage device or by way of a local or wide area network. For example images may be transported to the processor over the internet.

The bus subsystem includes media devices ports protocols and procedures that enable the processing unit and the peripheral devices and to communicate and transfer data. Instrumentation such as is illustrated in may also be coupled to the bus subsystem by a conventional instrumentation interface. The bus subsystem provides generally for the processing unit and peripherals to be collocated or dispersed

The memory subsystem includes read only memory ROM for storage of one or more programs of instructions that implement a number of functions and processes. One of the programs is an automated image process for processing a magnified image of biological material to identify one or more components of an image. The memory subsystem also includes random access memory RAM for storing instructions and results during process execution. The RAM is used by the automated image process for storage of images generated as the process executes. The file storage subsystem provides non volatile storage for program data and image files and may include any one or more of a hard drive floppy drive CD ROM and equivalent devices

The user interface devices include interface programs and input and output devices supporting a graphical user interface GUI for entry of data and commands initiation and termination of processes and routines and for output of prompts requests screens menus data images and results.

The input device enables the processor to receive digital images directly from the camera or from another source such as a portable storage device or by way of a local or wide area network. The interface device enables the processor to connect to and communicate with other local or remote processors computers servers clients nodes and networks. For example the interface device may provide access to an output device by way of a local or global network .

The acquisition of one or more video streams in step of is illustrated in more detail in which is explained with reference to the instrument of . At the mechanical stage is moved to place a well in the field of view of the objective . At the electrodes and are lowered to provide a stimulus signal to the well. Using the stained nuclei of cells in the well an autofocus process adjusts the mechanical stage vertically to a best focus position where the contents of the well are best focused by the objective . Then at with best focus established a first filter is utilized to allow the objective to image cell nuclei and a nuclear image is acquired and stored. At using a second filter to establish a channel of interest the camera shutter is operated to start acquisition of a video stream constituted of a time series sequence of magnified images of objects in the well s contents. In this regard the channel of interest may be associated with or determined by the color of objects viewed through the second filter. Immediately thereafter at a stimulus signal is applied to the well in order to initiate transient activity in cells contained in the well. A time series sequence of images of the cells including those cells exhibiting transient activity is captured in the ongoing video stream. After a predetermined amount of time sufficient to capture the transient event the camera shutter is operated to cease acquisition. At the electrodes are retracted and the time series sequence of images is stored for later processing. At as long as there is another from which to acquire a video stream the process repeats otherwise the process ends.

After acquiring a time series sequence of images of the contents of a well the system initiates cell mask generation as per . At a time series average image per is obtained using the channel of interest. At the nuclear image for the well is segmented and the segmented nuclear image is used with the time series average image to obtain cell masks at . Generation of cell masks may be done using a known technique such as a watershed algorithm.

After acquiring cell masks for a time series sequence of images of the contents of a well the system initiates cytometric analysis as per . At the cell masks are applied to each frame of the time series sequence of images and total and average intensity magnitudes for each cell are obtained at using the cell masks. At the system may produce a plot showing average channel intensity versus time for each cell in the well as illustrated in .

Methods and apparatuses for practicing these teachings may be constituted in whole or in part of a program product with a computer readable storage medium network and or node that enables a computer a processor a fixed or scalable set of resources a network service or any equivalent programmable real and or virtual entity to execute an automated transient image cytometry process as described and illustrated above. The program product may include a portable medium suitable for temporarily or permanently storing a program of software instructions that may be read compiled and executed by a computer a processor or any equivalent article. For example the program product may include a programmed CD such as is seen in or a network accessible site node center or any equivalent article.

Cultured NRVMs were utilized according to the description and illustrations above to obtain the images of and the plots of . These can be prepared quickly as opposed to the more lengthy culturing required for ESCMs . The cultured NRVMs respond to electrical stimulation a Ca transient accompanied by a contractile twitch. The contractile calcium transients are transient elevations in intracellular calcium which can be tracked via use of intracellular fluorescent calcium indicators e.g. Fluo 3 and Fluo 4 and digital fluorescence microscopy technology as represented by the EIDAQ 100 Q3DM San Diego Calif. modified to obtain and process video streams as illustrated in . An instrument designed to electrically stimulate record and quantify contractile calcium transients from NRVMs cultured in 96 well dishes should be capable of recording electrically stimulated contractile calcium transients in cultures of embryonic stem cells to provide a definitive readout of the stage of differentiation towards cardiomyocytes. That is we hypothesize that different stages of differentiation will be characterized by measurement differences in the Ca transients of these beating cells. The instrument will also likely be useful for testing compounds on NRVMs or cardiac myocytes from other sources in a high throughput manner for potential negative or positive inotropic effects or for arrhythmic effects.

The NRVMs were cultured in 96 well dishes Nunc coverslip glass bottom plates pretreated with 1 gelatin that was cross linked with glutaraldehyde to improve cell adherence.

Sensitivity to intracellular calcium kinetics is a desirable goal for automated calcium transient image cytometry because it is desirable to distinguish healthy contractile ESCMs from background non contractile stem cells. To test this sensitivity contractile calcium transients were quantified in two populations of NRVMs NRVMs exposed to control media vs. media supplemented with 100 nM thyroid hormone T3 which is known to increase the expression of SERCA2 leading to more rapid calcium re uptake and overall accelerated kinetics of the contractile calcium transients . Thus for all NRVMs preparations half of the wells contained control medium DMEM F12 with 0.25 FBS and the remainder included the same media supplemented with T3. The cells were maintained 48 to 72 hrs prior to scanning. On the day of scanning the cells were incubated with a 3 M solution of the acetyoxymethylester form of an intracellular calcium indicator either Fluo 4 AM or Fluo 3 AM in the base media for 25 minutes. The plasma membrane permeable to the acetoxymethylester forms of Fluo 3 and Fluo 4 which are modified intracellularly by esterases to an impermeable form. The loading solution was also supplemented with 200 ng ml Hoechst 33342 to label DNA within the nuclei. This concentration of Hoechst provides adequate label of the nuclei and was non toxic under these conditions. Thus the labeling procedure introduced a green fluorescence channel fluorescent calcium indicator into the cytoplasm of the NRVMs Fluo 4 and a blue fluorescence channel nuclear stain Hoechst . The nuclear channel was used for autofocus at each well additionally images obtained of the nuclei provided information regarding cellular position that was helpful in assigning boundaries between cells in the segmentation procedure applied to the green channel images. Following loading cells were placed in 150 l of HEPES buffered physiological saline Tyrodes solution supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 2 mM calcium chloride.

This example is merely illustrative and is not intended to limit the application of the principles set forth above to automated measurement and analysis of calcium transients in cardiomyocytes. Other applications may include stem cell cardiac myocytes derived from stem cells both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells neurons pancreatic beta cells adrenal cells and PC12 cells which are neuronal like but derived from the adrenals . In addition to electric signals stimuli to provoke transient response may include chemicals e.g. potassium chloride calcium channel activators e.g. BayK8644 pressure light and sound. Other transients to be measured may include membrane potential across the plasma membrane membrane potential across the mitochondrial membrane intracellular sodium and intracellular potassium.

Exemplary systems which can be used in the practice of the detailed description given above include the high content screening system the EIDAQ 100 Q3DM San Diego Calif. which is functionally identical to the later released Beckman Coulter IC 100.
