This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 272 341 entitled WAGERING GAME WITH AN AWARD BASED ON SUB GAME OUTCOMES AND METHOD filed on Nov. 17 2008 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention is directed to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods and more particularly to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods having adjustable multi part indicia.

In the prior art various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays lighted displays or sound effects to capture a player s interest in a gaming device.

Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards such as cash or prizes. For example in some slot machines the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel thereby allowing for multiple line betting. Feature games of various types have been employed to reward players above the amounts normally awarded on a standard game pay schedule. Generally such feature games are triggered by predetermined events such as one or more appearances of certain combinations of indicia in a primary game. In order to stimulate interest feature games are typically set to occur at a gaming machine on a statistical cycle based upon the number of primary game plays.

Some gaming machine games today include one or more progressive prize awards. In some configurations the progressive prize may have a small probability of a player winning it thus making it possible to have a larger progressive prize. In other game configurations the progressive prize may be a small amount thus allowing the player patron to win the progressive prize more frequently. In most typical game configurations the player wins the progressive prize as a result of a specific game outcome within the primary or main game.

While gaming machines including feature games and progressive prizes have been very successful there remains a need for games that provide a player with enhanced excitement and increased opportunity of winning

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention a gaming machine includes a processor operatively coupled to a set of player operable controls and a plurality of sub games from one or more of a reel game wheel game bingo game poker game or keno game one or more of which may be enabled by the processor in accordance with the player operable controls. Each enabled sub game includes a sub game outcome associated with a set of possible sub game awards. A payout device pays at least one meta game award distinct from the sub game awards the meta game award based on at least one of the sub game outcomes. A theoretical hold percentage of the meta game is maintained by altering the probability of the sub game outcomes associated with the meta game award based on the number of sub games enabled for play.

Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the various embodiments.

Various embodiments are directed to a game gaming machine gaming networks and method for playing a game wherein the game includes adjustable multi part indicia. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown illustrative examples of games gaming machines gaming networks and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the invention.

An example game in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention is shown in . Referring to a primary or meta game is implemented using nine three reel spinning mini games . Each mini game or sub game has at least one pay line pattern passing through one indicium on each of its three reels. For example pay line extends horizontally through the center position of each of the three reels of mini game . The number of pay lines and their patterns are by way of example only and may vary.

The player selects the number of mini games to play and the number of credits or coins wagered on each mini game using touch screen controls or gaming device control buttons. In one embodiment for example the player may touch each mini game he wishes to play in order to activate it. In the example shown in mini games and are not activated and may be activated by touching them. In another embodiment the player may press a quick pick button not shown to randomly enable mini games for play until a player chosen number of mini games have been enabled. In yet another embodiment controls may allow the player to easily enable and wager on a predetermined number of games for example Play 5 games at 2 credits per game. 

The player s selections are displayed on games selected meter per game bet meter and TOTAL BET meter located which may be located in a dashboard on the game display or otherwise displayed for example on LED meters adjacent the display. Win PAID meter and CREDITS meter provide the player with information about the amount paid by the last game played and the total number of credits available for play. The player may collect the balance of his credits by pressing CASH OUT button .

The player initiates game play by pressing games selected meter which in this example also serves as a touch screen start button. In some embodiments the player may simultaneously select and start all games at the maximum number of coins or credits allowed per game by pressing a MAX BET button not shown . Buttons see on gaming machine or touch screen buttons similar to button may be used to perform the actions described here without deviating from the scope of the invention. The reels of mini games are made to spin and stop in predetermined stop positions. In one or more embodiments the sub games spin simultaneously. In other embodiments each sub game spins and stops prior to the start of the next sub game or may partially overlap the prior sub game s play. In another embodiment all sub games may spin and be stopped on demand by way of a player control. Once the sub games are completed a determination is then made whether the stop positions of the reels resulted in a winning game outcome for each of the mini games.

The player may view a pay table associated with the primary or individual mini games on the primary game display by way of PAYS touch screen button or a similar electromechanical button. In alternate embodiments the pay table may be presented on a second video or printed display attached to the gaming device i.e. display or pay glass . A winning combination for example could be two or more symbols adjacent to one another on an active pay line. For each winning combination the game device awards the player the award in the pay table adjusted as necessary based on the number of credits wagered on the mini game pay line on which the win occurred. For example three TRIPLE BLAZING 7 symbols adjacent to one another from left to right on an active pay line in games might pay 300 times the player s wager.

In one or more embodiments each mini game may have a different game title and or pay table or some or all mini games may share common pay tables. In for example games share a common title and pay table while games share a second common title and pay table. In another embodiment the player is allowed to cycle through a list of possible game titles for each mini game by for example touching an icon representing the mini game title in a particular row or column. In some embodiments selection of a new game title by pressing the icon or otherwise choosing a new mini game title may change a group of mini games to a common title for a corresponding row or column.

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention a special slot symbol has certain probabilities of appearing on the middle reel of each of the mini games. The player may be awarded a primary game or meta game award based on the number of mini games showing this symbol on their pay line as part of their outcomes. The award may be a certain number of credits a certain number of free games or any other prize according to a pay table such as pay table . In some embodiments the awards may include multipliers 

In one or more embodiments the prizes for feature game play may be set amounts i.e. non progressive. In some embodiments the algorithms to determine the amounts may be determined by a statistical percentage based on an average take of a gaming machine and the likelihood of the win over a period of time. In the case where one or more gaming machines are networked a common award table may be utilized where the award algorithms are determined based on an average take total wagers of all the networked gaming machines and the likelihood of a win of an award over a period of time. Each award may be calculated in a similar manner based on the likelihood of a winning outcome being achieved during a game play session.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention progressive prizes such as those shown in pay table may be awarded. The progressive prizes may be calculated by a progressive controller such as a controller manufactured by Mikohn Inc. The progressive controller monitors wagering during base game play calculates a current value for one or more progressive jackpot pools and transmits the current pool values to the gaming machine. In one or more embodiments progressive awards are accumulated during regular play as a percentage such as three percent of the game play take. The prizes may be sized according to the preferences of the casino operator. The number of prizes may vary without deviating from the scope of the invention. The size of the prizes is dependent on the amount of play prior to initiating feature play and may come from the contributions of a single gaming machine or a number of linked gaming machines. In another aspect the prizes may be set amounts established by the casino operator from non coin in funds such as marketing funds.

In one or more embodiments the prizes for feature game play may be accumulated based on funding mechanisms other than a percentage of wagers accumulated by the gaming machine. For example an operator may initially fund various award pools with a pre determined amount of money such as 1000 for one progressive 500 for a second progressive 100 for a third progressive and so on. Subsequently the casino operator may determine to increase the amounts of one or more of the awards at pre determined times which may be periodically or randomly selected with a range of times or periods. Once a winner has occurred at any level the award levels may be rolled back to their initial funding amount. In one or more embodiments only the winning award level is rolled back to the initial funding amount.

In accordance with other embodiments the primary game includes a plurality of wagering mini games of any type and title. While the example of illustrates nine three reel slot machine reel mini games arranged in three rows and three columns the style of game and the number of rows and columns may vary. For example in one embodiment twelve five reel slot games are arranged in three rows and four columns. In an alternate embodiment the mini games include one or more types of game such as slots poker bingo keno and wheel games or the like. The player is allowed to play all or any subset of the available mini games. At the conclusion of the mini games the collective outcome of the mini games may result in a meta game or primary game award. In one or more embodiments the player may play the mini games but eligibility to receive any additional meta game award s may be based on the player s total wager amount or whether the player placed an additional meta game side bet whether the player has maintained a particular rate of play or any other eligibility criteria which may be established by the rules of the game.

In some embodiments the meta game or primary game award is the result of one or more winning mini game outcomes. For example a primary game pay line including mini game pay lines and may indicate a winning result when each of pay lines and display a mini game winning combination regardless of what each mini game winning combination might be. In other embodiments the mini game outcomes need not be winning outcomes in order to pay a primary game award according to the primary game s pay table. For example as described above a common symbol such as symbol on each of pay lines and might qualify as a winning primary game combination.

In each mini game is a 3 reel slot type game in which special slot symbol has a probability of occurring on the middle reel of each mini game. The player wins a meta game award based on the number of mini games whose outcomes display the special symbol. In this example the meta game awards are a mixture of progressive amounts and fixed credit amounts. In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention the table in may be used to determine a meta game award based on the number of mini games played versus the number of mini games with the special symbol visible in its game outcome. In this example the player must play a minimum of five mini games and place a side bet on the meta game to be eligible for a meta game award.

In the table of a reference to a level indicates a progressive award with a Level 1 progressive generally but not necessarily paying more than a Level 2 progressive a Level 2 progressive paying more than a Level 3 progressive and so on. The table shows that a progressive award may be won by having each mini game played display the special symbol as part of its outcome. The more mini games played the higher the progressive award potential. This encourages a player to wager more liberally in return for higher potential rewards.

A numerical table entry in the table of indicates a credit award. For example if the player plays six mini games and five of the mini games have a special symbol as part of their outcome the player will be awarded 2 000 credits times the number of credits bet per mini game.

In another example in accordance with one embodiment the table of shows various progressive levels associated with certain mini game outcomes. In this example the player has extra incentive to play eight or nine mini games because a progressive award may be won even if all of the mini games do not contain the special symbol in their outcomes. For example a lesser Level 7 progressive award may be won if the player plays nine mini games and only seven of the outcomes contain the special symbol.

In still other embodiments the method of determining which meta game award the player wins is based on the number of mini games with a special symbol visible in its game outcome regardless of the number of mini games played. An inherent problem with this approach is that the probability of getting for example five special symbols while playing nine mini games is much greater than the probability of getting five special symbols while playing only five mini games. This variation in probabilities causes undesired variations in the theoretical hold percentage of the game based on the number of mini games played.

One method to overcome this problem is to utilize specific reel strips or specific weightings of the symbols on the reels based on the number of games the casino patron is playing. For example when all nine mini games are played the game uses a set of reel strips which produce a less frequent occurrence of meta game wins relative to when five mini games are played in which the game uses an alternate set of reel strips which produce a more frequent occurrence of meta game wins.

Another method to overcome this problem is to require the player to play specific sets of mini games pre selected by the game whenever the player is playing less than all of the mini games. These sets of mini games are designed to produce more meta game wins when fewer mini games are played relative to less frequent meta game wins when more mini games are played.

In accordance with one or more embodiments illustrates a gaming machine including cabinet housing primary game display upon which a primary game and feature game may be displayed top box which may display multiple progressives that may be won during play of the feature game player activated buttons player tracking panel bill voucher acceptor and one or more speakers . Cabinet housing is a self standing unit that is generally rectangular in shape and may be manufactured with reinforced steel or other rigid materials which are resistant to tampering and vandalism. Cabinet housing houses a processor circuitry and software not shown for receiving signals from the player activated buttons operating the games and transmitting signals to the respective displays and speakers. Any shaped cabinet may be implemented with any embodiment of gaming machine so long as it provides access to a player for playing a game. For example cabinet may comprise a slant top bar top or table top style cabinet. The operation of gaming machine is described more fully below.

The plurality of player activated buttons may be used for various functions such as but not limited to selecting a wager denomination selecting a game to be played selecting a wager amount per game initiating a game or cashing out money from gaming machine . Buttons function as input mechanisms and may include mechanical buttons electromechanical buttons or touch screen buttons. Optionally a handle may be rotated by a player to initiate a game.

In other embodiments buttons may be replaced with various other input mechanisms known in the art such as but not limited to a touch screen system touch pad track ball mouse switches toggle switches or other input means used to accept player input. For example one input means is a universal button module as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 106 212 entitled Universal Button Module filed on Apr. 14 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Generally the universal button module provides a dynamic button system adaptable for use with various games and capable of adjusting to gaming systems having frequent game changes. More particularly the universal button module may be used in connection with playing a game on a gaming machine and may be used for such functions as selecting the number of credits to bet per hand.

Cabinet housing may optionally include top box which contains top glass comprising advertising or payout information related to the game or games available on gaming machine . Player tracking panel includes player tracking card reader and player tracking display . Voucher printer may be integrated into player tracking panel or installed elsewhere in cabinet housing or top box .

Game display presents a game of chance wherein a player receives one or more outcomes from a set of potential outcomes. For example one such game of chance is a video slot machine game. In other aspects of the invention gaming machine may present a video or mechanical reel slot machine a video keno game a lottery game a bingo game a Class II bingo game a roulette game a craps game a blackjack game a mechanical or video representation of a wheel game or the like.

Mechanical or video mechanical embodiments may include game displays such as mechanical reels wheels or dice as required to present the game to the player. In video mechanical or pure video embodiments game display is typically a CRT or a flat panel display in the form of but not limited to liquid crystal plasma electroluminescent vacuum fluorescent field emission or any other type of panel display known or developed in the art. Game display may be mounted in either a portrait or landscape orientation and be of standard or widescreen dimensions i.e. a ratio of one dimension to another of at least 16 9 . For example a widescreen display may be 32 inches wide by 18 inches tall. A widescreen display in a portrait orientation may be 32 inches tall by 18 inches wide. Additionally game display preferably includes a touch screen or touch glass system not shown and presents player interfaces such as but not limited to credit meter not shown win meter not shown and touch screen buttons not shown . An example of a touch glass system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 942 571 entitled Gaming Device with Direction and Speed Control of Mechanical Reels Using Touch Screen which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Game display may also present information such as but not limited to player information advertisements and casino promotions graphic displays news and sports updates or even offer an alternate game. This information may be generated through a host computer networked with gaming machine on its own initiative or it may be obtained by request of the player using either one or more of the plurality of player activated buttons the game display itself if game display comprises a touch screen or similar technology buttons not shown mounted about game display which may permit selections such as those found on an ATM machine where legends on the screen are associated with respective selecting buttons or any player input device that offers the required functionality.

Cabinet housing incorporates a single game display . However in alternate embodiments cabinet housing or top box may house one or more additional displays or components used for various purposes including additional game play screens animated top glass progressive meters or mechanical or electromechanical devices not shown such as but not limited to wheels pointers or reels. The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.

Referring to electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . EGM Processor Board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to EGM Processor Board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on EGM Processor Board PID and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having adjustable multi part indicia as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Processor board executes a game program that causes processor board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having adjustable multi part indicia. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

For example PID may have coding which is stored in local memory and executable by PID processor upon insertion of a player card into card reader and follows a sequence such as 

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of processor board uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during startup from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a callback posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.
