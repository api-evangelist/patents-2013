This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 899 117 filed May 21 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ASSESSING SECURITY FOR A NETWORK OF ASSETS AND PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS by Chad Loder Dana Elizabeth Wolf and Matthew Robert Hathaway the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In today s distributed computing environments security is of the utmost importance. Due to the rise of wide area public networks users have unlimited access to content e.g. data files applications programs etc. from a variety of sources. Additionally the users connection to the public networks provides a window for malicious entities to attack the users computing systems. Malicious entities utilize this ease of accessibility and anonymity to attack the users. For example the malicious entities can plant viruses Trojans or other malicious agents in publicly available content in order to attack the users computing systems and steal sensitive information from the users and can attack the users system remotely across the public networks.

To identify security risks in computing systems and networks users and administrators employ vulnerability assessment and security assessment tools. These tools can identify vulnerabilities in computing systems and networks but only provide discrete information about the vulnerabilities i.e. that a vulnerability exists . Accordingly the tools do not provide any assessment of the vulnerabilities within the context of the overall network security.

For simplicity and illustrative purposes the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to examples of various implementations thereof. However one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to and can be implemented in all types of information and systems and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover in the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying figures which illustrate specific examples of various implementations. Electrical mechanical logical and structural changes can be made to the examples of the various implementations without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.

According to implementations systems and methods are directed to providing an overall security assessment of a network of computer assets. In implementations a security assessment tool can determine computer assets in a network and provide an overall security score for the network. The overall security score can represent an objective measure of the security of the network that considers potential security threats to the computer assets counter measures deployed in the network to address the potential security threats and the effectiveness of the counter measures. Based on the overall security assessment the security assessment tool can provide recommendations for improving the security of the network.

In implementation the security assessment tool can be configured as a software program that is capable of being stored on and executed by a computer system whether part of the network environment or external to the network environment . The security assessment tool can be written in a variety of programming languages such as JAVA C Python code Visual Basic hypertext markup language HTML extensible markup language XML and the like to accommodate a variety of operating systems computing system architectures etc. illustrates a more detailed view of the security assessment tool . As illustrated the security assessment tool can be configured as a stand alone software program and can include a scanner a threat model a score module and one or more interfaces . While illustrates the components as being part of the security assessment tool the components can be separate software programs that communicate with the security assessment tool . Likewise the security assessment tool itself can be a component of another software program.

The scanner can include one or more software modules or tools that can scan the network environment and the computer assets . The scanner can be configured to determine the structure of the network environment and identify the computer assets . Likewise the scanner can be configured to determine the security information for the network environment . Accordingly the scanner can be configured to include the necessary logic commands algorithms and code to scan the network environment and to communicate computer assets .

As described herein the security assessment tool will be described with reference to a user interacting with the security assessment tool . In implementations a user can include a one or more persons and or one or more software programs that can interact with the security assessment tool .

In implementations a user can utilize the interface to interact with the security assessment tool to perform the overall security assessment. The user can utilize the interface to initiate a security assessment of the network environment . The user can utilize the interface to enter information about the network environment and the computer assets . For example the user can enter information about the structure of the network environment such as network addresses of the network environment . Likewise for example the user can enter information about the computer assets such as identification of the computer assets access information for the computer assets and the like. The security assessment tool for example the scanner can utilize the information provided by the user when identifying the computer assets and when determining the security information for the network environment .

The security assessment tool can utilize the interface to output the results of the overall security assessment. The results can include the security score relative to the potential security threats and the overall security score determined by the security assessment tool . The results can also include one or more recommendations for improving the security score relative to the potential security threats and the overall security score. For example the one or more recommendations can include deploying a new counter measure changing a security setting of the computer assets changing a system setting of the computer assets changing a security policy of the computer systems updating software of the computer assets installing security software on the computer assets and improving access information for the computer assets .

As illustrated the security assessment tool can be configured to access one or more security resources . The security resources can be a source whether internal or external to the network environment that provides information about security threats and counter measures. For example the security resources can include security experts security forums security literature empirical security testing platforms and the like. Likewise for example the security resource can include the user of the security assessment tool . The security assessment tool can utilize the security resources to generate and update the threat model . The security assessment tool can also utilize the security resources to generate and update the score model . For example the security assessment tool can utilize the security resources to determine effectiveness metrics for the counter measures. The effectiveness metrics can be utilized to determine and update the weighting values for the counter measures.

As illustrated at the process can begin. At the security assessment tool can determine the computer assets in the network environment . The security assessment tool can scan the network environment to identify the computer assets in the network environment . Likewise the security assessment tool can receive an identification of computer assets from a user of the security assessment tool . Additionally the security assessment tool can receive from a user information about the network environment and the computer assets to assist in scanning the network environment .

In the security assessment tool can determine security information of the network environment . The security assessment tool can scan the network environment and the computer assets to identify security information. Likewise the security assessment tool can receive the security information from a user of the security assessment tool . Additionally the security assessment tool can receive from a user information about the network environment and the computer assets to assist in scanning the network environment .

The security information can include any information about the structure of the network environment and any information about the computer assets . For example the security information can include security details of the network environment such as security polices of the network environment details of computer assets e.g. firewalls providing security in the network environment and the like. Likewise for example the security information can include security details of the computer assets such as the configuration of the computer assets system setting of the computer assets software programs including security software programs installed on the computer assets security settings of the computer assets configuration policies of the computer assets security policies of the computer assets access information for the computer assets and details of software programs installed on the computer assets.

In the security assessment tool can determine potential security threats to the network and determine counter measures to address the potential security threats. Based on the security information the security assessment tool can examine the threat model to identify the potential security threats to the network environment . Additionally from the threat model the security assessment tool can identify counter measure that can address the potential security threats to the network environment .

For example based on the type and configurations of computer assets the security assessment tool can determine potential security threats. For instance if one or more of the computer assets are running a particular OS or a particular software program the security assessment tool can determine any potential security threats and any counter measures that are applicable to the particular OS or software program. Likewise for instance if one or more of the computer assets are connected to a public network e.g. the internet the security assessment tool can determine any potential security threats and any counter measures that are associated with public networks.

In the security assessment tool can determine an actual deployment of the counter measures in the network. Based on the security information and potential security threats the security assessment tool can determine which counter measures are actually deployed in the network environment and on the computer assets . The security assessment tool can determine which of counter measures are deployed and the coverage of the counter measures e.g. on which computer assets are the counter measures deployed .

In the security assessment tool can determine an overall security score for the network. The security assessment tool can determine the overall security score based on potential security threats to the network environment the actual deployment of the counter measures in the network environment and effectiveness on the deployed counter measures. The overall security score can include security scores for different security threats. The security score for each security threat can reflect the actual deployment of counter measures for each counter measure and the effectiveness of the deployed counter measures. The overall security score can be the combination of the security scores for each potential security threat.

The security score for each potential security threat and the overall security score can be a numerical value that represents the overall security score for the network environment where a higher numerical value represents better security relative to lower numerical values. For example the security score for each potential security threat and overall security score can be a numerical value between 0 and 10 where 0 represents no security for potential security threats and 10 represents complete coverage for the potential security threats. For instance if for a particular security threat the network environment has deployed on 100 of the computer assets a counter measure that is 50 effective in mitigating a the particular security threat. In this instance the security assessment tool can determine that the overall security score is 5.

In the security assessment tool can output the security assessment for the network environment . For example the security assessment tool can output the security score for each potential security threat and overall security score via the interface . The security assessment tool can output the value of the security score for each potential security threat and overall security score in addition to recommendations to improve the overall security score. Examples of the output of the security assessment and the recommendations can be found in related application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 899 117 filed May 21 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ASSESSING SECURITY FOR A NETWORK OF ASSETS AND PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS by Chad Loder Dana Elizabeth Wolf and Matthew Robert Hathaway the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety

In the security assessment tool can repeat the process above over time to determine new overall security scores. As new security threats arise computer assets are added and removed from the network new counter measures are determined and as new counter measured are deployed the security assessment tool can determine new security score for each potential security threat and a new overall security score. Likewise the security assessment tool can determine impact of the changes on the new scores.

As illustrated at the process can begin. In the security assessment tool can determine a potential security threat to the network environment . As mentioned above the security assessment tool can scan the network environment to determine the security information for the network environment . Likewise the security assessment tool can receive the security information from one or more users via an interface of the security assessment tool . Based on the security information the security assessment tool can determine a potential security threat to the network environment . In the security assessment tool can determine a deployed counter measure for the potential security threat. As mentioned above from the security information the security assessment tool can identify a particular counter measure for the potential security threat that is actually deployed in the network environment .

For example a particular security threat to the network environment can be a malware program that attacks a particular version of a known software program. A possible counter measure can be antivirus installed on the computer assets with network access in the network environment . Based on the security information the security assessment tool can determine that one or more of the computer assets have installed the particular software program. Continuing this example the security assessment tool can determine that one or more of the computer assets have an antivirus counter measure installed.

In the security assessment tool can determine an actual effectiveness score of the deployed counter measure. The actual effectiveness score can represent the coverage of the counter measure e.g. how extensive is the deployment of the counter measures and the effectiveness of the counter measures. Based on the computer assets and the security information the security assessment tool can determine the possible coverage of the counter measure e.g. possible ways the counter measure can be deployed in the network environment. Based on the computer assets and the security information the security assessment tool can determine the actual deployment of the counter measure.

The actual effectiveness score can be given by the equation actual effectiveness percentage coverage weighting value where weighting value represents the effectiveness of the counter measure and

In the security assessment tool can determine a possible effectiveness score of the deployed measure for a complete coverage. That is the possible effectiveness score can represent all possible ways that a counter measure can be deployed in the network environment and the effectiveness of the counter measures. The possible effectiveness score can be given by the equation possible effectiveness 1.0 weighting value weighting value.

Continuing the above example the possible coverage would be the antivirus being installed on all the computer assets . If for example the network environment included 100 possible deployment computer assets and only 50 actual deployment of these computer assets included antivirus then the percentage coverage would be 0.5 or 50 . In this example the effectiveness of the antivirus can be given a weighting value of 0.75. That is if the counter measure was 100 deployed the counter measure would receive a possible effectiveness score of 0.75 possible coverage weighting factor . In this example the actual effectiveness score for the antivirus counter measure can be 0.38 percentage coverage weighting factor .

In the security assessment tool can determine a raw security score for the deployed counter measure. The raw security score represents the actual effectiveness score normalized relative to the possible effectiveness score. The raw security score can be given by the equation 

Continuing the example above for the antivirus counter measure the raw security score is 0.50 0.38 0.75 .

In the security assessment tool can repeat the process for each counter measure for the potential threat deployed in the network. For each counter measure for a particular security threat the security assessment tool can determine a raw security score as described above.

In once all the raw security scores are determined the security assessment tool can determine a security score for the potential threat. The security score can be based on the raw security scores for each deployed counter measure. The security score for a potential security threat can be determined by the equation 

Continuing the above example the security score can be within a range of 0 to 10 and the scaling factor can be 10. If only the antivirus counter measure is the only counter measure the security assessment tool can determine that the security score for the potential threat is 5.0 0.50 10 .

Likewise in the above example another possible counter measure can be deployed to address the particular malware threat. For example the network environment can implement a counter measure of updating the particular version of the software program to the latest version. In this example only 80 of the computer assets can include the update to the latest version of the software program and then the percentage coverage would be 0.8 or 80 . In this example the effectiveness of the antivirus can be given a weighting value of 1.0. That is if the particular software program is updated to the latest version the malware security threat can have little or no security impact on the security of the network environment . In this example if the update counter measure was 100 deployed the counter measure would receive a possible effectiveness score of 1.0. The actual effectiveness score for the updated software program counter measure can be 0.80 percentage coverage weighting factor . The security assessment tool can determine that the raw security score is 0.80 .

Continuing this example the security assessment tool can combine the raw security score for the antivirus counter measure and the update counter measure to determine the security score for the particular malware security threat. In particular the security assessment tool can determine that the security score for the particular malware security threat is 6.7 out of 10 0.38 0.80 0.75 1.0 10 0.67 10 .

In the security assessment tool can repeat the process for more security threats. For each potential security threat the security assessment tool can determine a security score for each potential threat as described above. In the security assessment tool can determine an overall security score for the network environment . The overall security score can represent the combination of the security scores for all the potential security threats and deployed counter measures. The security score for a potential security threat can be determined by the equation 

As illustrated at the process can begin. At the security assessment tool can determine potential security threats to networks. At the security assessment tool can determine potential counter measures to the potential security threats. The security assessment tool can access the security resources and determine the potential security threats and counter measures for the potential security threats. The security assessment tool can store the potential counter measures and the potential security threats in the threat model .

The security resources can be a source whether internal or external to the network environment that provides information about security threats and counter measures. For example the security resources can include security experts security forums security literature empirical security testing platforms and the like. Likewise for example the security resource can include the user of the security assessment tool .

At the security assessment tool can determine effectiveness metrics of the potential counter measures. The security assessment tool can access the security resources and determine the effectiveness metrics. The effectiveness metrics can include quantitative and qualitative data on the effectiveness of the counter measures.

For example if a security resource is a security expert security forum or security literature the effectiveness metrics can include one or more lists that rank one or more counter measures for a potential security threat. The ranking in the list can be based on the experience and observations of security experts and professional as to the effectiveness of a counter measures. If for example a particular counter measure is ranked 1 out of 10 on a list of counter measures the effectiveness metrics can be 1.0 or 100 effective. Likewise for example if a particular counter measure is ranked 3 out of 10 on a list of counter measures the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70 effective.

Likewise if a security resource is an empirical security testing platform the effectiveness metrics can include a score or ranking describing how well a counter measure performed in various security tests. For instance a security testing platform can operate a testing environment in which a counter measure is tested against attacks and exploits. If for example a particular counter measure was effective against 70 out of 100 attacks and exploits the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70 effective.

At the security assessment tool can determine a weighting factor for each of the counter measure. The weighting factor can be based on the effectiveness metrics. For example the weighting factor can be based on the effectiveness metrics from one of the security resources . For instance if the security assessment tool utilizes the list of ranked counter measures from a security resource the weighting factor can be based on the ranking in the list. If a particular counter measure is ranked 3 out of 10 on a list of counter measures the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70 effective and the security assessment tool can determine that the weighting factor is 0.7.

Additionally for example the security assessment tool can utilize the effectiveness metrics from multiple security resources . If for example a particular counter measure is ranked 1 out of 10 on a list of counter measures the effectiveness metrics can be 1.0 or 100 effective. Additionally for example if the particular counter measure is tested by a security testing platform and determined to be effective against 70 out of 100 attacks and exploits the effectiveness metrics can be 0.7 or 70 effective. The security assessment tool can combine the effective metrics to determine the weighting factor.

One skilled in the art will understand that any type of procedure method or algorithm can be utilized to combine the effectiveness metrics. For example the security assessment tool can average the effectiveness metrics to determine the weighting factor. For instance in the above example the security assessment tool can determine that weighting factor is 0.85 1.0 0.7 2 . Additionally for example when determining the average the security assessment tool can weight one of the effectiveness metrics from one or more of the security resources higher when combining the effectiveness metrics. For example if a particular security resource is deemed for accurate reliable or trustworthy the effectiveness metrics from the particular security resource can be weighted higher than effectiveness metrics from other security resources .

At the security assessment tool can generate a security score model. The security score model can be based on the potential security threats the potential counter measures and the weighing factors. The security assessment tool can generate the necessary logic algorithms commands instructions and code to perform the processes described above.

At the security assessment tool can determine over time if new security threats exist. As new security threats are identified the security assessment tool can update the threat model and the scoring model using the processes described above.

At the security assessment tool can determine over time changes in the counter measures. As counter measures change over time the security assessment tool can update the threat model and the scoring model using the processes described above.
