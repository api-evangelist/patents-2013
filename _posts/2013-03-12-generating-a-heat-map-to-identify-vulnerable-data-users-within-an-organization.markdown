Attackers for example in an advanced persistent threat APT commonly perform reconnaissance on a target organization prior to attempted exploitation. Through this reconnaissance the attackers may identify individuals of interest and or develop methods of potential access to the target. Targeted individuals can range for example from senior leadership to researchers to administrative assistants. The individuals and or user accounts in an organization that use and or have access to sensitive data are logically the individuals whose leak and or loss would cause the most significant negative impact for the organization. It would therefore be advantageous to preemptively identify individuals within the organization that possess particular vulnerability with respect to data usage and or access.

One or more illustrative embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for generating a heat map to identify vulnerable data users within an organization.

In accordance with an aspect of the invention a method is provided comprising the steps of comparing each of one or more items of data against a set of one or more pre configured data sensitivity parameters to detect one or more sensitive data operations within the one or more items of data generating an alert corresponding to each of the one or more sensitive data operations wherein the alert provides one or more items of information pertaining to the corresponding sensitive data operation and processing the one or more alerts to generate a heat map representing an association between each of multiple users and the one or more sensitive data operations.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention a method is provided comprising the steps of comparing each of one or more items of monitored data against a set of one or more pre configured data sensitivity parameters to detect one or more sensitive data operations within the one or more items of monitored data and generating an alert corresponding to each of the one or more sensitive data operations wherein the alert provides one or more items of information pertaining to the corresponding sensitive data operation. This method further comprises the steps of processing the one or more alerts to generate a heat map representing an association between each of multiple users within an organization and the one or more sensitive data operations and implementing a security policy for the organization based on the heat map.

The data security techniques of the illustrative embodiments overcome one or more of the problems associated with the conventional techniques described previously. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description.

As will be described the present invention in one or more illustrative embodiments provides techniques for generating a heat map to preemptively identify and represent vulnerable users handling sensitive data within an organization. At least one embodiment of the invention includes generating alerts also referred to herein as mini events for all sensitive data detections irrespective of data loss prevention DLP policies. Such alerts can be accumulated in a central repository or database and used to generate a heat map. As detailed herein such a heat map can be used for example as input to network security monitoring platforms and or to build a business case for instance to focus a security budget on particular individuals . A generated heat map can also be used for creating and or enforcing customized security policies on particularly vulnerable individuals.

Illustrative embodiments of the present invention will be described herein with reference to exemplary communication systems and or processing devices. It is to be appreciated however that the invention is not restricted to use with the particular illustrative system and device configurations shown.

A DLP system such as implemented in connection with at least one embodiment of the invention includes visibility into user data transactions on laptops and desktops as well as visibility into network traffic. Such a system covers both data in use and data in motion. Accordingly an aspect of the invention includes monitoring all data in use for example desktop applications and data in motion for example network traffic and generating a heat map of data users.

As noted herein generating alerts for all sensitive data detections irrespective of DLP policies can cause the alerts to be accumulated to a central repository without the need for significant design changes in many DLP products. Also in at least one embodiment of the invention such alerts include a user identifier ID a descriptive element as to the nature of the sensitivity of the associated data and the time of the alert. Based on this accumulation of alerts at least one embodiment of the invention includes generating a heat map of users that handle a non trivial amount of sensitive data.

At least one embodiment of the invention includes utilizing existing DLP architecture and corresponding deployment across an organization as well as utilizing existing monitoring capabilities and definitions of sensitive data. Accordingly the definition of what constitutes sensitive data can be determined and or established by relevant DLP policies in the form of content blades and or user defined content blades. By way of example a system might include a source code content blade a finger printed content blade etc.

Content blades are components that encapsulate the rules and logic dedicated to be used for detecting a specific piece of content such as for example a credit card number . By way of example a content blade can utilize detection rules and or contextual rules. Detection rules can include rules that address questions such as What is in the documents or transmissions If the document contains a personal identification number for instance then the document might be sensitive. The context rules leverage contextual evidence and address questions such as How does the evidence appear in the documents If the document contains a personal identification number for instance is that information near a name or an address Once defined the content blade can be re used across any number of policies.

Further detection rules in a content blade can be grouped into rules of inclusion and rules of exclusion. Rules of inclusion include positive detection rules wherein such rules describe evidence that should be contained in a document. Rules of inclusion can be required Must Occur rules or optional May Occur rules. Rules of exclusion include negative detection rules wherein such rules describe evidence that should not be contained in a document. These rules may also be referred to as Should Not Occur rules. In at least one embodiment of the invention rules of exclusion are only used in conjunction with rules of inclusion. Additionally rules of exclusion can be used to eliminate matching on specific evidence that is causing a false positive match.

Further in at least one embodiment of the invention matches to rules of exclusion are compared to matches of the rules of inclusion and if the total score is higher for the rules of exclusion that document will not be a match to the content blade. For example a rule of exclusion may be used to stop falsely matching a training document on credit card numbers which contains valid card numbers and words and phrases. The rule of exclusion may discount the document as a match based on the document s title or other linguistic evidence.

By way of illustration consider the follow example scenarios for implementation of the techniques detailed herein. An organization based on determinations derived from a generated heat map identifies multiple assistants of senior executives who access sensitive data. As a result the organization may opt for example to implement a policy requiring the noted assistants to change relevant passwords at a given interval for example every week or every month or to enforce more protection around these employees while developing a custom security policy.

In all data being used by the desktop and laptops are monitored. For example in at least one embodiment of the invention a signed kernel module and a dynamic link library DLL are injected into all processes on the user desktop laptops by a DLP end point agent. The signed kernel module makes sure that the DLL gets injected into processes as and or when the processes are launched. The injected DLL in turn is responsible for intercepting system level application programming interface API calls made by an application to monitor the application for potential security violations. Every item of data activity on the laptop or desktop from set that relates to sensitive data can be mapped to the user and or user account associated with that laptop or desktop.

As also depicted in sensor is an appliance which monitors several protocols in connection with analyzing data moving within the organization and or moving out of the organization. Similarly the sensor additionally monitors network protocols in analyzing network traffic coming in and or going out of the organization. The sensor is further capable of mapping the network traffic to individual data users.

DLP is designed to be scalable with dispersed and parallel execution of its tasks. Accordingly as illustrated in content analysis is handled by end point agents on the user desktop laptops and sensors that perform the analysis in place. Each end point agent receives instructions from and returns results to its site coordinator component which manages agents for a local network. For example an enterprise installation can have as many site coordinators as is desired possibly in dispersed locations.

The enterprise coordinator component is the controller of all site coordinator components deployment. The enterprise coordinator component sends instructions to and gathers results from all site coordinator components . The network controller component is the controller of all sensors . Accordingly the network controller component sends instructions to and gathers results from all sensors .

Additionally the enterprise manager component is the administrative interface and management console for all DLP components. Further the admin console is a representation of the user interface UI component of the enterprise manager component .

As detailed herein the components depicted in can be implemented in connection with data in use flows as well as with data in motion flows. With respect to data in use flows sensitive content usage is detected by the end point agents on the user desktop laptops . The evidence of sensitive data transmission is logged and this log reaches the enterprise manager component through the site coordinator component and enterprise coordinator component .

With respect to data in motion flows network transmission of sensitive data is detected by the sensor as the sensor is reading network data transmissions via the tap switch span port . The tap is monitoring all transmission at the egress point . Further the evidence of sensitive data transmission is logged and this log reaches the enterprise manager through the network controller .

As illustrated in a synchronization sync request from the mobile device is sent as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS POST to exchange server . The response to that request contains data such as for example email data calendar data short messaging service SMS data a meeting request or other information related to device based policy settings from the exchange server . All of the responses being transmitted through proxy are sent to ICAP server for content analysis. Based on the configured DLP settings the ICAP server will audit the sensitive data in the response before the response is sent to the mobile device .

Accordingly a user accessing data using his her mobile device is being monitored for sensitive data usage via the ICAP server . As such sensitive data can be mapped to a particular user based on this monitoring.

The same ICAP server can be used for monitoring internal emails in conjunction with a DLP exchange agent as shown in which is a diagram illustrating example system components according to an embodiment of the invention. Specifically in a hub transport server is a component of an exchange server such as for example the Microsoft Exchange server . Additionally depicts an enterprise manager component as well as a network controller . As noted above the network controller functions in a similar manner to the network controller depicted in that is the network controller manages all of the sensors or in this instance the ICAP servers . Additionally the enterprise manager component similar to the enterprise manager component depicted in functions as the administrative interface and management console for all DLP components.

In connection with the hub transport server the DLP transport agent has the capability to monitor all internal email transactions to detect sensitive data usage and map each usage to a user. In at least one embodiment of the invention the DLP transport agent can include a software component that works as a plug in into the hub transport serer which can be a component of an exchange server .

As noted above existing approaches utilizing DLP capabilities include monitoring but provide reporting only if a policy violation is detected. That is in such approaches if a given transaction or data operation involves legitimate usage of sensitive data that transaction or data operation is not reported. However aspects of the present invention include reporting all detected events associated with sensitive data usage and leveraging this reporting information to generate a heat map representing user vulnerability with respect to sensitive data access and or usage.

In at least one embodiment of the invention a mini event includes information such as the name or other identifying information of the user who performed the data operation associated with data file as well as the specific content blade s from the set of content blades implicated in the sensitive data detection flow indicating the category of sensitive data involved in the data operation. A mini event can additionally include information such as the severity for example as represented by a scale of 1 100 of the sensitive data and or associated data operation. In at least one embodiment of the invention the logic for determining severity is defined in the content blades . The content analysis component performs the action of assigning severity for the data analyzed.

Further in at least one embodiment of the invention a mini event can also include information such as the time that the relevant data operation occurred as well as the application name and or the network protocol involved in the data operation.

The logic of determining and generating the heat map involves aggregation on the severity parameter and sorting on the user parameter. By way of example if user organization.com as identified in the mini event in sends 100 emails with high severity then there would be 100 mini events which will be aggregated on the severity parameter. This user s total severity value will be sorted against other users severity value to determine his her position on the heat map.

Accordingly is a diagram illustrating an example heat map and a corresponding example heat map report according to an embodiment of the invention. As depicted in the example report in such reports can include the identification of particular users within the organization as well as severity scores and sensitive data categories associated with the data operation s of those particular users. The report content is derived from the heat map generated as detailed above via aggregation on a severity parameter and sorting on a user parameter.

Step includes generating an alert corresponding to each of the one or more sensitive data operations wherein the alert provides one or more items of information pertaining to the corresponding sensitive data operation. As detailed herein the alert can include information identifying a user who performed the corresponding sensitive data operation information identifying a pre configured data sensitivity parameter implicated in said comparing step as well as information identifying a pre configured data sensitivity parameter implicated in said comparing step comprises information indicating a category of sensitive data involved in the sensitive data operation. The alert can also include a severity measure associated with the corresponding sensitive data operation information identifying a time that the corresponding sensitive data operation occurred and information identifying at least one of an application and a network protocol involved in the sensitive data operation. At least one embodiment of the invention also includes storing each alert in a database.

Step includes processing the one or more alerts to generate a heat map representing an association between each of multiple users and the one or more sensitive data operations. At least one embodiment of the invention additionally includes generating a report corresponding to the heat map. The report can include information identifying one or more users associated with one or more sensitive data operations a severity measure associated with each of the one or more sensitive data operations and a sensitive data category associated with each of the one or more sensitive data operations.

Further at least one embodiment of the invention includes implementing a security policy based on the heat map. The security policy can include for example a requirement for one or more users to change one or more user passwords at a given interval.
