title: Systems and methods to identify merchants
abstract: A system and method including a mobile application installed on a mobile device and configured to authenticate a merchant represented by a unique identifier, determine a position of the mobile device while the mobile device is co-located with a transaction terminal of the merchant, communicate the position to a portal to associate the position with the unique identifier and to receive an account number, and provide the account number to generate an authorization request on the transaction terminal. The authorization request includes a terminal identifier of the transaction terminal. When the authorization request generated using the account number is detected, the association between the account number provided to the mobile application and the location received from the mobile application is replaced with the association between the terminal identifier extracted from the authorization request and the location. Thus, subsequent authorization requests generated by the transaction terminal can be determined to contain the terminal identifier and identified to be associated with the location and the merchant identifier.

U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005 0055275 published on Mar. 10 2005 and entitled System and Method for Analyzing Marketing Efforts discloses a system that evaluates the cause and effect of advertising and marketing programs using card transaction data.

U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2008 0217397 published on Sep. 11 2008 and entitled Real Time Awards Determinations discloses a system for facilitating transactions with real time awards determinations for a cardholder in which the award may be provided to the cardholder as a credit on the cardholder s statement.

A mobile application running on a mobile device can be used to establish the connection between a terminal identifier of a transaction terminal used in processing payment transactions of a merchant the location of the transaction terminal configured in a payment processing network and an identity of the merchant used outside the payment processing network. For example the mobile application can be configured to authenticate the merchant represented by a unique identifier outside the payment processing network. After the merchant is authenticated and while the mobile device is co located with the transaction terminal the mobile application determines a position of the mobile device. Thus the position determined by the mobile application represents a location of the transaction terminal. The mobile application provides the location to a portal for association with the unique identifier of the merchant and receives an account number from the portal to allow the portal to temporarily establish the association between the account number received in the mobile application and the location of transaction terminal determined by the mobile application. After the account number is used on the transaction terminal to initiate an authorization request for a transaction the authorization request made using the account number is identified to extract the terminal identifier transmitted in the authorization request. The association between the account number and the location of the transaction terminal is then replaced with the association between the terminal identifier and the location. Thus subsequent authorization requests containing the terminal identifier can be identified as being submitted for transactions at the location with the merchant represented by the unique identifier. Some details and examples are provided in the section entitled MERCHANT IDENTIFICATION. 

For example transaction data such as records of transactions made via credit accounts debit accounts prepaid accounts bank accounts stored value accounts and the like can be processed to optionally provide information for various services such as reporting benchmarking advertising content or offer selection customization personalization prioritization etc. In one embodiment of improving privacy protections users are required to enroll in a service program and provide consent to allow the system to use related transaction data and or other data for the related services and the system is configured to provide the services while protecting the privacy of the users in accordance with the enrollment agreement and user consent.

For example based on the transaction data and or the user data linked via the transaction data an advertising network can present personalized or targeted advertisements offers on behalf of advertisers. A computing apparatus of or associated with the transaction handler uses the transaction data and or other data such as account data merchant data search data social networking data web data etc. to develop intelligence information about individual customers or certain types or groups of customers. The intelligence information can be used to select identify generate adjust prioritize and or personalize advertisements offers to the customers. The transaction handler may be further automated to process the advertisement fees charged to the advertisers using the accounts of the advertisers in response to the advertising activities. Some of the services are discussed in the section entitled TRANSACTION DATA BASED SERVICES. 

For example the computing apparatus can be configured to generate trigger records for a transaction handler to identify authorization requests that satisfy the conditions specified in the trigger records identify communication references of the users associated with the identified authorization requests and use the communication references to target real time messages at the users in parallel with the transaction handler providing responses to the respective authorization requests. Details in one embodiment regarding the generation and delivery of messages in real time with the processing of transactions are provided in the section entitled REAL TIME MESSAGES. 

For example the computing apparatus can be configured to provide transaction information about transactions between enrolled merchants and enrolled account holders to a merchant aggregator which enrolls the merchants and account holders for enhanced communications with merchants and account holders. The transaction information is provided in real time or concurrently with the processing of the respective transaction requests at the transaction handler. Details and examples in one embodiment regarding the communication via the merchant aggregator are provided in the section entitled MERCHANT AGGREGATOR. 

The computing apparatus may correlate transactions with activities that occurred outside the context of the transaction such as online advertisements presented to the customers that at least in part cause offline transactions. The correlation data can be used to demonstrate the success of the advertisements and or to improve intelligence information about how individual customers and or various types or groups of customers respond to the advertisements.

For example the computing apparatus correlates or provides information to facilitate the correlation of transactions with online activities of the customers such as searching web browsing social networking and consuming advertisements with other activities such as watching television programs and or with events such as meetings announcements natural disasters accidents news announcements etc. The correlation results are used in predictive models to predict transactions and or spending patterns based on activities or events to predict activities or events based on transactions or spending patterns to provide alerts or reports etc.

In one embodiment a single entity operating the transaction handler performs various operations in the services provided based on the transaction data. For example in the presentation of the personalized or targeted advertisements the single entity may perform the operations such as generating the intelligence information selecting relevant intelligence information for a given audience selecting identifying adjusting prioritizing personalizing and or generating advertisements based on selected relevant intelligence information and facilitating the delivery of personalized or targeted advertisements etc. Alternatively the entity operating the transaction handler cooperates with one or more other entities by providing information to these entities to allow these entities to perform at least some of the operations for presentation of the personalized or targeted advertisements.

In a payment transaction processing network such as a system partially illustrated in and further discussed in the section entitled TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND DATA a merchant may be represented by a merchant account . A transaction terminal of the merchant has a terminal identifier that identifies the merchant account in the payment transaction processing network. The system may store merchant information in association with the merchant account such as a business name of the merchant a business address of the merchant etc.

However in a large payment transaction processing network it can be a challenging task to efficiently and accurately identify a particular merchant based on merchant information such as business name and or business address when the merchant information is submitted by a human user.

For example a merchant may have a plurality of different business names. A business name associated with a merchant account in the payment transaction processing system may be different from a business name typically used by the merchant in doing business outside the payment transaction processing system. For example a merchant may use business names with slightly different spelling or wording in different business situations. For example the business name of a merchant may be changed but not updated promptly in a data warehouse that stores the merchant information for the merchant account . Some merchants have similar or same business names.

Further it is desirable to have accurate location information of the transaction terminals e.g. of the merchants to provide location related services in connection with payment transaction processing.

In a mobile device is configured with a mobile application to facilitate the identification of the merchant. The mobile application can be provided via for example downloading it from a portal or an application store configured to deliver mobile applications to certain mobile devices .

In the mobile device includes a global positioning system GPS receiver to determine the current position of the mobile device . When the mobile device is positioned near the transaction terminal of the merchant or co located with the transaction terminal the position determined by the GPS receiver can be used as the position of the transaction terminal .

Alternatively or in combination the mobile device may determine the current position of the mobile device cellular communications signals wireless local area communications signals and or an interactive map.

In the mobile device includes a communication device configured to communicate with the portal via a wired communication connection and or a wireless communication connection. For example the communication device may include a wireless local area network transceiver configured to use a wireless local area network connection to connect to the Internet for communication with the portal . For example the communication device may include a cellular communications transceiver configured to use a cellular telecommunications connection to connect to the Internet for communication with the portal .

In the mobile device is configured to communicate with the portal to authenticate the merchant using the mobile application running in the mobile device .

For example when the merchant participates in an offer program e.g. by providing an offer illustrated in or a unique merchant identifier can be assigned to represent the merchant. The merchant identifier is configured to uniquely identify the merchant among a plurality of merchants in the system such as merchants identified in the data warehouse .

Access to merchant information and or services related to the unique merchant identifier can be protected via credential information such as username and password. The mobile application is configured to authenticate the merchant based on the credential information.

The merchant identifier can be assigned to the merchant when the merchant installs and or configures the mobile application on the mobile device . For example after the merchant signs up for the services provided by the portal the merchant is prompted to set up username and password. After the merchant passes authentication operations on the mobile application the merchant identifier is stored in the mobile application or mobile device to represent the merchant.

For example when the merchant enrolls in a program with a merchant aggregator illustrated in the merchant identifier can be assigned to identify the merchant in both the merchant aggregator and the data warehouse .

The mobile application can be configured to instruct the merchant to position the mobile device at or near the transaction terminal to obtain a location of the mobile device that represents the location of the transaction terminal . The mobile application then transmits the location to the portal for association with the merchant identifier in the data warehouse .

In the portal is configured to provide an account number to the mobile application in response to receiving the location . The portal stores data in the data warehouse to temporarily associate the account number to the location .

In the account number is independent from the merchant account in which the merchant receives payments processed by an acquirer processor on behalf of the merchant. The account number assigned to temporarily represent the location and or the merchant identifier in the data warehouse can be a one time account number or be set to expire within a short period of time.

The period of time in which the account number can be reduced to such that if the mobile device is in close proximity to the transaction terminal the account number presented by the mobile application can be used on the transaction terminal to initiate a transaction within the period of time and if the mobile device is not in close proximity to the transaction terminal it would be difficult to use the account number presented by the mobile application on the transaction terminal to initiate a transaction within the period of time in which the account number is valid.

For example the mobile application may display the account number to allow the merchant to key in the account number on the transaction terminal to initiate an authorization request for a transaction in an account uniquely identified by the account number .

For example the mobile application may include a near field communication device that is configured to communicate the account number to the transaction terminal via near field communication. When the mobile device and the transaction terminal are in range for near field communication the location of the mobile device as determined by the mobile device represents an accurate measurement of the location of the transaction terminal . The mobile application can be configured to determine the location for transmission to the portal while the mobile device and the transaction terminal are in range for near field communication such as before during or after the communication of the account number to the transaction terminal via near field communication.

In some implementations the mobile device can be configured to establish a wired or wireless communication connection with the transaction terminal to provide the account number . Examples of such a communication connection include a Bluetooth connection a personal wireless area network communication connection a Universal Serial Bus USB connection etc. The use of a wired communication connection or a wireless connection of a short communication range can improve the accuracy of the location measured using the location determination system of the mobile device such as the GPS receiver .

In the transaction terminal has a terminal identifier that is associated with the merchant account in the payment transaction processing network interconnected by a transaction handler . After the authorization request for the transaction made on the transaction terminal using the account number provided via the mobile application is processed by the transaction handler a transaction record for the transaction is generated and stored in the data warehouse that is coupled with both the transaction handler and the portal . The transaction record includes the account number provided to the transaction terminal via the mobile application and the terminal identifier of the transaction terminal .

If the transaction corresponding to the transaction record is determined to be valid e.g. within the predetermined time period in which the account number is valid and associated with the location within the predetermined limit on number of uses of the account number the portal and or the transaction handler or a separate computing device extracts the terminal identifier from the transaction record and stores data in the data warehouse to associate the terminal identifier with the location measured for the transaction terminal and the merchant identifier .

After the temporary association between the account number and merchant information is replaced in the data warehouse with the association between the terminal identifier and the merchant information the merchant information can be identified and used for transactions initiated on the transaction terminal of the merchant. When a subsequent transaction includes the terminal identifier the transaction can be identified to be at the location and with the merchant represented by the merchant identifier .

For example if an offer e.g. illustrated in or requires a payment transaction with the merchant identified by the merchant identifier the transaction handler and or the portal can be configured to detect such a payment transaction based on the terminal identifiers e.g. associated with the merchant identifier .

The merchant may have a plurality of transaction terminals e.g. and the mobile application can be used multiple times to measure the locations e.g. of the transaction terminal e.g. associate the measured locations e.g. with the terminal identifiers e.g. of the respective transaction terminals e.g. and associate the terminal identifiers e.g. of the merchant with the merchant identifier of the merchant.

The portal may provide different one time account numbers e.g. for identification of the different transaction terminals e.g. of the merchant. Alternatively the account number may be configured to be valid for use multiple times within a period of time.

When the account number can be used multiple times on different transaction terminals e.g. of the merchant the system may be configured to measure one location representing the set of the transaction terminals e.g. . Alternatively the transaction handler and or the portal may correlate the transactions initiated on the transaction terminals e.g. and local measurements based on time sequence.

For example the mobile application may provide the account number to initiate an authorization request for a transaction on the transaction terminal and report the location measured for the transaction terminal within a short period of time e.g. shorter than a time period for the merchant to move the mobile device to another transaction terminal . Thus the authorization request generated from the transaction terminal can be corrected to the location measured from the transaction terminal based on the timestamp associated with the reporting of the measured location and the timestamp of the authorization request.

Alternatively or in combination different transaction amounts can be used to tell the different transaction terminals apart. For example during the identification of the transaction terminal the mobile application presents not only the account number but also the transaction amount of the transaction to be initiated on the transaction terminal . Thus the transaction for the particular transaction terminal can be identified based on the combination of the transaction amount and the account number .

In a computing apparatus system is configured to provide a mobile application on a mobile device having a position determination system e.g. GPS receiver authenticate using the mobile application a merchant represented by a merchant identifier to perform operations in association with the merchant identifier determine a position of the mobile device using the mobile application while the mobile device is near or co located with a transaction terminal of the merchant such that the position can be used as a measurement of the location of the transaction terminal in association with the merchant identifier communicate the position e.g. location to a portal and receive an account number from the portal initiate on the transaction terminal an authorization request for a transaction in an account specified by the account number extract a terminal identifier of the transaction terminal from the authorization request that identifies the account number and replace the account number with the terminal identifier for association with the position e.g. location and or the merchant identifier .

The computing apparatus system may include one or more of the portal the data warehouse the mobile device the transaction terminal and the transaction handler .

For example the computing system can be implemented using one or more data processing systems illustrated in each of which has at least one microprocessor and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one microprocessor to perform operations. The computing system may include a transaction handler configured to process payment transactions in a payment processing network and generate transaction data recording the payment transactions processed by the transaction handler and a portal configured to communicate with a mobile application executing in a mobile device having a communication device and a GPS receiver where the mobile application is configured to instruct the GPS receiver to determine a position e.g. location of the mobile device while the mobile device is positioned in the vicinity of a transaction terminal of a merchant authenticating the merchant represented by a merchant identifier . After the merchant is authenticated via the mobile application the portal communicates with the mobile application via the communication device to receive the position e.g. location from the mobile application and provides an account number to the mobile application for the initiation of a transaction on the transaction terminal .

The computing system may further include a data warehouse coupled with the portal and the transaction handler to store merchant information including the position e.g. location received from the mobile application where the position e.g. location is stored in association with the merchant identifier that uniquely identifies the merchant among a plurality of merchants in the data warehouse . The data warehouse may further store first data associating the account number with the merchant information and a transaction record of the transaction initiated on the transaction terminal of the merchant using the account number while the account number is associated with the merchant information where the transaction record includes the account number and the terminal identifier of the transaction terminal .

The computing system is configured via instructions to identify the transaction record based on the account number extract the terminal identifier from the identified transaction record identify the merchant information that is associated with the account number in the data warehouse and store in the data warehouse second data associating the terminal identifier with the merchant information .

The computing system may remove the first data associating the account number with the merchant information after the second data associating the terminal identifier with the merchant information is stored in the data warehouse .

The computing system can be further configured to detect a subsequent transaction initiated on the transaction terminal having the terminal identifier determine the terminal identifier used in the subsequent transaction and determine the location of the subsequent transaction and the merchant identifier of the subsequent transaction based on matching the terminal identifier used in the subsequent transaction and the terminal identifier in the second data.

The account number can be for example a one time account number valid for one time use. The one time account number can be generated in response to receiving the location from the mobile application or in anticipation of the mobile application submitting the location .

The mobile device can be configured for example to present the account number on a display device and determine the position e.g. location of the mobile device while the account number is presented on the display device. The time period of the display of the account number on the mobile application can be limited to encourage the determination of the position e.g. location of the mobile device in the vicinity of the transaction terminal .

The mobile device can be configured to communicate the account number to the transaction terminal via near field communication and determine the position of the mobile device as the measured location of the transaction terminal while the mobile device and the transaction terminal are in communication range for near field communication.

The mobile device can also be implemented using a data processing system illustrated in . For example the mobile device includes a communication device a GPS receiver at least one microprocessor coupled with the communication device and the GPS receiver and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one microprocessor to perform operations. The instructions include a mobile application configured to authenticate a merchant represented by a merchant identifier determine using the GPS receiver a location of the mobile device while the mobile device is positioned in the vicinity of a transaction terminal of the merchant and communicate using the communication device with the portal to provide the location in association with the merchant identifier and to receive an account number for the initiation of a transaction using the transaction terminal .

The portal is coupled with a data warehouse storing transaction data as illustrated in recording payment transactions processed by the transaction handler of a payment processing network and the data warehouse is coupled with the portal and the transaction handler to store merchant information such as the location received from the mobile application and the merchant identifier first data associating the account number with the merchant information before a terminal identifier of the transaction terminal of the merchant replaces it with the account number and a transaction record of the transaction initiated using the account number on the transaction terminal of the merchant while the account number is associated with the merchant information where the transaction record includes the account number and a terminal identifier of the transaction terminal .

The portal can be configured to identify the transaction record having the account number extract the terminal identifier from the transaction record identify the merchant information associated with the account number in the data warehouse in accordance with the first data and store in the data warehouse second data associating the terminal identifier with the merchant information .

The account number may be set to be valid for one time use within a predetermined period of time. The mobile device may further include a display device on which the mobile application is configured to present the account number while determining the location of the mobile device .

The account number may be displayed at least in a bar code format such that a bar code scanner of the transaction terminal can read the account number . Alternatively the transaction terminal may include a key pad to receive manual input of the account number from the person using the mobile device . Alternatively the mobile device may include a near field communication device configured to communicate present the account number to the transaction terminal to initiate the transaction corresponding to the transaction record . When the near field communication device is used the mobile device can be configured to determine and report the location of the mobile device while the mobile device and the transaction terminal are in communication range for near field communication.

In some instances the mobile device may be integrated within the transaction terminal and the mobile application can be downloaded and installed on the transaction terminal to perform the operations described herein.

The mobile application may be provided by the portal for installation on the mobile device of the merchant. The merchant is prompted to provide input to the mobile application to authenticate that a user of the mobile application is authorized by the merchant represented by a merchant identifier that uniquely identifies the merchant in an application outside the payment processing network. The mobile application is used to provide an account number to a transaction terminal directly or indirectly while measuring a location of the transaction terminal using a GPS receiver . Thus the measured location of the transaction terminal can be associated with the merchant identifier and after the terminal identifier of the transaction terminal is extracted from the authorization request generated on the transaction terminal using the account number the terminal identifier can be associated with the measured location of the transaction terminal and the merchant identifier . The operations can be repeated for different transaction terminals e.g. to measure their locations e.g. and to associate their terminal identifiers with the merchant identifier . The merchant information may include information such as the business name of the merchant a street or mailing address of the merchant online access credential etc.

The computing apparatus can be further implemented optionally to perform other operations discussed below such as the operations discussed in the section entitled TRANSACTION DATA BASED SERVICES. Some of the hardware arrangements are discussed in the sections entitled CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE and HARDWARE. 

In the system further includes a correlator to correlate user specific advertisement data with transactions resulting from the user specific advertisement data . The correlation results can be used by the profile generator to improve the transaction profiles .

The transaction profiles of one embodiment are generated from the transaction data in a way as illustrated in . For example in an aggregated spending profile is generated via the factor analysis and cluster analysis to summarize the spending patterns behaviors reflected in the transaction records .

In one embodiment a data warehouse as illustrated in is coupled with the transaction handler to store the transaction data and other data such as account data transaction profiles and correlation results . In a portal is coupled with the data warehouse to provide data or information derived from the transaction data in response to a query request from a third party or as an alert or notification message.

In the transaction handler is coupled between an issuer processor in control of a consumer account and an acquirer processor in control of a merchant account . An account identification device is configured to carry the account information that identifies the consumer account with the issuer processor and provide the account information to the transaction terminal of a merchant to initiate a transaction between the user and the merchant.

In one embodiment the transaction data relates to financial transactions processed by the transaction handler and the account data relates to information about the account holders involved in the transactions. Further data such as merchant data that relates to the location business products and or services of the merchants that receive payments from account holders for their purchases can be used in the generation of the transaction profiles .

In one embodiment the financial transactions are made via an account identification device such as financial transaction cards e.g. credit cards debit cards banking cards etc. the financial transaction cards may be embodied in various devices such as plastic cards chips radio frequency identification RFID devices mobile phones personal digital assistants PDAs etc. and the financial transaction cards may be represented by account identifiers e.g. account numbers or aliases . In one embodiment the financial transactions are made via directly using the account information without physically presenting the account identification device .

In one embodiment the transaction handler couples with a centralized data warehouse organized around the transaction data . For example the centralized data warehouse may include and or support the determination of spend band distribution transaction count and amount merchant categories merchant by state cardholder segmentation by velocity scores and spending within merchant target competitive set and cross section. For example the centralized data warehouse may include the advertisement data and or offers of benefits such as discount reward points cashback etc. The offers can be communicated to the users e.g. via the advertisement data or as part of the advertisement data .

In one embodiment the centralized data warehouse provides centralized management but allows decentralized execution. For example a third party strategic marketing analyst statistician marketer promoter business leader etc. may access the centralized data warehouse to analyze customer and shopper data to provide follow up analyses of customer contributions to develop propensity models for increased conversion of marketing campaigns to develop segmentation models for marketing etc. The centralized data warehouse can be used to manage advertisement campaigns and analyze response profitability.

In one embodiment the centralized data warehouse includes merchant data e.g. data about sellers customer business data e.g. data about buyers and transaction records between sellers and buyers over time. The centralized data warehouse can be used to support corporate sales forecasting fraud analysis reporting sales customer relationship management CRM business intelligence credit risk prediction and analysis advanced authorization reporting merchant benchmarking business intelligence for small business rewards etc.

In one embodiment the transaction data is combined with external data such as surveys benchmarks search engine statistics demographics competition information emails etc. to flag key events and data values to set customer merchant data or event triggers and to drive new transactions and new customer contacts.

In the profile generator generates transaction profiles based on the transaction data the account data and or other data such as non transactional data wish lists merchant provided information address information information from social network websites information from credit bureaus information from search engines and other examples discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 614 603 filed Nov. 9 2009 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011 0054981 and entitled Analyzing Local Non Transactional Data with Transactional Data in Predictive Models the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the transaction profiles provide intelligence information on the behavior pattern preference propensity tendency frequency trend and budget of the user in making purchases. In one embodiment the transaction profiles include information about what the user owns such as points miles or other rewards currency available credit and received offers such as coupons loaded into the accounts of the user . In one embodiment the transaction profiles include information based on past offer coupon redemption patterns. In one embodiment the transaction profiles include information on shopping patterns in retail stores as well as online including frequency of shopping amount spent in each shopping trip distance of merchant location retail from the address of the account holder s etc.

In one embodiment the transaction handler and or the portal is configured to provide at least part of the intelligence for the prioritization generation selection customization and or adjustment of the advertisement for delivery within a transaction process involving the transaction handler . For example the advertisement may be presented to a customer in response to the customer making a payment via the transaction handler .

Some of the transaction profiles are specific to the user or to an account of the user or to a group of users of which the user is a member such as a household family company neighborhood city or group identified by certain characteristics related to online activities offline purchase activities merchant propensity etc.

The profile generator may generate and update the transaction profiles in batch mode periodically or generates the transaction profiles in real time or just in time in response to a request received in the portal for such profiles.

The transaction profiles of one embodiment include the values for a set of parameters. Computing the values of the parameters may involve counting transactions that meet one or more criteria and or building a statistically based model in which one or more calculated values or transformed values are put into a statistical algorithm that weights each value to optimize its collective predictiveness for various predetermined purposes.

Further details and examples about the transaction profiles in one embodiment are provided in the section entitled AGGREGATED SPENDING PROFILE. 

In one embodiment the transaction data is analyzed in connection with non transactional data to generate transaction profiles and or to make predictive models.

In one embodiment transactions are correlated with non transactional events such as news conferences shows announcements market changes natural disasters etc. to establish cause and effect relations to predict future transactions or spending patterns. For example non transactional data may include the geographic location of a news event the date of an event from an events calendar the name of a performer for an upcoming concert etc. The non transactional data can be obtained from various sources such as newspapers websites blogs social networking sites etc.

When the cause and effect relationships between the transactions and non transactional events are known e.g. based on prior research results domain knowledge expertise the relationships can be used in predictive models to predict future transactions or spending patterns based on events that occurred recently or are happening in real time.

In one embodiment the non transactional data relates to events that happened in a geographical area local to the user that performed the respective transactions. In one embodiment a geographical area is local to the user when the distance from the user to locations in the geographical area is within a convenient range for daily or regular travel such as 20 50 or 100 miles from an address of the user or within the same city or zip code area of an address of the user . Examples of analyses of local non transactional data in connection with transaction data in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 614 603 filed Nov. 9 2009 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011 0054981 and entitled Analyzing Local Non Transactional Data with Transactional Data in Predictive Models the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the non transactional data is not limited to local non transactional data. For example national non transactional data can also be used.

In one embodiment the transaction records are analyzed in frequency domain to identify periodic features in spending events. The periodic features in the past transaction records can be used to predict the probability of a time window in which a similar transaction would occur. For example the analysis of the transaction data can be used to predict when a next transaction having the periodic feature would occur with which merchant the probability of a repeated transaction with a certain amount the probability of exception the opportunity to provide an advertisement or offer such as a coupon etc. In one embodiment the periodic features are detected through counting the number of occurrences of pairs of transactions that occurred within a set of predetermined time intervals and separating the transaction pairs based on the time intervals.

In an advertisement selector prioritizes generates selects adjusts and or customizes the available advertisement data to provide user specific advertisement data based at least in part on the user specific profile . The advertisement selector uses the user specific profile as a filter and or a set of criteria to generate identify select and or prioritize advertisement data for the user . A media controller delivers the user specific advertisement data to the point of interaction for presentation to the user as the targeted and or personalized advertisement.

In one embodiment the user data includes the characterization of the context at the point of interaction . Thus the use of the user specific profile selected using the user data includes the consideration of the context at the point of interaction in selecting the user specific advertisement data .

In one embodiment in selecting the user specific advertisement data the advertisement selector uses not only the user specific profile but also information regarding the context at the point of interaction . For example in one embodiment the user data includes information regarding the context at the point of interaction and the advertisement selector explicitly uses the context information in the generation or selection of the user specific advertisement data .

In one embodiment the advertisement selector may query for specific information regarding the user before providing the user specific advertisement data . The queries may be communicated to the operator of the transaction handler and in particular to the transaction handler or the profile generator . For example the queries from the advertisement selector may be transmitted and received in accordance with an application programming interface or other query interface of the transaction handler the profile generator or the portal of the transaction handler .

In one embodiment the queries communicated from the advertisement selector may request intelligence information regarding the user at any level of specificity e.g. segment level individual level . For example the queries may include a request for a certain field or type of information in a cardholder s aggregate spending profile . As another example the queries may include a request for the spending level of the user in a certain merchant category over a prior time period e.g. six months .

In one embodiment the advertisement selector is operated by an entity that is separate from the entity that operates the transaction handler . For example the advertisement selector may be operated by a search engine a publisher an advertiser an ad network or an online merchant. The user specific profile is provided to the advertisement selector to assist the customization of the user specific advertisement data .

In one embodiment advertising is targeted based on shopping patterns in a merchant category e.g. as represented by a Merchant Category Code MCC that has high correlation of spending propensity with other merchant categories e.g. other MCCs . For example in the context of a first MCC for a targeted audience a profile identifying second MCCs that have high correlation of spending propensity with the first MCC can be used to select advertisements for the targeted audience.

In one embodiment the aggregated spending profile is used to provide intelligence information about the spending patterns preferences and or trends of the user . For example a predictive model can be established based on the aggregated spending profile to estimate the needs of the user . For example the factor values and or the cluster ID in the aggregated spending profile can be used to determine the spending preferences of the user . For example the channel distribution in the aggregated spending profile can be used to provide a customized offer targeted for a particular channel based on the spending patterns of the user .

In one embodiment mobile advertisements such as offers and coupons are generated and disseminated based on aspects of prior purchases such as timing location and nature of the purchases etc. In one embodiment the size of the benefit of the offer or coupon is based on purchase volume or spending amount of the prior purchase and or the subsequent purchase that may qualify for the redemption of the offer. Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 960 162 filed Dec. 19 2007 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub.

In the user tracker obtains and generates context information about the user at the point of interaction including user data that characterizes and or identifies the user . The profile selector selects a user specific profile from the set of transaction profiles generated by the profile generator based on matching the characteristics of the transaction profiles and the characteristics of the user data . For example the user data indicates a set of characteristics of the user and the profile selector selects the user specific profile that is for a particular user or a group of users and that best matches the set of characteristics specified by the user data .

In one embodiment the profile selector receives the transaction profiles in a batch mode. The profile selector selects the user specific profile from the batch of transaction profiles based on the user data . Alternatively the profile generator generates the transaction profiles in real time and the profile selector uses the user data to query the profile generator to generate the user specific profile in real time or just in time. The profile generator generates the user specific profile that best matches the user data .

In one embodiment the user tracker identifies the user based on the user activity on the transaction terminal e.g. having visited a set of websites currently visiting a type of web pages search behavior etc. .

In one embodiment the user data includes an identifier of the user such as a global unique identifier GUID a personal account number PAN e.g. credit card number debit card number or other card account number or other identifiers that uniquely and persistently identify the user within a set of identifiers of the same type. Alternatively the user data may include other identifiers such as an Internet Protocol IP address of the user a name or user name of the user or a browser cookie ID which identify the user in a local temporary transient and or anonymous manner. Some of these identifiers of the user may be provided by publishers advertisers ad networks search engines merchants or the user tracker . In one embodiment such identifiers are correlated to the user based on the overlapping or proximity of the time period of their usage to establish an identification reference table.

In one embodiment the identification reference table is used to identify the account information e.g. account number based on characteristics of the user captured in the user data such as browser cookie ID IP addresses and or timestamps on the usage of the IP addresses. In one embodiment the identification reference table is maintained by the operator of the transaction handler . Alternatively the identification reference table is maintained by an entity other than the operator of the transaction handler .

In one embodiment the user tracker determines certain characteristics of the user to describe a type or group of users of which the user is a member. The transaction profile of the group is used as the user specific profile . Examples of such characteristics include geographical location or neighborhood types of online activities specific online activities or merchant propensity. In one embodiment the groups are defined based on aggregate information e.g. by time of day or household or segment e.g. by cluster propensity demographics cluster IDs and or factor values . In one embodiment the groups are defined in part via one or more social networks. For example a group may be defined based on social distances to one or more users on a social network website interactions between users on a social network website and or common data in social network profiles of the users in the social network website.

In one embodiment the user data may match different profiles at a different granularity or resolution e.g. account user family company neighborhood etc. with different degrees of certainty. The profile selector and or the profile generator may determine or select the user specific profile with the finest granularity or resolution with acceptable certainty. Thus the user specific profile is most specific or closely related to the user .

In one embodiment the advertisement selector uses further data in prioritizing selecting generating customizing and adjusting the user specific advertisement data . For example the advertisement selector may use search data in combination with the user specific profile to provide benefits or offers to a user at the point of interaction . For example the user specific profile can be used to personalize the advertisement such as adjusting the placement of the advertisement relative to other advertisements adjusting the appearance of the advertisement etc.

In one embodiment the user data uses browser cookie information to identify the user . The browser cookie information is matched to account information or the account number to identify the user specific profile such as aggregated spending profile to present effective timely and relevant marketing information to the user via the preferred communication channel e.g. mobile communications web mail email POS etc. within a window of time that could influence the spending behavior of the user . Based on the transaction data the user specific profile can improve audience targeting for online advertising. Thus customers will get better advertisements and offers presented to them and the advertisers will achieve better return on investment for their advertisement campaigns.

In one embodiment the browser cookie that identifies the user in online activities such as web browsing online searching and using social networking applications can be matched to an identifier of the user in account data such as the account number of a financial payment card of the user or the account information of the account identification device of the user . In one embodiment the identifier of the user can be uniquely identified via matching IP address timestamp cookie ID and or other user data observed by the user tracker .

In one embodiment a look up table is used to map browser cookie information e.g. IP address timestamp cookie ID to the account data that identifies the user in the transaction handler . The look up table may be established via correlating overlapping or common portions of the user data observed by different entities or different user trackers .

For example in one embodiment a first user tracker observes the card number of the user at a particular IP address for a time period identified by a timestamp e.g. via an online payment process a second user tracker observes the user having a cookie ID at the same IP address for a time period near or overlapping with the time period observed by the first user tracker . Thus the cookie ID as observed by the second user tracker can be linked to the card number of the user as observed by the first user tracker . The first user tracker may be operated by the same entity operating the transaction handler or by a different entity. Once the correlation between the cookie ID and the card number is established via a database or a look up table the cookie ID can be subsequently used to identify the card number of the user and the account data .

In one embodiment the portal is configured to observe a card number of a user while the user uses an IP address to make an online transaction. Thus the portal can identify a consumer account based on correlating an IP address used to identify the user and IP addresses recorded in association with the consumer account .

For example in one embodiment when the user makes a payment online by submitting the account information to the transaction terminal e.g. an online store the transaction handler obtains the IP address from the transaction terminal via the acquirer processor . The transaction handler stores data to indicate the use of the account information at the IP address at the time of the transaction request. When an IP address in the query received in the portal matches the IP address previously recorded by the transaction handler the portal determines that the user identified by the IP address in the request is the same user associated with the account of the transaction initiated at the IP address. In one embodiment a match is found when the time of the query request is within a predetermined time period from the transaction request such as a few minutes one hour a day etc. In one embodiment the query may also include a cookie ID representing the user . Thus through matching the IP address the cookie ID is associated with the account information in a persistent way.

In one embodiment the portal obtains the IP address of the online transaction directly. For example in one embodiment a user chooses to use a password in the account data to protect the account information for online transactions. When the account information is entered into the transaction terminal e.g. an online store or an online shopping cart system the user is connected to the portal for the verification of the password e.g. via a pop up window or via redirecting the web browser of the user . The transaction handler accepts the transaction request after the password is verified via the portal . Through this verification process the portal and or the transaction handler obtain the IP address of the user at the time the account information is used.

In one embodiment the web browser of the user communicates the user provided password to the portal directly without going through the transaction terminal e.g. the server of the merchant . Alternatively the transaction terminal and or the acquirer processor may relay the password communication to the portal or the transaction handler .

In one embodiment the portal is configured to identify the consumer account based on the IP address identified in the user data through mapping the IP address to a street address. For example in one embodiment the user data includes an IP address to identify the user and the portal can use a service to map the IP address to a street address. For example an Internet service provider knows the street address of the currently assigned IP address. Once the street address is identified the portal can use the account data to identify the consumer account that has a current address at the identified street address. Once the consumer account is identified the portal can provide a transaction profile specific to the consumer account of the user .

In one embodiment the portal uses a plurality of methods to identify consumer accounts based on the user data . The portal combines the results from the different methods to determine the most likely consumer account for the user data .

Details about the identification of consumer account based on user data in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 849 798 filed Aug. 3 2010 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011 0093327 and entitled Systems and Methods to Match Identifiers the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the correlator is used to close the loop for the tracking of consumer behavior across an on line activity and an off line activity that results at least in part from the on line activity. In one embodiment online activities such as searching web browsing social networking and or consuming online advertisements are correlated with respective transactions to generate the correlation result in . The respective transactions may occur offline in brick and mortar retail stores or online but in a context outside the online activities such as a credit card purchase that is performed in a way not visible to a search company that facilitates the search activities.

The correlator is configured in one embodiment to identify transactions resulting from searches or online advertisements. For example in response to a query about the user from the user tracker the correlator identifies an offline transaction performed by the user and sends the correlation result about the offline transaction to the user tracker which allows the user tracker to combine the information about the offline transaction and the online activities to provide significant marketing advantages.

For example a marketing department could correlate an advertising budget to actual sales. For example a marketer can use the correlation result to study the effect of certain prioritization strategies customization schemes etc. on the impact on the actual sales. For example the correlation result can be used to adjust or prioritize advertisement placement on a web site a search engine a social networking site an online marketplace or the like.

In one embodiment the profile generator uses the correlation result to augment the transaction profiles with data indicating the rate of conversion from searches or advertisements to purchase transactions. In one embodiment the correlation result is used to generate predictive models to determine what a user is likely to purchase when the user is searching using certain keywords or when the user is presented with an advertisement or offer. In one embodiment the portal is configured to report the correlation result to a partner such as a search engine a publisher or a merchant to allow the partner to use the correlation result to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and or search result customization to arrange rewards etc.

In one embodiment the correlator matches the online activities and the transactions based on matching the user data provided by the user tracker and the records of the transactions such as transaction data or transaction records . In another embodiment the correlator matches the online activities and the transactions based on the redemption of offers benefits provided in the user specific advertisement data .

In one embodiment the portal is configured to receive a set of conditions and an identification of the user determine whether there is any transaction of the user that satisfies the set of conditions and if so provide indications of the transactions that satisfy the conditions and or certain details about the transactions which allows the requester to correlate the transactions with certain user activities such as searching web browsing consuming advertisements etc.

In one embodiment the requester may not know the account number of the user and the portal is to map the identifier provided in the request to the account number of the user to provide the requested information. Examples of the identifier being provided in the request to identify the user include an identification of an iFrame of a web page visited by the user a browser cookie ID an IP address and the day and time corresponding to the use of the IP address etc.

The information provided by the portal can be used in pre purchase marketing activities such as customizing content or offers prioritizing content or offers selecting content or offers etc. based on the spending pattern of the user . The content that is customized prioritized selected or recommended may be the search results blog entries items for sale etc.

The information provided by the portal can be used in post purchase activities. For example the information can be used to correlate an offline purchase with online activities. For example the information can be used to determine purchases made in response to media events such as television programs advertisements news announcements etc.

In one embodiment the transaction handler uses the account data to store information for third party loyalty programs.

In one embodiment the association between the account identifier and the loyalty benefit offeror in the account data indicates that the user having the account identifier is a member of the loyalty program. Thus the user may use the account identifier to access privileges afforded to the members of the loyalty programs such as rights to access a member only area facility store product or service discounts extended only to members or opportunities to participate in certain events buy certain items or receive certain services reserved for members.

In one embodiment it is not necessary to make a purchase to use the privileges. The user may enjoy the privileges based on the status of being a member of the loyalty program. The user may use the account identifier to show the status of being a member of the loyalty program.

In one embodiment when the account identifier is used to identify the user as a member to access member privileges the transaction handler stores information about the access of the corresponding member privilege in loyalty record . The profile generator may use the information accumulated in the loyalty record to enhance transaction profiles and provide the user with personalized targeted advertisements with or without further offers of benefit e.g. discounts incentives rebates cash back rewards etc. .

In one embodiment the association of the account identifier and the loyalty benefit offeror also allows the loyalty benefit offeror to access at least a portion of the account data relevant to the loyalty program such as the loyalty record and certain information about the user such as name address and other demographic data.

In one embodiment the loyalty program allows the user to accumulate benefits according to loyalty program rules such as reward points cash back levels of discounts etc. For example the user may accumulate reward points for transactions that satisfy the loyalty program rules and the user may use the reward points to redeem cash gift discounts etc. In one embodiment the loyalty record stores the accumulated benefits and the transaction handler updates the loyalty record associated with the loyalty benefit offeror and the account identifier when events that satisfy the loyalty program rules occur.

In one embodiment the accumulated benefits as indicated in the loyalty record can be redeemed when the account identifier is used to perform a payment transaction when the payment transaction satisfies the loyalty program rules. For example the user may redeem a number of points to offset or reduce an amount of the purchase price.

A method to provide loyalty programs of one embodiment includes the use of the transaction handler as part of a computing apparatus. The computing apparatus processes a plurality of payment card transactions. After the computing apparatus receives a request to track transactions for a loyalty program such as the loyalty program rules the computing apparatus stores and updates loyalty program information in response to transactions occurring in the loyalty program. The computing apparatus provides to a customer e.g. an offer of a benefit when the customer satisfies a condition defined in the loyalty program such as the loyalty program rules . In one embodiment the loyalty benefit as identified in the loyalty record can be redeemed in connection with a transaction in a way the benefit of an offer stored in association with the account identifier is redeemed.

In one embodiment the transaction handler is configured to cooperate with the media controller to facilitate real time interaction with the user when the payment of the user is being processed by the transaction handler . The real time interaction provides the opportunity to impact the user experience during the purchase e.g. at the time of card swipe through delivering messages in real time to a point of interaction such as a mobile phone a personal digital assistant a portable computer etc. The real time message can be delivered via short message service SMS email instant messaging or other communications protocols.

In one embodiment the real time message is provided without requiring modifications to existing systems used by the merchants and or issuers.

In one embodiment the media controller is to provide the message to the point of interaction in parallel with the transaction handler providing the response to the authorization request.

In one embodiment the point of interaction receives the message from the media controller in real time with the transaction handler processing the authorization request. In one embodiment the message is to arrive at the point of interaction in the context of the response provided from the transaction handler to the transaction terminal . For example the message is to arrive at the point of interaction substantially at the same time as the response to the authorization request arrives at the transaction terminal or with a delay not long enough to cause the user to have the impression that the message is in response to an action other than the payment transaction. For example the message is to arrive at the point of interaction prior to the user completing the transaction and leaving the transaction terminal or prior to the user leaving the retail location of the merchant operating the transaction terminal .

For example in one embodiment the portal allows the user to register the communication reference in association with the account data such as the account information of the consumer account and the media controller is to use the communication reference to deliver the message to the point of interaction . Examples of the communication reference include a mobile phone number an email address a user identifier of an instant messaging system an IP address etc.

In one embodiment the portal allows merchants and or other parties to define rules to provide offers as real time responses to authorization requests and based on the offer rules the message broker is to generate or instruct the media controller to generate the real time message to provide the offers to the user . For example the offer may include a discount incentive reward rebate gift or other benefit which can be redeemed upon the satisfaction of certain conditions required by the offer rules . In one embodiment based on the offer rules the message broker configures a message by selecting the appropriate message template from an existing message s template s and inserts any relevant data e.g. the communication reference into the selected template then passes the configured message to the media controller which delivers the message to the point of interaction . In one embodiment the message broker or a subsystem is used to manage message templates along with the rules for selecting the appropriate message template from among several potential choices.

In one embodiment the offer rules include offer details targeting rules advertisement campaign details profile mapping creative mapping qualification rules award notify fulfillment rules approvals etc. Creative elements for offers include text images channels approvals etc.

In one embodiment when the offer rules are activated by the merchant or advertiser via the portal the message broker is to generate trigger records for the transaction handler . The transaction handler is to monitor the incoming authorization requests to identify requests that satisfy the conditions specified in the trigger records during the process of the authorization requests and to provide the information about the identified requests to the message broker for the transmission of an appropriate real time message in accordance with the offer rules .

In one embodiment the generation of the trigger records for the transaction handler is in real time with the merchant or advertiser activating the offer rules . Thus the offer rules can be activated and used for the detection of the new authorization requests in real time while the transaction handler continues to process the incoming authorization requests.

In one embodiment the portal provides information about the spending behaviors reflected in the transaction data to assist the merchants or advertisers to target offers or advertisements. For example in one embodiment the portal allows merchants to target the offers based on transaction profiles . For example the offer rules are partially based on the values in a transaction profile such as an aggregated spending profile . In one embodiment the offer rules are partially based on the information about the last purchase of the user from the merchant operating the transaction terminal or another merchant and or the information about the location of the user such as the location determined based on the location of the transaction terminal and or the location of the merchant operating the transaction terminal .

In one embodiment the portal provides transaction based statistics such as merchant benchmarking statistics industry market segmentation etc. to assist merchants and advertisers to identify customers.

Thus the real time messages can be used to influence customer behaviors while the customers are in the purchase mode.

In one embodiment the benefit of the offers can be redeemed via the transaction handler . The redemption of the offer may or may not require the purchase details e.g. SKU level purchase details . Details in one embodiment about redeeming offers via the transaction handler are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 113 710 filed May 23 2011 and entitled Systems and Methods for Redemption of Offers the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment when the authorization request for a purchase indicates that the purchase qualifies the offer for redemption if the purchase corresponding to the authorization request is completed the message broker is to construct a message and use the media controller to deliver the message in real time with the processing of the authorization request to the point of interaction . The message informs the user that when the purchase is completed the transaction handler and or the issuer processor is to provide the benefit of the offer to the user via statement credit or some other settlement value for example points in a registered loyalty program or credit at the point of sale using a digital coupon delivered to the purchaser via mobile phone.

In one embodiment the settlement of the payment transaction corresponding to the authorization request does not occur in real time with the processing of the authorization request. For example the merchant may submit the complete purchases for settlement at the end of the day or in accordance with a predetermined schedule. The settlement may occur one or more days after the processing of the authorization request.

In one embodiment when transactions are settled the settled transactions are matched to the authorization requests to identify offers that are redeemable in view of the settlement. When the offer is confirmed to be redeemable based on a record of successful settlement the message broker is to use the media controller to provide a message to the point of interaction of the user such as the mobile phone of the user . In one embodiment the message is to inform the user of the benefit to be provided as statement credits and or to provide additional offers. In one embodiment the message to confirm the statement credits is transmitted in real time with the completion of the transaction settlement.

In one embodiment the message broker is to determine the identity of the merchant based on the information included in the authorization request transmitted from the transaction terminal to the transaction handler . In one embodiment the identity of the merchant is normalized to allow the application of the offer rules that are merchant specific.

Details on real time messages in one embodiment are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 8 359 274 issued Jan. 22 2013 and entitled Systems and Methods to Provide Messages in Real Time with Transaction Processing the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment real time information about transactions is communicated to a remote computing device such as a merchant aggregator which has a plurality of merchants as clients. The computing device is connected to the portal of the transaction handler a communication network e.g. Internet a wide area network or a dedicate network to receive the real time information and provide services to the merchants and their customers.

In one embodiment the remote computing device such as the merchant aggregator is configured to provide offers to customers e.g. user on behalf of the merchants service loyalty programs on behalf of the merchants and or provide rewards to customers e.g. user for their interaction with the merchants etc. The real time information about the transactions between the merchants and the customers allows the remote computing device to provide new services and improve existing services.

In one embodiment the computing device remotely connected to the portal such as a merchant aggregator is configured to enroll merchants and or customers e.g. user to provide services based on the real time information about transactions between the merchants and the customers e.g. user . However the identifiers used by the portal to identify the enrolled merchants are generally different from merchant identifies used by the transaction handler in processing transactions initiated using the transaction terminals e.g. of the merchants. Thus the identifiers used by the portal to identify the enrolled merchants may not be sufficient to identify the transactions between the enrolled merchants and the enrolled customers.

In one embodiment the portal of the transaction handler is configured to match the identities of the merchants as known to the remote computing device such as the merchant aggregator with the identities of the merchants as known to the transaction handler to facilitate the monitoring of transactions of the merchants and to generate the real time information about the transactions between the respective merchants and enrolled customers e.g. user .

In one embodiment the portal is configured to link a merchant identifier of a merchant as known to the remote computing device to a merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the transaction handler via a transaction made using a transaction terminal of the merchant. Information about the transaction is communicated between the portal and the remote computing device in association with the merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the remote computing device to identify the transaction from the transactions processed the transaction handler and thus link the merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the remote computing device to the merchant identifier used in the identified transaction.

Alternatively or in combination the portal is configured to link the merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the remote computing device to the merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the transaction handler based at least in part on marching attributes of the merchant such as name address business category etc.

For example when a merchant enrolls or registers with the remote computing device to receive the services of the remote computing device the remote computing device is configured to collect information about the merchant such as the business name of the merchant the street address of the merchant the business category of the merchant etc. Such information about the merchant can be matched with the respective merchant information in the data warehouse stored for the merchants as known to the transaction handler . Different data fields such as name address business field may provide partial match for a given merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the remote computing device and a rule engine is configured in one embodiment to rank the degree of match and select one or more top ranked candidate merchant identifiers as used in transactions processed by the transaction handler .

In one embodiment a transaction is initiated on a transaction terminal of a merchant as part of the process to register or enroll the merchant for the services of the remote computing device. The transaction is identified as part of information about the merchant in association with the merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the remote computing device. The merchant identifier used in the transaction is thus linked to the merchant identifier of the merchant as known to the remote computing device. Thus transactions of the merchant can be monitored using the merchant identifier used in the transaction formed as part of the process to register or enroll the merchant.

In one embodiment the transaction formed as part of the process to register or enroll the merchant is performed in a predetermined account. The information about the transaction is provided to the portal to allow the portal to identify a transaction record for the transaction based on attributes such as the date and or time of the transaction the transaction amount an authorization code for the transaction and a message e.g. a pseudo promotional code transmitted to the transaction handler in an authorization request for the transaction etc. The portal is configured to identify the transaction record e.g. of the transaction based on matching the attributes as identified in the information transmitted from the remote computing device to the portal .

In one embodiment the portal is configured to communicate with the remote computing device to determine one or more parameters of the transaction performed on the transaction terminal of a merchant to enroll or register the merchant. Examples of the parameters that can be configured to uniquely identify merchants to be enrolled include transaction amounts pseudo promotional code etc. After one or more parameters are determined to uniquely identify the merchant among a set of merchants currently in the process of being enrolled or registered the transaction terminal is used to initiate the transaction according to the one or more parameters and the transaction handler is configured to monitor transactions being processed to detect the transaction initiate the transaction according to the one or more parameters. In response to the detection of authorization request initiated on the transaction terminal of the merchant for the transaction made according to the one or more parameters the merchant identifier used in the authorization request is extracted and linked to the merchant as registered and or enrolled.

In one embodiment enrollment communication between the portal and the remote computing device includes not only the identification information about the merchant but also the identification information of the transaction terminal used to initiate the transaction designed to register the merchant and or the transaction terminal . In one embodiment information about the transaction terminal includes an identifier of the transaction terminal e.g. a serial number a location of the transaction terminal e.g. a street address of a retail store in which the transaction terminal is deployed a GPS position of the transaction terminal a description of the location of the transaction terminal within a retail store in which a plurality of transaction terminals e.g. of the merchant are located .

In one embodiment multiple transactions are performed to individually identify the transaction terminals of the merchant. Thus the transaction handler can monitor the transactions made using specific transaction terminals of the merchant and or provide information about the transaction terminals on which the monitored transactions are initiated.

In one embodiment when an authorization request for a transaction made using the one or more parameters assigned to uniquely identify the merchant and or the transaction terminal of the merchant is detected the transaction handler is configured to communicate with the portal to provide a response to indicate the detection of the transaction. For example in one embodiment the transaction handler is configured to provide an indication via the authorization response to indicate the recognition of the merchant and or the transaction terminal . For example in one embodiment the portal is configured to provide a message to the remote computing device to indicate the successful detection of transaction associated with the merchant and or the transaction terminal and completion of the registration or enrollment process.

In one embodiment when the merchant aggregator enrolls a new merchant the merchant aggregator provides merchant information to the portal of the transaction handler to request the portal and or the transaction handler to monitor the transactions of the respective merchant .

In one embodiment the merchant information used by the merchant aggregator to identify the merchant may include the business data e.g. corporation data corporation name consumer facing name doing business as names names of affiliates and or subsidiaries addresses and store locations etc. of the merchant . In one embodiment the merchant information further includes information about the acquirer representing the merchant merchant category and or other relevant information that is helpful in identifying the merchant in the transaction processing network having the transaction handler interconnecting acquirer processors e.g. operated by acquirers representing respective merchants and issuer processors e.g. operated by issuers representing respective users of consumer accounts .

For example in one embodiment the merchant aggregator provides the merchant information via a spreadsheet identifying a list of merchants . In the spreadsheet each merchant is identified via the corporate name of the merchant and the consumer facing name of the merchant. For less well known merchants e.g. small businesses the spreadsheet further identifies the name of the acquiring bank that represents the merchant in processing transactions to be processed via the transaction handler . In one embodiment the spreadsheet further includes the desired starting date of monitoring the transactions of the merchants identified in the spreadsheet and the expected ending date of monitoring the transactions of the merchant for the merchant aggregator .

In one embodiment the portal is configured to provide a user interface that allows the merchant aggregator to specify data for the creation of the trigger records associated with an offer campaign. For example the user interface in one embodiment allows the merchant aggregator to create an offer campaign associated with one of the merchants identified in the spreadsheet provided to identify the merchants . To support the offer campaign the user interface is configured to allow the merchant aggregator to specify rules to monitor the transactions of the respect merchant . For example the rules may identify a date to start testing of the monitoring of the transactions of the merchant a date to send the monitoring of the transactions of the merchant for the purpose of the offer campaign a request for a notification of transactions provided in real time as the processing of the authorization requests of the respective transactions of the merchant and or a request for a notification of transactions provided in real time as the processing of the settlement requests of the respective transactions of the merchant . In one embodiment the user interface further allows the merchant aggregator to specify other requirements to select transactions to be monitored such as requirements based on transaction amount transaction time characteristics of the user purchasing from the merchant etc. In one embodiment the user interface further allows the merchant aggregator to specify messages to be transmitted in a way as illustrated in to the respective user transacting with the merchant in response to the transactions detected according to the offer rules.

In one embodiment the portal is configured to correctly identify transactions associated with the enrolled merchant based on the merchant information and calculate the location of the transactions to enable location based services associated with the offer of the merchant .

In one embodiment based on the merchant information the portal is configured to identify one or more merchant IDs that are configured to be used in authorization requests for transactions of the merchant identified by the merchant information . The identified merchant ID is used to generate the trigger records for monitoring the transactions of the merchant identified by the merchant information provided by the merchant aggregator .

In one embodiment the account holders e.g. user are required to enroll with the system to provide the consent for the media controller to send the transaction information of the account holders e.g. user to the merchant aggregator and for the media controller and or the merchant aggregator to send messages to the point of interaction of the user based on the transaction information.

In after user enrollment the user of the consumer account is identified to be associated with a user ID used by the merchant aggregator to identify the user . The user may further provide the communication reference to the merchant aggregator to receive offers rewards notifications alerts etc. The transaction handler is configured to use the trigger records containing the account number of the user to detect the transactions of the user e.g. the transactions between the user between one or more the enrolled merchants e.g. .

To associate the account number with the user ID in one embodiment the account number of the consumer account of the user is identified to the portal during the user enrollment and stored in the data warehouse in association with the user ID .

For example during the user enrollment process the point of interaction e.g. a web browser a mobile phone of the user interacting with the merchant aggregator is redirected in one embodiment from the merchant aggregator to the portal with a reference to the user ID and in response the portal provides a user interface to the point of interaction of the user to specify the account number . After the account number specified by the user is validated and or authenticated e.g. via security code person identification number security questions security devices etc. the account number is associated with the user ID in the data warehouse of the transaction handler .

In one embodiment more than one account number of the consumer accounts of the user can be associated with the single user ID used by the merchant aggregator to represent the user .

In one embodiment the user ID is assigned to the user by the merchant aggregator during the enrollment process. Alternatively the portal may generate and assign the user ID for the user during the enrollment process and provide the user ID to the merchant aggregator to complete the enrollment of the user .

In one embodiment during the enrollment process the user provides the account number to the merchant aggregator which indicates the association between the account number and the user ID to the portal of the transaction handler and the user ID is subsequently used to identify the user is messages to the merchant aggregator . Alternatively the account number may be used directly to identify the user when the real time message from the media controller to the merchant aggregator is transmitted over a secure communication channel.

In one embodiment the trigger record is generated based at least in part on the account number and the merchant ID to monitor the transactions between the user and the merchant . When the authorization request from the transaction terminal of the merchant identifies the account number and the merchant ID as required by the trigger record and satisfies other requirements of the trigger record such as requirements related to the date and time of the transaction the amount of the transaction etc. the transaction handler causes the message broker to generate a message and transmit the message to the merchant aggregator in real time with the processing of the transaction to inform the merchant aggregator of the transaction.

In one embodiment the data warehouse stores the merchant location for the merchant ID associated with the transaction terminal .

In one embodiment in response to the authorization request from the transaction terminal the merchant location of the transaction terminal is determined and included in the real time message generated by the message broker and provided to the merchant aggregator in a generic machine readable format e.g. XML . Based on the information provided in the real time message the merchant aggregator may use the communication reference to communicate offers rewards messages notifications alerts etc. to the point of interaction of the user such as via messages to a mobile phone identified by the communication reference and or a mobile application running on the mobile phone of the user .

In the merchant aggregator is configured to communicate with the point of interaction of the user in response to the real time message from the media controller . Alternatively or in combination the data warehouse may store the communication reference which is used by the media controller to provide one or more separate real time messages related to location based offers to the point of interaction of the user without going through the merchant aggregator .

In one embodiment a merchant may have a number of subsidiaries with different names and locations. In response to the merchant information merchant data related to merchant accounts are searched to identify a set of possible matches to the merchant information which may be further communicated to the merchant aggregator for confirmation. For example in one embodiment each matched merchant ID is augmented with the respective address of the transaction terminals operated by the respective merchant entity and the merchant may further confirm the enrollment of the respective merchant entity. In one embodiment the names and addresses of the merchant information are matched with the names and addresses of the merchant data for merchant accounts to identify the merchant entity that is enrolled via the merchant information .

In one embodiment a plurality of merchant IDs may match the merchant information specified by the merchant aggregator and one or more merchant locations corresponding to the locations of the transaction terminals may associate with a merchant ID in the data warehouse . When the trigger record matches a transaction the merchant location corresponding to the transaction terminal from which the authorization request is received is used for the location based service provided by the merchant aggregator and or the message broker .

In when the merchant enrolls with the merchant aggregator the merchant enrollment data including the merchant information is generated to identify the names and locations of the enrolled merchant . The merchant aggregator uses the merchant identifier to represent the enrolled merchant .

In one embodiment to correlate the merchant identifier with a merchant ID associated with the merchant account the transaction terminal at the enrolled location of the merchant is used to initiate a transaction using a predetermined account number . After the transaction is initiated the acquirer processor connected to the transaction terminal provides the authorization request to the transaction handler which stores the transaction record that includes the predetermined account number the merchant ID the date of the transaction the amount of the transaction the authorization code provided by the transaction handler through the acquirer processor to the transaction terminal for the transaction etc.

In one embodiment the merchant aggregator stores a separate transaction record including certain information about the transaction as identified by the enrolling merchant such as the predetermined account number the date or the time period in which transaction is performed the amount and the authorization code received by the transaction terminal through the acquirer processor and the transaction handler for the transaction etc.

In the portal is configured to match the transaction records and to link the merchant ID to the merchant identifier using one or more sets of corresponding fields of the transaction records and .

For example during the enrollment period the portal is configured to retrieve transactions records for the predetermined account number from the data warehouse and the merchant aggregator is configured to provide its transaction record with the merchant identifier to the portal . The portal is configured to match the transaction records and based on the account number the transaction date and or the transaction amount . When a match is detected the merchant ID and the identifier of the transaction terminal from the transaction record generated by the transaction handler is linked to the merchant identifier associated with the transaction record stored by the merchant aggregator .

Using the system of the merchant can selectively enroll certain transaction terminals operated under certain names and or at certain locations. Thus the merchant may enroll a portion of the transaction terminals under the control of the merchant but not another portion of the transaction terminals under the control of the merchant . Different transaction terminals e.g. of a merchant may have different merchant ID and or transaction terminal IDs. Through transactions initiated using the different transaction terminals of the merchant the merchant identifier representing an enrolled merchant is linked to the different merchant ID and or transaction terminal IDs as used in authorization request for the transactions made using respective transaction terminals of the corresponding enrolled merchant.

In one embodiment the transaction record further includes the location information of the transaction terminal which can be used for location based services. For example in reporting the transaction initiated via using the predetermined account number at the transaction terminal the merchant may specify the location of the transaction terminal via a mobile device a mobile application a map application or a street address. Thus the location of the transaction terminal is associated with the merchant ID and or the transaction terminal .

In one embodiment the data warehouse stores location information of transaction terminal e.g. as reported by the acquirer processor and provides the location information to the merchant aggregator after the merchant ID is linked to the merchant identifier via the transaction record for the transaction initiated on the transaction terminal .

In one embodiment during the enrollment process the merchant aggregator instructs the merchant to perform the transaction according to the data stored in the transaction record and provides the transaction record to the portal . In response the portal generates a trigger record to detect the transaction that is subsequently initiated by the merchant at the transaction terminal . In one embodiment the trigger record is configured to cause the portal to link the merchant ID from the transaction record of the identified transaction with the merchant identifier associated with the transaction record used to generate the trigger record .

In one embodiment during the enrollment process the merchant aggregator is configured to request the portal to generate a set of transaction parameters to temporarily identify a transaction terminal of a merchant . The portal is configured to transmit the parameters to the merchant aggregator as part of the transaction record for initiation of the transaction. Examples of the parameters include the transaction amount a pseudo promotional code to be transmitted in an authorization request initiated in the transaction terminal . After the parameters are transmitted to the merchant aggregator the transaction handler is configured to monitor transactions to detect the transaction made in the predetermined account using the parameters provided to the merchant aggregator . Thus as soon as the authorization request for the expected transaction reaches the transaction handler the portal can identify the merchant ID and or the transaction terminal ID of the respective transaction terminal from the received authorization request for association with the transaction terminal of the merchant to be enrolled.

In one embodiment the transaction handler is configured to monitor and detect a plurality of transactions initiated to enroll a plurality of different merchants and or different transaction terminals of the enrolled merchants. To separately identify the merchants and or the transaction terminals the portal and or the merchant aggregator are configured to select the transaction parameters e.g. transaction amounts as temporary unique identifiers of the merchants and or transaction terminals. A data warehouse e.g. is configured to store data associating the temporary unique identifiers with the merchants and or transaction terminals. After a transaction is performed and detected the temporary association between the corresponding transaction parameters with the merchants and or transaction terminals can be removed and or reused for the identification of further merchants and or transaction terminals.

In one embodiment the transaction parameters configured as temporary identifiers of the enrolled merchants and or transaction terminals are used to create trigger records to detect the subsequent authorization requests initiated from the corresponding transaction terminals of the enrolled merchants.

Some details about enrolling a merchant for communication via a merchant aggregator can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 624 778 filed Sep. 21 2012 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2013 0073464 and entitled Systems and Methods to Communicate via a Merchant Aggregator the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment at least some of the profile generator correlator profile selector and advertisement selector are controlled by the entity that operates the transaction handler . In another embodiment at least some of the profile generator correlator profile selector and advertisement selector are not controlled by the entity that operates the transaction handler .

In one embodiment the products and or services purchased by the user are also identified by the information transmitted from the merchants or service providers. Thus the transaction data may include identification of the individual products and or services which allows the profile generator to generate transaction profiles with fine granularity or resolution. In one embodiment the granularity or resolution may be at a level of distinct products and services that can be purchased e.g. stock keeping unit SKU level or category or type of products or services or vendor of products or services etc.

In one embodiment the entity operating the transaction handler provides the intelligence information in real time as the request for the intelligence information occurs. In other embodiments the entity operating the transaction handler may provide the intelligence information in batch mode. The intelligence information can be delivered via online communications e.g. via an application programming interface API on a website or other information server or via physical transportation of a computer readable media that stores the data representing the intelligence information.

In one embodiment the intelligence information is communicated to various entities in the system in a way similar to and or in parallel with the information flow in the transaction system to move money. The transaction handler routes the information in the same way it routes the currency involved in the transactions.

In one embodiment the portal provides a user interface to allow the user to select items offered on different merchant websites and store the selected items in a wish list for comparison reviewing purchasing tracking etc. The information collected via the wish list can be used to improve the transaction profiles and derive intelligence on the needs of the user and targeted advertisements can be delivered to the user via the wish list user interface provided by the portal . Examples of user interface systems to manage wish lists are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 683 802 filed Jan. 7 2010 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010 0174623 and entitled System and Method for Managing Items of Interest Selected from Online Merchants the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the characteristics of transaction patterns of customers are profiled via clusters factors and or categories of purchases. The transaction data may include transaction records and in one embodiment an aggregated spending profile is generated from the transaction records in a way illustrated in to summarize the spending behavior reflected in the transaction records .

In each of the transaction records is for a particular transaction processed by the transaction handler . Each of the transaction records provides information about the particular transaction such as the account number of the consumer account used to pay for the purchase the date and or time of the transaction the amount of the transaction the ID of the merchant who receives the payment the category of the merchant the channel through which the purchase was made etc. Examples of channels include online offline in store via phone etc. In one embodiment the transaction records may further include a field to identify a type of transaction such as card present card not present etc.

A card present transaction typically involves physically presenting the account identification device such as a financial transaction card to the merchant e.g. via swiping a credit card at a POS terminal of a merchant and a card not present transaction typically involves presenting the account information of the consumer account to the merchant to identify the consumer account without physically presenting the account identification device to the merchant or the transaction terminal .

The transaction records of one embodiment may further include details about the products and or services involved in the purchase.

When there is voluminous data representing the transaction records the spending patterns reflected in the transaction records can be difficult to recognize by an ordinary person.

In the voluminous transaction records are summarized into aggregated spending profiles e.g. to concisely present the statistical spending characteristics reflected in the transaction records . The aggregated spending profile uses values derived from statistical analysis to present the statistical characteristics of transaction records of an entity in a way easy to understand by an ordinary person.

In the transaction records are summarized via factor analysis to condense the variables e.g. and via cluster analysis to segregate entities by spending patterns.

In a set of variables e.g. are defined based on the parameters recorded in the transaction records . The variables e.g. and are defined in a way to have meanings easily understood by an ordinary person. For example variables measure the aggregated spending in super categories variables measure the spending frequencies in various areas and variables measure the spending amounts in various areas. In one embodiment each of the areas is identified by a merchant category e.g. as represented by a merchant category code MCC a North American Industry Classification System NAILS code or a similarly standardized category code . In other embodiments an area may be identified by a product category a SKU number etc.

Examples of the spending frequency variables and spending amount variables defined for various merchant categories e.g. 306 in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 537 566 filed Aug. 7 2009 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010 0306029 and entitled Cardholder Clusters and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 777 173 filed May 10 2010 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010 0306032 and entitled Systems and Methods to Summarize Transaction Data the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In the aggregation includes the application of the definitions for these variables e.g. and to the transaction records to generate the variable values . The transaction records are aggregated to generate aggregated measurements e.g. variable values that are not specific to a particular transaction such as frequencies of purchases made with different merchants or different groups of merchants the amounts spent with different merchants or different groups of merchants and the number of unique purchases across different merchants or different groups of merchants etc. The aggregation can be performed for a particular time period and for entities at various levels.

The transaction records can be aggregated according to a buying entity or a selling entity. For example the aggregation can be performed at account level person level family level company level neighborhood level city level region level etc. to analyze the spending patterns across various areas e.g. sellers products or services for the respective aggregated buying entity. For example the transaction records for a particular merchant having transactions with multiple accounts can be aggregated for a merchant level analysis. For example the transaction records for a particular merchant group can be aggregated for a merchant group level analysis. The aggregation can be formed separately for different types of transactions such as transactions made online offline via phone and or card present transactions vs. card not present transactions which can be used to identify the spending pattern differences among different types of transactions.

In the variable values e.g. . . . associated with an entity ID are considered the random samples of the respective variables e.g. sampled for the instance of an entity represented by the entity ID . Statistical analyses e.g. factor analysis and cluster analysis are performed to identify the patterns and correlations in the random samples.

Once the cluster definitions are obtained from the cluster analysis the identity of the cluster e.g. cluster ID that contains the entity ID can be used to characterize spending behavior of the entity represented by the entity ID . The entities in the same cluster are considered to have similar spending behaviors.

In the random variables e.g. and as defined by the definitions have certain degrees of correlation and are not independent from each other. For example merchants of different merchant categories e.g. may have overlapping business or have certain business relationships. For example certain products and or services of certain merchants have cause and effect relationships. For example certain products and or services of certain merchants are mutually exclusive to a certain degree e.g. a purchase from one merchant may have a level of probability to exclude the user from making a purchase from another merchant . Such relationships may be complex and difficult to quantify by merely inspecting the categories. Further such relationships may shift over time as the economy changes.

In a factor analysis is performed to reduce the redundancy and or correlation among the variables e.g. . The factor analysis identifies the definitions for factors each of which represents a combination of the variables e.g. . A factor from the factor analysis is a linear combination of a plurality of the aggregated measurements e.g. variables determined for various areas e.g. merchants or merchant categories products or product categories . Once the relationship between the factors and the aggregated measurements is determined via factor analysis the values for the factors can be determined from the linear combinations of the aggregated measurements and be used in a transaction profile or to provide information on the behavior of the entity represented by the entity ID e.g. an account an individual a family .

Once the factor definitions are obtained from the factor analysis the factor definitions can be applied to the variable values to determine factor values for the aggregated spending profile . Since redundancy and correlation are reduced in the factors the number of factors is typically much smaller than the number of the original variables e.g. . Thus the factor values represent the concise summary of the original variables e.g. .

For example there may be thousands of variables on spending frequency and amount for different merchant categories and the factor analysis can reduce the factor number to less than one hundred and even less than twenty . In one example a twelve factor solution is obtained which allows the use of twelve factors to combine the thousands of the original variables and thus the spending behavior in thousands of merchant categories can be summarized via twelve factor values . In one embodiment each factor is combination of at least four variables and a typical variable has contributions to more than one factor.

In an aggregated spending profile for an entity represented by an entity ID e.g. includes the cluster ID and factor values determined based on the cluster definitions and the factor definitions . The aggregated spending profile may further include other statistical parameters such as diversity index channel distribution category distribution zip code etc. as further discussed below.

In general an aggregated spending profile may include more or fewer fields than those illustrated in . For example in one embodiment the aggregated spending profile further includes an aggregated spending amount for a period of time e.g. the past twelve months in another embodiment the aggregated spending profile does not include the category distribution and in a further embodiment the aggregated spending profile may include a set of distance measures to the centroids of the clusters.

In data from related accounts are combined recurrent installment transactions are combined and account data are selected according to a set of criteria related to activity consistency diversity etc.

In the computation models e.g. as represented by the variable definitions are applied to the remaining account data e.g. transaction records to obtain data samples for the variables. The data points associated with the entities other than those whose transactions fail to meet the minimum requirements for activity consistency diversity etc. are used in factor analysis and cluster analysis .

In the data samples e.g. variable values are used to perform factor analysis to identify factor solutions e.g. factor definitions . The factor solutions can be adjusted to improve similarity in factor values of different sets of transaction data .

The data samples can also be used to perform cluster analysis to identify cluster solutions e.g. cluster definitions . The cluster solutions can be adjusted to improve similarity in cluster identifications based on different sets of transaction data . For example cluster definitions can be applied to the transactions in the time period under analysis e.g. the past twelve months and be applied separately to the transactions in a prior time period e.g. the twelve months before the past twelve months to obtain two sets of cluster identifications for various entities. The cluster definitions can be adjusted to improve the correlation between the two set of cluster identifications.

Optionally human understandable characteristics of the factors and clusters are identified to name the factors and clusters. For example when the spending behavior of a cluster appears to be the behavior of an internet loyalist the cluster can be named internet loyalist such that if a cardholder is found to be in the internet loyalist cluster the spending preferences and patterns of the cardholder can be easily perceived.

In one embodiment the factor analysis and the cluster analysis are performed periodically e.g. once a year or six months to update the factor definitions and the cluster definitions which may change as the economy and the society change over time.

In transaction data are summarized using the factor solutions and cluster solutions to generate the aggregated spending profile . The aggregated spending profile can be updated more frequently than the factor solutions and cluster solutions when the new transaction data becomes available. For example the aggregated spending profile may be updated quarterly or monthly.

Details about aggregated spending profile in one embodiment are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 777 173 filed May 10 2010 assigned U.S. Pat. App. Pub.

In this description some functions and operations are described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However such expressions are also used to specify that the functions result from execution of the code instructions by a processor such as a microprocessor.

Alternatively or in combination the functions and operations as described here can be implemented using special purpose circuitry with or without software instructions such as using Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA . Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions or in combination with software instructions. Thus the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

While one embodiment can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer readable media used to actually effect the distribution.

At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied at least in part in software. That is the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor such as a microprocessor executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory such as ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory cache or a remote storage device.

Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. The computer programs typically include one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.

The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory and or cache. Portions of this software and or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically just in time when needed for execution. Thus it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.

Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non recordable type media such as volatile and non volatile memory devices read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory devices floppy and other removable disks magnetic disk storage media optical storage media e.g. Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROMS Digital Versatile Disks DVDs etc. among others. The computer readable media may store the instructions.

The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical optical acoustical or other forms of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. However propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.

In general a machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form accessible by a machine e.g. a computer network device personal digital assistant manufacturing tool any device with a set of one or more processors etc. .

In various embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.
