The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless communication systems and to systems and methods for deployment operations of small cells in self organizing networks.

Growth in wireless communication continues to increase. Demand for data services with high data bandwidth requirements has led to the introduction of multiple modulation techniques for wireless communication such as Long Term Evolution LTE LTE Advanced High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA and CDMA2000 1xEV DO Evolution Data Optimized or EVDO . Additionally deployment of small cells such as picocells and femtocells has become increasingly desirable for providing coverage. Small cells may be deployed for example in areas having high user density such as airports or event venues or areas with poor coverage by macro base stations. A small cell base stations may have for example a 100 meter coverage radius. Both voice and data modes are desired in small cell deployments. Development of multi modal multi modulation capable small cells is complex. Such small cell systems need management of backhaul and core network connectivity as well as advanced features such as capabilities for self organizing networks.

Further deployment of small cells can be complex and consume a large amount of technical resources. Network organization grows increasingly complex as an increasing number of cells are deployed. The deployment of small cell eNBs can be extremely cumbersome to an operator s management system from the configuration and maintenance point of view as well as all the signaling and traffic to the mobility management entity. Automation of small call deployment can thus aid in meeting the growing demand for wireless communications.

In one aspect the invention provides a method for use in deploying a small cell base station in a self organizing network. The method comprises scanning for received radio signals to detect neighboring base stations updating a neighbor list using information about the detected neighboring base stations connecting to the detected neighboring base stations and receiving lists of neighboring base stations from the detected neighboring base stations adding information from the received lists of neighboring base stations to the neighbor list determining a physical cell identity using the neighbor list and establishing wireless communications with user equipments in a cell using the physical cell identity.

The systems and methods disclosed herein can be used with small cells and other base stations. Small cells can be operated in a wireless network to provide wireless network connectivity to a plurality of user devices. The small cell can cooperate with other devices in the wireless network to self organize to efficiently provide communication services. A network with such operations is commonly referred to as self organizing network SON . The systems and methods disclosed herein may be used to operate SONs and to deploy base stations in a wireless communication network. For concise exposition various embodiments are described using terminology and organization of particular technologies standards and services. However the systems and methods described herein are broadly applicable to other technologies standards and services.

The small cell eNBs may be configured to provide coverage for one or more mobile phone carriers or network providers. The small cell eNBs can communicate with a core network via an external security gateway using an S1 interface. The communication between the small cell eNBs and the external security gateway can be a broadband connection provided by an Internet service provider ISP network. One of the small cell eNBs may also communicate with the other small cell eNBs over X2 interfaces.

The external security gateway is coupled to an automatic configuration system ACS . The ACS can operate as a configuration server that manages configurations of the eNBs at an operator centralized location. The external security gateway is also coupled to a home eNB gateway . The home eNB gateway may connect multiple small cell eNBs to a serving gateway and a mobility management entity MME . The macro eNBs also connect to the serving gateway and the MME . The small cell eNBs may communicate with the macro eNBs by way of the serving gateway and the MME . The serving gateway provides communications to other devices for example via a packet gateway.

A user equipment can communication with the small cell eNBs and the macro eNBs . The user equipment may handover between the small cell eNBs between the macro eNBs or between one of the small cell eNBs and one of the macro eNBs . The user equipment may be a mobile device such as a mobile phone wireless modem or other device that uses voice data or other communications services. The user equipment may also be a fixed location device.

The small cell eNBs in an embodiment provides automated functions for deployment in self organizing networks. For example the small cell eNBs may provide network monitoring neighbor peer discovery processing of neighbor peer reports automated transmit power adaptation processing of user equipment reports physical cell identity selection automatic neighbor relation handover configuration private access connections load balancing RACH preamble power control RACH preamble set selection RACH preamble splitting PRACH configuration and mobility robustness.

The RF interface module provides an interface for radio signals to and from the small cell eNB. The RF interface module couples the radio modules and the sniffer module to antennas . The small cell eNB illustrated in includes three antennas . In other embodiments the small cell eNB may include greater or fewer antennas. One of the antennas may be dedicated to the sniffer module . The RF interface module includes circuitry for transmission and reception of the radio signals such as power amplifiers for driving the antennas low noise amplifiers LNAs for amplifying signals received by the antennas tuners upconverters and downconverters.

The RF interface module in some embodiments combines and splits the radio signals. For example the small cell eNB may be configured for multiple input multiple output MIMO or diversity operation. Additionally the RF interface module may operate in multiple frequency bands. The RF interface module may include modules that are dynamically configurable or adjustable. For example a power amplifier in the RF interface module may be configured for various predistortion techniques and may have an adjustable bias setting.

Each of the radio modules may be configured to support a specific protocol stack. The protocol stack may include for example a Radio Resource Control RRC layer a Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP layer a Radio Link Control RLC layer a Media Access Control MAC layer and a Physical PHY layer. The protocol layers of the radio modules may differ and allocation of functions over the layers may also differ.

The Radio Resource Control RRC layer handles the control plane signaling of Layer 3 between the user devices and the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network UTRAN . The UTRAN allows connectivity between the UE and the core network. The UTRAN includes base stations eNodeBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs . The RRC layer provided functions for connection establishment and release the broadcast of system information radio bearer establishment reconfiguration and release paging notification and release and outer loop power control.

The Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP layer performs IP header compression and decompression transfer of user data and maintenance of sequence numbers for Radio Bearer.

The Radio Link Control RLC layer delivers data to the MAC layer over logical channels. The RLC layer maps these logical channels to transport channels that represent the interface to the physical layer. The RLC layer can provide error correction and can also ensure that data is delivered only one time and in the correct sequence. The RLC layer can also segment data packets delivered by higher layers so that the MAC sublayer receives data of the correct size over the logical channels.

The Media Access Control MAC layer coordinates access to the physical medium over which data is transmitted. The MAC layer can include queue in which data for different data streams can be placed until the data is transmitted.

The Physical PHY layer provisions transport channels maps transport channels to the physical interface provides macro diversity and soft handover. The physical layer can also provide error protection such as forward error correction and interleaving. The physical layer can also provide for multiplexing and demultiplexing frequency and time synchronization power control and measurements of various characteristics of the physical link such as frame error rate.

The different radio modules in some embodiments may be configured to implement different protocol stacks. For example in the embodiment illustrated in the first radio module may be configured to implement a UMTS protocol stack and the second radio module may be configured to implement a long term evolution LTE protocol stack. The radio modules in some embodiments can be reconfigured dynamically based on the types of user devices being served by the small cell eNB.

The sniffer module operates to sense radio signals received by the small cell eNB. The small cell eNB may use information about sensed signals for example to determine frequencies to transmit on and to detect neighbor cells. The sniffer module can detect the received signal strength decode the master information block and decode the system information blocks of the sensed signals. The signal strengths and decoded information blocks of the sensed signals may provide operational details of the neighbor cells to other algorithms operating within the small cell eNB.

The radio modules and sniffer module may be provided as software defined radios SDRs . An SDR is a programmable radio device that includes a processor for executing signal processing. A variety of different radio protocols waveforms can be received and transmitted depending on the software that is executed by the processor of an SDR. An SDR can be rapidly reconfigured to change radio protocols used. In an embodiment processing circuitry may be shared between radio modules and between radio modules and other modules of the small cell eNB.

The processor module provides processing resources for the small cell eNB. The processor module can process communications being received and transmitted by the small cell eNB. The processor module can also manages resources of the small cell eNB. The processor module includes or is coupled to a memory. The memory stores data for use by the processor module. The memory may also be used to store computer readable instructions for execution by the processor module . The computer readable instructions can be used by the small cell eNB for accomplishing the various functions of the small cell eNB. The memory or part thereof may be considered a non transitory machine readable medium. For concise description the small cell eNB or embodiments of it are described as having certain functionality. This functionality in various embodiments is accomplished by the processor module other modules or a combination of modules. Furthermore in addition to executing instructions the processor module may include specific purpose hardware to accomplish some functions.

The processor module can manage radio resources of the small cell eNB. The processor module provides an interface that allows the small cell eNB to include a plurality of the radio modules . The processor module provides functions for a common radio element application manager CREAM .

The backhaul interface module provides an interface to backhaul communications for the small cell eNB. The backhaul connections may vary for example depending on the type of network that the small cell eNB will be connected to. For example the backhaul interface module may include a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification DOCSIS connection an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ADSL connection a Very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line VDSL connection a satellite connection or an optical fiber connection. In some embodiments the backhaul interface module includes connections for multiple backhaul interfaces. Data received from the network is supplied to the other modules of the small cell eNB via the backhaul interface module . Similarly data from the modules of the small cell eNB is transmitted to the network via the backhaul interface module . The backhaul interface module may also provide power distribution and control environmental monitoring and local and remote system management support for the small cell eNB.

The small cell eNB can use the sniffer module as a radio in band sniffer to detect existing macro base station carrier frequencies or other small cell carrier frequencies in wireless radio bands. The small cell eNB can also information from the sniffer module in SON functions. The SON functions can include setting up RF power parameters for the small cell coverage continuously monitoring RF spectrum and optimizing coverage for users present in cells managed by the small cell eNB and in adjacent cells optimizing the RF parameters to reduce interference to the macro network and to the UE tied to the macro network using sniffed information of the frequency usage to allow offload to other frequency bands examining usage of one carrier s radio resources and reallocating capacity from a full carrier to other unused carriers within the same band using network monitoring mode to allow for small cell to small cell handovers and small cell to macro handovers and vice versa using network monitoring to allow the use of several mobile network operator in a neutral host application and using network monitoring parameters to enable software defined radio baseband elements to increase capacity elements or throughput QoS. The small cell eNB can also use the sniffer module for peer management of frequency usage and allocation. The small cell eNB can include dynamic sniffing to dynamically adjust output power to not interfere with existing macro frequencies.

Example embodiments of a small cell eNB are further described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 444 704 filed Apr. 11 2012 and published as U.S. 2010 0264470 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 926 700 filed Jun. 25 2013 which are hereby incorporated by reference. For example the picocell described with reference to FIG. 2 in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 444 704 may be used to implement the small cell eNB of the present application. Similarly the small cell described with reference to FIG. 2 in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 926 700 may be used to implement the small cell eNB of the present application. Furthermore the CREAM functions and modules described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 444 704 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13 926 700 may be included in the small cell eNB of the present application and be used to provide various process of the small cell eNB.

In step an initial configuration file is installed in the small cell eNB. The initial configuration file may be installed for example by a technician of the supplier of the eNB. The initial configuration file can be installed in a non volatile memory of the small cell eNB. The processor of the small cell eNB can read values from the initial configuration file to begin operations of the small cell eNB. The initial configuration file can for example contain information on how to connect to a server or gateway device.

In step the small cell eNB is shipped to a location where it will be installed. In step the small cell eNB is connected to a backhaul connection at the installation location. In step power is applied to the small cell eNB. The small cell eNB can then begin its configuration process including reading the initial configuration file.

In step the small cell eNB connects to the external security gateway . In step the small cell eNB downloads configuration information from the ACS . The small cell eNB communicates with the ACS via the external security gateway .

In step a network monitor mode module scans received radio signals to detect neighboring eNBs. They sniffer module can be used to detect neighboring eNBs. The neighboring eNB detection can be used to create an initial neighbor list. In step the small cell eNB connects to the home eNB gateway and via the home eNB gateway to the MME . Steps and may be performed concurrently.

In step a connection is made to the neighbor eNBs detected in step . The connection can use the X2 interface. The small cell eNB can request a list of neighbors from the neighbor eNBs that it connects to. The neighbor eNBs of the neighbor eNBs can be added to the neighbor list.

In step the small cell eNB builds a map of tracked cells using the neighbor and neighbor of neighbor information. In step the small cell eNB uses the map of track cells to select a physical cell identity PCI . In step the small cell eNB can then set up one or more cells and start transmission using the PCI selection.

In the initialization mode the network monitor mode module performs a full scan of all frequencies to build a map of the neighbor cells. The initialization mode for example may be used in step of the process of . In step the network monitor mode module identifies a frequency band to scan. In step a first frequency is selected for signal detection. In step the selected frequency is analyzed to detect any received signals. For example the sniffer module may determine the signal strength and other characteristics of signals received by the small cell eNB. Since the initialization mode operations occur before the small cell eNB has active cells the radio modules can also be used for signal detection. In step a next frequency is selected to be scanned. In step the process determines if there are more frequencies to scan. If there are more frequencies to scan the process returns to step otherwise the process continues to the continuous mode.

The detected signal information is used to build the map of neighbor cells. The map among other things provides the initial input for creation of X2 connections to other eNBs. The information about the detected neighbor cells can also be used as starting information for automatic neighbor relations ANR and PCI selection.

In the continuous mode a dedicated receiver for example the sniffer module is used for signal detection. The continuous mode can provide signal detection without interrupting user data traffic to and from the small cell eNB. The use of a dedicated receiver also allows quick detection of intra frequency network changes. Information about detected network changes can be supplied to self configuration functions to provide a quick response to dynamic situations. The continuous mode also detects inter frequency network changes for example on a periodic schedule. Information about detected inter frequency network changes is also supplied for self configuration and self optimization functions.

In step a selected frequency is scanned. In step a next frequency to be analyzed is selected. In step the process determines if there are more frequencies to scan. If there are more frequencies to scan the process returns to step otherwise the process continues to the RSSI mode. The process may also return to step for example on a period schedule when there is not a pending RSSI scan request.

In the RSSI mode when requested by an X2 peer the network monitor mode module scans a requested frequency to measure RSSI and reports the results of the measurement.

In step the process waits for an RSSI scan request. The RSSI scan request may be received from a neighbor eNB over the X2 interface. In step the small cell eNB selects a frequency or frequencies to scan. The selected frequencies may be signaled in the RSSI scan request. In step the RSSI is measured for the selected frequencies. Other measurements may additionally or alternatively be performed. The measurement results are reported to the requesting neighbor eNB.

From the initial scan of the network monitor mode module for the detected cells by 13 the neighbor peer discovery process performs following sequence of steps. In step a lookup is performed for the ENB peer. If the small cell eNB does not have information about the eNB peer the small cell eNB requests information from the MME . In step using the information about the eNB peer the small cell eNB contacts the eNB peer to set up an X2 interface connection. In step the small cell eNB requests it receives information from the peer ENB. The received information is processed to add the peer ENB to the neighbor list.

In step the process determines if there are more peer eNBs to process. If there are more peer eNBs to process the process returns to step otherwise the process continues to the step . In step addition of a new neighbor peer can be detected. When a new peer ENB is detected the process returns to step .

In step the small cell eNB receives a peer report from one of its neighboring cells. The peer reports can include various types of information. The peer report may include resource status usage . When the small cell eNB receives a repeater report that includes resource status usage information in the received report may be used for load balancing .

The peer report may include load information . When the small cell eNB receives a peer report that includes load information the information may be used as input to an inter cell interference coordination function .

The peer report may include a handover report . The peer report also may include radio link failure information . When the small cell eNB receives a peer report that includes a handover report or radio link failure information the information may be used as input to a mobility optimization function .

The peer report may include an RSSI scan report . When the small cell eNB receives a peer report that includes an RSSI scan report the received information may be used as input to a transmit power adapter nation function .

The source small cell eNB transmits it a transmission to the target small cell eNB . The source small cell eNB also transmits an RSSI measurement request to the target small cell eNB . When the target small cell eNB receives the RSSI measurement request the target small cell eNB performs a measurement of the RSSI of the transmission received from the source small cell eNB . The target small cell eNB transmits an RSSI measurement response to the source small cell eNB . The RSSI measurement response includes the results of the measurement .

When the source small cell eNB receives the RSSI measurement response the source small cell eNB can adjust its transmit power . The source small cell eNB may also use RSI measurement reports from other eNBs to adjust its transmit power. The automated transmit power adaptation process provides a closed loop feedback for tuning the transmit power of the small cell eNB. In an embodiment a cluster of eNBs perform the automated transmit power adaptation process. The automated transmit power adaptation process can help balance the coverage area of cells in the cluster.

In step the small cell eNB receives a user equipment report. The user equipment report can include various types of information. The user equipment report may include a measurement report . The information in the measurement report can be used for a handover determination function can be used for an ANR update function and can be used for a PCI tracking function .

The user equipment report may also include a visited cells report . The visited cells report can include information about eNBs that the user equipment has communicated with. Information in the visited cells report can also be used for the PCI tracking function .

The user equipment report may also include an RACH statistics report . The RACH statistics report can be used in an RACH optimization function .

During operation of the small cell eNB a PCI conflict may occur. The small cell eNB can check for conflicts after receiving a measurement report after results from the network monitor mode s continuous scan and after an X2 peer is added 927. After these events in step the small cell eNB adds a new cell to its list or table or database of tracked cells . The list of tracked cells may be kept by frequency allocations. Step may also be performed after other events where there may be a new tracked cell.

In step the small cell eNB checks for conflicts between the PCI of the small cell eNB and the PCIs used by the cells in the tracked cells . In step if a conflict is detected the process continues to step otherwise the process returns and awaits another event that can lead to a PCI conflict.

In step the small cell eNB resolves the PCI conflict be selecting a new PCI. Selection of the new PCI may be the same or similar to the initial PCI select of step .

A user equipment connected to the small cell eNB may detect a previously unknown cell. The user equipment can then report the PCI of the unknown cell to the small cell eNB. The small cell eNB can then send a measurement configuration e.g. using the small cell eNB s radio resource manager to the user equipment to cause the user equipment to report the cell global identity CGI of the unknown cell to the small cell eNB. The small cell eNB can add the information from the user equipment to the list of tracked cells .

During operation of the small cell eNB events may occur that cause the small cell eNB to update the ANR neighbor list . The number of entries in the ANR neighbor list may be limited for example to 32 neighbors. List may be recycled on a least recently used LRU basis.

One event is an X2 peer addition . Another event is receipt of a measurement report with information about an eNB that is not currently a neighbor as a handover candidate. When a user equipment detects a signal from an eNB with a certain signal strength e.g. with RSRP exceeding threshold value . The user equipment can then report the PCI of the detected cell to the small cell eNB. The small cell eNB can then send a measurement configuration to the user equipment to cause the user equipment to report the CGI of the detected cell to the small cell eNB. If the detected cell is new to the small cell eNB the detected cell can be added to the neighbor list. Another event is that the continuous mode operation of the network monitor mode module may detect a new peer . Another event is that a user equipment may be handed in to the small cell eNB from a new peer . Hand in of the user equipment may begin with the eNB currently serving the user equipment source eNB determining that handover to the small cell eNB target eNB which is performing the ANR process is needed. The user equipment detects the target eNB and sends a measurement report to the source eNB. The source eNB negotiates resources for the user equipment on the target eNB either directly via X2 communication or indirectly via S1. If the resources are allocated successfully the source eNB directs the user equipment to acquire the target eNB. If the user equipment successfully acquires and connects to the target eNB the source eNB can be added as a neighbor. The foregoing events can cause the small cell eNB to add a neighbor to the neighbor list . Other events may also cause removal of a neighbor.

Another type of event is that the small cell eNB may determine that handovers to one of the neighbors experience an excess number of failures . For use in inter alia step the small cell eNB tracks handover success rates for each neighbor. Excessive failures may be determined when the success rate is less than a configurable threshold. Another event is that an X2 peer has been removed . The foregoing events can cause the small cell eNB to blacklist a neighbor in the neighbor list . Other events may also cause blacklisting of a neighbor. The small cell eNB may not handover user equipments to a blacklisted neighbor.

Handovers in the wireless communications network can occur in different ways. A user equipment can handover from one small cell eNB to another small cell eNB where the two small cell eNBs have an X2 connection. A user equipment can also handover from a small cell eNB to a macro eNB.

The handover process can begin with the source small cell eNB receives a measurement report from the user equipment that indicates the user equipment should be handed over. The user equipment may for example detect a signal from the target small cell eNB with characteristics e.g. based on RSRP that causes the user equipment to send the measurement report .

When the source small cell eNB analyzes e.g. by its radio resource manager the measurement report and determines that the user equipment should be handed over to the target small cell eNB the source small cell eNB finds a X2 interface to the target small cell eNB . The source small cell eNB sends a handover request to the target small cell eNB over the X2 interface. The target small cell eNB sends a handover request acknowledgment to the source small cell eNB . The target small cell eNB may evaluate its current loading before accepting the handover request.

The source small cell eNB can then send an RRC connection reconfiguration message to the user equipment. The source small cell eNB also sends a sequence number status transfer to the target small cell eNB .

The target small cell eNB can send an RRC connection re establishment command to the user equipment . The target small cell eNB then sends a path switch request to the MME informing the MME of the handover. The MME confirms the path change by sending a path switch acknowledgment to the target small cell eNB .

The target small cell eNB can send a send UE context release to the source small cell eNB to inform the source small cell eNB of successful handover. The source small cell eNB may then release resources allocated to the user equipment .

The handover process can begin with the source small cell eNB receives a measurement report from the user equipment that indicates the user equipment should be handed over. The user equipment may for example detect a signal from the target macro eNB with characteristics e.g. based on RSRP that causes the user equipment to send the measurement report .

When the source small cell eNB analyzes e.g. by its radio resource manager the measurement report and determines that the user equipment should be handed over to the target macro eNB the source small cell eNB fails to find a X2 interface to the target macro eNB . The source small cell eNB then sends a handover required message to the MME over the S1 interface.

The MME may then send a handover request to the target macro eNB . The target macro eNB sends a handover request acknowledgment to the MME . The target macro eNB may evaluate its current loading before accepting the handover request. The MME sends a handover command to the source small cell eNB . The source small cell eNB can then send an RRC connection reconfiguration message to the user equipment.

The target macro eNB can then send an RRC connection re establishment command to the user equipment . The target macro eNB then sends a handover notify message to the MME informing the MME of successful handover.

In the connections for private access illustrated in the user equipment receives a download of available private eNBs in a CSG whitelist . The user equipment may receive the CSG whitelist using OMA device management. The eNB also gets configuration information from the ACS . The configuration information includes a CSG identity for the eNB.

The eNB then transmit a system information block that includes the CSG identity of the eNB. When the user equipment receives the system information block and determines that the CSG identity matches an entry in the user equipment s CSG whitelist the user equipment can send a connect request to the eNB .

The eNB may based on current loads perform real time dynamic cell reconfiguration. The load balancing can use local resource usage information and resource usage information from peer cells . The resource usage information from peer cells can be received in status reports from the peer cells.

In step the eNB analyzes the resource usage information to calculate a desired radio admission control RAC state. If the desired RAC state requires changes the eNB makes RAC configuration changes.

In step the eNB analyzes the resource usage information to calculate desired handover weighting. The handover may be on a per peer basis. If the desired handover weights require changes the eNB makes associated configuration changes. The handover weights may include a local weight of hand out and a remote weight of hand in. For load balancing the eNB can increase the hand out weight as the local load increases. This encourages user equipment on the cell edge to hand out sooner. The eNB also can decrease the hand in weight as the load of the associated peer cell increases. The deceased weight discourages handover to loaded cells.

The load balancing illustrated in includes three RAC states an unloaded state a loaded state and a GBR disallowed state . In the unloaded state the cell is marked as unbarred and any user equipment is allowed admission. In the GBR disallowed state user equipments are allowed admission but new GBR bearers are not allowed. In the loaded state cell is marked as barred and user equipments will not be allowed admission and should not attempt to initiate new connections with the eNB.

The eNB may transition between the load balancing states based on traffic loading. The eNB may for example generally move to the unloaded state when the traffic level is low move to the loaded state with the traffic level is too high for any additional traffic and move to the GBR disallowed state when the traffic level is too high for any additional GBR traffic but still low enough for best effort traffic.

The small cell eNBs described herein can perform various functions to control random access channel RACH operations to improve wireless communications network performance. An eNB may for example use an RACH preamble power control process to reduce user equipment transmission power thereby reducing inter cell interference and also conserving user equipment battery power. An eNB may also use a preamble set selection process to avoid or reduce overlap with neighbor cells. An eNB may also use a preamble splitting process to balancing of dedicated and shared preambles to dynamically react to the types of RACH loads. An eNB may also use a PRACH configuration process to avoid or reduce the amount of overlap with neighbor cells.

In step the small cell eNB receives a RACH statistics report from a user equipment. The RACH statistics report includes the number of RACH preambles sent before successful completion. The user equipment may for example send the RACH statistics report in response to a request from the small cell eNB. In step the small cell eNB analyzes the received RACH statistics report.

In step the small cell eNB determines whether the number of RACH preambles sent by the user equipment is more than one. If the number of RACH preambles sent is more than one the process continues to step otherwise the process continues to step .

In step the small cell eNB starts a power decrease timer. Since the RACH was successful after one attempt it may be appropriate to decrease the preamble power. The process then returns to step to receive further RACH statistics reports. The process also continues to step to wait for expiration of the power decrease timer.

In step the small cell eNB stops the power decrease timer. Since the RACH was not successful after one attempt it may be appropriate to increase the preamble power. In step the preamble power is increased. The process then returns to step to receive further RACH statistics reports. The process also continues to step to effect the new preamble power configuration.

In step when the power decrease timer expires the process continues to step . The power decrease timer may expire after a fixed period of time passes without step occurring. In step the preamble power is decreased. The process then continues to step to effect the new preamble power configuration.

The small cell eNB in step establishes that there has been a change to its neighbor list. The neighbor list may be changed for example by the processes described with reference to and . In the step a set selection timer is started if not previously started . The set selection timer can reduce the number of preamble set reselections performed when multiple neighbor changes occur in quick succession.

In step the process determines whether the set selection timer has expired. The set selection timer may expire after a fixed period of time passes without a change to the neighbor list occurring. If the set selection timer has expired the process continues to step otherwise the process returns to step .

In step a new root sequence index RSI is determined. The small cell eNB may loop through all of its neighbors and selects an optimal RSI. The process then continues to step to effect the new root sequence index configuration.

In step the small cell eNB receives a RACH statistics report from a user equipment. The RACH statistics report includes for example the number of preambles sent prior to successful access to the eNB and the number of contention resolution failures prior to successful access to the eNB. In step the small cell eNB receives a message with an RACH dedicated preamble from a user equipment.

After either or both of step and step in step a preamble split timer is started if not previously started . The preamble split timer can reduce the number of preamble split configuration changes performed when multiple RACH statistics report or dedicated preambles uses occur in quick succession.

In step the process determines whether the preamble split timer has expired. The preamble split timer may expire after a fixed period of time passes without either event or occurring. If the preamble split timer has expired the process continues to step otherwise the process returns to step and step .

In step the small cell eNB processes the information from step and step . Depending for example on the dedicated preamble usage and collision rate statistics gathered a new allocation of dedicated preambles may be determined. The process then continues to step to effect the new preamble split configuration.

The small cell eNB in step establishes that there has been a change to its neighbor list. The process continues to step .

In step the small cell eNB receives a RACH statistics report from a user equipment. The RACH statistics report includes for example the number of preambles sent prior to successful access to the eNB and the number of contention resolution failures prior to successful access to the eNB. In step the small cell eNB calculates the RACH load using the information from step .

In step the RACH load from step is compared to the current small cell eNB configuration e.g. current RACH operating class . If the RACH load fits the current configuration the process returns to step and step otherwise the process continues to step . In step the small cell eNB selected a new configuration that fits the current RACH load.

In step the small cell eNB resolves any PRACH conflicts created by the new configuration from step or the neighbor list change from step . In step the small cell eNB selects a new PRACH configuration based on the preceding steps. The process then continues to step to effect the new PRACH configuration.

A first variation of the illustrated handover process begins with the source small cell eNB sending an RRC reconfiguration request to the user equipment . The RRC reconfiguration request instructs the user equipment to handover to the target small cell eNB . The user equipment then sends an RRC reestablishment request to the target small cell eNB . The source small cell eNB can detect a radio link failure . In the case of a too late handover the RLF may occur when communication between the source small cell eNB and the user equipment are not complete but the user equipment is out of range of the source small cell eNB .

The target small cell eNB sends an RLF indication to the source small cell eNB over the X2 interface. This may be triggered by the RRC reestablishment request which can include an indication from the user equipment of RLF failure.

When the source small cell eNB receives the RLF indication the small cell eNB can evaluate the related events e.g. the RLF detection to determine that the RLF was caused by a too late handover . The source small cell eNB can then update its handover parameters to avoid future too late handovers.

A second variation of the illustrated handover process begins with the source small cell eNB sending an RRC reconfiguration request to the user equipment . The RRC reconfiguration request instructs the user equipment to handover to the target small cell eNB . If the handover is early the user equipment may not be able to communicate with the target small cell eNB . The user equipment then sends an RRC reestablishment request to the target small cell eNB .

The target small cell eNB can detect a radio link failure because except communication with the handed over user equipment does not occur.

The source small cell eNB sends an RLF indication to the target small cell eNB over the X2 interface. This may be triggered by the RRC reestablishment request which can include an indication from the user equipment of RLF failure. The target small cell eNB can send a handover report in response to the RLF indications .

When the source small cell eNB receives the handover report the source small cell eNB can evaluate the related events e.g. the RLF indication to determine that the RLF was caused by a too early handover . The source small cell eNB can then update its handover parameters to avoid future too early handovers.

Notably the message sequences for the too early and too late handover failures are unique and sufficient to identify both the reason for the failure and the eNB that caused the failure.

As described in this specification various apparatuses and methods are described as working to optimize particular parameters functions or operations. This use of the term optimize does not necessarily mean optimize in a theoretical or global sense. Rather the apparatuses and methods may work to improve performance using algorithms that are expected to improve performance in at least many common cases. Similar terms like minimize or maximize are used in a like manner.
