The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

DSI telemetry receivers of the type used with caged animals are typically equipped with welded slots on their rear surface. These slots are dimensioned to receive the head of a quarter inch carriage bolt which is slidably received within the slot.

In order to attach the telemetry receiver to the wall of a cage for an animal the telemetry receiver is positioned on the inside surface of the wall and so that the carriage bolts slidably positioned within the telemetry receiver slots extend through the wall and outside of the cage. The bolts are then secured to the cage utilizing oversized fender washers and nuts to securely bolt the receiver to the inside of the animal cage. Thereafter the data cable for the telemetry receiver is attached to the receiver to communicate the data collected by the receiver to a computer or other recording device.

When moving the animal from one cage to another for routine cleaning of the cage or moving the animal from a testing area to a housing area the scientist or technician currently has two options to move the animal and continue to collect the telemetry data once the animal is moved. One way is to stop the data collection from the telemetry receiver and close the computer file. The computer program is then restarted with a second receiver at the new animal cage and a new data file is initiated. Unfortunately this method takes time and requires twice the number of receivers i.e. one receiver for the old cage and a new receiver for the new cage.

A still further disadvantage of this previously known method is that two data files are created for the same animal. Thus when restarting the data collection with a new receiver the software must be configured for the new receiver. This method is disadvantageously time consuming for the analysis of the collected data since the collected data must be analyzed for two or even more different computer files. Furthermore since two or even more data files must be analyzed there exists the risk of mixing data results for different animals.

Alternatively when moving the animal the computer data collection program is paused. The data cable for the telemetry receiver is then unplugged from the receiver.

Thereafter a wrench is used to loosen the carriage bolts holding the receiver to the wall of the cage and once loose the telemetry receiver is slid out from the carriage bolts and removed from the cage. The telemetry receiver is then mounted on the new or second cage the data cable reconnected to the computer and the computer is unpaused.

While this alternate method minimizes the number of telemetry receivers required to monitor the animals and results in a single data file on one computer it suffers from its own disadvantages. First the overall procedure of removing the telemetry receiver from one cage and reattaching the telemetry receiver to a second cage is time consuming and difficult to accomplish particularly since protective clothing is usually required for animal handling. Furthermore this procedure also requires tools for loosening and tightening the nuts onto the carriage bolts and the attendant risk of dropping and losing the fastener hardware.

The present invention provides a mount for a telemetry receiver for mounting the telemetry receiver onto a cage wall which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known methods.

In brief the mount for the telemetry receiver in accordance with the present invention comprises a base plate which may be constructed of any suitable material. However a synthetic material such as plexiglass is preferred due to its low cost and easy cleaning.

A pair of rails are then attached to the base plate. These rails are spaced apart and generally parallel to each other and are dimensioned to slidably receive opposed sides preferably the top and bottom of the telemetry receiver. An end stop is also preferably attached to the base plate to limit the insertion of the telemetry receiver into the rails.

The base plate includes at least one opening which is aligned with the telemetry receiver data connector when the telemetry receiver is slid between the rails and against the end stop. This opening is dimensioned to receive the data cable through the base plate. Any conventional means such as a nut and bolt is then used to attach the base plate on the inside surface of the cage wall.

In practice the telemetry receiver is slid horizontally in between the rails until the telemetry receiver abuts against the end stop. At that time the data connector for the telemetry receiver is aligned with the opening in the base plate.

Thereafter the data cable for the telemetry receiver is inserted through the base plate opening and attached to the telemetry receiver. In doing so the data cable locks the telemetry receiver to the base plate against sliding movement relative to the base plate and its walls.

When a subsequent transfer of the animal from the cage is desired it is merely necessary to pause the computer and remove the data cable. The telemetry receiver is then easily and rapidly removed from the mount by sliding the telemetry receiver along the rails. The telemetry receiver is then easily and rapidly installed at the new cage without the use of tools by simply sliding the telemetry receiver in a second mount at the new cage attaching the data cable for the telemetry receiver and unpausing the computer data collection program.

With reference first to a preferred embodiment of the telemetry mount in accordance with the present invention is illustrated mounted to a wall of a cage . The cage is of the type used to contain laboratory animals for research or other purposes. The laboratory animal not shown is fitted with a conventional telemetry transmitter and sensors to continuously transmit data regarding the animal to a telemetry receiver held by the mount .

With reference now particularly to the mount includes a generally rectangular base plate . This base plate is preferably slightly larger than the telemetry receiver and is constructed from any suitable material. However a synthetic material such as plexiglass is preferred both for its inexpensive cost and easy cleaning.

As best shown in a pair of elongated rails are attached to the base plate so that the rails are spaced apart and generally parallel to each other. Furthermore the spacing between the rails is slightly greater than the overall width of the telemetry receiver . Any conventional means such as solvent welding may be used to attach the rails to the base plate .

As best shown in each rail includes a portion which extends inwardly from the rail towards the opposite rail and overlies the base plate . The spacing between an inner side of the rail overlapping portion furthermore is less than the width of the telemetry receiver .

Still referring to the rail with its overlying portion and the base plate forms a generally U shaped channel . This U shaped channel furthermore is dimensioned to slidably receive opposed sides such as the top and bottom of the telemetry receiver . Consequently the telemetry receiver can be slid into or out of the U shaped channels and when positioned between the rails the overlying portions of the rails retain the telemetry receiver to the base plate .

With reference again to an end stop is preferably secured to the base plate in between and adjacent one end of the rails . This end stop thus limits the insertion of the telemetry receiver from one end of the base plate and towards its other end . Any conventional means such as solvent welding may be used to attach the end stop to the base plate .

With reference now to any conventional means may be utilized to secure the mount to the inside of the cage wall . However as shown an elongated support bar preferably constructed of a synthetic material such as plexiglass extends along the outside of the cage wall . The support bar furthermore is dimensioned so that it extends across at least two of the bars forming the cage wall .

At least one and preferably several mounting holes in the base plate register with mounting holes formed through the support bar . A carriage bolt is then positioned through the registering holes and in the base plate and support bar respectively and tightened using a nut such as a wing nut. Upon tightening of the nuts the cage bars are sandwiched in between the support bar and the base plate thus firmly securing the base plate to the inside of the cage wall.

With reference again to the base plate includes at least one opening which is aligned with the data output connector on the telemetry receiver when the receiver is fully inserted in between the rails and against the end stop . These openings furthermore are dimensioned to allow the data cable for the telemetry receiver to be inserted through the opening and connected to the data output connector on the telemetry receiver .

Upon connection of the data cable to the telemetry receiver once the telemetry receiver is fully inserted into the mount the mechanical interference between the data cable and the base plate simply but effectively locks the telemetry unit to the base plate against sliding movement. Furthermore this is achieved without the use of tools.

In operation when it is desired to move the animal from one cage to another the computer program collecting the data is paused and the data cable is removed from the telemetry receiver . Upon removal the entire receiver may be simply and rapidly slidably removed from the mount without the use of tools. The now removed telemetry receiver may then be easily and simply slid in between the rails and against the end stop in a subsequent cage. Thereafter the data collection cable is reattached to the telemetry receiver thus effectively locking the telemetry receiver to the second mount and data collection is resumed by unpausing the computer.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a simple and yet effective mount for a telemetry receiver of the type used in cages for laboratory animals. Having described our invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
