This application is a U.S. National Stage Entry of International Patent Application Serial Number PCT EP2013 000632 filed Mar. 5 2013 which claims priority to German patent application no. 102012104644.1 filed May 30 2012.

Steering columns of the generic type are therefore embodiments of steering columns in which the steering spindle which supports the steering wheel can be adjusted in its position at least in the longitudinal direction in order to adapt the position of the steering wheel to the size of the vehicle driver. However in steering columns of this generic type the position of the steering spindle is adjusted at least in the longitudinal direction by means of a motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive. As a rule such steering columns do not have a separate locking mechanism which in its closed position secures the steering spindle in its position which has been set. In these cases the position is fixed by means of the motor operated adjustment mechanism.

In general in such steering columns of the generic type it is desired that on the one hand the adjustment in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle can occur in an easily moving fashion that is to say with small motor forces of the motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive. However on the other hand a high degree of freedom from play needs to be provided. The freedom from play in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle is generally achieved through the connection of the steering spindle to the motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive. However in order to achieve the desired position of the column tube with play with respect to the carrier body additional measures are generally necessary in the transverse direction orthogonally with respect to the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle. JP 06286620 A of the generic type therefore discloses a sliding compound between two tube parts of an electrically adjustable steering column in which a spring mechanism acts on a planar circumferential section of the interior column tube wherein this interior column tube applies spring prestress to planar surface sections in the carrier body which are arranged in a V shape. However this technical solution requires a large number of individual components is costly to realize and limits the design of the column tubes.

In JP 2011 121440 A a sleeve which to a greater or lesser extent completely surrounds the column tube is arranged between the column tube and the carrier body in order to eliminate play between the column tube and the carrier body and thus prevent rattling noises. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that the mounting of the components in this design is relatively complex.

US 2005 0066761 A1 shows a motor adjustable steering column in which a leaf spring is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle and presses against the column tube via blocks which are arranged in the transverse direction. DE 10 2010 037 312 B3 presents a steering column which is only manually adjustable and in which a leaf spring is provided for forcing wedge shaped bodies in the circumferential direction between the column tube and the carrier body.

Disclosed herein is a steering column for a motor vehicle having a column tube for rotatably mounting a steering spindle of the steering column and having a carrier body which engages around the column tube at least in certain areas wherein the column tube is mounted in the carrier body so as to be slidable at least in a longitudinal direction of the steering column wherein the steering column has at least one leaf spring which presses against a cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube in a transverse direction orthogonally with respect to the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle.

An object of the present disclosure is to provide a steering column in which a play free position of the column is made possible between the column tube and the carrier body using simple means.

There is therefore provision that the leaf spring has at least two support faces which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube with which support faces said leaf spring presses against the column tube directly or with the interposition of at least one bearing body wherein both during the direct pressing against the column tube and during pressing against the column tube with the interposition of the bearing body the leaf spring presses against the column tube exclusively with its side facing the column tube.

The invention is preferably applied for steering columns in which the column tube is mounted in the carrier body so as to be slidable at least in a longitudinal direction of the steering spindle by means of a motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive of the steering column.

By loading the column tube by means of the contact pressure of the leaf spring in the transverse direction orthogonally with respect to the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle it is easily ensured that the column tube is forced against the carrier body which surrounds the column tube as a result of which the desired play free position is achieved in the transverse direction. There is provision here that the leaf spring presses onto a cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube which in turn permits a very simple design of the column tube. In particularly simple configurations of the invention the leaf spring can press directly onto the column tube that is to say can make direct contact with the column tube in its cylindrical column shaped section. However indirect pressing of the leaf spring against the specified cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube is also possible. For example corresponding configurations of the invention provide that the leaf spring presses against the column tube with the interposition of at least one bearing body. The bearing body can be constructed for example from plastic for example as an injection moulded part. Preferred variants provide that the leaf spring presses against the column tube with the interposition of two bearing bodies which are arranged spaced apart from one another. In this context it is to be particularly preferred if the two bearing bodies are connected to a connecting section to form one component a bearing element. In particular the bearing bodies and the connecting section can be manufactured as a single common part preferably in an injection moulding method. For the purpose of optimum positively locking adaptation to the cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube the bearing bodies can be embodied at least in certain areas in a wedge shape in cross section. It is particularly advantageous if at least one surface which is curved in certain areas in a cylindrical column shape for bearing against the column tube is provided on the bearing body. In a combination of these two preferred variants the bearing body is then wedge shaped in certain areas in cross section wherein at least one of its surfaces is curved in a cylindrical column shape in order to bear against the column tube. For the purpose of simplifying the mounting the leaf spring is held in the single part bearing element by means of laterally arranged clips. These clips can also be embodied directly together with the bearing bodies and the connecting section in an injection moulding method.

Generally it is advantageous if the leaf spring presses against the column tube at least two points or areas which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube. It is in turn advantageous in this context if the leaf spring presses against the column tube with its support faces spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube at the points which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube. One of the specified bearing bodies can then be respectively arranged at each of these points or areas which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube. In such embodiments the bearing bodies are as stated above preferably connected to one another and more preferably pre assembled with the leaf spring as an assembly.

For the sake of a design which is as simple as possible preferred embodiments of the invention provide that the column tube rests on the side facing the leaf spring on the carrier body exclusively with interposition of a lubricant film. In these variants the leaf spring therefore presses the column tube on the side facing the leaf spring directly against the carrier body. However this occurs with the interposition of a lubricant film in order to implement the longitudinal adjustment in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle by means of the motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive with as little application of force as possible.

For the sake of mounting which is as simple as possible particularly preferred variants of the invention provide that the leaf spring is arranged in an opening in the carrier body wherein for the purpose of mounting the leaf spring can be introduced from the outside through the opening and pressed against the column tube. This makes it possible firstly to introduce the column tube into the carrier body and then to press the leaf spring from the outside through the opening against the column tube. In this context the leaf spring can be supported on its side facing away from the column tube by means of at least one bolt or at least one screw. In particular when a screw is used it is possible here for the purpose of setting the prestress to configure the screw to be adjustable in the specified transverse direction. Of course it is basically also possible to set the prestress by means of a bolt which can be adjusted in the transverse direction. A preferred method for mounting the leaf spring in the steering column according to the invention therefore provides that the leaf spring is arranged in an opening in the carrier body wherein for the purpose of mounting the leaf spring is introduced from the outside through the opening and pressed against the column tube. In this context the leaf spring can be mounted through the opening as an assembly together with the bearing bodies specified above or the bearing element specified above. If bearing bodies are used it is however also possible for these to be firstly introduced from the outside through the opening and positioned against the column tube separately from the leaf spring in order then subsequently to carry out the mounting of the leaf spring in the specified fashion.

In order to permit the specified mounting in the opening in the carrier body there is preferably provision that the leaf spring is arranged in an opening in the carrier body wherein an opening face of the opening is at least as large as the leaf spring. There is preferably provision that the opening in the carrier body is bounded exclusively by walls which are parallel to one another. Preferred embodiments of the invention also provide that the leaf spring extends over half the circumference of the column tube at maximum. The leaf spring particularly preferably extends over at most a quarter of the circumference of the column tube since this has permitted good support to be achieved.

The circumference of the column tube is to be used here in the area of the cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube in which the leaf spring also presses against the column tube.

In contrast to manually adjustable steering columns in steering columns according to the invention in which the column tube is slid in the carrier body in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle by means of a motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive there is provision that the locking of the steering spindle in the longitudinal direction is implemented without the tensioning between the carrier body and the column tube which is customary in the case of manually adjustable steering columns. In this context preferred embodiments of the invention therefore provide that the column tube is held in the respectively set position in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle preferably exclusively by the motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive. In steering columns of the generic type the locking mechanisms which are known in the case of manually adjustable steering columns are therefore generally dispensed with. Correspondingly the fixing of the position which can be set in the longitudinal direction is preferably carried out exclusively by means of the motor operated adjustment mechanism and not by means of tensioning between the carrier body and the column tube.

For the sake of completeness it is also to be noted that the column tube favourably partially or entirely surrounds the steering spindle. The steering spindle is mounted in the column tube so as to be rotatable about its longitudinal axis or longitudinal direction in order to be able to transmit a steering movement of the steering wheel to the wheels of the motor vehicle. In order to adjust the position of the steering spindle in the longitudinal direction the latter is slid in the carrier body together with the column tube by the motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive. The carrier body can engage around the column tube in certain areas or completely. For this purpose the carrier body can have a corresponding cavity in which the column tube is slideably mounted. Said carrier body advantageously has a cylindrical cavity for accommodating the column tube. The column tube and the steering spindle are then directly or indirectly attached to the bodywork of the vehicle via the carrier body. With respect to the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle it is to be noted for the sake of completeness that this is the direction of the longitudinal extent of the steering spindle. The rotational axis about which the steering spindle is mounted in a rotatable fashion in the column tube generally extends in this longitudinal direction. The motor operated longitudinal adjustment drive is usually composed of multiple parts. Said longitudinal adjustment drive can comprise for example a motor in particular an electric motor a transmission and or a spindle which is driven by the motor together with the transmission. For example the column tube can then be attached to this spindle.

For the sake of completeness it is to be noted that steering columns according to the invention can of course be adjustable not only in the longitudinal direction of the steering spindle but also in other directions for example in the vertical direction. For the purpose of vertical adjustment for example a motor operated vertical adjustment drive can then be provided.

In this first exemplary embodiment the column tube is however adjustable not only in the longitudinal directions but also in the vertical directions . For this adjustment the motor operated vertical adjustment drive is provided. The latter comprises in turn a motor a transmission a spindle and a pivoting lever . The pivoting lever is mounted in the carrier body so as to be rotatable with an axle and is mounted in the securing bracket so as to be rotatable with an axle . By rotating the spindle the motor moves via the transmission a threaded nut which is coupled to the pivoting lever which leads to a pivoting movement of the pivoting lever and then leads in a manner known per se to a vertical adjustment of the column tube together with the steering column in one of the vertical directions .

In the exemplary embodiment shown the leaf spring does not press directly onto the points or areas and of the cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction. In this exemplary embodiment there is instead provision that the leaf spring presses against the cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube with the interposition of a bearing element comprising two bearing bodies which are embodied in a wedge shape. On the side facing the leaf spring the column tube bears directly against the carrier body exclusively with the interposition of a lubricant film .

As is already apparent from in this exemplary embodiment the leaf spring presses against the respective bearing bodies in the areas just before their ends and said leaf spring is supported on the bolt in the area between said bearing bodies in the centre here. shows in an enlarged form that in preferred embodiments the ends of the leaf spring are bent somewhat in the direction away from the bearing body . This results in a situation in which no sharp edges which could lead to the leaf spring cutting into the bearing body are present in the area of the support of the leaf spring on the bearing body . Of course correspondingly bent ends can be employed to form rounded support faces even in exemplary embodiments in which bearing bodies are dispensed with and the leaf spring presses directly onto the column tube .

Greases or else solid lubricants can be used as the lubricants. However surface treatment in particular surface coating of one of the surfaces in contact can also be provided.

As a result of the pressing according to the invention of the leaf spring against the cylindrical column shaped section of the column tube and the freedom from play which is achieved as a result optimum support of the column tube in the carrier body is achieved with extremely simple means. This also leads to a reduction in migration of the column tube during the adjustment in the directions perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the steering column . It is particularly advantageous here if the distance between the points or areas and are selected to be as large as possible. The points or areas and should advantageously be arranged symmetrically here with respect to a plane in which the longitudinal direction runs. The leaf spring ensures through its elasticity that unevennesses in the system are compensated. In this context the use of the leaf spring is also advantageous because it makes relatively long spring travel available with extremely simple means and furthermore given a corresponding design the leaf spring does not dig into the bearing bodies either. In addition with a leaf spring the force can be applied to the column tube selectively at the desired points or areas and . The use of a bolt in the form of an aligning pin is a particularly economical solution.

In all the exemplary embodiments according to the invention shown there is provision that the leaf spring has at least two support faces which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube with which support faces said leaf spring presses against the column tube directly or with the interposition of at least one bearing body . In this context the leaf spring presses exclusively with its side facing the column tube against the column tube . This applies both to the case in which the leaf spring presses directly against the column tube as well as to the case in which this pressing occurs with the interposition of the one or more bearing bodies . Generally there is advantageously provision that the leaf spring presses with its support faces spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube against the column tube at the points which are spaced apart from one another in the circumferential direction of the column tube. The corresponding support faces of the leaf spring can be but do not have to be arranged in the area just before the ends of the leaf spring . The same symmetry as in the case of the points or areas at which the leaf spring or its support faces bear against the column tube preferably applies to the arrangement of the support faces.

As is also implemented in the individual exemplary embodiments there is advantageously provision that the opening in the carrier body is bounded exclusively by walls which are parallel to one another. These may be for example walls which are parallel to one another in pairs. The walls are generally part of the carrier body .
