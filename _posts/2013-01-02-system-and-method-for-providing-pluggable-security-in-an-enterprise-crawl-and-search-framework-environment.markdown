A pluggable security environment which includes one or more enterprise application security APIs authentication services security plugin authorization service and data service allows an application developer to add security information to enterprise application data before inserting or creating indexes on the search engine and deploy the enterprise application and use any policies in its configuration to configure enterprise application domain security so that at query time the security environment retrieves security keys of a user performing an enterprise application search and passes those keys to the search engine where they are used to filter the query results.

As described above organizations have become increasingly interested in greater integration of their business content with their business processes including the use of transaction processing systems or application servers to deliver a higher quality of service in today s increasingly complex business environment.

In particular today s enterprise search specialists are looking to several important aspects of enterprise searching for use with their systems including 

To address this in accordance with an embodiment described herein are systems and methods for providing an enterprise crawl and search framework ECSF including features such as use with middleware and enterprise application environments pluggable security search development tools user interfaces and governance.

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework can be used with environments such as Oracle Fusion Applications and or Oracle WebLogic application server or other enterprise application and computing environments to consolidate business content information and enable transactional search in a business context.

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework includes an open architecture that supports different types of search engine in a plug and play manner e.g. the use of Oracle Secure Enterprise Search SES or another open source or proprietary search engine. An administrator can add define configure and change search engines define repositories to be supported and administer external repositories such as defining their location defining and configuring connectors indexing external data and defining parameters related to federated search.

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework can support features such as searching across different objects that have 1 1 1 M M 1 or M M relationships with each other as defined by the organization s business process and the use of searchable objects which allow users to control which objects can be exposed and made searchable.

In accordance with an embodiment which uses Fusion Applications the enterprise crawl and search framework can be provided as part of an integrated environment that includes the framework itself one or more search engines that provides the fundamental search capability that includes indexing querying and security and a source system such as a relational database which stores searchable business content or other information.

In accordance with various embodiments described herein some of the features and advantages of the enterprise crawl and search framework include 

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework includes a searchable object manager component a search designer component a runtime e.g. managed bean Mbean component a semantic engine component a command line administration utility component and one or more security services e.g. data service and query service . Each of the above components is described in further detail below.

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework integrates with an enterprise search engine e.g. SES which provides capabilities for crawling and indexing metadata and objects exposed by the framework. In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise search engine can include one or more security plugin components e.g. crawler plugin component and search federation component . Each of the above components is also described in further detail below.

In accordance with an embodiment each enterprise application can include a search user interface UI and an application repository .

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise search environment including the enterprise crawl and search framework can be accessed by a developer or another user using an application development framework e.g. Oracle JDeveloper and by an administrator or another user using an administration system e.g. Oracle Fusion Applications Control or Oracle Enterprise Manager .

In accordance with an embodiment the searchable object manager component serves as a metadata manager manages searchable objects and provides the runtime interface for accessing these objects. At runtime the searchable object manager loads searchable objects from persistent storage validates the searchable object definitions and provides the searchable objects to a crawlable factory component of the data service. In accordance with an embodiment the searchable object manager is also responsible for the lifecycle management of the searchable objects which allows administrators to deploy customize and enable or disable searchable objects via the command line administration utility component or the administration system.

In accordance with an embodiment the search designer component can be provided e.g. as a page in JDeveloper including an interface for defining metadata that describes the business objects to be indexed. A developer or another user can use this design interface to specify the security mechanism to be used to protect the data and to define the searchable object search characteristics which include advanced search faceted navigation and actionable results.

In accordance with an embodiment the semantic engine component leverages the semantic information of searchable object definitions to create context around the search by interpreting searchable object definitions with relation to the runtime user information during both crawl and query time.

In accordance with an embodiment the administration system can be provided e.g. as an Enterprise Manager extension that provides a user interface for registering searchable objects in the framework schema of e.g. the Fusion Applications database as well as for administering the runtime parameters of the framework the target search engine and the configuration of parameters.

In accordance with an embodiment the command line administration utility component is a standalone command line interface that provides a user interface for registering searchable objects in the framework schema of e.g. the Fusion Applications database. A developer administrator or other user can also use the command line administration utility to configure and administer the framework without external dependencies on the administration system.

In accordance with an embodiment the security service component is responsible for providing security information to the search engine. During query time the security service retrieves the security keys of the user performing the search and passes those keys to the search engine where they are used to filter the query results.

In accordance with an embodiment the security service server component is also invoked during crawl time to add security information access control lists ACL to data before inserting or creating indexes on the search engine. An ACL identifies the users who can access an associated object and specifies the user s access rights to that object. The ACL values generated by the security service during crawl time should match the corresponding keys generated during query time.

In accordance with an embodiment the security service component is implemented as a security engine with a plug in interface. The security plug in determines the format of the ACL keys. For custom security models a new custom security plug in can be implemented. In accordance with an embodiment the security service can use e.g. Oracle Platform Security for Java to authenticate users and call the security plug in to retrieve security values for a given searchable object.

In accordance with an embodiment the data service component is the primary data interface between the enterprise crawl and search framework and the search engine. In accordance with an embodiment the data service can use a proprietary Really Simple Syndication RSS feed format. In addition to supporting the flow of metadata between the framework and the search engine the data service can support attachments batching and error handling.

In accordance with an embodiment the data service authenticates each search engine crawl request by using e.g. Platform Security for Java to validate the user credentials and permissions for crawling the data source. A crawlable factory component which is part of the data service determines how searchable objects are broken down and manages the construction of RSS feeds to the search engine.

In accordance with an embodiment the query service component provides a search interface for the enterprise application s search user interface UI and handles all search requests. In accordance with an embodiment the query service performs query rewrite parameter substitution and other preprocessing operations before invoking the underlying configured search engine. Search results are also serviced via this service. Hooks can be provided to preprocess and postprocess data which facilitates the capability to filter search results.

In accordance with an embodiment the search engine component e.g. SES enables a secure uniform search across multiple enterprise repositories. The enterprise crawl and search framework integrates with the search engine to provide full text search functionality in enterprise applications e.g. Fusion Applications .

Some search engines such as SES provide an API for writing security plug ins or connectors e.g. in Java which allows a developer to provide a security plug in to meet their requirements. In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework can interface with this security plug in. The security plug in invokes the security service to retrieve keys to which the user has access for filtering the results that are delivered to the query service. In accordance with an embodiment a proxy user must be set up on the search engine in order to invoke the security service and must have security privileges for the enterprise applications e.g. Fusion Applications .

In accordance with an embodiment the crawler plug in component is a search engine module that implements the modified RSS feed format between the enterprise crawl and search framework and the search engine. In accordance with an embodiment the crawler plug in component deserializes data communicated by the framework via the data service component and interfaces with the search engine components that create the indexes.

In accordance with an embodiment the search federation component provides support for the user of federated search engine instances.

As shown in in accordance with an embodiment a business intelligence BI server environment such as an Oracle Business Intelligence environment using WebLogic application server can include a BI server and a web services component that provides access to a BI web catalog of business content data or other information .

In accordance with an embodiment one or more BI applications can include an enterprise crawl and search framework API which allows a developer or other user using an application development framework and or administration system to configure the BI application s to take advantage of the enterprise crawl and search framework including leveraging the enterprise search engine search instances and search engine database to provide full text search functionality across the applications.

In accordance with an embodiment a system including the enterprise crawl and search framework can include support for pluggable security.

As described above in accordance with an embodiment during query time the security service retrieves the security keys of the user performing the search and passes those keys to the search engine where they are used to filter the query results. During crawl time the security service adds security information access control lists ACL to data before inserting or creating indexes on the search engine. An ACL identifies the users who can access an associated object and specifies the user s access rights to that object. The ACL values generated by the security service during crawl time should match the corresponding keys generated during query time.

In accordance with an embodiment a security plug in determines the format of the ACL keys. For custom security models a new custom security plug in can be implemented. Some search engines such as SES provide an API for writing security plug ins or connectors e.g. in Java which allows a developer to provide a security plug in to meet their requirements. In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework can interface with this security plug in. When alternative types of search engine are used alternative plug ins connectors or means of communicating with the search engine can be used depending on the particular requirements and features of the search engine.

As shown in in accordance with an embodiment the enterprise search engine e.g. SES can include one or more administration component identity management component with ID plugin crawling layer including metadata extractor CS plugin NTFS plugin and application plugin security layer including CS authentication plugin and object authentication plugin search e.g. SES index and query layer with a federation component that provides access to one or more search engine instances .

As further shown in in accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework ECSF can include one or more Enterprise Application e.g. Fusion Applications security APIs authentication services security plugin authorization service and data service .

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework security can be configured by a user using an administration system e.g. Fusion Applications Control or Enterprise Manager .

In accordance with an embodiment the search engine does not apply data level security to business objects that are exposed as searchable objects to determine if a particular object can be viewed by the user. Instead the system is configured so that all qualified users will see a limited amount of information when the business object is enabled for search. In accordance with an embodiment the information displayed in the search results e.g. the search box or user interface includes the item number and description. The enterprise crawl and search framework checks the data level security whenever the user elects to view item details by following through the links within their search results.

In accordance with an embodiment the pluggable security environment can be used to secure credentials and searchable application data. The credentials are required for the enterprise crawl and search framework engine to be able to communicate with the enterprise search engine s administration service query service and security service. In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework also uses Secure Socket Layer SSL to secure the connections through which the credentials are transmitted.

In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework can store credentials and passwords in e.g. a Credential Store Framework CSF component of a WebLogic domain. These passwords can then be used to perform secure interaction between the enterprise crawl and search framework engine and the enterprise search engine.

In accordance with an embodiment when the enterprise crawl and search framework runtime server or client library is added to e.g. an enterprise application project in JDeveloper a permission policy can be added to an identity management ID store for that enterprise application e.g. in the contact of Fusion Applications the jazn data.xml file for example 

When the enterprise application is subsequently deployed the policies in the identity management store for that enterprise application can then be used to configure the enterprise application domain security e.g. the WebLogic domain .

For example in accordance with an embodiment Fusion Applications include six search related application identities that are seeded and are stored in the identity store FUSION APPS CRM SES CRAWL APPID FUSION APPS FSCM SES CRAWL APPID FUSION APPS HCM SES CRAWL APPID FUSION APPS CRM ECSF SEARCH APPID FUSION APPS FSCM ECSF SEARCH APPID FUSION APPS HCM ECSF SEARCH APPID and FUSION APPS ECSF SES ADMIN APPID.

In accordance with an embodiment each pair of application identities including one pair for each product family are used to integrate the enterprise crawl and search framework with the enterprise application in this example Fusion Applications . In accordance with an embodiment the Credential Store Framework CSF component of the WebLogic domain can be used to store the credentials to access the identities.

If the enterprise application developer is developing applications on e.g. an Integrated WebLogic Server instance then in accordance with an embodiment they must manually configure the application identities to integrate the enterprise crawl and search framework for the crawl users SES ADMIN USERNAME SES QUERY PROXY USERNAME and ECSF SECURITY USERNAME.

The required setup for any particular user depends on the application setup and is not controlled by the enterprise crawl and search framework. For example Fusion Applications includes three application IDs that are created for use in crawling data FUSION APPS CRM SES CRAWL APPID FUSION APPS FSCM SES CRAWL APPID and FUSION APPS HCM SES CRAWL APPID. In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise application developer must make sure that the proper roles permissions and privileges are granted to these three application IDs so they have access to the data to be crawled.

In the example of a Fusion Applications environment to configure the application identities the enterprise application developer must also ensure the SearchContext is set to FusionSearchContextlmpl create the application identities and ensure the permission policies for the identity store and the JPS IdentityAssertion API are added to the identity management store for that enterprise application e.g. in the context of Fusion Applications the jazn data.xml file .

In order for the enterprise crawl and search framework to handle the application identities of e.g. Fusion applications the SearchContext must be set to FusionSearchContextlmpl. The SearchContext is automatically set at runtime based on the runtime environment. If the SearchContext is not set properly then the developer can set the context using an oracle.ecsf.context system property.

For example the developer can set the user names for Customer Relationship Management to SES ADMIN USERNAME eqsys SES QUERY PROXY USERNAME FUSION APPS CRM ECSF SEARCH APPID and ECSF SECURITY USERNAME FUSION APPS CRM SES CRAWL APPID.

Once the user names are set the developer can update the corresponding password parameters for those users to the key names for the application identities. This creates entries with the correct map key pairs for the users.

For a Fusion Applications environment in accordance with an embodiment in order for the enterprise crawl and search framework to read and write to the application identity maps in the keystore and access the JPS IdentityAssertion API permissions must be granted to the crawl users. In the context of Fusion applications the permission policies are seeded in the identity management store for the enterprise application e.g. the jazn data.xml file and can be managed in e.g. Fusion Applications Control for example by specifying 

The permissions allow the enterprise crawl and search framework to read and write credential store entries. New grants are needed in order to authorize users for the search feeds which can be provided by manually update the application s jazn data.xml file 

The above examples illustrate how the jazn data.xml file can be modified to grant the permission to a role. In accordance with an embodiment the enterprise crawl and search framework secures the searchable application data by authenticating and authorizing users who use ECSF to perform searches and enabling the use of the security model for authenticating and authorizing users. To enable the use of the security model the developer can 

At step a security service component is provided which is responsible for providing security information to the search engine.

At step a developer or other user adds security information e.g. access control lists ACL to the enterprise application data before inserting or creating indexes on search engine.

At step the enterprise application is deployed and uses any policies in its configuration to configure enterprise application domain security.

At step at query time the security service retrieves security keys of user performing enterprise application search and passes those keys to the search engine where they are used to filter the query results.

The present invention may be conveniently implemented using one or more conventional general purpose or specialized digital computer computing device machine or microprocessor including one or more processors memory and or computer readable storage media programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure. Appropriate software coding can readily be prepared by skilled programmers based on the teachings of the present disclosure as will be apparent to those skilled in the software art.
