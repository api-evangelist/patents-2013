This disclosure relates generally to the field of communications and more specifically to a location aware conferencing system and method.

For some conferences or meetings all the attendees or participants may not be in the same location. For example some of the participants may be in one conference room while other participants may be in another conference room and or at various separate remote locations. Still other participants may be in transit between two locations and or may be dialing into the conference using a mobile device. Regardless of the location of the user conferencing systems such as WebEx or other collaborative applications require the participant to dial and or identify a phone number that the application may dial to conference in the participant.

In one embodiment a method includes receiving a first request to join a conference from a first user device. The location of the first user device is determined. Based on the location of the first user device the proximity of the first user device relative to endpoints configured to facilitate the conference is identified. A first one of the endpoints that is more proximate to the first user device than other endpoints is selected for handling the conferences.

Conference locations may be any location from which one or more users participate in a conference. In the example of users are located in a first conference location which may be a conference room in a particular embodiment.

In certain embodiments logic may determine the location of endpoints and the location of user devices relative to the endpoints . For example logic may determine that user device is proximate endpoint

In particular embodiments the location of user devices and endpoints may be determined by mobility services engine MSE . In some embodiments MSE may refer to any suitable combination of hardware and or software implemented in one or more modules to process data and provide the described functions and operations. In some embodiments the functions and operations described herein may be performed by multiple MSEs . In some embodiments MSE may include for example a mainframe server host computer workstation web server file server a personal computer such as a laptop or any other suitable device operable to process data. In some embodiments MSE may execute any suitable operating system such as IBM s zSeries Operating System z OS MS DOS PC DOS MAC OS WINDOWS UNIX OpenVMS or any other appropriate operating systems including future operating systems. In some embodiments MSE may be a web server running Microsoft s Internet Information Server .

In general MSE communicates with controller endpoints and or user devices to determine the location of user devices relative to endpoints for the purpose of facilitating a conference between users . In some embodiments MSE may include a processor and a memory . Processor is generally operable to execute logic stored in memory to determine the locations of endpoints according to the disclosure. Processor may include one or more microprocessors controllers or any other suitable computing devices or resources. Processor may work either alone or with components of conferencing system to provide a portion or all of the functionality of conferencing system described herein. In some embodiments processor may include for example any type of central processing unit CPU .

Processor is communicatively coupled to a memory . Memory may refer to any suitable device capable of storing and facilitating retrieval of data and or instructions. Examples of memory include computer memory for example Random Access Memory RAM or Read Only Memory ROM mass storage media for example a hard disk removable storage media for example a Compact Disk CD or a Digital Video Disk DVD database and or network storage for example a server and or any other volatile or non volatile computer readable memory devices that store one or more files lists tables or other arrangements of information. Although illustrates memory as internal to MSE it should be understood that memory may be internal or external to MSE depending on particular implementations. Also memory may be separate from or integral to other memory devices to achieve any suitable arrangement of memory devices for use in conferencing system .

Memory is generally operable to store logic and logic information . Logic generally refers to logic rules algorithms code tables and or other suitable instructions for performing the described functions and operations. In some embodiments logic includes a communications solution which provides location identification services such as Mobility Services Engine available from Cisco Systems Inc.

Location information may be any suitable data associated with and or used to identify the location of user devices . In some embodiments location information may be received from user devices endpoints or other components of system . In some embodiments location information may include identifiers for all devices and endpoints capable of coupling to network using a WIFI connection. In some embodiments location information may include location information associated with endpoints that are capable of facilitating a conferencing session. For example location information may include one or more facility maps that identify the location of endpoints within an enterprise facility. In some embodiments location information may be stored in a database which may also include additional information about user devices and or endpoints .

As described above logic when executed by processor is configured to detect the location of a user device relative to an endpoint for use by controller in facilitating a conferencing session. For example it is described above that when user at first conference location wishes to join a conferencing session the user may use user device to transmit a join request . In one particular embodiment the join request may be generated in response to user clicking on a URL link within an email related to a scheduled conferencing session. Specifically a current meeting page may be displayed on user device in response to user clicking the URL link within the email. The meeting page may include a connect button that user may select to join the conferencing session. In certain embodiments join request may be generated after and because user selects the connect button. In other embodiments the generation of the meeting page may be omitted and the join request may be generated automatically in response to the user clicking the URL link within the email.

Join request may be transmitted to and received by controller . In certain embodiments controller may then forward join request a portion of join request or some other data relevant to the join request user and or user endpoint to MSE . In a particular embodiment controller may transmit a query to MSE that requests location information for endpoint . Logic of MSE may then operate to determine the location of user device . In certain embodiments logic may operate to track the location of user device based on the devices s WIFI connection to network . Specifically and in a particular embodiment logic may use triangulation to pinpoint the location of user device

In particular embodiments logic of MSE may compare the identified location of user device to location information to determine the nearest endpoint that may be used to participate in the conferencing session. For example when join request is received from user device logic may determine that endpoint at first conference location is the closest endpoint to facilitate the teleconference for user . Similarly when join request is received from user device logic may determine that endpoint at second conference location is the closest endpoint to facilitate the teleconference for user . However when join request is received from user device logic may determine the location of user device and then further determine whether user device is closer to first conference location or second conference location

After logic identifies the closest endpoint this information may be conveyed to controller . Controller may then determine a phone number associated with the closest endpoint and call the closest endpoint to initiate the conferencing session. Accordingly in the depicted example controller may identify endpoint as being closest to user device and call endpoint to initiate the conferencing session for user . Likewise controller may identify endpoint as being closest to user device and call endpoint to initiate the conferencing session for user . With regard to user device controller may identify the endpoint that is closest to user device and call that endpoint to initiate the conferencing session for user . Additionally or alternatively controller may direct end user to the location of the closest endpoint .

In certain embodiments controller may determine that an endpoint has already initiated the conferencing session and thus does not need to be called. For example controller may receive a first join request from user device . MSE may operate to determine location information of user device determine that user device is proximate to endpoint . As described above MSE may provide that information to controller which may then dial a phone number associated with endpoint to initiate the conferencing session. If thereafter controller receives a second joint request from user device . MSE may then operate to determine location information of user device and determine that user device is also proximate to endpoint . MSE may then provide that information to controller . Controller may determine that endpoint has already been called and that the conferencing session has already been initiated at first conference location . Because the conferencing session is already in progress or has already been initiated controller may recognize that no further action is needed to facilitate the conferencing session for user

It is recognized that various changes alterations transformations and modifications may be made to conferencing system . For example in certain embodiments a user may opt out of automatic calling and instead select to receive location information of endpoints . As such controller may be configured to provide endpoint location information to user devices rather than automatically call the endpoint locations to initiate the conferencing session. For example MSE may operate to determine location information associated with a user device and the most proximate endpoint as described above. MSE may transmit the location information to controller . However rather than automatically dial a telephone number associated with the most proximate endpoint to initiate the conferencing session controller may be configured to transmit a message to the user device . In a particular embodiment the message may include a list of phone numbers associated with multiple endpoints that may be used to initiate the conferencing session. The list of phone numbers may be prioritized in certain embodiments such that the most proximate endpoint is listed first and the furthest endpoint from the user device is listed last. A user may then select the endpoint that the user would like to use to initiate the conferencing session. Controller may then dial the phone number associated with the endpoint selected by the user .

In certain embodiments automated dialing or user selectable dialing may be user customizable. Thus a user may set one or more settings maintained by controller that disable or enable automated dialing. For example a user may choose to enable automated dialing such that the most proximate endpoint is always automatically dialed when a join request is initiated by a user device . Conversely a user may choose to disable automated dialing such that the user is always presented with a prioritized list of the most proximate endpoints . In still other embodiments a user may disable or enable automated dialing based on location. For example a user may enable automated dialing for the user s office. Thus controller may be configured to automatically dial the user s office telephone when controller determines that the user is proximate to his office. Conversely when controller receives location information identifying the location of the user as being outside the user s office controller may be configured to present the user with a prioritized list of the most proximate endpoints .

As another example alteration controller may not request location of a user device in response to a join request. Rather controller may register to automatically receive location information for certain or all user devices that communicate with network . In one particular embodiment MSE may automatically operate to monitor for and detect events associated with a user device . The event may include for example a change in position containment within a specific boundary or some other criteria. When an event is detected MSE may determine the location of the user device and match the user device and or event to any event subscriptions maintained by the MSE . When MSE identifies a match between an event and an event subscription MSE may transmit details associated with the user device and the location information associated with the user device and or event to controller . In this manner or some similar manner controller may subscribe to receive location information for user devices .

As another example logic of MSE may be configured to detect the location of only those user devices that are registered with network in certain embodiments. For example in a particular embodiment network may include a private enterprise network. User devices may be required to register with the network before a wireless or other type connection may be established between the user devices and the network . In this manner MSE may be configured to recognize only those user devices that are authorized to connect to network . Additionally though controller is described as receiving join requests and then forwarding such join requests to MSE it is generally recognized that MSE may receive join request or the portion thereof directly from user device in certain embodiments. Thus either or both of MSE and controller may receive join requests from user devices 

At step a location of the first user device may be determined at step . In a particular embodiment determining the location of the first user device may include detecting the wireless connection of the first user device with a network. The location of the first user device may then be determined based on the wireless connection of the first user device. For example triangulation may be used to determine the location of the first user device based on the wireless connection.

At step the proximity of the first user device relative to a plurality of endpoints configured to facilitate the conference may be identified. A first one of the plurality of endpoints may be selected for handling the conference at step . The selected endpoint may be more proximate i.e. closer to the first user device than other ones of the plurality of endpoints.

At step a determination may be made as whether the selected endpoint is already participating in the conference. If the selected endpoint is already participating in the conference no further action may required for the user to join the conference and the method may terminate. If however the selected endpoint is not already participating in the conference the conferencing session may be automatically initiated at the selected endpoint at step . In a particular embodiment initiating the conferencing session may include identifying a call in number associated with the selected endpoint and automatically dialing the call in number. In other embodiments the call in number may not be automatically dialed. Instead a message may be transmitted to the first user device. The message may include a prioritized list of all endpoints that may facilitate or handle the conferencing system. The list may be prioritized such that the endpoint that is closest to the first user device is listed first and the endpoint that is furthest from the first user device is listed last.
