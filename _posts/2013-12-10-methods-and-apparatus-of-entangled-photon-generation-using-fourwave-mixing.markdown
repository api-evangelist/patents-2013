This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 876 677 filed on Sep. 11 2013 by R. Camacho under the title Methods and Apparatus of Entangled Photon Generation Using Four Wave Mixing which application is commonly owned herewith and the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

The generation of entangled photons is an essential element in current approaches to quantum information processing and quantum communication. In particular it is often desirable to generate entangled photons having narrow spectral bandwidths to facilitate coupling to long lived quantum memories or repeaters.

Various physical mechanisms have been considered for generating entangled photons. One such mechanism is four wave mixing FWM . In particular FWM in chip scale microresonators has been proposed as potentially advantageous means for producing narrowband entangled photons.

FWM in microresonators is usually performed in systems such as disk and ring resonators that have azimuthal symmetry also referred to herein as cylindrical symmetry . Such systems are advantageous because among other reasons they readily permit near equal mode spacing small mode volumes and high optical quality factors.

For entangled photon production an underlying electronic nonlinearity is utilized to produce spontaneous degenerate FWM. Driven FWM has also been considered. In particular it has been shown that driving above the parametric oscillation threshold can produce frequency combs. More specifically if the resonant disk or ring is composed of a material with a third order nonlinear suceptiblity 3 z then upon pumping the resonator with a strong pump beam of frequency selected to couple into mode m of the ring a process may occur by spontaneous FWM in which two pump photons are annihilated to produce an entangled pair of signal and idler photons of respective frequencies and . However the process must conserve both energy and momentum. The conservation of energy requires that 2 .

The conservation of momentum requires that m m 2m in which m m and mare the respective mode numbers for the signal idler and pump waves.

Various investigators have attempted to theoretically model the spectrum resulting from spontaneous and driven FWM in azimuthally symmetric systems. Although it has been more common in these efforts to approximate the cylindrical resonator as an unfolded straight waveguide several investigators have employed a representation in cylindrical coordinates which is more naturally suited to systems with azimuthal symmetry.

For example a fully vectorial treatment of cascaded FWM in a spherical resonator taking into account all components of the electric field spatial mode overlaps and resonator dispersion profiles was reported in Y. K. Chembo and N. Yu Modal expansion approach to optical frequency comb generation with monolithic whispering gallery mode resonators 82 033801 2010 and in Y. K. Chembo D. V. Strekalov and N. Yu Spectrum and dynamics of optical frequency combs generated with monolithic whispering gallery mode resonators 104 103902 2010 . Although those results apply only to spherical resonators and neglect material dispersion they successfully track the spectral evolution resulting from the FWM interaction.

A theoretical study of the quantum correlations resulting from spontaneous FWM in azimuthally symmetric ring resonators was presented in J. Chen Z. H. Levine J. Fan and A. L. Migdall Frequency bin entangled comb of photon pairs from a Silicon on Insulator micro resonator 19 1470 1483 2011 . That work predicted that FWM in an azimuthally symmetric ring resonator could be used to generate a frequency bin entangled comb of photon pairs. However that work included certain implicit assumptions based on rectilinear rather than cylindrical resonator geometries.

More specifically in their quantum formalism the authors enforced a phase matching condition that involved integrating an effective linear group velocity and linear wavevector i.e. k vector over an unfolded cavity of specified linear length. In a cylindrical system however the linear momentum is zero and the linear wavevector and group velocities are poorly defined particularly for small resonator radii such as radii approaching ten or fewer times the resonant wavelength. Moreover because cylindrical resonator systems lack translational symmetry the accuracy with which optical wave propagation can be modeled using a linear wavevector is limited. Greater accuracy would be achieved using the angular wavevector and angular group velocities.

One thing that has been lacking until now is a fully vectorial quantum model in cylindrical coordinates to describe spontaneous FWM in axially symmetric systems which might facilitate new design approaches and even lead to new optical devices based on properties revealed by the use of such a model.

We have developed a non linear optical device that exhibits FWM. The device comprises an optical disk or ring microresonator fabricated from a material that exhibits an optical nonlinearity able to produce degenerate four wave mixing FWM in response to a pump beam having a pump frequency in a specified effective range. The microresonator is conformed to exhibit an angular group velocity minimum at a pump frequency within the specified effective range such that there is zero angular group velocity dispersion at the pump frequency. We refer to such a pump frequency as the zero dispersion frequency .

In embodiments excitation of the resonator by a pump beam of sufficient intensity at the zero dispersion frequency causes the resonator to emit a frequency comb of entangled photon pairs wherein the respective frequencies in each pair are symmetrically placed about the zero dispersion frequency.

In systems with azimuthal symmetry the optical eigenmodes of the system as expressed in cylindrical coordinates may be labeled by an integer angular wavenumber m thus the azimuthally symmetric electric field distribution for mode m may be expressed by E r t E z e. Here r and t are respectively the spatial and time coordinates and and z have their usual meaning as the azimuth independent cylindrical coordinates.

Also indicated in the figure are examples of the radial field profiles E z for three TE like resonant modes with differing angular wavenumbers and radial orders. Specifically the modes represented in the figure are the first three radial modes with odd vector symmetry about the z axis TE like modes .

It should be noted in this regard that the modeling results presented here were based on numerical calculations that considered only the fundamental radial TE like modes.

As can be seen from each of the field profiles the circumnavigating field near the outside of the mode travels a much greater linear distance than the field near the inside of the mode leading to linear group and phase velocities that depend on the coordinate p. As those skilled in the art will understand the angular group and phase velocities are therefore better suited to describing optical propagation in the illustrative system.

As noted above if the resonant disk or ring is composed of a material with a third order nonlinear susceptibility z then upon pumping the resonator with a strong pump beam of frequency selected to couple into mode m of the ring a process may occur by spontaneous FWM in which two pump photons are annihilated to produce an entangled pair of signal and idler photons of respective frequencies and . However the process must conserve both energy and momentum. It should be noted that what is meant here is angular not linear momentum. The conservation of energy requires that 2 . The conservation of angular momentum requires that m m 2m in which m m and mare the respective mode numbers for the signal idler and pump waves.

Upon consideration of the integer solutions m m of the momentum condition m m 2mfor given integer m it will be understood that if mis less than mby an integer amount m then mwill exceed mby the same amount and vice versa. Hence for any value of m in a range limited only by the value of m there will be a pair of phase matched modes at m m m and m m m.

The possible solutions to the energy condition 2 are more limited however because although is discrete it can assume values that are not necessarily equally spaced in the continuum from which they are drawn. Hence the dispersion of the optical modes or in other words their spectral spacing is the most important factor for determining whether spontaneous FWM will occur and produce entangled photon pairs.

By quantizing the electromagnetic field in the cylindrical resonator and using first order perturbation theory we derived an expression provided below for calculating the spectra of entangled photon pairs bi photon spectra generated by our system. Selected steps in our analysis are presented below. As the full analysis is not necessary for practical implementation of our discoveries as described here we have omitted it for brevity. Those wishing to consult the full analysis may refer for example to R. M. Camacho Entangled photon generation using four wave mixing in aximuthally symmetric microresonators 20 Issue 20 21977 21991 2012 .

It should be noted that the group and phase velocities are explicitly included in the normalization of the electric field operator. This is essential if the total energy of of the system is to be accounted for in a Hamiltonian formulation.

Here vand vare respectively the group and phase velocities r is the dielectric constant equal to in free space and circumflex over t and circumflex over t are respectively the creation and destruction operators well known from quantum mechanical formalism.

Equation 1 is valid in any coordinate system but specializing to the case of azimuthal symmetry yields certain simplifications and insights. Importantly it is the ratio of the angular phase and group velocities that are relevant in this case since the unfolded linear phase and group velocities are not well defined i.e. they depend on r . The angular phase and group velocities in units of radians s may be written

In deriving Eq. 5 we assumed a monochromatic pump with a classical amplitude and we made use of a two port cavity input output formalism in which represents an intrinsic loss rate and is the total loss rate intrinsic and extrinsic . We also made the approximation that the cavity linewidth is much less than the FSR 

Given the two photon wavefunction it is straightforward to calculate quantities such as the bi photon production rate the single photon spectrum and the coincidence spectrum.

For example the signal beam spectrum more specifically the single photon spectrum for one of the two photons in a bi photon pair is

The design for a typical disk or ring resonator is specified by the resonator material the composition of the surrounding material or materials the outer diameter the height and for a ring resonator the inner diameter. Of course the width of the ring may equivalently be specified instead of the inner or outer diameter.

The field profiles u r and the eigenfrequencies can be calculated using e.g. a fully vectorial 2 D axially symmetric weighted residual formulation of Maxwell s equations as implemented for example in Comsol Multiphysics software available from COMSOL Inc. 10850 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 800 Los Angeles Calif. 90024 www.comsol.com.

An iterative approach can be used to incorporate material dispersion which is expressed using a Sellmeier equation for the wavelength dependent dielectric constant. The dielectric constant of silicon nitride for example may be approximated by

More information about modeling the wavelength dependent dielectric constant may be gained for example from T. B k Silicon oxynitride a material for GRIN optics 21 1069 1072 1982 and I. H. Malitson Interspecimen comparison of the refractive index of fused silica 55 1205 1208 1965 .

Given the field profiles and the eigenfrequencies it is straightforward to calculate the local FSR ffor each eigenmode the spectral walk off and the spectra of the signal and idler photons using the equations presented above.

Using the analysis presented above we calculated the spectra of entangled bi photons generated by resonators of representative designs in two illustrative geometries a thick silicon nitride disk and a larger silicon nitride ring. In the ring resonator we discovered a special situation in which the dispersion in the ring resonator allows for generation of entangled pairs with extremely wide spectral separation while suppressing pair generation for closely spaced modes.

Referring ahead to for example it will be seen that an angular wavenumber corresponding to a particular pump frequency was identified at which there is zero angular group velocity dispersion which as will be understood from the foregoing analysis also corresponds to a stationary point here a minimum in the graph of angular group velocity or of free spectral range versus angular wavenumber.

In the example of excitation of the resonator by a pump beam of sufficient intensity at the zero dispersion frequency produced a frequency comb of entangled photon pairs but similar excitation at a particular frequency offset from the zero dispersion frequency caused the resonator to emit entangled photons in a pair of frequencies that were symmetrically placed relative to the pump frequency and were widely spaced relative to the emissions in the concurrently emitted frequency comb.

By widely spaced in this regard we mean that the frequency pair is separated by more than the full width at half maximum of any concurrently emitted frequency comb. In fact the frequency pair in the example presented was also separated by more than the full width at half maximum of the frequency comb emitted when the resonator was excited at the zero dispersion frequency.

This example is provided in part as a pedagogical aide to introduce the interpretation of our computational results and it is provided in part as a basis for comparison to the surprising results described below in Example 2.

We modeled a silicon nitride disk suspended in air with a radius of 20 m and a thickness of 250 nm. Silicon nitride was of interest because it is an important optical material whose spectral bandgap lies above the energy required for two photon absorption at the 1550 nm communication wavelength.

As an aide to interpretation of the figure we have added an air line and a dielectric in this instance silicon nitride line which respectively indicate the fictitious frequency tilde over f each mode would have were it contained completely within the air medium or the silicon nitride medium while possessing the same mode profile. The equation for the air or silicon nitride line in terms of an effective radius rand a dielectric constant E of the respective medium is

Qualitatively speaking the mode must be bounded by these two lines and must asymptotically approach one or the other as m tends respectively to zero or infinity. Mode dispersion occurs as a result of the transition of the mode frequency from the air line to the dielectric line.

As would be expected the FSR decreases as the mode transitions from the air line to the dielectric line. As seen the FSR ultimately levels off to a value near 1.2 THz. An important observation is that the FSR decreases monotonically for the represented range in m this is most evident upon reference to the derivative of the FSR as a function of m which is seen to be consistently negative. As a consequence there is no point of zero angular group velocity dispersion where the FSR would be stationary and the derivative would be zero .

It will be recalled from the preceding discussion that energy can be perfectly conserved in an FWM interaction only if 2 . This in turn demands emission into a pair of modes i.e. the signal and idler modes whose respective frequencies are symmetrically placed about the pump frequency which by assumption corresponds to angular wavenumber m as indicated on the horizontal axis of the figure. By symmetrically placed is meant that the respective emission frequencies fall at equal intervals above and below the pump frequency. The FSR however is equivalent to the frequency spacing and equivalently the energy spacing of the modes. It is clear on reference to the figure that any pair of emissive modes that conserve energy must violate the momentum conservation rule requiring m m 2m since to balance the energy of a mode placed a certain wavenumber interval to the left of the pump mode would require a second mode placed a greater wavenumber interval to the right of the pump mode.

The spectrum has been normalized such that a peak will have a value of unity when the mode pair and corresponding to that peak exactly conserve energy 0 have identical angular group velocities f f and have a perfect spatial overlap u r u r u r and the approximation m m mis valid. Any reduction in the amplitude of a peak in the spectrum results from one of these criteria not being fulfilled and is dominated by nonzero values of the walk off signifying that energy is not perfectly conserved.

The dotted reference line in shows the location of the pump beam on the dispersion walk off curve f. As can be seen the change in the FSR for each successive mode is approximately 2 GHz which corresponds to approximately a full linewidth at the pertinent frequencies. For example 200 THz 105 2 GHz . Consequently the first order sidebands in the spectrum are reduced by almost one half from the ideal case and the second order sidebands and beyond are strongly suppressed owing to the walk off.

We modeled a silicon nitride ring of radius r 20 m clad with silicon dioxide and of width w 1.1 m and thickness h 750 nm.

In fact we observed that a similar change in curvature will also occur in the thin disk of Example 1 but only at higher frequencies where the optical mode field is much more strongly confined by the high index dielectric and approaches the dielectric light line more closely.

With further reference to and continuing with the present example it will be seen that the FSR curve passes through a minimum and the derivative curve passes through zero at a point marked with the numeral 1 in the figure at an angular wavenumber m of about 137. Thus there is at that point a zero crossing in f signifying a point of zero angular group velocity dispersion. As will be explained in more detail below the identification of a zero dispersion frequency can be utilized to produce more desirable entangled photon spectra.

We chose the geometry of the ring so that the zero dispersion point would occur near a wavelength of 1550 nm. Through numerical modeling using the results presented here it is likewise possible to select design parameters of the resonator including its composition and dimensions to yield any of a range of desired zero dispersion frequencies. In particular an iterative procedure may be used in which an initial estimate of design parameters leads to an initial spectral calculation which may lead to one or more refined estimates followed by further calculations until a comparison indicates that the predicted and desired spectral properties agree to within a specified margin.

We note in this regard that the above cited work by J. Chen et al. 2011 predicted that excitation of a cylindrically symmetrical microresonator at a zero dispersion frequency could result in the generation of frequency binned entangled photon pairs. However as we pointed out above Chen s analysis had non physical aspects because it was not based explicitly on angular eigenmodes and as a consequence was subject to inaccuracies that we believe we have avoided in our work. In our model by contrast we explicitly calculate angular eigenmodes based on the angular wavenumber angular group velocity and angular group velocity dispersion.

However two large peaks now surprisingly appear in the spectrum at large values of m. The cause of these peaks is an accidental degeneracy in the energy or frequency separation between the pump beam and respective signal and idler modes that lie at equal wavenumber intervals from the pump wavenumber.

The phenomenon may be physically understood as follows The total frequency separation between the pump mode and any other mode is given by the discrete sum of the FSR between each mode and the next beginning on and ending on . This sum is shown graphically as the area under the fcurve in

When the pump beam is slightly detuned from the minimum dispersion point to the side with a shallow slope i.e. in the direction of increasing wavenumber there exists a unique m at which the respective areas under the curve to the left and to the right of the pump are equal. It will be understood that no such point exists when the pump is detuned in the direction of decreasing wavenumber because the area on the left will always be larger than the area on the right.

The result is the existence of two special modes which exactly conserve both energy and momentum in the FWM process and can therefore be used to produce narrow band entangled photons with very large differences in wavelength. Entangled photon pairs from these modes are readily filtered from the central comb modes using a broadband filter. This can lead for example to an on chip spectrally bright source of widely spaced narrowband entangled photons.

As noted our calculations assume a quality factor of 10. We believe that it would be experimentally feasible to increase the quality factor to 10or even more. A pertinent discussion of high quality factors may be found for example in J. S. Levy A. Gondarenko M. A. Foster A. C. Turner Foster A. L. Gaeta and M. Lipson CMOS compatible multiple wavelength oscillator for on chip optical interconnects 4 37 40 2010 .

At a quality factor for the resonator of 10 the central comb region would be further suppressed more specifically there would exist ten times fewer modes in the central comb region but a zero dispersion point would still fall in the wings of the spectrum. This can lead for example to a chip scale CMOS compatible technology for providing low cost sources of spectrally bright entangled photons. Moreover on chip filtering and processing of the entangled photons could lead to chip scale quantum processing and networking.

Optical resonators as described above are manufacturable by known techniques such as well known CMOS fabrication methods. Patterning on the dimensional scales required is readily achieved by electron beam lithography or photolithography. The steps performed in the fabrication of specific exemplary disk and ring microresonators are described for example in J. S. Levy et al. 4 37 40 2010 cited above.

As seen in the figure the system includes a tunable laser and a controller for controlling among other things the output wavelength of the laser. The laser output is directed into an input waveguide evanescently coupled to a disk or ring resonator . FWM within the resonator leads to the desired optical output which along with other optical output is evanescently coupled into an output waveguide .

Collection optics collect and condition the output from the output waveguide and direct it for further processing. Although of course various alternative arrangements are possible the arrangement shown in the figure includes a moveable mirror which when in its active position directs the waveguide output into a spectral analyzer which may provide among other things feedback information for the laser controller. When the moveable mirror is in its inactive position the beam that is output from the waveguide may be subject to optical filtering e.g. to isolate a frequency comb or entangled spectral pair.

After optical filtering the output beam is directed to a semireflective mirror which divides it into two output beams labeled in the figure as 1 and 2.
