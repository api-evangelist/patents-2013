As the world is moving towards paperless exchange of information use of electronic documents for example documents in Portable Document Format PDF is on the rise. The electronic documents typically include time related information like due dates etc. However to remind reviewers of the electronic documents of this time related information a sender has to send reminder emails and messages. Sending such emails and messages takes time and is an inefficient process for both the sender and the receiver. Therefore there is a need for improved way of managing time related information.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A method for managing calendar entries in a document is provided. In one embodiment a document comprising a calendar entry is received by an electronic device. The document is not a meeting invitation email. The calendar entry is then extracted from the document. Further the calendar entry is included as a calendar entry in a calendar of a user without the document.

While the procedure and apparatus is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings those skilled in the art will recognize that the procedure and apparatus for managing calendar entries in a document is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit embodiments to the particular form disclosed. Rather the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the procedure and apparatus for managing calendar entries in the document. Any headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used herein the word may is used in a permissive sense i.e. meaning having the potential to rather than the mandatory sense i.e. meaning must . Similarly the words include including and includes mean including but not limited to.

One prior procedure for reminding users e.g. recipients of time related information includes sending reminder emails and messages to a recipient. For example a sender manually creates a Meeting invitation email including the time related information and then sends it to a recipient using email tools such as Outlook from Microsoft Corporation. The recipient then receives the Meeting invitation email using the Outlook and manually processes the Meeting invitation email to include it in Outlook calendar of the recipient. For example the recipient manually selects any one option out of several options such as Accept Decline and Tentatively Accept available for the Meeting invitation email. Once the recipient accepts the Meeting invitation email the Meeting invitation email is removed from the recipient s inbox and moved into Outlook calendar as an Accepted invitation. However processing the Meeting invitation email manually takes time and is dependent on human input. In addition the Meeting invitation email is only limited to emails and that too to email tools such as Outlook. Also manual processing puts an additional burden on the recipient to open the email tool and then to manually process the Meeting invitation email thereby making the process susceptible to faults. In case the recipient does not open the email tool and process the Meeting invitation email then the recipient does not get any reminder and hence the recipient may miss such calendar invites. More importantly the calendar event may not include the context information of the meeting invitation email unless the recipient manually inputs that information. Therefore there is a need for improved way of managing time related information.

In accordance to embodiments of the present invention and as will be described in more detail below one or more calendar entries are included in electronic documents hereinafter referred to as document or documents. In addition a procedure for managing calendar entries in the document is also described. In one embodiment an author creates a document. In response to an input e.g. selection of Create Calendar Entry from the author a calendar entry is created and inserted inside the document. The calendar entry is created in the document as either an annotation or is embedded in structure of the document. The document is not a meeting invitation email.

In one embodiment the author then sends the document to a recipient or a user. The document is then received and accessed by a software application e.g. Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader or a browser plugin or any other way of implementing the software application present on an electronic device e.g. desktop computer smartphone etc. of the recipient. In one scenario the author sends the document via email to the recipient. In another scenario other ways e.g. via pen drive File Transfer Protocol FTP transfer etc. of sending the document to the recipient can also be used. In yet another scenario the author can upload the document to a cloud service e.g. document management services offered by Adobe Systems Incorporated and the document can be fetched by the recipient from the cloud service via a portal of the cloud service e.g. www.acrobat.com . In all scenarios the document is accessed i.e. received or fetched or opened using the electronic device of the recipient. The document can be accessed in response to a click input of the recipient or in response to any other input by any other means. For example the recipient can login into the portal and open the document via a plugin installed in a browser of the electronic device. The electronic device of the recipient accesses the document using the software application in response to the input. The document is processed by the electronic device to extract the calendar entry from the document automatically. The calendar entry in the document includes time related information. The calendar entry is then automatically included as a calendar entry in a calendar of the recipient with or without the document. In some scenarios the calendar entry in the calendar of the recipient can include link to access the document. For example the document can be stored on the electronic device of the recipient or on the cloud service instead of storing the document in the calendar entry in the calendar. A link e.g. uniform resource locator or address indicating the location of the document stored on the electronic device or on the cloud service or any other storage repository accessible from the electronic device is included in the calendar entry in the calendar of the recipient. The calendar of the recipient is present on the electronic device of the recipient and is in communication with the software application via application programming interfaces APIs provided by the calendar or APIs provided by the software application or via APIs provided by both. The calendar is automatically synced to reflect the calendar entry and provide reminders corresponding to the calendar entry to the recipient.

In another embodiment the author then sends the document to a cloud service e.g. document management services offered by Adobe Systems Incorporated . The document is received and accessed by a server supporting the document management services. In one scenario the author sends the document via email to a dedicated email id of a recipient provided by the document management services. In another scenario the author sends the document to an email id other than the dedicated email id of the recipient. Other ways e.g. via pen drive File Transfer Protocol FTP transfer etc. of sending the document to the recipient can also be used. The recipient then fetches the document from the email or from other ways through which the recipient receives the document and uploads the document to the portal e.g. www.acrobat.com of the document management services. The upload also results in access of the document by the server. In both the scenarios the document is accessed i.e. received or fetched or opened by the server. The document is processed by the server to extract the calendar entry from the document automatically. The calendar entry is then automatically included as an entry in a calendar of the recipient with or without the document. In one scenario the calendar of the recipient can be a cloud based calendar provided by the document management services and in such scenario the calendar entry is pushed to the cloud service. The recipient accesses the calendar entry in the calendar by accessing the cloud service via the portal using login details. In another scenario the calendar of the recipient is present on the electronic device of the recipient and is in sync with the document management services via APIs provided by the calendar present on the electronic device of the recipient or APIs provided by an application of the document management services present on the device of the recipient. The calendar is automatically synced to reflect the calendar entry and provide reminders corresponding to the calendar entry to the recipient.

In some embodiments the calendar entry in the document can include other context information such as amount due etc. if it is inputted by the author. In some embodiments the author may not include such context information in the calendar entry in the document. However since the document or the link to the document is included in the calendar entry made in the calendar of the recipient the context information can still be accessed using the document or the link to the document. Hence some embodiments advantageously provide access to the context information even though such information is not included by the author in the calendar entry in the document.

In various embodiments automatic extraction of the calendar entry in the document eliminates manual intervention. Also in one embodiment when the document is processed by the server only the calendar entry needs to be sent to the recipient and not the entire document bandwidth is saved.

A document is an electronic content that includes a calendar entry. In one example the document includes at least some content other than the calendar entry and such content may or may not be related to the calendar entry. For example the document can include a receipt of previously paid bill on first page and a new bill on the second page. The calendar entry in the document can be for making the new bill payment. Hence the document includes some content i.e. the new bill content on the second page related to the calendar entry. Similarly the document also includes some content i.e. the paid bill content on the first page not related to the calendar entry. The document in itself is not the calendar entry but a superset of the calendar entry plus some other content. In some embodiments the document is not a meeting invitation email or any other email. Examples of the document include but are not limited to word processing file portable document format text file etc. In some embodiments the document is accessed by a document processing application which is different than an email client application. Examples of the document processing application include Adobe Acrobat Adobe Reader etc. while the email client application includes Gmail Outlook Yahoo mail etc. So the document can also be accessed by the electronic device or the server that does not include the email client application.

A meeting invitation email is an email invitation that is processed by the email client application. The meeting invitation email in itself is a calendar entry and does not include any content other than the calendar entry.

A calendar entry in a document is an entry in the document that includes a date and a time or includes a date a time and a message. The calendar entry is stored in the document as an annotation or is embedded in a structure of the document. The calendar entry is created by an author of the document. The calendar entry also includes one or more tasks lists created by the author.

A calendar entry in a calendar of a user or a recipient is an entry in an electronic calendar of the recipient that includes a date and a time or includes a date a time and a message. Many calendar entries can be present in the calendar of the recipient.

A calendar is an electronic application that includes at least one of a cloud based calendar or an application present on an electronic device of the user or the recipient. The calendar includes one or more records of times and dates. In one embodiment the calendar is a part of the email client application but different than the document processing application which receives the document and processes the document. In another embodiment the calendar is an application separate from both the applications i.e. the email client application and the document processing application which receives the document and processes the document. In addition in some embodiments the calendar in which the calendar entry is entered resides on the electronic device which is remote and different than a server processing the document. The calendar is capable of generating one or more reminders or alerts corresponding to the calendar entry. The alerts or reminders can be in visual format or audio format or text format or message format.

An electronic device is a device that processes documents to extract one or more calendar entries from the document. Examples of the electronic device includes but are not limited to server desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer tablet computer smartphone electronic content reader touch screen device gesture enabled device or any other electronic device including one or more processors for processing the document.

A server is an electronic device that processes the document for extracting one or more calendar entries from the document. Examples of the server includes but are not limited to computing devices processing devices or any other device including one or more processors for processing the document.

An annotation is a portion of the document that includes a calendar entry. The annotation can be a document within the document.

An author is any person or entity that has access to the document and can add calendar entries to the document. Examples of the author includes but are not limited to banks sending credit card statements user accessing the document via the electronic device etc.

A user or a recipient is any person or entity that receives the document. The user can open or access the document by providing a click input or any other input by any other means.

In the following discussion an example environment is first described that is operable to employ techniques described herein. Following this a section entitled Example Procedures describes some example procedures for managing calendar entries in a document in accordance with one or more embodiments. Finally a section entitled Example Screenshots indicates managing the calendar entries in the document in accordance with one or more embodiments.

Examples of the application include but are not limited to word processing application document processing application etc. In one embodiment the application includes Adobe Reader application or Acrobat application.

The apparatus further includes one or more input devices not shown in connected to the electronic device . Examples of the one or more input devices include but are not limited to peripheral devices keyboard mouse etc. In some embodiments the electronic device may not be connected to the input devices separately and may have functionalities of these input devices built into the electronic device . For example in cases in which the electronic device is touch enabled device gesture enabled device or paired to such similar devices that act as the input devices.

In one embodiment the electronic device is a server. The application accesses a document . The document is received as an attachment to an email or is uploaded on the server via document service portal such as www.acrobat.com. The document includes one or more calendar entries. The calendar entries are included as annotations or are embedded in structure of the document . The application processes the document to extract the calendar entries from the document . The calendar entries are then entered into a calendar as calendar entries with or without document. In one example the calendar is a cloud calendar maintained by the document service portal. The cloud calendar is accessible from one or more devices of a user or a recipient via the document service portal or other account authentication. In another example the calendar entries are pushed as calendar entries in one or more calendars on the devices of the user. The calendar entries are pushed using the application programming interfaces APIs of the calendars on the devices. The server is accessible from the devices and vice versa via one or more networks not shown in . Examples of the networks include but are not limited to internet local area network LAN wireless area network wired area network etc. The server includes or is connected to various circuits not shown in for enabling connectivity. Examples of the various circuits include but are not limited to LAN cards modems routers internet cards etc.

In another embodiment the electronic device is a device of the user or the recipient. The application accesses a document . The document is received as an attachment to an email or via any other mode for example file transfer from any other device or accessing the document by visiting the portal such as www.acrobat.com. The document includes one or more calendar entries. The calendar entries are included as annotations or are embedded in structure of the document . The application processes the document to extract the calendar entries from the document . In one example the calendar entries are then automatically entered into the calendar of the device as calendar entries with or without document. In another example the calendar entries are displayed to the user of the client device when the user accesses the document . The user then chooses to export the calendar entries. The calendar of the device is then populated with the calendar entries in response to an input i.e. selection of the calendar entries or corresponding button click from the user. The device is connected to other devices via one or more networks not shown in . The device includes or is connected to various circuits not shown in for enabling connectivity.

In some embodiments an author of the document inserts the calendar entries in the document . The calendar entries are inserted as annotations or are embedded in structure of the document. The author can also include one or more tasks list in the document .

In some embodiments a calendar entry also includes a link to access the document . For example the calendar entry includes a link for a folder on the device where the document is stored. The document is accessible from within the calendar entry even though the calendar entry does not include the document . When the document is accessed the list of the tasks included in the document can also be displayed. Similarly the link can be for the document stored in the document service portal. In addition the calendar entry can also include additional context information related to the calendar entries and already included in the document . For example amount due name of the sender and address of the sender can be included in the calendar entry if the author has specified the context information in the calendar entry in the document .

At step a document including at least one calendar entries is accessed. In one embodiment the accessing includes receiving the document or fetching the document or opening the document or a combination of one or more of receiving fetching and opening. The document is received as an attachment to an email or is uploaded on the server. The document can also be obtained via other means for example pen drive via FTP transfer etc. The document is not a meeting invitation email.

At step the document is processed to extract the calendar entry from the document. The calendar entry is included either as an annotation or is embedded in the structure of the document. In one example when the calendar entry is included as the annotation then the calendar entry is extracted from the annotation. In another example when the calendar entry is embedded in the structure of the document then the structure of the document is parsed and the portion of the structure corresponding to the calendar entry is extracted. The calendar entry can be embedded in the document using extensible mark up language XML . An example of the structure including the calendar entry is now shown below.

In some embodiments the document or the calendar entry also includes one or more tasks list and the list is also extracted. In addition link to access the document is also extracted. For example in case the document is present on the device of the user then the link of the folder is identified and extracted or in case the document is present on the document service portal then corresponding uniform resource locator URL is identified and extracted. Further other information present in the calendar entry is also extracted. For example amount to be paid whom to pay account number and other information included in the document and linked or related to the reminder.

In one embodiment the extraction happens automatically. For example when the server receives the document then the extraction happens. The document is received as an attachment to the email or is uploaded to the server. In another embodiment the extraction happens in response to an input from the user. For example the user accesses the document and clicks on a button for example export reminder as a calendar entry . In some cases the accessing of the document can be the input. Any other form of input for example right click on the annotation and selection of push to calendar can be used. The calendar entries are displayed to the user when the document is accessed by the user.

In one embodiment the calendar entry only includes the calendar entry related information and does not include attachments and does not include all other content of the document.

At step the calendar entry is included as a calendar entry in a calendar of the user. The user has the device and the device includes the calendar. In one embodiment the server causes entry of the calendar entry to be done in the calendar of the device via APIs of the calendar. For example a portion of the document service portal running on the server syncs with another portion of the document service portal running on the device. During syncing the server pushes the calendar entry to the device. The calendar entry can be pushed to one or more devices of the user. Also the server enables cloud based calendar and hence the server can push the calendar entries as and when the calendar entries are extracted. In another embodiment the device causes entry of the reminder to be done in the calendar of the device via APIs of the calendar. For example when the user accesses the document then the device causes the calendar entry from the document to be pushed to other calendar applications present on the device.

In some embodiments the calendar entry includes link to access the document and also other information related to the reminder. The calendar entries can then be used in various ways for example providing alerts or notifications to the user. The calendar entry also helps the user in location the document using the link included in the calendar entry. The list of tasks can also be accessed via the calendar entry. The list can also be displayed within the document.

The user then accesses the document via the device of the user. In one scenario the document is accessed by the user using the device and the user sees an option shown in for exporting the calendar entry in the document as the calendar entry in the calendar of the user. The user clicks on the option and the calendar entry is pushed as the calendar entry in the calendar of the user. In another scenario the document is directly received by the server and automatically processed to extract the calendar entry and cause the calendar entry to be entered as the calendar entry in calendar of the user. In yet another scenario the user clicks on the option and the calendar entry is pushed to the server and automatically processed to cause the calendar entry to be entered as the calendar entry in calendar of the user.

Various other ways as discussed earlier can be used for accessing the document by the device or the server.
