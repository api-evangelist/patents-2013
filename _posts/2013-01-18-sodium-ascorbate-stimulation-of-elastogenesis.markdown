This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 587 864 filed Jan. 18 2012 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety .

This invention was partially funded by a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research grant No. PG 13920 and by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario grant No. NA 4381 .

Embodiments presented herein are useful for stimulating elastic fiber production by cells through the use of ascorbate anions.

In one embodiment an ascorbic acid salt sodium ascorbate stimulates production of both collagen and elastic fibers in cultures of fibroblasts derived from normal and pathologic human skin fat tissue and myocardium as well as by human aortic smooth muscle cells. The intracellular influx of SA facilitated via the probenecid sensitive transporter associates with a significant reduction of reactive oxygen species. This in a short time contributes to better preservation of newly synthesized tropoelastins while also creating permissive conditions for activation of c Src tyrosine kinase which facilitates the IGF 1 induced phosphorylation of IGF 1 receptor that triggers a signaling pathway leading to activation of the elastin gene expression and a final enhancement of elastin deposition.

In various embodiments SA can be used to selectively stimulate elastic fiber deposition by cells such as those present in dermal scars the aorta or the heart. In certain embodiments SA may be applied in combination with factors interfering with collagen deposition for example proline hydroxylase inhibitor or mineralo corticosteroid receptors inhibitors spironolactone and eplerenone .

In various other embodiments SA can be used as a potent stimulator of collagen and elastin production. In such embodiments SA is useful for the treatment of wrinkled and stretched skin and for bioengineering of resilient dermal and arterial constructs.

Embodiments further comprise methods for administering an effective amount of SA to a skin area to at least treat or otherwise decrease wrinkles and stretch marks. In such embodiments SA may be administered for example by injection or topical administration and may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient.

Additional embodiments comprise methods for including an effective amount of SA during bioengineered growth of dermal and arterial cells to form artificial constructs thereof.

Further embodiments are drawn to inclusion of SA into therapeutic combinations aimed at stimulation of non fibrotic remodeling of the metabolically injured and post infarct hearts prevention of arterial occlusions and prevention of development of rigid dermal scars.

Embodiments may include methods for administering an effective amount of SA to injured heart areas to stimulate remodeling of the injured areas. In various other embodiments SA may be administered for example by injection via a catheter or by other known methods and may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient.

Other embodiments include methods for administering an effective amount of SA to arterial sites to prevent or decrease occurrence of occlusions. As such SA may be administered for example by injection via a catheter or by other known methods and may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient.

Yet further embodiments include methods for administering an effective amount of SA to injured skin areas to prevent or at least decrease dermal scars. As such SA may be administered for example by injection or topical administration and may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient.

Before the present compositions and methods are described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular processes compositions or methodologies described as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used in the description is for the purpose of describing the particular versions or embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims. Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments of the present invention the preferred methods devices and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.

Contrary to the observed effects of Vitamin C L ascorbic acid increasing collagen deposition in cells and inhibiting elastogenesis salts of L ascorbic acid SA applied in 50 200 M concentrations are disclosed herein to stimulate production of both collagen and elastic fibers in cultures of fibroblasts derived from normal human skin and dermal fat as well as in cultured explants of normal and stretch marked human skin. Moreover SA applied in combination with a proline hydroxylase inhibitor exclusively induces deposition of elastic fibers in cultured explants of dermal scars. As disclosed herein SA stimulates elastogenesis after intracellular influx of non oxidized ascorbate anions that scavenge reactive oxygen species ROS . Such down regulation of ROS contributes to the activation of c Src tyrosine kinase and the consecutive enhancement of IGF 1 induced phosphorylation of the IGF 1 receptor that triggers a signaling pathway leading to the activation of elastin gene expression and subsequent deposition of elastic fibers. Thus in various embodiments SA can be used as a potent stimulator of collagen and elastin production in the treatment of wrinkled and stretch marked skin as well as be included with therapeutic combinations of collagenogenesis inhibitors to prevent formation of dermal scars. Similarly SA can be used in low dose regimens to preferentially stimulate cellular elastogenesis over collagen production.

As used herein the salts of ascorbic acid SA are those wherein a hydrogen ion generated by dissociation of H can be substituted by a positive ion such as a metal ion ammonium ion and the like to form a salt. Such salts are also included in the scope of the disclosure and include includes inorganic salts and organic salts. Inorganic salts include salts of an alkali metal such as but not limited to lithium sodium and potassium salts of an alkaline earth metal such as but not limited to calcium and magnesium ammonium salt and the like. Organic salts include a diethanolamine salt triethanolamine salt basic amino acid salts such as but not limited to arginine lysine carnosine and glutathione or other organic salt such as but not limited to glucosamine nicotinamide niacin niacinamide allantoin creatine creatinine chitosan and the like. Formation of such salts can be carried out by the same method as for known salt formation methods such as neutralization of an aqueous solution of an ascorbic acid derivative with a basic substance.

As used herein the term therapeutic means an agent utilized to treat combat ameliorate prevent or improve an unwanted condition or disease of a patient.

A therapeutically effective amount or effective amount of a composition is a predetermined amount calculated to achieve the desired effect i.e. to increase production of elastin or the deposition of elastic fibers. For example a therapeutic effect may be demonstrated by increased elastogenesis increased cellular proliferation increased digestion or resorption of scar material reduction of symptoms and sequellae as well as any other therapeutic effect known in the art. The activity contemplated by the present methods includes both medical therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment as appropriate. The specific dose of a compound administered according to this invention to obtain therapeutic and or prophylactic effects will of course be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case including for example the compound administered the route of administration the physical characteristics of the patient height weight etc. and the condition being treated. It will be understood that the effective amount administered will be determined by the physician in light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated the choice of compound to be administered and the chosen route of administration and therefore the dosage ranges provided are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. A therapeutically effective amount of compound of this invention is typically an amount such that when it is administered in a physiologically tolerable excipient composition it is sufficient to achieve an effective systemic concentration or local concentration in the tissue.

In certain embodiments the local cellular concentration of SA is in the range of 50 200 M L. Those of skill in the art recognize that such a concentration is easily convertible among equivalents. For example where the molecular weight of sodium ascorbate is 198.11 MW the solute mass in a 1 M L solution is 198.11 M L. Similarly the use of the volume in the denominator is not necessary to describe the molarity of a solution. Therefore as in the above example a 1 M solution of sodium ascorbate would comprise ascorbate at a ratio of 198.11 g L of water.

As such the concentrations of an ascorbate anion necessary to produce elastogenesis can be 0.01 M 0.05 M 0.1 M 0.2 M 0.3 M 0.4 M 0.5 M 0.6 M 0.7 M 0.8 M 0.9 M 1.0 M 2.0 M 3.0 M 4.0 M 5.0 M 6.0 M 7.0 M 8.0 M 9.0 M 10.0 M 20 M 30 M 40 M 50 M 60 M 70 M 80 M 90 M 100 M 200 M or higher. Those of skill in the art recognize that distribution of ascorbate in the body and throughout the tissues is not uniform so that an in situ concentration of 50 200 M inducing elastogenesis locally may be independent of the systemic concentration or dose. As such it is contemplated that systemic administration of ascorbate for example can be adjusted to target individual classes of cells individual tissues and individual organs depending on the type of disease and symptoms of that disease. It is also contemplated that ascorbate can be delivered locally to a site such as skin in need of elastogenesis so that the concentration in situ is 50 200 M.

In certain embodiments ascorbate may interact with cells so as not to significantly induce collagen type I and fibronectin production or cause cellular proliferation. In certain embodiments therapeutically active concentrations of ascorbate required to activate elastogenesis are lower than those used in other applications and treatments. In certain embodiments the dosage window balancing such effects is termed low dose ascorbate treatment and comprises a dosage creating a concentration of ascorbate of 50 200 M locally. Such local concentrations can be achieved by any means known in the art including deposition injection topical administration perfusion and others. As such it is also contemplated in the disclosure that when ascorbate is administered to induce elastogenesis the dosages are adjusted so as to avoid stimulation any concomitant effects opposing the elastogenic action of the ascorbate such as for example avoiding production of collagen type I and fibronectin or stimulating cellular proliferation.

The term treat as used herein refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen an undesired physiological condition disorder or disease or to obtain beneficial or desired clinical results. For the purposes of this invention beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of symptoms diminishment of the extent of the condition disorder or disease stabilization i.e. not worsening of the state of the condition disorder or disease delay in onset or slowing of the progression of the condition disorder or disease amelioration of the condition disorder or disease state and remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable or enhancement or improvement of the condition disorder or disease. Treatment includes eliciting a clinically significant response without excessive levels of side effects.

Thus methods of treatment are disclosed herein which involve the simultaneous topical application or intra lesion injection of therapeutic amounts of each of disclosed compounds for treatment of dermal scars. It is now common to use fibroblasts isolated from human skin in the manufacture of artificial skin to temporarily cover chemically or thermally damaged skin or replace skin destroyed by ischemia or infection. While the use of autologous fibroblasts obtained from the injured patient can be one solution the harvesting of large numbers of dermal fibroblasts is not always possible. Thus the harvesting of a larger number of ECM producing fibroblasts from the fat tissue by liposuction emerged as a safe and more feasible alternative. In fact intra dermal injection of fat derived fibroblasts capable of resuming the production of collagen and fibronectin has already been used to regenerate damaged skin. The therapeutic effect of locally injected fat derived fibroblasts has also been reported in the healing of difficult wounds. However to date the elastogenic potential of these cells has not been evaluated. The disclosed embodiments that treatment of fat tissue fibroblasts with micromolar concentrations of SA also boosts the production of elastin further encourages methods of using these SA stimulated cells for regeneration of damaged skin and also encourages methods for use of the SA stimulated cells for the bioengineering of more elastic skin replacements.

Vascular smooth muscle cells SMCs are the main types of cells residing in the tunica media of arteries and veins. During normal embryonic development and in the neonatal period the SMCs are responsible for the deposition of extracellular matrix rich in elastic fibers and lamellae that are mostly responsible for the resiliency of vascular walls and for carrying the pulsation flow of blood through the aorta and large arteries. In well developed arteries the majority of SMCs turn into the contractile and quiescent phenotype. However after metabolic or physical injuries those SMCs differentiate into the activated phenotype . Just after the arterial injury the SMCs can release numerous proteolytic enzymes including serine and metallo proteinases and can further contribute to the break down of elastic fibers and lamellae. In the consecutive repair stage the SMCs respond to numerous signals including those initiated by the degradation products and resume intense proliferation migration and deposition of the new ECM that contains a disproportionally high amount of collagen and scarce and disorganized elastic fibers. Also during the slow development of atherosclerosis the outgrowth of activated SMCs is preceded and facilitated by the progressive degradation of the existing elastic fibers that cannot be replaced during the pathological remodeling of arterial walls and formation of the occlusive neointima. Current therapeutic approaches including balloon angioplasty and implantation of drugs eluting stents dramatically improved the outcome of arterial occlusions caused by an overzealous healing process and thrombosis. However the overall success rate of these life savings techniques is often diminished by the growth of activated SMCs through the stent mesh and the additional production of collagen fibers and this leads to rigid in stent stenosis. Heightened migration and proliferation of the tunica media derived SMC coincide with the inhibition of new elastic fibers formation and that this pathology could be reversed after the stimulation of new elastogenesis either in vitro or in intra arterial stents. While the pro elastogenic action of numerous factors has been documented the diverse side effects of high concentrations of those factors TGF 1 IGF 1 aldosterone or dexamethasone limit their chronic use in clinic. This elastogenic potential of low concentrations of SA are useful for methods of preventing pathologic remodeling leading to arterial occlusions and also useful in conjunction with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers that would inhibit collagenogenesis and enhance beneficial effects of angioplasty and stents implantation. Moreover SA is also useful for methods of stimulation of elastic fiber production by isolated cells embedded in bioengineered vessel constructs thereby enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the constructs after implantation to the human arteries.

Cardiac fibroblasts are the most abundant cell type of the myocardium responsible for production of ECM proteins supporting the structure of beating myocardium. However in metabolically injured or post infarct hearts these stromal cells usually respond to numerous hormones and cytokines with the overzealous production of collagen type I leading to the formation of rigid post infarct scars and myocardial fibrosis. It has been shown that pharmacological inhibition of proteolytic degradation of myocardial elastic fibers occurring after cardiac infarction reduces inflammatory infiltration and cardiac dilatation. Also it has been documented that blocking of the mineralocorticoid receptors improved diastolic function after myocardial infarction and lead to a significant decrease of post infarct mortality. It has also been determined that aldosterone applied in the presence of mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitors exclusively stimulates the production of new elastin by the heart stromal fibroblasts in the mechanism that involves cross activation of c Src and consecutive phosphorylation of the IGF 1 receptor which in turn triggers the downstream elastogenic pathway. The observation that micromolar concentrations of SA also activates c Src phosphorylation of IGF 1 receptor and successive propagation of the downstream elastogenic pathway indicates that SA is also useful in methods of treatment of post infarct patients especially in view of the observations that the simultaneous application of SA with inhibitors of mineralocorticoid receptors or with inhibitor of proline hydroxylase allowed for the exclusive up regulation of the net elastic fibers deposition by cultured AoSMC and fibroblasts derived from human heart. The addition of SA to the already accepted treatments with eplerenone or spironolactone that prevent aldosterone induced collagenogenesis is therefore useful to selectively promote formation of the resilient connective tissue framework in the post infarct myocardium and allow for better compliance with the beating heart.

As such SA is indicated for the simultaneous stimulation of collagen and elastin in bioengineered constructs of human tissues containing the residential stem and fully differentiated fibroblasts isolated from adult human skin and fat tissue. Likewise SA is also indicated for application in combination with factors interfering with collagen deposition for propagation of a non fibrotic remodeling of the heart for prevention of arterial stiffness and for improvement of dermal scarring.

Generally speaking the term tissue refers to any aggregation of similarly specialized cells which are united in the performance of a particular function. As used herein tissue unless otherwise indicated refers to tissue which includes elastin as part of its necessary structure and or function. For example connective tissue which is made up of among other things collagen fibrils and elastin fibrils satisfies the definition of tissue as used herein. As such tissue may comprise cells such as skin fibroblasts fat tissue fibroblasts myocardium fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. These cells can comprise even partially a tissue type such as post infarct cardiac tissue occluded tissue dermal scar tissue traumatically injured tissue and chronic wounds for example.

Additionally elastin is involved in the proper function of blood vessels veins and arteries in their inherent visco elasticity.

The extracellular matrix ECM is a complex network of proteins and carbohydrates that provide the framework and physical support for structural organization of practically all tissues and organs. The ECM is made up of fibronectin laminin collagen and elastic fibers as well as numerous glycosaminoglycans and protoglycans. These ECM components are organized into a network of rope like structures which underlies many tissues such as blood vessels skin tendons ligaments and lungs. Of these components the major fibrotic components that provide tissues with mechanical strength and resiliency are the collagen and elastic fibers respectively. The elastic fibers are composed of two major components an amorphous elastin core which makes up the bulk 90 of the fiber and the 10 12 nm microfibrilary component surrounding the elastin core and made up of glycoproteins such as for example fibrillins fibulins and microfibril associated glycoproteins MAGPs .

Elastin is unique in that it can be stretched to over 150 percent of its original length and rapidly returns to its original size and shape. This property provides tissues in which elastin is incorporated with the ability to resume their original form after stretching. Therefore elastin and elastin fibers provide these tissues with the ability to maintain their resiliency stretchability and shape. Elastin may also be interwoven with non elastic collagen fibers to limit stretching and prevent tearing of certain tissues. Mature insoluble elastin is metabolically inert and remains the most durable element of extracellular matrix. In undisturbed tissues mature elastin may last for the lifetime of the tissue

Elastic fiber formation or elastogenesis is a complex process involving intracellular and extracellular events. Cells such as fibroblasts endothelial cells chondroblasts or vascular smooth muscle cells first synthesize and secrete glycoproteins that form a microfibrillilar scaffold into the extracellular space. Tropoelastin the soluble precursor peptide of elastin is synthesized in these cells by ribosomes in the rough endoplasmatic reticulum and is transported through the Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles that deposit tropoelastin in the extracellular space. Once outside the cell tropoelastin is assembled into long chains and covalently cross linked by lysyl oxidase. During crosslinking unique composite amino acids desmosine and isodesmosine which join the tropoelastin chains are formed and insoluble elastin is created.

Deposition of elastin in the ECM appears to be controlled on both the transcriptional level tropoelastin mRNA message expression and post transcriptional level tropoelastin message stability . Other post transcriptional events which control secretion of tropoelastin monomers extracellular assembly of tropoelastin and regulation of cross linking of tropoelastin may also control elastin deposition.

As the major components of dermal extracellular matrix collagen and elastic fibers provide skin with mechanical strength and resiliency respectively. Elastic fibers are composed of a microfibrillar scaffold containing several glycoproteins and a core of elastin made of cross linked tropoelastin. Elastic fibers are mainly produced during the second half of foetal development and in early childhood. They do not undergo any extensive turnover and are supposed to last one s lifetime. However aging and other cellular processes determined by a combination of genetics and environmental factors as well as local inflammation cause activation of diverse proteases and consequent loss of skin elasticity. Numerous pathological conditions can also contribute to the degradation of the elastic fibers. Elastic fibers cannot be repaired and once damaged they have to be replaced by the new ones. The extensive loss of elastic fibers contributes to formation of skin wrinkles development of arterial aneurysms and lung emphysema and deterioration of ligaments strength. The extensive loss of elastic fibers clearly contributes to the formation of wrinkles and stretch marks because they cannot be spontaneously repaired or adequately replaced. Although new ECM produced during the healing of dermal wounds contains a small amount of elastic fibers hypertrophic scars and keloids practically do not contain elastic fibers.

Furthermore the proper mechanical performance of the myocardium depends on the contractile properties of cardiac myocytes that are supported by the mechanical strength and resiliency of the ECM. Following myocardial injury the cardiac ECM undergoes dynamic local remodeling and the insufficient production of elastic fibers along with an excess of collagen production during the remodeling of a metabolically injured or ischemic myocardium leads to the production of scar tissue and interferes with the contractility of the myocardium.

The inhibition of elastogenesis in injured arteries lung and skin tissues can also lead to their development of maladaptive fibrosis and functional impairments.

Recent advances in tissue engineering utilizing different types of human stem cells or fully differentiated fibroblasts chondroblasts or smooth muscle cells embedded into artificial scaffolds allow for repair and reconstruction of underdeveloped injured or metabolically damaged human tissues. However knowledge about endogenous and exogenous factors that can selectively trigger or inhibit production of particular components of the ECM is still limited. Thus exploration of safe pharmacological interventions that would control the well balanced production of ECM or particularly stimulate the new elastogenesis by fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells emerges as a real necessity in regenerative medicine. The selective stimulation of elastic fibers production seems to be particularly needed for the repair of injured heart and lungs as well as the production of artificial constructs of arteries heart valves bladders and skin substitutes made of human cells placed on biodegradable polymers.

It has been established that the initiation of the elastin gene transcription can be positively regulated by such endogenous factors as glucocorticoids IGF 1 insulin TGF and aldosterone. In contrast tumor necrosis factor interleukin 1 basic fibroblast growth factor and Vitamin D3 have been shown to down regulate elastin gene expression. Currently only few exogenous factors such as dexamethasone retinoids or ferric ions have been proven as stimulators of a net elastogenesis. L ascorbic acid AA a potent stimulator of collagen production has also been listed as an inhibitor of elastin deposition. It has been suggested that AA may destabilize tropoelastin mRNA and cause overwhelmed hydroxylation on prolyl lysyl residues of tropoelastin molecules thereby promoting their accumulation inside cells and inhibiting their secretion.

Embodiments of the invention show that micromolar concentrations of SA stimulate production of both collagen and elastic fibers by cultured human fibroblasts derived from normal and elastin deficient tissues as well as by vascular smooth muscle cells.

The aldosterone synthetase inhibitor 4 fluoro N 3 pyridin 3 yl benzamide was from Chem Div Inc. San Diego Calif. . The DMEM FBS and other cell culture products were acquired from GIBCO Life Technologies Burlington ON.

Biopsies and Experimental Design The approval from the Medical Ethical Review Board and patient informed consents were obtained for all described studies that used small fragments of skin excess collected during plastic surgery procedures. Guidelines for the protection of human subjects of the Department of Health and Human Services and of the Declaration of Helsinki Principles were followed in obtaining tissues for this investigation. In all described experiments skin biopsies were derived from 6 normal females 6 patients with stretch marked skin and 5 patients with abdominal hypertrophic scars. All donors were 25 to 37 year old Caucasian females. In all biochemical studies quadruplicate samples derived from each experimental group were assayed in three separate experiments. Mean and standard deviations SD were calculated for each experimental group and statistical analyses were carried out by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni s test comparing selected groups or by t test as appropriate. P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Cell Cultures Fibroblasts initially grew out from the explants of these full thickness skin biopsies and were maintained. The primary cultures of fat derived fibroblasts obtained from Thermogenesis Rancho Cordova Calif. were also tested. In all described experiments 2 4 passages of both kinds of fibroblasts were used. In experiments aimed at assessing ECM production cells were initially plated at a concentration of 100 000 cells dish. Confluent cultures were then maintained either in serum free medium DMEM or in medium supplemented with 5 FBS in the presence of different reagents that were added 1 hour before treatments with SA.

Immuno staining All cultures maintained in the presence and absence of indicated reagents were either fixed in cold 100 methanol at 20 C. for detection of elastin or in 4 paraformaldehyde at room temperature for detection of collagen I . The multiple parallel cultures were then incubated with 10 g ml of polyclonal antibody to tropoelastin Elastin Products Owensville Mich. or polyclonal antibody to collagen type I Chemicon Temecula Calif. . Cultures were then incubated with the respective fluorescein conjugated goat anti rabbit goat anti mouse or rabbit anti goat secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide Sigma Sigma St. Louis Mo. . All of the cultures were then examined with a Nikon Eclipse E1000 microscope attached to a cooled CCD camera QImaging Retiga EX and analyzed by the computer generated morphometric analysis system Image Pro Plus software Media Cybernetics Silver Springs Md. as previously described.

Quantitative Assays of Insoluble Elastin Fibroblasts were grown to confluency in 35 mm culture dishes 100 000 cells dish . Next 2 Ci of 3H valine ml Amersham Biosciences Ltd. Oakville Canada were added to each dish along with or without the indicated treatments. At the end of each experiment the levels of metabolically labeled NaOH insoluble elastin present in individual cultures were assayed and normalized per their DNA content.

Organ culture of skin explants Fragments of normal skin stretch marked skin and dermal scars collected during plastic surgery procedures were cut into multiple 4 mm2 pieces and maintained for 7 days in DMEM medium containing 5 FBS in the presence or absence of 200 M SA alone or in combination with 200 M DMOG as described in figure legends. The parallel quadruplicate explants from each experimental group were additionally maintained in the presence 2 Ci of 3H valine ml and then subjected to the assay of insoluble elastin. The parallel explants from each experimental groups were also evaluated after pentachrome Movat s staining which allows for clear marking of elastic fibers. In each experimental group 50 sections derived from quadruplicate explants were analyzed.

One Step RT PCR Analysis The confluent cultures of skin fibroblasts were treated with or without the reagents of interest for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legend. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit and the one step RT PCR reactions were set up with the RT PCR Kit according to the manufacturer s Qiagen Mississauga ON instructions. The amounts of tropoelastin mRNA were always normalized to the amount of GAPDH mRNA.

Western Blots At the end of indicated experiments cells were lysed with NP 40 buffer containing a cocktail of broad spectrum inhibitors of proteinases and phosphatases. The 50 g aliquots of protein extract were then resolved by SDS PAGE gel 4 12 gradient in reducing conditions and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies indicated in figure legends as previously described. Initial blots were also re probed with monoclonal anti actin antibody Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Danvers Mass. to confirm the equal protein loading. The degree of expression was measured by densitometry.

Immuno precipitation To evaluate the levels of IGF I receptor or insulin receptor phosphorylation cultures maintained either in serum free medium or in medium with 2 FBS were incubated for 15 minutes in the presence or absence of 100 M SA or 50 ng ml IGF 1 with or without 30 minute pretreatment with 0.5 M PPP or 10 M PP2. At the end of each experiment cells were submerged in the lysis buffer containing a broad range phosphatase inhibitor. The polyclonal antibodies recognizing either the subunits of the IGF IR or the subunit of the insulin receptor were immobilized on separate sets of the IgG bearing magnetic beads Invitrogen Canada Inc Burlington ON and then incubated for 1 hour with the aliquots of the cell lysates containing 400 g of protein as described in the manufacturer protocol. The beads bearing the resulting immuno precipitation products were re suspended in sample buffer and the released proteins were resolved with SDS PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with a monoclonal anti p Tyr PY99 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz Calif. and then with HRP conjugated goat anti mouse secondary antibody.

Quantification of Intracellular free radicals reactive oxygen species ROS To assess the levels of ROS quadruplicate cultures of normal skin fibroblasts were exposed to 10 M of ROS sensitive CM H2DCFDA fluorescent probe Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. for 30 minutes. This probe passively diffuses into the cell interior and only upon oxidation is a fluorescent product released that can be visualized under a fluorescent microscope or captured by flow cytophotometry when excited at 480 nm. Fibroblasts were then maintained for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of 400 M probenecid then incubated either for 2 or 24 hours with and without 100 M AA or 100 M SA. At the end of these periods the images were captured using a fluorescent microscope under identical parameters of contrast and brightness. The ROS production was also assessed by flow cytophotometry excitation 480 nm emission 520 nm using FACSCalibur Beckton Dickinson Instrument.

It was found that small concentrations of SA ranging from 50 M to 200 M significantly stimulated production of immuno detectable elastic fibers in 24 hour old cultures of normal dermal fibroblasts. In contrast higher concentrations of SA did not further stimulate deposition of elastic fibers 400 M and even induced a clear inhibition of elastogenesis 800 M SA . Meaningfully it was also established that treatments of parallel cultures either with 100 200 M NaCl or with a mixture of 100 M of NaCl and 100 M of AA did not cause any up regulation in elastic fiber deposition upper panels . Moreover treatment with 100 M AA alone stimulated collagen deposition by cultured fibroblasts but completely inhibited their elastogenesis. While causing remarkable up regulation in the net deposition of new elastic fibers treatment with 100 M SA also induced a more potent up regulation in the deposition of immuno detected collagen fibers than 100 M AA upper panels . It has been established that addition of the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG along with 100 M SA to cultured fibroblasts inhibited the deposition of collagen fibers but did not interfere with the enhanced production of elastic fibers. All mentioned results based on morphometric evaluations of the immuno detected elastic fibers correlated well with results from the quantitative assay of metabolically labeled insoluble elastin performed on parallel cultures lower panels .

The morphometric evaluations of immuno staining along with the quantitative assay of metabolically labeled insoluble elastin in parallel cultures of fat tissue derived fibroblasts indicated that a similar concentration of SA 50 200 M induced on average a 22 4 increase in elastin deposition p

The cellular mechanism by which SA stimulates production of elastic fibers was initially demonstrated by the addition of 50 200 M of SA causing a significant and dose dependent up regulation of the levels of tropoelastin encoding mRNA detected by RT PCR 18 hours after its addition to cultures maintained in medium supplemented with 5 FBS. This preceded an increase in the levels of newly synthesized tropoelastin detected by Western blots in 20 hour old cultures and in levels of insoluble elastin observed in 24 hour old cultures. The results of three separate experiments showing the elastogenic potential of 100 M SA are shown in . Since the salt configuration ensures the temporal stability of SA molecules in the culture medium pH 7.4 cultured skin fibroblasts were also exposed to 400 M probenecid and it was found that their pre incubation with this SVCTs inhibitor eliminated the elastogenetic effects of 100 M SA observed in the amount of message precursor protein and final product levels . Interestingly cultures maintained for 24 hours with 100 400 M probenecid alone did not demonstrate any decrease in their basic deposition of elastic fibers below the level observed in untreated control cultures. Together the results obtained from three independent experiments indicate that a quick transportation of SA derived non oxidized ascorbate anions into the cell interior may contribute to the enhancement of elastogenesis.

Treatment with SA associates with a decrease in levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS .

Next fibroblasts were exposed to the ROS sensitive fluorescent probe CM H2DCFDA and found that cells treated for only 2 hours with 100 M SA contained significantly lower levels of ROS that could be detected by fluorescence microscope or by the flow cytophotometry and . This effect could not be observed in cultures in which the intracellular influx of SA derived non oxidized ascorbate had been inhibited by pre incubation with probenecid. The parallel cultures treated for 2 hours with 100 M AA did not display any decrease in ROS contents as compared with untreated counterparts.

Surprisingly it was also found that the elastogenic effects of SA evident in 18 24 hour old cultures maintained in the presence of FBS could not be observed in cultures maintained in serum free medium . This suggested that SA might only enhance elastogenic signals triggered by some other factor s present in the serum. Therefore it was tested whether addition of SA would positively modulate the effects of selected elastogenic stimulators corticosteroids TGF 1 and IGF 1. Results of these experiments indicated that the addition of 100 M SA did not further enhance the increase in elastogenesis induced by 1 M dexamethasone or 1 ng ml of TGF 1 but significantly up regulated the levels of elastin deposition induced by 50 ng ml of IGF 1. Consequently the putative mechanism by which SA would enhance the IGF 1 induced elastogenic signaling pathway was tested.

The results of the next experiments revealed that addition of 100 M SA to fibroblasts maintained in the presence of FBS remarkably enhanced levels of IGF 1R phosphorylation immuno precipitated with antibody recognizing the subunit of IGF 1R and detected on Western blot with anti phospho tyrosine antibody . This was in contrast with fibroblasts maintained in serum free medium that did not reveal any increase in IGF 1R phosphorylation in response to treatment with the same dose of SA . These results suggest that either the presence of SA derived non oxidized ascorbate ions enhanced interactions of the extremely small concentration of IGF 1 2 6 ng ml of 5 FBS with IGF 1R or that the independent simultaneous actions of SA and IGF 1 lead to the ultimate enhancement of IGF 1R phosphorylation. The possibility of the super activation of IGF 1R by a SA induced cellular mechanism was further endorsed by the fact that additions of 100 M SA significantly enhanced the levels of phosphorylated IGF IR in parallel cultures maintained in both tested media treated with 50 ng ml of IGF 1.

Since this SA induced enhancement of IGF 1R phosphorylation was eliminated in cultures pretreated and maintained in the presence of either the c Src kinase inhibitor PP2 or the specific inhibitor of IGF 1R tyrosine kinase PPP it was concluded that c Src tyrosine kinase activity is required for the execution of the SA triggered phosphorylation of IGF 1R. Importantly SA did not induce heightened phosphorylation of the highly homologous insulin receptors . Then it was found that 24 hour treatment of dermal fibroblasts maintained in the presence of 5 FBS with 100 M SA alone induced a similarly strong elastogenic effects as treatment with 50 ng ml of exogenous IGF 1. Importantly parallel cultures jointly treated with IGF 1 and SA displayed even higher levels of tropoelastin mRNA intracellular tropoelastin insoluble elastin and immuno detected elastic fibers than their counterparts treated with either compound on its own. Moreover SA did not trigger elastogenic effects in cultures pretreated with PP2 PPP or with anti IGF 1R blocking antibody . Furthermore we have also established that inhibition of other kinases contributing to the IGF 1 induced signaling pathway phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase by LY294002 or cyclin dependent kinase 2 by CVT313 eliminated elastogenic effects of 100 M SA.

SA ameliorates the poor deposition of collagen and elastic fibers observed in monolayer cultures of dermal fibroblasts and organ cultures of explants derived from dermal stretch marks.

Importantly it was established that cultured fibroblasts derived from dermal stretch marks also significantly up regulated their production of both collagen and elastic fibers in response to treatment with 200 M SA. Also in this experimental model the treatment of parallel cultures with 200 M AA caused a selective inhibition of new elastogenesis . The effects of SA in cultured explants of biopsies derived from normal skin and dermal stretch marks was also tested. Results of morphometric analysis of sections stained with pentachrome Movat s method as well as the quantitative assay of metabolically libeled insoluble elastin indicated that the 10 day long daily treatment with 200 M SA not only enhanced deposition of new elastic fibers in normal skin explants FIG. but restored the practically non existent elastogenesis observed 10 day old cultures of full thickness explants of dermal biopsies derived from stretch marks . In contrast parallel explants treated with 200 M AA demonstrated only up regulation in the deposition of collagen.

We have also established that treatment with SA induced a beneficial remodeling of cultured explants of the rigid dermal scars. Both histochemistry and quantification of insoluble elastin indicated that treatment with 200 M SA initiated production of new elastic fibers in their mostly collagenous extracellular matrix. Moreover we found that explants jointly treated with SA and DMOG which blocks collagen deposition demonstrated further up regulation in the net deposition of elastic fibers . Interestingly parallel scar explants treated with 1 mM DMOG alone did not revealed any elastic fibers in their ECM.
