This invention was made with government support under contract numbers NCI NIH RO1 CA122914 and CA079870 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating and identifying estrogen related medical disorders such as cancer inflammation osteoporosis vaginal atrophy central nervous diseases and cardiovascular system diseases.

The selective estrogen receptor modulator SERM tamoxifen TAM is the most widely prescribed endocrine therapy for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The development of resistance to TAM either de novo or acquired limits its clinical effectiveness leading to disease progression. Before the introduction of TAM breast cancer patients received high dose 17 estradiol E2 or diethystilbesterol DES treatment. Although similar response rates were observed 9 10 TAM treatment became the mainstay due to a lower incidence of side effects.

Protein kinase C PKC belongs to a family of serine threonine protein kinases 1 2 . The expression of PKC is associated with disease outcome for breast cancer patients on endocrine therapy. A shorter duration of response to endocrine therapy was associated with PKC expression 3 and patients whose primary tumors overexpress PKC were more likely to experience disease recurrence when treated with TAM 4 . PKC positivity is also associated with poor patient survival and breast cancer aggressiveness 5 .

TAM resistant T47D A18 PKC tumors regress upon treatment with both E2 and the benzothiophene SERM raloxifene RAL 11 . RAL has a favorable antiestrogenic profile in the uterus and has proven safety over 15 years of clinical use in postmenopausal osteoporosis and breast cancer chemoprevention. In Examples below the in vivo effects of two novel benzothiophene SERMs BTC 2 4 hydroxyphenyl benzo b thiophen 6 ol and TTC 352 3 4 fluorophenyl 2 4 hydroxyphenoxyl benzo b thiophen 6 ol that in contrast to RAL were observed to act as estrogen agonists in T47D A18 as reflected by proliferation and ERE luciferase reporter assays. Remarkably both of these SERMs were able to induce regression of TAM resistant hormone independent T47D A18 PKC xenograft tumors in vivo but neither compound was able to support the growth of hormone dependent TAM sensitive T47D A18 neo tumors. Importantly neither SERM caused any significant increase in the uterine weights of these mice. These data indicate that benzothiophene SERMs can be designed for the treatment of endocrine resistant breast cancers as they are estrogenic antitumor agents in the TAM resistant T47D A18 PKC breast cancer model are devoid of significant estrogenic action in the uterus and are unable to support the growth of estrogen sensitive T47D A18 breast cancer xenografts.

The synthesis of BTC and HP BTF has been previously described 12 . Dansyl derivatization of BTC was employed to increase limits of detection and quantitation for LC MS MS analysis of plasma samples . Working solutions of BTC and internal standard 3 Br BTC were prepared by serial dilution of 1 mg mL acetonitrile stocks. Calibration standards were prepared by spiking BTC or 3 Br BTC 20 ng mL into blank mouse plasma to give a final concentration range of 5 100 ng mL . After addition of cold acetonitrile samples were kept at 4 C. for 2 h centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min and supernatants were concentrated under Nstream. Resulting residues were reconstituted in 0.1 mL of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer pH 10.5 and derivatized by addition of 0.1 mL dansyl chloride 2 mg mL in acetone followed by incubation at 60 C. for 5 min. After removal of solvent residues were reconstituted in 0.25 mL acetonitrile water 1 1 v v and analyzed by LC MS MS.

BTC was administered in ethanol using a vehicle of propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose 10 mg kg p.o to ovariectomized 4 6 week old athymic mice Harlan Sprague Dawley n 3 . Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes at 20 min 2 h and 6 h after treatment. Plasma was separated from whole blood by centrifugation at 4 C. Prior to analysis plasma was spiked with internal standard and extracted 3 with cold acetonitrile. Recovery of analyte was measured by spiking known amounts of BTC into blank plasma samples. Work up of plasma samples were identical to that described above for standard curve determination.

LC MS MS analysis was performed using an API 3000 Applied Biosystems triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Agilent 1200 HPLC Agilent Technologies Santa Clara Calif. USA . Multiple reaction monitoring MRM for the dissociations of m z 709 171 and m z 789 171 loss of 5 dimethylaminonaphthalene were optimized to measure dansyl BTC and dansylBr BTC respectively . Separation was performed using a Hypersil BDS C18 2.1 mm 30 mm 3 m column Thermo Quest Corporation MA at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min. The elution solvent consisted of water with 10 MeOH and 0.3 formic acid A and MeCN with 0.3 formic acid B . The mobile phase was initially held at 10 B for 5 min increased to 60 B over 1.5 min and then increased to 90 B over 15 min with dansyl BTC and dansylBr BTC eluting at 17.8 and 19.7 min respectively .

We have previously reported that E2 inhibits the growth of T47D A18 PKC tumors in vivo and inhibits colony formation in 3D MATRIGEL culture but has no inhibitory effect in 2D culture. Conversely the parental empty vector control T47D A18 neo cell line is growth stimulated by E2 in vitro and in vivo 7 15 . In an effort to find a potential alternative to E2 and to expand on positive data obtained in vivo with RAL 11 two benzothiophene SERMs were selected from a library of SERMs and screened by DNA growth assay in our 2D in vitro model. We have previously reported on examples of this library using radioligand displacement assays ERE luciferase reporter assays in MCF 7 human mammary cancer cells and alkaline phosphatase activation in Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cells 12 16 19 . In accord with previous data both BTC and TTC 352 acted as estrogen agonists in T47D A18 neo and T47D A18 PKC cells stimulating proliferation in 2D cultures. Cells were grown in E2 free media treated with 0.1 DMSO vehicle control E2 BTC or TTC 352 and DNA content was measured as an index of proliferation. T47D A18 PKC cells proliferated in the presence of BTC and TTC 352 at all concentrations tested 1 nM 10 nM 100 nM and maximal efficacy was similar to that of E2 1 nM observed in vitro . Interestingly only the higher concentrations of BTC 100 nM and TTC 352 100 nM showed effects on the proliferation of T47D A18 neo cells comparable to E2 1 nM treatment .

E2 inhibits T47D A18 PKC colony formation in MATRIGEL 15 in part recapitulating the E2 inhibitory effect on tumor establishment 7 . To determine if BTC and TTC 352 similar to E2 can inhibit the growth of T47D A18 PKC colonies in 3D culture colony formation in MATRIGEL was examined. Cells were plated in phenol red free MATRIGEL containing vehicle 0.1 DMSO E2 1 nM BTC 100 nM or TTC 352 100 nM and allowed to grow for 10 days. These concentrations were selected on the basis of proliferative effects in 2D cultures. T47D A18 neo colony growth was stimulated by E2 BTC and TTC 352 treatment while T47D A18 PKC colony formation was inhibited in the presence of E2 BTC and TTC 352 . These results indicate that BTC and TTC 352 are estrogenic in vitro and if observations in the 3D culture are predictive of the in vivo outcome that these SERMs inhibit the growth of T47D A18 PKC cells in xenografts.

RAL is an estrogen antagonist in MCF 7 and Ishikawa cells whereas TTC 352 is an estrogen agonist and BTC is an estrogen agonist in MCF 7 and Ishikawa cells. Although BTC and TTC 352 are nanomolar estrogen agonists in Ishikawa cells it should be noted that potency is three orders of magnitude below that of E2 16 19 . To fully characterize the estrogenic activity of BTC and TTC 352 in T47D A18 neo and T47D A18 PKC cells we examined transcriptional activation of ER using an estrogen response element ERE luciferase reporter construct. Following transient co transfection of the ERE tk luc and pCMV galactosidase plasmids cells were treated with vehicle control 0.1 DMSO E2 1 nM BTC 1 nM 10 nM 100 nM or TTC 352 1 nM 10 nM 100 nM 24 hours prior to determining luciferase and gal activities. We have previously reported that the basal ERE activity is elevated in T47D A18 PKC cells compared to the parental T47D A18 neo cells 6 . In T47D A18 neo cells BTC and TTC 352 treatment resulted in an increase in ER transcriptional activity at the highest concentration of 100 nM . T47D A18 PKC cells were more sensitive than T47D A18 neo cells to BTC ERE luciferase induction at 100 nM and 10 nM . These data suggest that BTC and TTC 352 act as ER agonists in both T47D A18 neo and T47D A18 PKC cell lines in vitro however relative to E2 BTC has enhanced potency and or efficacy in T47D A18 PKC cells.

In humans the absolute bioavailability of orally administered RAL is reported as 2 with oral clearance of 44 l kg h 20 21 . Desmethylarzoxifene DMA is a more potent estrogen antagonist in the breast and maintains estrogen agonist actions in bone tissues however it also has poor bioavailability 22 . Arzoxifene was designed as a DMA prodrug to overcome the problems associated with low bioavailability 23 26 . As part of a comparative study of biological activity of DMA arzoxifene and F DMA in juvenile female rats metabolism was assessed by quantification of remaining drug in plasma after 3 days of drug administration DMA was not observed above detection limits 16 18 19 . BTC is the benzothiophene core of both DMA and RAL whereas TTC 352 bears structural similarity with F DMA. Study of the comparative metabolism of DMA and F DMA suggests that BTC would have low bioavailability on account of metabolism and clearance in contrast to TTC 352 that is predicted to be stable 18 19 26 27 . Therefore plasma levels of BTC were measured after oral administration to ovariectomized athymic nude mice. Since BTC ionizes poorly by electrosparay ionization ESI MS a chemical derivatization method was developed using tandem mass spectroscopic MRM analysis. Drug was detected in plasma at a peak concentration of 40 ng mL at 30 min which fell to 10 ng mL after 6 h . Given the observation of BTC well above detection limits in mouse plasma it was decided to compare the effects of BTC and TTC 352 with RAL and E2 in the T47D A18 PKC xenograft model using oral delivery.

We have recently reported that RAL treatment results in significant regression of TAM resistant T47D A18 PKC tumors. However RAL did not produce an effect as robust as E2 on tumor regression and was unable to inhibit MATRIGEL colony formation 11 . In contrast to RAL BTC and TTC 352 are estrogens in 2D culture and like E2 have the ability to inhibit T47D A18 PKC colony formation in MATRIGEL . Therefore we next examined if these compounds could initiate T47D A18 PKC tumor regression. T47D A18 PKC cells were injected into 40 athymic mice and were left untreated for seven weeks at which time the mean tumor size was 0.5 cm 100 . At seven weeks the mice were randomized to either continue on the untreated control arm 9 mice received implants of an E2 capsule 9 mice oral RAL 1.5 mg day 9 mice oral BTC 1.5 mg day 9 mice or oral TTC 352 1.5 mg day 4 mice . Following two weeks all treatments significantly reduced tumor volume compared to non treated controls P

Regression of T47D A18 PKC tumors induced by both RAL and E2 is accompanied by the exit of the estrogen receptor ER from the nucleus 11 . We have previously reported the possible involvement of an extranuclear ER in E2 induced tumor regression 11 15 . Here we show that when tumors treated with BTC and TTC 352 are regressing there is an exit of ER from the nucleus suggesting that the mechanism underlying regression by benzothiophene SERMs may be similar to that of E2 and RAL and involve extranuclear ER . Together these results indicate that BTC and TTC 352 like E2 cause T47D A18 PKC tumor regression through a mechanism possibly involving extranuclear ER .

The ER positive hormone dependent T47D A18 neo empty vector control breast cancer cell line requires E2 for growth in vitro and in vivo 6 7 . Since BTC and TTC 352 treatment result in growth of T47D A18 neo cells in 2D culture and in 3D MATRIGEL we next sought to determine if BTC and TTC 352 could sustain the growth of T47D A18 neo tumors in vivo. T47D A18 neo cells were bilaterally injected into the mammary fat pads of 20 athymic mice and divided into six treatment groups 3 non treated control 3 E2 capsule 3 oral TAM 1.5 mg day 3 oral RAL 1.5 mg day 4 oral BTC 1.5 mg day or 4 oral TTC 352 1.5 mg day . Following seven weeks of treatment mice treated with E2 as expected harbored T47D A18 neo tumors that reached an average size of 0.35 cm 100 tumors treated with BTC and TTC 352 grew to an average size of 0.04 cm2 and 0.1 cm respectively . Although at higher concentrations BTC and TTC 352 stimulated the growth of T47D A18 neo cells in vitro neither compound was able to significantly stimulate the growth of T47D A18 neo xenograft tumors in vivo. Interestingly the dose capable of causing robust regression of T47D A18 PKC tumors had no effect on the growth of T47D A18 neo tumors in vivo. Additionally no significant weight loss was observed over the seven week treatment period .

E2 has a proliferative effect on the endometrium resulting in an increase in uterine weight. TAM has an estrogenic effect on endometrial growth which leads to an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer 28 . In ovariectomized rats at a minimally effective dose RAL did not increase uterine weight in contrast to E2 and TAM and at doses up to 10 mg kg day did not increase luminal epithelial cell thickness 29 32 . Mindful of the estrogen agonist actions of BTC and TTC 352 in Ishikawa cells we sought to compare the effects of BTC and TTC 352 on uterine weight with those of RAL TAM and E2. Following 7 weeks of treatment the uteri from ovariectomized mice in A were excised and weights determined. Interestingly there was no significant increase in the uterine weights of mice treated with BTC or TTC 352 . The significant proliferative actions associated with both TAM and E2 were absent from BTC and TTC 352 indicating that these SERMs deliver an improved safety profile compared to TAM and E2.

Resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer whether de novo or acquired is a major clinical obstacle. The use of 17 estradiol E2 or an alternative estrogen has re emerged as a potential treatment option following exhaustive use of selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors. Protein kinase C alpha PKC expression was shown to be a predictor of disease outcome for patients on endocrine therapy and may predict a positive response to an estrogenic treatment. We have previously reported that the ectopic overexpression of PKC in T47D A18 breast cancer cells leads to a hormone independent tamoxifen TAM resistant and E2 inhibited phenotype in vivo recapitulating observations made in the clinic. Here using our clinically relevant T47D A18 PKC model we have investigated novel benzothiophene SERMs for the treatment of TAM resistant breast cancer. Treatment with these SERMs resulted in significant regression of T47D A18 PKC tumors following two weeks of treatment accompanied by translocation of ER to extranuclear sites. Importantly SERM treatment did not result in growth of parental E2 dependent T47D A18 neo tumors suggesting that these SERMs do not act as estrogen agonists in parental hormone dependent cells in vivo. Additionally treatment with SERMs did not stimulate uterine weight gain.

Resistance to endocrine therapies is a major obstacle encountered in the clinical setting. Currently there is a lack of effective therapeutic options for women who no longer respond to conventional endocrine therapy approaches. Our findings and those of others suggest that PKC expression is a predictive marker of disease outcome for patients on endocrine therapy 3 5 . Further its expression may predict a positive response to E2 or an E2 like compound 7 . E2 has clinical efficacy 9 10 33 34 but due to unfavorable side effects it is no longer used for treatment. In the present study we sought to identify possible alternative therapeutic options for TAM resistant breast cancers especially those overexpressing PKC .

We screened a number of benzothiophene analogs and based on their in vitro estrogenic activity we chose two analogs BTC and TTC 352 for further study. In both T47D A18 neo and T47D A18 PKC cells BTC and TTC 352 treatment led to increased proliferation and activation of ERE in vitro . Although E2 induced the growth of hormone dependent TAM sensitive parental T47D A18 neo tumors in vivo neither BTC nor TTC 352 were able to support T47D A18 neo tumor growth . Interestingly the TAM resistant T47D A18 PKC tumors that were shown previously to regress upon E2 treatment 7 also regress when treated with BTC or TTC 352 . Similar to E2 regression is also accompanied by exit of ER from the nucleus to extranuclear sites suggesting a potential role for extranuclear ER in BTC and TTC 352 induced tumor regression. Extranuclear ER non genomic responses are generally associated with a proliferative response through activation of various signaling cascades 35 38 . We have previously shown that as T47D A18 PKC tumors regress in the presence of E2 there is a downregulation of the AKT pathway 15 as well as exit of ER from the nucleus to extranuclear sites 11 suggesting that extranuclear ER may have a novel anti proliferative role in SERM induced T47D A18 PKC tumor regression. It is interesting to postulate a mechanism in which extranuclear ER either directly or indirectly associates with PKC leading to its inactivation as T47D A18 PKC tumors regress. These possibilities are currently being explored in our laboratory. However unlike E2 neither BTC nor TTC 352 treatment resulted in an increase in the uterine weights of mice indicating that BTC and TTC 352 unlike E2 has enhanced tissue specificity.

Translocation of ER from the nucleus to cytoplasm is a common feature of treatments that cause regression of T47D A18 PKC tumors but not those that are ineffective i.e. TAM 11 . The similarity with the diarylthiohydantoin antiandrogens e.g. MDV3100 ARN509 RD 162 that cause a similar translocation of the androgen receptor AR in prostate cancer cells is of interest in particular because this feature is seen as a clinical advantage over older antiandrogens 39 40 . MDV3100 is anticipated shortly to receive approval for treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer. The mechanism by which these antiandrogens cause translocation have not been defined and as for benzothiophene SERMs could include stabilization of cytoplasmic or destabilization of nuclear receptor complexes.

It is fascinating that structurally related SERMs variously showing classical ER antagonist activity RAL or classical agonist activity BTC TTC 352 should elicit the same tumor regressing actions in T47D A18 PKC xenografts although the failure of RAL induced regression to persist after drug withdrawal is noted. That the estrogen agonists BTC and TTC 352 did not stimulate growth of estrogen sensitive T47D A18 neo xenografts or uterine tissues is most simply rationalized by the relatively low potency of these agonists again indicating involvement of a pathway that is not simply classical ER mediated in T47D A18 PKC xenografts.

Recently the use of E2 or an E2 like compound has re emerged as a possible treatment strategy for patients exhibiting endocrine therapy resistant breast cancers 41 44 . Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of E2 in this setting 33 34 . In fact a long term follow up study indicated a survival advantage for patients treated with the synthetic estrogen DES compared to patients treated with TAM 45 . The basis for the clinical use of estrogens is supported by a number of preclinical laboratory models 7 8 46 52 . Shim and colleagues showed that long term E2 deprived MCF 7 cells form tumors that are inhibited by E2 52 . RAL resistant MCF 7 cells undergo apoptosis following E2 exposure 48 . The serial transplantation of TAM stimulated MCF 7 tumors for 5 years also led to an E2 inhibitory phenotype 8 as well as the over expression of PKC 7 . The ability to predict a patient s response to therapy prior to treatment would be a very attractive clinical option. Patients presenting with tumors overexpressing PKC would likely benefit from an E2 like therapy of which there are currently few options.

The results of the present study support the use of a second line SERM with selective estrogenic effects on the breast for use in patients that no longer respond to conventional endocrine therapy and whose tumors overexpress PKC . We have described two novel benzothiophene SERMs that cause tumor regression in the TAM resistant T47D A18 PKC model while having little effect on the growth of parental hormone dependent T47D A18 neo tumors. As the presence of PKC dictated an enhanced estrogenic response to BTC and TTC 352 as well as a tumor regressing phenotype these compounds have potential clinical value in the TAM resistant setting. Importantly treatment with BTC and TTC 352 had minimal effects on proliferation within the uteri of mice in vivo indicating that the estrogenic effects of these agents are specific to the breast. Both BTC and TTC 352 are potential alternatives to E2 treatment and represent chemical probes and lead compounds for further optimization towards new treatment options in the management of endocrine resistant breast cancer.

In accordance with clinical observations both T47D Tam1 and T47D PKC xenografts are TAM resistant and growth is inhibited by Etreatment C . Interestingly the newer generation Selective estrogen Receptor Modulator SERM raloxifene caused tumor regression however drug withdrawal led to relapse . Observations that TTC 352 structurally related to raloxifene mimicked the actions of Ein T47D cells in vitro endorsed TTC 352 as a potential alternative treatment to E. Established T47D Tam1 and T47D PKC xenograft tumors treated daily with TTC 352 for seven weeks displayed tumor regression comparable to that of E treated tumors even after withdrawal of treatment . Endometrial thickening caused by both Eand TAM but not raloxifene is directly associated with gynecological carcinogenesis and uterine cancer. TTC 352 treatment did not increase uterine weight in mice suggesting negligible hormonal stimulation in gynecological tissues . TTC 352 meets the criteria for a selective estrogen mimic SEM selective for therapy of ER and TAM resistant breast cancer with enhanced safety compared to Eand TAM. PKC is present in 70 of all tumors including triple negative BC for which there is no effective treatment indicating the effectiveness of SEM therapeutic application beyond TAM resistance.

SEM prodrugs have been prepared using standard scalable organic chemistry techniques. Metabolic stability will be verified in human liver and human intestinal microsomal incubations and plasma with or without esterase PLE . SEMs with high stability minimal oxidative metabolites and efficient enzymic bioactivation to TTC 352 i.e. TTC 352 will be advanced to pharmacokinetic studies.

Ovariectomized OVX nude 4 to 6 week old athymic mice will be administered TTC 352 and no more than 3 SEM prodrugs by gavage in ethanol using a vehicle of propylene glycol carboxymethyl cellulose at a single dose of 4.4 mol equivalent to 1.5 mg day used in xenograft studies . Blood samples will be collected at 20 min 2 h and 6 h after treatment using EDTA as an anticoagulant. Plasma will be separated from whole blood by centrifugation at 4 C. and samples will be immediately analyzed for prodrug and drug using LC MS MS.

T47D Tam1 and T47D PKC xenograft tumor models will be used to assess the efficacy of 2 SEM treatments at 2 doses 4.4 mol and 0.44 mol day based upon data shown in . Tumors will be grown in OVX athymic mice and treated once tumor volume reaches approximately 0.5 cm. The response to SEMs will be compared to the standard of care e.g. tamoxifen .

For tumors treated by SEMs PKC and ER biomarkers will be assessed by immunohistochemistry. Anticoagulant activity will be measured ex vivo.
