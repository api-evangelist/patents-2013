The invention described here may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for Governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention generally relates to a system and method for vehicle deployment extraction and stowage.

Conventional vehicle deployment extraction and stowage systems and methods include the General Motors Vert A Pac railroad cars for stowage of vertically oriented vehicles elevator lift systems that have stowage for horizontally oriented vehicles the modular reusable shipping crate of U.S. Pat. No. 7 762 417 issued Jul. 27 2010 and the vehicle storage lift of U.S. Pat. No. 7 861 828 issued Jan. 4 2011.

Such conventional systems and methods may have deficiencies such as they are generally specialized for particular vehicles require extensive human interaction have limited storage capacity and or fail to provide efficient space utilization. As such conventional vehicle deployment extraction and stowage systems and methods may be unsuitable for unmanned ground vehicles.

Thus there exists a need and an opportunity for an improved system and method of unmanned ground vehicle deployment extraction and stowage. Such an improved system and method may overcome one or more of the deficiencies of the conventional approaches.

The present invention is directed to a system and method of unmanned ground vehicle deployment extraction and stowage. The system is a modular handling and stowage system for the vehicles. The system comprises at least one primary full function module and may include one or more secondary limited function modules. The primary module and all of the secondary modules that may be implemented together as a system are generally electrically and mechanically coupled. Each of the secondary modules may be added or removed to grow the system to provide multiple unmanned ground vehicle deployment extraction and stowage. In the preferred embodiment based on the interface chosen for module to module communication and voltage drops limitations through for example Ethernet and Universal Serial Bus USB total networks the maximum size recommended is twenty modules. However other embodiments may provide more additional module implementation beyond twenty.

Each modular unit of the system is marsupial that is each module provides containerized stowage of the desired conventional small tracked unmanned ground vehicle e.g. UGV robot or the like as well as electro mechanical elements to provide loading unloading and tilting of the robot. That is each unit contains a UGV and enables remote extraction and deployment. In one embodiment the modules may be mounted to a host. When multiple modules are implemented one or more of the modules may contain a vehicle or alternatively remain empty. When implemented the host can be a manned or unmanned vehicle container wagon trailer cargo hold air craft water craft or the like which may provide air water or ground deliverability to a desired location e.g. field of action .

The system comprises one master e.g. primary load unload store end full function etc. module e.g. unit container box etc. and may further include any number of slave e.g. secondary limited function etc. modules. Each of the primary module and the secondary modules generally provides storage for a UGV as each module comprises stowage mechanics a motor controller embedded software a UGV alignment sub system robotic positioning sensors status indicators e.g. light emitting diodes LEDs an electro mechanical UGV power on off mechanism implemented to conserve UGV battery charge that is generally remotely activated a mechanical grasp mechanism to hold and clench and rotate the robot in place and position and a linear actuator.

Each of the primary and secondary modules includes the capability to position rotate and stow the respective robot in a substantially vertical orientation thereby generally reducing or minimizing the horizontal storage space otherwise known as the footprint that is implemented to stow the robot s and potentially maximizing the number of robots that can be carried via the host or otherwise stowed.

Each adjacent module of the modular system interlinks via mechanical coupling and electrical coupling. The robot s exit and enter the system from a common point that is the master primary module.

The mechanical coupling between adjacent modules may be implemented as draw latches that use a compressive force interlocking system. Each module is generally interconnected to the adjacent modules by using bullet hole alignment devices in combination with the draw latches.

The system comprises a master module and zero or more slave modules. The master module includes a UGV robot master support tray and lift articulation actuator that generally provides a primary ingress and egress ramp for all of the robots that are serially stored in the master and the slave modules. That is the system provides a last in first out LIFO stowage of the robots. Each slave module contains a UGV robot limited function support tray which when lowered provides overlap into the adjacent module for interconnecting the continuous ingress and egress path for the robots to traverse upon throughout the system of interconnected coupled modules.

The UGV stowage system comprises a single system master controller e.g. a supervisory modules controller which communicates to i a host interface system when the host is implemented ii the master module controller and iii slave module controllers. Each of the individual master and slave modules includes an individual motor controller which is configured when in slave mode to the system master controller. The slave controller in the master module and each of the slave modules are linked electrically coupled to the system master controller through a serial communications link. The master module and each slave module also comprise a clamping linear drive actuator and location sensors. The slave controller in the master module and in each of the slave modules is connected coupled to provide control of the respective clamping linear drive actuator. The clamping linear drive actuators are generally connected mechanically to the main drive shaft via a linkage described in detail below such that the clamping linear drive actuator rotates a main drive shaft.

The system master controller generally i interfaces typically via a wireless link with a a user e.g. operator Soldier etc. and b the host interface system when implemented ii monitors and controls the status of the individual master and slave modules iii provides hierarchy control over the master and slave modules iv provides data for the graphical user interface and v distributes the power and serial communication to each of the slave modules and master module motor controller. The system master controller monitor and control of the status of the individual master and slave modules includes executing extraction or deployment commands or operation and also may include real time information such as the presence of a robot within each module and whether each module is in the operation of robot extraction or deployment.

The system master controller may also provide an interlock e.g. lockout failsafe and the like feature to each module when the user does not provide the correct information to execute a command. For example a slave module located three modules away from the master module will not be allowed to execute a robot deploy command when the prior two modules are not in the deployed position or when a robot is present in the one or both of the modules located one or two modules away from the master module has not yet deployed the respective robot or when the robot contained within the module commanded to deploy has not established a communication link.

The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed descriptions thereof when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.

The singular forms such as a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example reference to a material includes reference to one or more of such materials and an element includes reference to one or more of such elements.

As used herein substantial ly and about when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material characteristic parameter and the like refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly substantially free of or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition characteristic or property. Particularly assemblies that are identified as being substantially free of are either completely absent of the characteristic or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.

A plurality of items structural elements compositional elements materials subassemblies and the like may be presented in a common list or table for convenience. However these lists or tables should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. As such no individual member of such list should be considered a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on the presentation in a common group so specifically described.

Concentrations values dimensions amounts and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub range is explicitly recited. For example a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units 3 dimensional units 10 dimensional units and the like and sub ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units and the like.

As used herein elements having numbers more than 100 and less than 1000 generally refer to conventional elements known by one having ordinary skill in the art while elements number 1000 and above refer to the present invention or elements components and the like thereof. Like numbered elements generally refer to the same element however the like numbered elements may include a suffix L to designate the left side element and a suffix R to designate the right side element when left and right elements are mirrors i.e. physical embodiment of mirror images of each other. Similarly a center i.e. substantially centrally positioned element may be designated with the suffix C . The suffix x refers to a generic member of the particular element group e.g. an element from a group having a number of similar elements a n hence the suffix x 1 refers to a serially immediately higher element and the suffix x 1 refers to a serially immediately lower element. When it is understood by one of skill in the art from the context of use suffix designation may be omitted herein.

For clarity of Figures and explanation conventional direct hard electrical wiring and related connectors are not illustrated. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand the layout positioning and operational characteristics of such conventional elements. One of ordinary skill in the art would also understand that such direct electrical wiring generally may provide multi message bi directional communications as well as multi level e.g. different levels of voltage and or current electrical power.

Conventional elements further generally include i those elements associated with an unmanned ground vehicle e.g. tracked robot and the like that is an exemplar of the vehicle to be deployed extracted i.e. retrieved and stowed i.e. transported stored held etc. in accordance with the present invention ii those elements associated with a host vehicle sub system vessel receptacle warehouse or the like where the present invention may be installed i.e. implemented disposed etc. and or iii programmable controller and computer hardware and memory but not including the particular computer programming that is implemented in accordance with the present invention.

With reference to the Figures the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. Generally the present invention provides an improved system e.g. a modular handling and stowage system and an improved method e.g. a process for unmanned ground vehicle deployment extraction and stowage. However as understood by one of skill in the art the present invention is generally scalable such that other vehicles and apparatuses may be deployed extracted and stowed in accordance with the present invention.

Referring to on an isometric perspective view of the system from the right rear is shown on an isometric view of the modular handling and stowage system from the upper left is shown as installed on a host e.g. a vehicle or another host such as a building airplane ship trailer etc. of which a partial broken image is shown and on a block electrical schematic diagram of a system control apparatus that is implemented in connection with the system is shown. The system modular handling and stowage generally comprises a master e.g. primary load unload store end full function etc. module e.g. container unit box etc. and the system control apparatus .

In a preferred embodiment the system further comprises at least one slave e.g. secondary limited function etc. module e.g. secondary modules . When the system is configured having the primary module implemented in connection with one or more of the secondary modules the modules and are positioned adjacently and are generally serially and electrically coupled and mechanically coupled together.

Like named and numbered components and elements are generally implemented similarly whether implemented in connection with a primary box or a secondary box . Further as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art similar naming and numbering of elements within the Detailed Description and Figures generally does not distinguish between primary module and secondary module implementations as the context will make clear the usage. In contrast the Claims generally do include primary and secondary designations such that the usage is distinct and unambiguous to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The system is generally implemented in connection with at least one conventional small tracked unmanned ground vehicle e.g. UGV robot or the like as illustrated on in a partially deployed mode. In one example as illustrated on the UGV may be implemented having inner tracks e.g. left inner track L and right inner track R and outer tracks e.g. left outer track L and right outer track R .

As described in more detail below the modules and each stow one of the UGVs in a substantially vertical orientation. The UGVs are serially deployed and extracted retrieved to and from the system via in and out of the primary module via the system control apparatus under the direction e.g. operation supervision management etc. of a User e.g. operator technician Soldier etc. . However other vehicles e.g. manned vehicles devices apparatus and the like may be advantageously deployed extracted and stored via the modular handling and stowage system .

For purposes of description of directions orthogonal coordinate referencing is generally assumed. Longitudinal front back fore aft forward backward etc. and lateral left right side to side etc. directions relative to the system are generally as illustrated on and are generally perpendicular to each other. As such vertical i.e. up down upward downward upper lower top bottom lift lower etc. directions are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal lateral i.e. horizontal plane e.g. an earth or water body plane . Similarly clockwise CW and counter clockwise CCW rotational angular motions are referenced as viewed from the right towards the left about a right left axis.

In the preferred embodiment based on the electrical interface implemented for module to module communications and voltage drops limitations through the Ethernet and Universal Serial Bus USB networks the maximum size recommended is twenty modules. However other embodiments e.g. wireless communications implementations may provide more additional module implementation beyond twenty.

Referring to an isometric view from the upper left side of the system installed e.g. mounted fastened positioned placed implemented etc. on the host partially illustrated via a broken image is shown. The system may be implemented in connection with any appropriate host . For example the host may be implemented as a manned or unmanned vehicle container wagon trailer cargo hold aircraft water craft or the like.

Each of the boxes and generally provides containerized stowage of the desired conventional small tracked unmanned ground vehicle e.g. UGV robot or the like as well as electro mechanical elements e.g. sub systems devices apparatuses and the like to provide loading unloading and tilting of the robot . That is each unit and or may contain a UGV and enables remote extraction e.g. removal of the UGV from an operation environment for stowage in the system on the host and deployment e.g. unloading the UGV from the system on the host . There is generally a plurality of the robots implemented in connection with the system . However one or more of any of the units and or may be left empty e.g. a No UGV state .

The system may minimize the horizontal stowage space that is implemented in connection with the host for each small UGV . Each of the modules and or generally implements the capability to position and stow the robot in a substantially vertical orientation which may maximize the number of robots carried via the host .

The modular handling and stowage system generally implements a common ingress egress point path for the UGVs e.g. in out of the primary module as illustrated for example on as via the rear of the host vehicle . Each module and or of the modular handling and stowage system interlinks electrically and mechanically to the other units and or and the robot s exit and enter the system from a common point i.e. the rear of the master module .

Referring to a block electrical schematic diagram illustrating the system control management operation etc. apparatus e.g. system controller is shown. The system control apparatus e.g. assembly group etc. generally monitors and controls the operation e.g. process steps method etc. of the system as directed by the User. In one embodiment the system control apparatus comprises an operation control sub system a host interface system a wireless communication link and a primary module control sub system . Within e.g. throughout the system the system control apparatus generally manages via a plurality of signals e.g. messages transmissions communications and the like e.g. signals Control Status Msg or alternatively in some uses herein abbreviated CSSM to designate the same signals that control command indicate status provide sensor output actuator input warning power and or power transmission and the like. The specific role of a given signal CSSM will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

In another embodiment e.g. when the system is implemented without the host the host interface system may be omitted.

The operation control sub system generally includes an operator control unit OCU by which the User monitors and controls the modular handling and stowage system e.g. via screen images graphical user interfaces keyboard and or touch screen entry joystick manipulation etc. and a first communications link transceiver that is electrically coupled interlinked linked etc. to the OCU . The host interface system is generally implemented in connection with e.g. installed on mounted to etc. the host and comprises a second transceiver and a host interface controller that is electrically coupled to the second transceiver . The host interface controller is generally electrically coupled to the primary module control sub system . When the modular handling and stowage system is implemented without the host interface system the host interface controller is generally not included.

The primary module control sub system comprises a supervisory modules controller and an individual motor controller e.g. a motor controller  PM . The supervisory modules controller may be directly electrically coupled to the host interface controller . The supervisory modules controller is generally electrically coupled to the primary motor controller  PM.

The communication link generally provides a wireless bi directional communication path between the operation control sub system and the host interface system and thereby between the User and the system which is mounted on the host .

When the modular handling and stowage system includes one or more of the secondary storage modules each secondary storage module comprises a secondary sub system controller e.g. secondary sub system controllers that is generally operated in a so called slave mode. The secondary sub system controller includes an individual motor controller e.g. motor controllers . All of the motor controllers are generally serially electrically coupled e.g. via a serial communication link such that the supervisory modules controller which is generally operated in a so called master mode provides communication e.g. monitor and control of operations via signals Control Status Msg or CSSM to all of the modules and or . As such monitor and control operations of the system are provided to and from the User via the control sub system .

Referring to block diagrams illustrating two examples of a variety of information e.g. data commands statuses states poses and the like that may be observed controlled communicated and monitored in the modular handling and stowage system via the system control apparatus are shown. The primary module control sub system generally includes the real time status e.g. Sx where x indicates a particular module or for the primary module and the secondary modules in the supervisory modules controller . The information that is presented via a status message signal e.g. the signal Control Status Msg or CSSM from the individual motor controllers to the supervisory modules controller may be in terms of executing an extraction or deployment command or operation and may also include real time information with regards to the presence of the robot within each module and or and whether each module and or is an extraction or deployment mode of operation of the robot and the like.

In one example illustrated on the individual motor controller  PM presents a status e.g. state message signal e.g. S PM Deployed No UGV to the supervisory modules controller the individual motor controller presents a status signal e.g. Sa Deployed No UGV to the supervisory modules controller the individual motor controller presents a status signal e.g. Sb Not Deployed Has UGV to the supervisory modules controller and the individual motor controller presents a status signal e.g. Sc Deployed Has UGV to the supervisory modules controller .

In another example illustrated on the individual motor controller  PM presents the status signal S PM Deployed No UGV to the supervisory modules controller the individual motor controller presents the status signal Sa Deployed No UGV to the supervisory modules controller the individual motor controller presents the status signal Sb Not Deployed Has UGV Ready to the supervisory modules controller and the individual motor controller presents the status signal Sc Deployed Has UGV Not Ready to the supervisory modules controller .

The system control apparatus controller generally limits deployment of the UGVs from the modules and to the UGVs that are in a condition for deployment e.g. a Ready state or mode . The supervisory modules controller also generally provides extraction storage deployment operation and interlock lockout failsafe to each module and to eliminate deployment errors. In particular as well as status signals the system control apparatus generally communicates signals with the system that may be related to command and control operations e.g. lift lower actuate extend retract deploy extract power on off rotate feedback etc. and monitoring e.g. alert e.g. safe not safe clear blocked in out of position alignment etc. . More details of the operation of the modular handling and stowage system via the system control apparatus are provided below.

Referring to isometric views from the upper right rear of the primary container and the UGV in a deploying loading unloading state and a clamped and stowed state are illustrated. The UGV further comprises a nose and a camera e.g. a manipulator camera . The manipulator camera generally faces forward and provides the User a forward view images as one or more of the monitor signals. However in alternative embodiments the camera may have alternative orientation to meet the design criteria of the particular implementation.

The unit generally comprises a storage compartment i.e. region zone space area etc. an operation mechanism compartment a wall e.g. bulkhead divider partition plate separator etc. a shell i.e. cover enclosure housing jacket shroud casing etc. a base e.g. bottom main support and the like and a tray assembly e.g. pan platform platter carriage and the like which includes track clamp arms e.g. left and right track clamp arms L and R respectively .

The storage space is generally sized to receive and stow one vehicle in a substantially vertical orientation that is laterally tilted 90 degrees from a normal mode of operation . The operation mechanism compartment is generally sized to hold and protect a portion of the system control and operation devices as described in further detail below. The wall generally vertically and longitudinally defines the separation between the storage zone and the operation mechanism compartment and provides a mounting surface for elements e.g. components sub assemblies etc. as described in detail below.

The cover is generally shaped as an inverted U and comprises three of the four sides to a rectangle with the base comprising the fourth side of the rectangle when viewed from the front or rear. The cover is generally mechanically coupled to the base via a plurality of bolts or screws . The cover generally further comprises cooperatively mating draw latch clasp and hook assemblies and lift D rings .

The module base further generally provides a mounting surface for elements e.g. components assemblies sub systems and the like as described in detail below.

The master module tray generally provides i a ramp for deployment and extraction i.e. ingress egress of the vehicle ii a constraining surface for storage of the vehicle and iii a mounting surface for elements components as described in detail below. The track clamp arms are generally implemented as L shaped members having the short leg of the L directed inward. In response to a control signal the track clamp arms are generally rotated such that the short leg of the L presses against the tracks to hold the vehicle firmly in place in the tray .

Referring to isometric views from the upper right rear of the secondary container and the UGV in a deploying loading unloading state and a clamped and stowed state are illustrated. The secondary container is generally implemented similarly to the primary container however in lieu of the tray the secondary container includes a secondary tray assembly . Likewise as is made clear in the description below some of the control and operation components and processes that are described in detail below may be implemented differently as between the primary container and the secondary container .

Referring to and referring back to A B and A B exemplary broken sections with inset A from B and B of a side elevation sectional view illustrating details of the mechanical coupling of adjacent modules and e.g. the primary module and the secondary module or the module and the module 1 are shown. The mating draw latch clasp and hook assemblies generally mechanically couple interconnect adjacent containers and or to via a compressive force interlocking system. Alignment of adjacent modules and or to is generally achieved via pin hole alignment devices e.g. a bullet shaped pin e.g. male device and a mating hole e.g. female device in combination with the draw latch clasp and hook assemblies.

Referring to a top plan view of the rear portion of the modular handling and stowage system with the covers removed from the interconnected boxes and and without a UGV aboard for clarity is shown. Each of the slave modules e.g. the slave modules comprises a UGV robot the support tray e.g. the platforms which when lowered provides overlap into the rearwardly adjacent module and or for interconnecting the continuous ingress and egress path for the robots to traverse upon throughout the system .

Referring to a side sectional view taken at line 9 9 on is shown. also illustrates the support tray e.g. the platforms which when lowered provides overlap into the rearwardly adjacent module and or for interconnecting the continuous ingress and egress path for the robots to traverse upon throughout the system .

Referring to an isometric view from the lower left rear of the primary module without the vehicle is shown. Some elements are omitted for clarity. The module may be an example embodiment of the UGV deployment and extraction master module that is implemented in accordance with the present invention. The primary full function module generally comprises the wall plate the shroud cover the base plate and the UGV support tray assembly .

The primary module further comprise bearing support plates e.g. brackets flanges etc. e.g. left and right bearing support flanges L and R respectively that are mounted vertically on the base into the storage compartment and an actuator mounting plate e.g. bracket flange truss or the like that is mounted vertically on the base into the operation mechanism compartment and is retained at the top via a truss mounting bolt that is mechanically coupled into the partition .

The primary module support tray is generally sized and configured in connection with additional elements as described in detail below to grasp and rotate a selected UGV from a variable deployed position horizontal to negative 30 degree depression angle to a substantially vertical position for stowage in response to an appropriate store control signal e.g. command and the reverse process for deployment in response to a deploy control signal.

A typical primary module in accordance with this invention for the selected UGV may have an overall size envelope of 29 tall by 32 wide by 13 deep. However master module is generally sized to accommodate any desired UGV to meet a given design criteria of a particular implementation.

Referring to an isometric view from the rear upper right of the full function unit with the cover removed for clarity is illustrated. The master module further comprises a lifting lift linear actuator a main drive shaft an intermediate shaft a clamping clamp linear actuator module tray support arms e.g. left and right tray support arms L and R respectively that are secured to the bottom of the tray a clamp dog that is generally centrally laterally mounted in the storage compartment on the base a lift arm and cylindrical pins .

In addition the master module support tray further comprises ramp extensions e.g. feet sections etc. e.g. left and right ramp extensions L and R respectively and a plurality of laterally positioned tread lugs e.g. cleats . The module tray support arms further comprise rearward oriented extension legs e.g. left and right extension legs L and R respectively . Refer also back to .

The lift linear actuator and the clamping linear actuator are generally implemented as bidirectional electrical linear actuators that extend and retract in response to control signals e.g. the signals Control Status Msg CSSM via the primary module control sub system generally mounted on the lift linear actuator the supervisory modules controller and or the individual motor controller  PM. The lift linear actuator and the clamping linear actuator may also provide positional feedback signals e.g. indication of the position of the actuator shaft to the primary module control sub system . The clamp dog in connection with the track clamp arms is generally implemented to hold the vehicle in the stowed position.

The lifting and lowering where lift is designated as clockwise CW motion rotation and lower is designated counter clockwise CCW motion of the UGV support primary module tray is generally provided via the linear lift actuator in connection with the main drive shaft the tray support arms and the lift arm . The lift lower angular range of motion provided to the support tray is generally from at least 30 degrees below the horizontal to 90 degrees i.e. vertical refer back for example to .

The linear lift actuator is generally rotationally pinned via a first of the pins through the actuator plate and the wall at a first end and rotationally pinned via a second of the pins through legs of the lift arm at the second end. The lift arm is securely mechanically coupled i.e. fastened to the main drive shaft thereby translating linear extension retraction motion of the lift actuator into rotation of the main drive shaft thus providing the lift lower motion of the tray . The main drive shaft is generally supported along its length by bearings in the actuator plate wall plate and the bearing support plates . Retaining rings e.g. c clips e clips and the like at the ends of the main shaft may axially constrain the main drive shaft thereby permitting only one degree of freedom that is rotation of the main shaft .

The main drive shaft generally runs laterally through holes in the support arms of the UGV support tray and is securely non pivotally attached fixed to the support arms of the tray . The main drive shaft generally runs through bearings in the clamping dog thereby providing free rotation of the clamping dog relative to the main drive shaft . The lateral motion of the clamp dog is generally constrained by pins that are installed through the main drive shaft on both sides of the clamp dog see also .

Referring to an isometric view from the left upper front of a broken out portion of the primary module illustrated on is shown and also referring to whereon sectional side views of the primary module taken at line 13 13 of with a vehicle included on the primary module support tray with the primary module support tray is at a substantially horizontal position are shown. illustrate operation of the clamp dog and associated elements during a closing opening i.e. clamping unclamping operation on the front of the vehicle i.e. the nose in response to an appropriate control signal. In particular illustrates the clamp dog in a fully open i.e. raised up etc. position illustrates the clamp dog in a partially open partially closed i.e. intermediate position and illustrates the clamp dog in a fully closed clamped position i.e. the clamp dog clamped on the UGV nose . As also illustrated on the clamp dog further comprises a switch plunger assembly which is described in detail below for example in connection with .

The UGV support tray assembly comprises the intermediate shaft which runs through bearings in the UGV tray support arms thereby providing free rotation of the intermediate shaft relative to the UGV support tray . The support tray assembly further comprises a rocker device having cantilever rockers e.g. left and right rockers L and R respectively a primary cantilever rocker pin sector shaped slider plates e.g. left and right slider plates L and R respectively a rocker cross pin rocker torsion springs dog clamp lugs e.g. legs flanges projections etc. e.g. left and right dog clamp lugs L and R respectively that extend off the clamp dog and an arc shaped clamp linkage e.g. curved bar .

The cantilever rockers are generally triangular shaped and include lateral holes at each of the three vertices. The cantilever rockers generally pivot rotate freely about the intermediate shaft at the first hole. The two slider plates are rigidly i.e. non rotatably firmly etc. attached at the vertices to the intermediate shaft outboard of the cantilever rockers . The rocker cross pin extends laterally through the second hole in the cantilever rockers through a hole in a first end of the clamp linkage and through curved arcuate slider slots e.g. left and right slider slots L and R respectively in the slider plates at the periphery i.e. distal to the intermediate shaft .

The rocker torsion springs are mounted about e.g. wrapped around the intermediate shaft . The torsion springs have a first end that is captured by the slider plates at the periphery and a second end that generally rests against the rocker cross pin thereby providing angular torsional force between the periphery of the slider plates and the rocker cross pin . The clamp linkage is generally rotatably held i.e. pivotal at a first end by the rocker cross pin between the cantilever rockers and is generally rotatably pivotally pinned through holes in the dog clamp legs on the clamping dog at the second end.

As illustrated on when in response to a clamping control signal e.g. the signal CS SM the clamping linear actuator extends the forward linear motion of the clamping linear actuator is generally translated into rotational motion of the slider plate which is translated into substantially linear motion of the clamping linkage into the dog clamps lugs which is in turn translated into rotational clamping motion of the clamp dog onto the front of the vehicle e.g. the vehicle nose .

Referring to an isometric view from the upper right rear of a broken out portion of the primary module with the primary module support tray assembly at a substantially horizontal orientation is shown. See also for example . illustrates an embodiment of track clamping arm actuation mechanics e.g. sub assembly implemented in connection with the primary module .

The primary module support tray assembly further comprises clamp arm lug plates e.g. left and right clamp arm lug plates L and R respectively clamp arm link bars e.g. left and right clamp arm link bars L and R respectively clamp arm link plate e.g. fingers struts etc. pairs  T and  B top and bottom respectively e.g. top left clamp arm link finger  TL not visible on bottom left clamp arm link finger  BL top right clamp arm link finger  TR and bottom right clamp arm link finger  BR clamp arm pivot pins e.g. left and right clamp arm pivot pins L and R respectively support tray walls e.g. left and right support tray walls L and R respectively and a support tray center hump e.g. rise crown ridge and the like . The support tray walls are generally substantially vertical.

The clamp arm lug plates are rigidly i.e. non rotatably firmly etc. attached to the outboard ends of the intermediate shaft . As such rotary motion of the intermediate shaft also produces rotary or angular motion to the periphery of the clamp arm lug plates . The clamp arms are pinned through the outboard vertical walls of the UGV support tray via the clamp arm pivot pins thereby providing free rotation pivoting of the clamp arms relative to the UGV support tray .

A first end of the clamp arm link bar is pivotally pinned to the peripheral outer end of the clamp arm lug plate . A first end of the top clamp arm link finger  T is pivotally pinned to the clamp arm . A first end of the bottom clamp arm link finger  B is pivotally pinned to the support tray wall . A second end of the clamp arm link bar a second end of the top clamp arm link finger  T and a second end of the bottom clamp arm link finger  B are all pivotally pinned together to form a three bar linkage.

Referring to sectional side views of the primary module taken at line 15 15 of are shown. illustrate operation of the clamp arm in connection with the intermediate shaft . illustrates the clamp arm in a fully up open position illustrates the clamp arm in an intermediate position and illustrates the clamp arm in a fully down clamped position.

The three bar linkage formed by the combined clamp arm link bar and the clamp arm link plate pairs generally translates rotary motion of the intermediate shaft and thus the clamp arm lug plate into rotary motion of the clamp arm . When viewed from right to left along the axis of the intermediate shaft a clockwise rotation of the intermediate shaft produces counter clockwise rotation of the clamp arm about the clamp arm pin pivot point. Similarly counter clockwise rotation of the intermediate shaft is converted to clockwise rotation of the clamp arm about the clamp arm pin pivot point.

Referring to a side sectional view of the primary module taken at line 16 16 of is shown. The support platform further comprises tray actuator lugs e.g. flanges brackets etc. e.g. left and right tray actuator brackets L and R respectively . The clamping linear actuator is generally pivotally pinned at one end to the tray actuator lugs on the UGV support tray and is pivotally pinned to the cantilever rockers at the other end via the primary cantilever rocker pin .

When the User presents one or more clamp unclamp control signals to the primary module via the system control apparatus the clamping linear actuator extends retracts accordingly. As shown on and described above in connection with the combined linkages cantilever rocker intermediate shaft etc. are mechanically coupled and translate extension and retraction motion of the clamping linear actuator to rotary motion of the clamping dog such that when the clamping linear actuator extends the clamp dog is rotated counter clockwise when viewed from right to left .

Similarly retraction of the clamping linear actuator causes clockwise rotation of the clamping dog about the main drive shaft . Thus through the mechanical coupling described in connection with arcuate motion of the clamp arms and the clamping dog are directly controlled by extension and retraction of the clamping linear actuator in response to the one or more clamp unclamp control signals CSSM.

Referring to side sectional views of the primary module taken at the line 17 17 of are shown. On the primary module tray is illustrated at a position that is about 30 degrees below the horizontal plane and the torsion spring is in a compressed state. On the primary module tray is illustrated at a position that is substantially horizontal and the torsion spring is in a mostly predominantly relaxed state that is tension sufficient to hold the torsion spring captured in place by the slider plates is maintained.

The rocker cross pin lateral coupling through the curved slider plate slots in the slider plates and the torsion spring connections e.g. the torsion spring interfacing against the slider plate and the rocker cross pin generally provide torsional bias that produces full unclamping of the clamp arms and the clamp dog at a User controlled variable depression angle e.g. zero to negative 30 degrees thereby decoupling the relative motion of the clamp arms and the clamp dog e.g. providing lost motion to the clamp arms via the slots when the clamp arms are fully open and the clamp dog has some distance yet to travel e.g. a portion of angular unclamping motion of the clamp dog is incomplete . The arcuate length of the slider plate slots is generally sized to provide such decoupling.

Referring to a side elevation view looking forward of the primary module having the vehicle resting in the primary module tray and the primary module tray oriented in a substantially horizontal position is shown. generally illustrates end view geometry of the UGV primary module support tray . The UGV primary module support tray is generally of sufficient width i.e. distance between the tray walls L and R to allow a selected UGV to freely drive move longitudinally along the length of the primary module tray . The center hump has a rise that is low enough to clear the underbelly of the UGV and generally has trapezoidal shape having a bottom width that provides walls sloped to urge e.g. force nudge push etc. the UGV to self center along the length of the primary module tray while contacting inboard surfaces the UGV tracks .

As also illustrated on the partition further comprises a first visual indicator and a second visual indicator . The visual indicators and are generally implemented as light emitting diodes LEDs . In particular the LED is generally implemented as a red LED and the LED is generally implemented as a green LED.

The LEDs and are generally mounted on the wall into the storage compartment region and are outwardly oriented to provide visibility of the emitted light signals e.g. versions of the signals Control Status Msg to the User from the rear. The camera may also be advantageously implemented by the User to view the output signals from the LEDs and especially when the User is driving the UGV into the modular handling and stowage system . See also the description below in connection with .

Referring to a side sectional view of a portion of the primary module taken at the line 19 19 of is shown in connection with a loading unloading ramp portion of the host with the primary module tray lowered as illustrated for example on and . The support tray ramp sections generally protrude extend at a depression angle from the UGV support tray main surface and contact one of i the mating ramp on the host ii the ground and iii the surface onto which the system is mounted. The tread lugs are generally attached to the ramp extensions and the main surface of the UGV primary module support tray at intervals to provide a positive grip surface for the UGV to climb especially when the ramp on the host is oriented at an extreme depression angle.

Further the primary module support tray comprises two lever operated limit switches e.g. a first lever operated limit switch a second lever operated limit switch . The first lever operated limit switch is generally electrically connected coupled to the primary module control sub system to provide a feedback signal e.g. a version of the signal CSSM that may indicate the position of the primary module tray . In particular the first lever operated limit switch is generally mounted to the outer longitudinal edge of the UGV primary module support tray between the extension legs . When the primary module support tray is sufficiently lowered e.g. at the desired depression angle the lever arm actuator portion of the first lever operated limit switch will contact one of i the mating ramp on the host ii the ground and iii the surface onto which the system is mounted and the first lever operated limit switch will present the appropriate signal CSSM that indicates such contact to the primary module control sub system .

Referring to a side sectional view of a portion of the primary module taken at line 20 20 of is shown. Also refer back to and 19 . The second lever operated limit switch is electrically connected coupled to the primary module control sub system to provide the system control apparatus positional feedback information regarding the vehicle and also to sense and indicate presence of the UGV . The second lever operated limit switch is generally mounted to the UGV support tray left lift arm L such that when the UGV is in the appropriate longitudinal position for clamping and stowage the lever actuation arm is depressed by the UGV nose and the appropriate signal CSSM is presented to the primary module control sub system .

Continuing to refer to and also referring back to the system control apparatus and thus the modular handling and stowage system further comprises a non contacting in one example an optical based distance sensor on the sensors  PM and . The distance sensor is generally implemented as an infrared IR sensor. The IR distance sensor is generally attached to the inside of the module cover . The IR distance sensor is electrically coupled to the primary module control sub system to provide a positional feedback signal i.e. over run position signal CS SM regarding the nose position for the UGV .

In the embodiment illustrated on the IR distance sensor is shown mounted and aimed to sense downward see line of sight L O S . In the embodiment that is illustrated on the optical nose position sensors i.e. the non contacting sensors  PM and are mounted on the inside of the left wall of the cover and aimed laterally across the interior .

In any case the IR distance sensor is generally positioned and aimed relative to the UGV stowage position at a location such that the nose may be detected when the UGV is driven into the module by the User. The position and aiming hence L O S of the optical nose position sensor is generally implemented such that when the UGV is driven too far into the module by the User the IR distance i.e. optical nose position sensor generally detects an overrun condition e.g. when the nose extends inward such that the clamp dog is unable to properly engage the nose during a clamping process and presents an alert signal e.g. the over run position signal CSSM to the primary module control sub system and thus to the system control apparatus .

The selection of sensor type location orientation and aiming of the non contact e.g. optical nose position sensor may be determined through routine experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art to meet the design criteria of a particular application. Likewise non optical e.g. sonar capacitive and the like generally non contacting sensors may be implemented instead of optical sensors.

As described above in connection with the red and green LEDs and respectively are mounted to the side wall of the primary module to provide light beams that are visible through the UGV camera and may be seen by the UGV operator when driving a UGV into the primary module .

In one mode of operation when the second visual indicator emits a steady green light the primary module is generally ready and waiting for a UGV to be driven into position. When the second lever operated limit switch actuator is depressed the second visual indicator generally turns off and the first visual indicator generally steadily emits red light indicating that the UGV is properly longitudinally positioned.

When the overhead mounted IR distance sensor detects the presence of the vehicle the first and second visual indicators and begin flashing alternately thereby providing a visual alert to the operator User that an overrun condition has occurred. When the UGV operator reverses direction of the UGV and thus clears the overhead mounted IR distance sensor e.g. backs the UGV rearward out of the L O S the LED e.g. green light turns off and the LED e.g. red light illuminates steadily thereby signaling the UGV operator to stop driving.

Referring to isometric views from the upper rear left of the primary module in connection with the UGV and having the cover removed for clarity are shown. illustrate the vehicle at various stages of clamping and deployment extraction on the primary module . illustrates the vehicle clamped by the clamp arms and the clamp dog and stowed in an upright i.e. substantially vertical position in the primary module .

Referring to a broken out side sectional view of the primary module is shown. See also for example for added context. The primary module further comprises a first push button limit switch and a clamp dog net pad e.g. stop bumper rest check and the like . The first push button limit switch and the clamp dog stop are mounted inside the stowage compartment on the module base .

The clamp dog stop is generally threadably attached to the primary module base plate and adjusted to a height such that when the clamp dog reaches a substantially horizontal position the clamp dog stop will prevent further travel e.g. hard stop of the clamp dog .

The first push button limit switch is generally electrically connected coupled to the primary module control sub system to provide a feedback signal e.g. a version of the signal CSSM that may indicate the position of the clamp dog . In particular the first push button limit switch is mounted in a position such that the first push button limit switch is actuated by the clamp dog when the clamp dog is in an essentially horizontal position and substantially simultaneously contacts the clamp dog stop .

Referring to an isometric view from the upper left rear of a shuttle assembly is shown. The shuttle assembly comprises a shuttle tray a shuttle ramp block having a ramp region and a push face a pair of block restraint covers a pair of shuttle solenoid extension springs and a push solenoid .

The shuttle ramp block is generally positioned within the shuttle tray . The block restraint covers are mounted on either side of and atop the shuttle tray to constrain vertical and lateral movement of the shuttle ramp block . The solenoid extension springs are connected between i the shuttle tray near the push solenoid and ii the shuttle ramp block near the push face . The push solenoid is attached to a first generally forward end of the shuttle tray that is opposite the push face .

The shuttle ramp block is generally able to freely slide longitudinally inside of shuttle tray in response to fore aft forces generated by the push solenoid and the shuttle solenoid extension springs . The push solenoid is generally electrically connected coupled to the primary module control sub system and may receive one or more control signals CSSM. In response to the appropriate command control signal CSSM the push solenoid may push the shuttle ramp block in one direction e.g. slide rearward and in response to cessation of the command signal CSSM the shuttle solenoid extension springs may return e.g. slide forward the shuttle ramp block to a default position near the push solenoid .

Referring to broken out side sectional views from left to right of the primary module are shown. For clarity the shuttle solenoid extension springs are not shown. On the vehicle is in a clamped state within the primary module support tray which is in a partially lowered position. On the vehicle is in a clamped state within the primary module support tray which is in a substantially vertical position. See also for example A C and for added context.

The vehicle further comprises a push button power on off switch . The push button power on off switch generally cycles the battery power within the vehicle such that when the push button power on off switch is in the off position minimal vehicle battery power is utilized.

The clamp dog further comprises a clamp dog through hole e.g. lumen passage etc. that contains the switch plunger assembly . The switch plunger assembly comprises a plunger pin nose end and a plunger pin head end .

The push solenoid comprises a solenoid body and a solenoid actuation push rod e.g. pin pole etc. . The solenoid body includes an inductive coil that responds to the signal CSSM and has a cylindrical center through hole lumen that holds the solenoid actuation rod . The solenoid actuation rod generally pushes the shuttle ramp block longitudinally e.g. rearward in response to the command signal CSSM.

The clamp dog through hole is positioned on the body of the clamp dog such that the switch plunger assembly has the plunger pin nose end extending outward and downward from the body of the clamp dog when the clamp dog is in a completely open position and has the plunger head is essentially flush or slightly recessed from the clamping surface of the clamp dog .

The switch plunger assembly is mounted in the clamp dog through hole to align with the push button power on off switch when the clamp dog is in a clamped position on the nose of the vehicle . Such an alignment generally provides capability for the switch plunger assembly to contact the UGV power switch when the UGV is clamped and stowed vertically within the primary module . Having the plunger pin nose end extend beyond the clamp dog generally provides for depression of the switch plunger assembly by an external mechanical device e.g. the shuttle ramp as described below .

The shuttle assembly is generally is mounted within a pocket e.g. cutout hole relief etc. in the primary module base plate . The shuttle ramp is generally wedge shaped so that when the clamp dog is clamped on the nose and the vehicle is stowed in a vertical position a longitudinal rearward motion of the solenoid actuation rod is translated to vertical motion of the switch plunger assembly in a cam follower like motion. The combined action from the shuttle assembly the switch plunger assembly and clamp dog act in concert to provide power management that is to depress the power switch of the UGV when the UGV is clamped and stowed thus the power to the UGV may be toggled on and off conserving battery power when the vehicle is at an idle mode.

The primary module support tray and the clamp dog are generally shaped and sized to provide alignment of the UGV in particular the vehicle nose to the clamping dog laterally and longitudinally when the primary module support tray is tilted to the vertical position. The primary module support tray is generally shaped and sized e.g. the distance between the walls the height of the walls the width and height of the center hump the height of the clamp dog stop etc. are selected such that when the primary support module is in a substantially horizontal position e.g. as illustrated on the clamp dog rests below the plane of the UGV support tray center hump thereby providing a clear path for the UGV to traverse.

The mechanical coupling of the UGV support tray to the lift linear actuator as well as coupling of the clamping linear actuator to the intermediate shaft subsequent coupling of the clamp arms and the clamping dog to the intermediate shaft and hard stops built into the system generally provide the capability for the primary module to clamp lift stow deploy unclamp and clear the UGV for travel in and out of the modular handling and stowage system .

Referring to a block electrical schematic diagram of the control circuitry i.e. a section of the system control apparatus related to control of the master primary full function module is shown. The primary module control sub system comprises the supervisory modules controller the individual master primary module controller  PM a clamping linear actuator motor controller a lifting linear actuator motor controller and a primary module controller printed circuit board PCB  PM.

The individual primary module controller  PM generally comprises unique programming that is software and or firmware that may be different that the software that is implemented in connection with the secondary module individual controllers . The individual primary module controller  PM further comprises electrical coupling e.g. connections links communication etc. to the lifting linear actuator the clamping linear actuator the supervisory modules controller the clamping linear actuator motor controller the lifting linear actuator motor controller and the primary module controller printed circuit board .

The individual primary module controller  PM is generally electrically coupled to the first visual indicator the second visual indicator the IR distance sensor the first lever operated limit switch the second lever operated limit switch the clamp dog position push button limit switch i.e. the first push button limit switch and the push solenoid assembly via the primary module controller printed circuit board .

The primary individual motor controller  PM may be linked to the co located supervisory modules controller through the serial communications link . When the system includes one or more of the secondary modules the primary individual motor controller  PM may be linked to the secondary module control sub systems via the serial communications link .

A method e.g. steps processes operations blocks tasks and the like having designation numbers 3000 and higher may be implemented for the user to perform extracting and storing and deploying operations of at least one of the vehicle in connection with the modular handling and stowage system . Embodiments of the methodology are as follows.

Step The UGV is driven into the primary module . This is typically done through remote control operation of the system control apparatus by the UGV operator User. 

Step The UGV activates the second lever operated limit switch signaling the operator User via the first visual indicator e.g. red LED when the over run signal is absent that the vehicle is in position for stowage and initiating the UGV stowage operation.

Step The clamping linear actuator rotates the rocker cantilevers which are coupled to the intermediate shaft via the spring loaded slider plates thereby rotating the intermediate shaft which substantially simultaneously moves the clamp arm link bars and clamp arm link fingers and essentially simultaneously rotates the first and second clamping arms to clamp the UGV tracks into place against module tray assembly and essentially simultaneously positions the clamping dog into place against the UGV nose until positional feedback e.g. the signal CSSM is presented by the clamping linear actuator indicating that the clamped position has been reached is received. The clamp dog position first push button limit switch signals that the clamp dog has moved from the horizontal position.

Step The individual motor controller  PM powers off the clamping linear actuator and powers on the lifting linear actuator .

Step The lifting linear actuator retracts thereby pulling the lift arm and rotating the main drive shaft thus causing the primary module support tray assembly and payload e.g. the UGV support tray the clamp arms the clamp dog and the UGV to rotate from a horizontal or depressed below horizontal position to a substantially vertical position around the main shaft axis until the clamp dog push button first limit switch is closed and rotation stops. The primary tray position limit switch i.e. the first lever operated limit switch signals that the primary module support tray has moved from the horizontal position.

Step When the clamp dog first push button limit switch closes the signal e.g. an appropriate signal CSSM is communicated presented to the lifting linear actuator motor controller which in response to the signal CSSM stops the lifting linear actuator from rotating the module main drive shaft and a signal CSSM is presented via the system control apparatus to the operator that UGV is stowed.

Step The supervisory modules controller receives the command signal CSSM to deploy the UGV that is stowed within the primary module from the User via the system control apparatus .

Step The module lifting linear actuator extends thereby pushing the lift arm and rotating the main drive shaft which substantially simultaneously causes the entire primary module tray system including the UGV which is stowed thereon to rotate as a unit from a vertical to deployed position around the main shaft .

Step The coupled rotational motion of the primary module tray assembly the first and second clamp arms the clamp dog and the UGV loaded thereon around the main shaft is generally maintained until the module tray assembly position limit switch contacts the ramp mounting surface or other surface of the host platform anywhere from horizontal to a negative 30 degree depression angle. The tray position limit switch i.e. the first lever operated limit switch presents the status signal CSSM to the primary module motor controller  PM that the primary module tray assembly is in the deployment position and primary module lifting linear actuator stops extending.

Step The primary module clamping linear actuator retracts thereby rotating the rocker cantilever which essentially simultaneously moves the clamp arm link bars and the clamp arm link fingers and thereby substantially simultaneously rotates the first and second clamp arms to unclamp the first and second clamp arms from the UGV tracks and position the first and second clamp arms clear of the UGV ingress and egress path while substantially simultaneously positioning the clamp dog into a horizontal position. Depending on the depression angle of the primary module support tray the first and second clamp arms may reach the limits of an unclamped position before the clamp dog is horizontal. When the first and second clamp arms reach the limits of an unclamped position before the clamp dog is horizontal the first and second clamp arms generally stop moving while the torsion springs that couple the rotation of the intermediate shaft to the cantilever rockers will begin loading e.g. torsional force on the torsion springs may increase until the clamp dog reaches the horizontal position. The clamp dog first limit switch presents the status signal CSSM to the primary module individual motor controller  PM indicating that the clamp dog is in the open position.

Step The tray position limit switch i.e. the first lever operated limit switch in combination with the clamp dog first push button limit switch present status signals CS SM to the primary module individual motor controller  PM indicating that the tray assembly is in the horizontal or otherwise deployed position and that the clamp dog is in the fully open position.

Step The UGV is driven out of the primary container . Control of the vehicle is typically performed through remote control by the UGV operator User via the system control apparatus .

In accordance with the description of the operation and processes that are generally implemented in connection with the primary module the following signals e.g. the signal Control Status Msg or CSSM may be presented to from the system control apparatus 

a primary extract signal e.g. command that is presented via the OCU when extraction of the vehicle and stowage within the primary module is desired 

a primary deploy signal that is presented via the OCU when deployment of the vehicle from the primary module is desired 

a primary tray deployed position e.g. status signal presented via the primary tray lever operated limit switch indicating that the primary module support tray is in the deployed position 

a primary nose position signal that is presented via the primary nose position limit switch when the nose reaches the clamping position 

a primary clamp dog horizontal position signal that is presented via the primary clamp dog limit switch indicating that the primary clamp dog is fully open 

a primary over run position signal that is presented via the primary optical nose position sensor when the nose of the vehicle exceeds the clamping position 

a clamping linear actuator position feedback signal that is presented by the clamping linear actuator when the primary clamp dog rests against the nose 

a primary clamp dog off horizontal position signal that is presented via the primary clamp dog limit switch indicating that the primary clamp dog has moved from the horizontal position 

a primary tray off deployed position signal that is presented via the primary tray lever operated limit switch indicating that the primary module support tray has moved from the deployed position 

a vehicle primary stored status signal that is presented via the primary individual module motor controller  PM when i the primary tray lever operated limit switch indicates that the primary module support tray has moved from the deployed position and ii the primary clamp dog limit switch indicates that the primary clamp dog has moved from the horizontal position thereby indicating that the vehicle is stored in the primary module and

a primary power control e.g. command signal that is presented via the OCU when the primary shuttle switching assembly is actuated thereby toggle switching the vehicle battery power on and off.

Elements of the secondary module are generally implemented similarly to the like numbered elements of the primary module . For clarity the similarly implemented elements may be referred to by a preceeding primary or secondary indicator adjective as would understood by one of skill in the art. As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art differences between the primary module and the secondary module are described in detail below in connection with the referenced Figures.

Referring to an isometric view from the lower left rear of one of the secondary modules of the modular handling and stowage system is shown. The secondary module comprises the base plate the shroud cover the wall partition the left and right bearing support flanges L and R respectively the actuator plate and the secondary module UGV support tray assembly .

In contrast to the primary module support tray of the primary module which generally may be lowered to about 30 degrees below the horizontal plane the secondary module support tray is sized to grasp clamp and rotate a selected UGV from a essentially horizontal to vertical position for stowage and from a vertical to horizontal position for deployment. In further contrast to the primary module support tray the secondary module support tray does not include the left and right ramp extensions .

However the secondary module support tray further comprises support leg stops e.g. net pads rests bumpers checks etc. e.g. left and right support leg stops L and R respectively and the top of the support tray center hump includes a tray relief e.g. cutout notch etc. at the edge of the secondary module support tray that is distal to the main drive shaft . The support leg stops are located at the inner edges of the tray relief at the edge of the secondary module support tray that is distal to the main drive shaft . The support leg stops are mounted on the bottom of the secondary module support tray and are generally aligned with the module tray support arms . Referring back to the stops generally rest atop the aligned adjacent module tray support arms when the primary support tray and the one or more secondary support trays are in a deployed mode.

The secondary module is generally shaped sized and otherwise configured to matingly connect to the primary module and another secondary module via the draw latch clasp and hook assemblies. As such in one example a typical secondary module for the selected UGV may have an overall size envelope of 29 tall by 32 wide by 13 deep.

Referring to an isometric view from the rear upper right of the secondary module is shown. Note that the shroud is shown removed for clarity. The secondary module implements the components within the operation mechanism compartment similarly to the implementation of the primary module however the secondary sub system controller is implemented in connection with the single lifting linear actuator .

As described in more detail below the secondary module further comprises two lug arms e.g. left and right lug arms L and R respectively that are rigidly linked fixed to the main drive shaft and generally maintain hold constrain the positions of the clamping dog and UGV support tray axially along the main drive shaft i.e. laterally in the secondary module .

Referring to an isometric view from the left upper front of a broken out portion of the secondary module illustrated on is shown and also referring to whereon sectional side views of the secondary module taken at line 30 30 of with the vehicle included on the secondary module support tray with the secondary module support tray is at a substantially horizontal position are shown. illustrate operation of the clamp dog and associated elements during a closing opening i.e. clamping unclamping operation on the front of the vehicle i.e. the nose in response to an appropriate control signal. In particular illustrates the clamp dog in a fully open i.e. raised up etc. position illustrates the clamp dog in a partially open partially closed i.e. intermediate position and illustrates the clamp dog in a fully closed clamped position i.e. the clamp dog clamped on the UGV nose .

The clamping and lifting mechanisms that are implemented on the secondary support tray in connection with the base generally comprise the main drive shaft the intermediate drive shaft the support tray lift arms the clamp dog including the clamp dog lugs the cantilever rockers a secondary cantilever rocker pin the rocker cross pin three of the arc shaped clamp links e.g. left center and right clamp links L C and R respective and the lug arms .

The clamping and lifting mechanisms that are implemented on the secondary support tray in connection with the base further comprise arm spring retention posts e.g. left and right spring retention posts L and R respectively base spring retention posts e.g. left and right spring retention posts L and R respectively a tray rod compression spring tray arm extension springs e.g. left and right tray arm extension springs L and R respectively a lug arm to link pin a guide rod a support tray clearance hole and a second push button limit switch .

The lug arms are laterally located between the clamp dog lugs and the support tray lift arms . The cantilever rockers are fixed non rotatably to the intermediate shaft at the first hole. The rocker cross pin extends laterally through the second hole in the cantilever rockers . The secondary cantilever rocker pin extends laterally through the third hole in the secondary cantilever rockers .

The clamp link C is generally pivotably rotatably pinned at a first end by the rocker cross pin between the cantilever rockers and is generally rotatably pinned through the holes in the clamp dog legs at the second end. The clamp links L and R are generally pivotably rotatably pinned at a first end by the secondary cantilever rocker pin outboard of the cantilever rockers and are generally rotatably pinned through holes in the lug arms at the second end via the lug arm to link pin .

The guide rod is generally rotatably pinned at a first end by the cantilever rocker pin inboard of the cantilever rockers and the second end of the guide rod generally extends freely slidably in through the clearance hole in the secondary UGV support tray . The clearance hole is substantially centrally located in a vertical laterally oriented flange on the bottom of the secondary UGV support tray .

As illustrated on when in response to an appropriate clamping control signal CSSM the lifting linear actuator extends and the combination of the clamp links the cantilever rockers and the intermediate shaft convert translate rotary motion of the main drive shaft to opposite rotary motion of the clamping dog such that when viewed along the axis of the main drive shaft i.e. laterally right to left clockwise rotation of the main drive shaft is converted to counter clockwise rotation of the clamping dog about the main drive shaft . Conversely when the lifting linear actuator retracts counter clockwise rotation of the main drive shaft is converted to clockwise rotation of the clamping dog about the main drive shaft .

The clamping operation to clamp the tracks via the clamp arms is implemented in connection with the secondary module similarly to the clamping operation as shown for example on FIGS. and A C and described above in connection with the primary module .

Through the coupling described above in connection with and A C motion of the clamp arms and the clamping dog are directly controlled by extension and retraction of the lifting linear actuator that is implemented in connection with the secondary module .

Referring to a left upper rearward isometric view of a broken portion of the secondary module is illustrated without a vehicle and with the secondary module support tray in the horizontal position is shown. Also referring back to the tray rod compression spring is installed coaxially over the guide rod and is captured between the cantilever rockers and the secondary module UGV support tray at the clearance hole . When viewed from right to left clockwise rotation of the intermediate drive shaft generally compresses the tray rod compression spring and likewise counter clockwise rotation of the intermediate drive shaft generally relieves compression of the tray rod compression spring .

The arm spring retention posts are mounted on the inboard sides of the lift arms on the extension legs that extend beyond the holes for the main drive shaft opposite the tray portion of the secondary support tray . The base spring retention posts are mounted vertically to the base outboard of and near the shuttle assembly . The tray arm extension springs are attached hooked at first and second ends between the arm spring retention posts and the base spring retention posts .

When viewed from right to left clockwise rotation of the secondary UGV support tray from horizontal to vertical about the main drive shaft produces extension of the tray arm extension springs . The tray rod compression spring and the tray arm extension springs are generally selected and sized to act in unison and provide counterbalancing to prevent the clamping arms and the clamp dog from opening e.g. unclamping until the secondary UGV support tray is in a substantially horizontal position and the support leg stops contact the UGV support tray lift arms of the adjacent module or at a so called hard stop . See also .

The first and second visual indicators and and the distance sensor are generally implemented similarly in connection with the secondary module as implemented in connection with the primary module . See for example and the related descriptions above.

The secondary module e.g. the secondary module support tray does not implement a first lever operated limit switch . The second lever operated limit switch is generally implemented similarly in connection with the secondary module as implemented in connection with the primary module . See for example and the related description above.

The clamping dog and associated position related circuitry are generally implemented similarly in connection with the secondary module as implemented in connection with the primary module . Likewise the shuttle assembly is generally implemented similarly in connection with the secondary module as implemented in connection with the primary module . See for example and the related description above.

Referring to a side elevation sectional view taken at line 32 32 on is shown and also referring back to the second push button limit switch is generally mounted to the module base plate . The second push button limit switch is generally connected coupled electrically to the secondary sub system controller to provide positional feedback with respect to the secondary module support tray . The second push button limit switch is generally aligned at an angle and position such that the second push button limit switch is activated by contact of the leg extension R on the UGV support tray lift arm R when the UGV support tray is in a substantially horizontal e.g. deployed position.

Referring to isometric views from the upper rear left of the secondary module in connection with the UGV and having the cover removed for clarity are shown. illustrate the vehicle at various stages of clamping and deployment extraction on the secondary module . The mechanical coupling of the main drive shaft to the intermediate drive shaft subsequent coupling of the clamp arms and the clamping dog to the intermediate drive shaft built in hard stops and the counterbalancing performed by the tray rod compression spring and the tray arm extension springs allow the secondary module to clamp lift stow deploy unclamp and clear the UGV for travel through the secondary modules using the lift linear actuator i.e. without the clamping linear actuator that is implemented in the primary module .

Referring to a block electrical schematic diagram of the control circuitry i.e. a section of the system control apparatus related to control of the secondary module is shown. The secondary module control sub system comprises the individual slave secondary module controller the lifting linear actuator motor controller and a secondary module controller printed circuit board PCB 

The secondary module controller generally comprises unique programming that is software and or firmware that may be different that the software that is implemented in connection with the primary module controller  PM . The secondary module controller further comprises electrical coupling e.g. connections links communication etc. to the lifting linear actuator the lifting linear actuator motor controller and the secondary module controller printed circuit board . The secondary module controller further comprises electrical coupling to the primary module i.e. the primary individual motor controller  PM via the serial communications link .

The secondary module controller is generally electrically coupled to the first visual indicator the second visual indicator the IR distance sensor the second lever operated limit switch the clamp dog position push button limit switch i.e. the first push button limit switch the second push button limit switch and the push solenoid assembly via the secondary module controller printed circuit board

Step The UGV is driven into the secondary module . This is typically done through remote control operation of the system control apparatus by the UGV operator User. 

Step The UGV activates the second lever operated limit switch signaling the operator User via the first visual indicator e.g. red LED that the vehicle is in position for stowage and when the over run signal is absent initiating the UGV stowage operation.

Step The lift linear drive actuator retracts and thereby rotates the main drive shaft and the main drive shaft substantially simultaneously rotates the rocker cantilever and the intermediate shaft . Rotation of the intermediate shaft essentially simultaneously moves the linkages L and R and C and thereby decompresses the tray rod compression spring which is positioned on the guide rod between rocker cantilever and secondary tray assembly . Rotation of the intermediate shaft also essentially simultaneously rotates the left and right secondary clamping arms to clamp the UGV tracks into place against the module tray assembly and substantially simultaneously positions the clamping dog into place against the UGV body nose via a cantilever motion that is reverse to and opposite the rotation of the main drive shaft . That is the rotations of the clamp dog and the cantilever rocker assembly are generally in opposite directions to each other. The clamp dog limit switch provides a signal CSS that generally indicates the clamp dog has moved from the horizontal position.

Step The clamp dog and the cantilever rocker assembly continue to rotate in opposite directions to each other until the rotational extension limit of the interconnecting linkages between the clamp dog and the counter rotating cantilever rocker assembly is reached e.g. a mechanical bind results . The entire UGV secondary support tray assembly including the clamp arms the clamp dog and the included UGV rotate from a horizontal to vertical position around the main drive shaft . The first and second counterbalance extension springs i.e. the left and right tray arm extension springs L and R that are connected between the module base plate and the secondary tray assembly are extended until the clamp dog i.e. the first push button limit switch is closed. When the first push button limit switch is closed a control signal CSSM is presented to the secondary module controller . In response to the control signal CSSM from the clamp dog limit switch retraction of the lifting linear actuator is stopped thereby rotation of the module main drive shaft is also stopped. The tray position limit switch i.e. the second push button limit switch presents a status signal CSSM to the secondary module controller that indicates the secondary module tray has moved from the horizontal position.

Step When the clamp dog limit switch closes the status signal CSSM is also presented via the system control apparatus indicating to the operator that the UGV is stowed.

Step The secondary module individual motor controller receives the command signal CSSM to deploy the UGV that is stowed within the secondary module from the User via the system control apparatus .

Step In response to the control signal CSSM the module lifting linear actuator extends thereby pushing the lift arm and rotating the main drive shaft which substantially simultaneously causes the entire secondary module tray system including the UGV which is stowed thereon to rotate as a unit from a vertical to deployed e.g. horizontal position around the main shaft . Substantially simultaneously the left and right tray arm extension springs L and R retract.

Step The coupled rotational motion of the secondary module tray assembly the first and second clamp arms and the clamp dog and the UGV loaded thereon around the main shaft is maintained until the secondary module tray assembly reaches a substantially horizontal position and contacts the tray position i.e. the second push button limit switch . Substantially simultaneously the mechanical stops rest against the adjacent module or module support tray and or i.e. the leg extensions respectively. Rotational motion of the secondary module tray and the UGV stored thereon is stopped. The tray position limit switch presents a status signal CSSM to the module motor controller that indicates the secondary tray assembly is in the horizontal position.

Step The module linear drive actuator continues to extend thereby rotating the main drive shaft which substantially simultaneously rotates the rocker cantilever . The rocker cantilever in turn essentially simultaneously moves the linkage L R and C thereby compressing the tray rod compression spring . The rotating main drive shaft also substantially simultaneously rotates the first and second clamp arms to an unclamped position away from the UGV tracks and clear of the UGV ingress and egress path on the secondary tray . Further the rotating main drive shaft also substantially simultaneously positions the clamp dog into a substantially horizontal position via a cantilever motion that is reverse to and opposite the rotation of the main drive shaft . The clamp dog limit switch presents a signal CSS to the module motor controller that generally indicates that the clamp dog has moved to the open position.

Stated alternatively the module linear drive actuator continues to extend and thereby continues to rotate the module main drive shaft . The clamp dog and the cantilever rocker to rotate in opposite directions to each other and compress the tray rod compression spring until the tray position limit switch closes. The closed tray position limit switch command signal CSSM in combination with the clamp dog limit switch signal CSSM that are presented to the secondary module motor controller produces a command signal CSSM from the secondary module motor controller to stop the lift linear drive actuator thereby stopping the motion of the first and second clamp arms the clamp dog the rocker cantilever and the main drive shaft .

Step The tray position limit switch in combination with the clamp dog limit switch presents a status signal CSSM to the secondary module motor controller that the secondary tray assembly is in the horizontal position and that the clamp dog is in the fully open position.

Step The UGV is driven out of the secondary container . Control of the vehicle is typically performed through remote control by the UGV operator User via the system control apparatus .

In accordance with the description of the operation and processes that are generally implemented in connection with the secondary module the following signals e.g. the signal Control Status Msg or CSSM may be presented to from the system control apparatus 

a secondary extract signal that is presented via the OCU when extraction of the vehicle and stowage within the secondary module is desired 

a secondary deploy signal that is presented via the OCU when deployment of the vehicle from the secondary module is desired 

a secondary tray deployed position signal that is presented via the secondary tray limit switch when the secondary module support tray reaches the deployed position 

a secondary nose position signal that is presented via the secondary nose position limit switch when the nose reaches the clamping position 

a secondary clamp dog horizontal position signal that is presented via the secondary clamp dog limit switch when the secondary clamp dog reaches the horizontal position 

a secondary over run position signal that is presented via the secondary optical nose position sensor when the nose of the vehicle exceeds the clamping position 

a secondary clamp dog off horizontal position signal that is presented via the secondary clamp dog limit switch indicating that the secondary clamp dog has moved from the horizontal position

a vehicle secondary stored status signal that is presented via the secondary module motor controller when i the secondary tray limit switch indicates that the secondary module support tray has moved from the deployed position and ii the secondary clamp dog limit switch indicates that the secondary clamp dog has moved from the horizontal position thereby indicating that the vehicle is stored in the secondary module and

a secondary power control signal that is presented via the OCU to actuate the secondary shuttle switching assembly thereby toggle switching the vehicle battery power on and off.
