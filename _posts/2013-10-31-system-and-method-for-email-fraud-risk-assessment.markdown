This present application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61 730 372 filed Nov. 27 2012.

An email address identifies a particular box to which email messages are electronically delivered. Today email messages and email addresses have become the primary digital identification and communication channel between people companies and customers. Email communications are relied on to conduct business and to communicate with customers regarding offers or updates to their accounts or services. As email communication has gained widespread use so too has the occurrence of fraudulent email addresses. Because of the prevalent use of email communication for important and sensitive matters the accuracy and validity of current and prospective customer email addresses is of utmost importance.

The validation of email address data is an important component when assessing the fraud risk associated with an email address and data normalization. The solution is found in the present disclosure that comprises a system and methodology for email address fraud risk assessment that collects data elements associated with email addresses from numerous sources validates and verifies existence of email addresses calculates and describes the fraud risk indicators for the email addresses.

The present disclosure is directed to a system and methodology that satisfies the need to collect data elements associated with email addresses from numerous sources validate and verify existence of email addresses and to calculate and describe fraud risk indicators for email addresses. In some implementations email addresses may be verified and validated in queued mode batch processing real time or any other applicable processing methodology.

Implementations of the system and method disclosed herein may provide numerous benefits and advantages for data verification thereby providing greater confidence in the validity and credibility of email data and applications using email address data sets. Email address fraud risk assessment and credibility rating is an innovative and efficient way to confirm the existence of an email address and assess the fraud risk associated with it. This determination in turn can be used to prevent and detect fraud to serve as an additional layer of protection against fraud incidents such as for example for new applications of financial products or services and in many other areas involving commerce and online transactions.

As shown in a system and method to assess the email addresses fraud risk is disclosed. Determination of email addresses fraud risk includes verifying the address comparing and matching it against preexistent lists with both historical and fraud information and collecting data elements for the domain and local portions of the address. The data elements may be acquired from internal and external data sources each data element is then assigned a value corresponding to a predetermined scale. By computing the data element values a Fraud Risk Score is then determined and returned to the user along with additional data elements linked to the email.

One of skill in the art will recognize that the methods of the present disclosure may be implemented as one or more software processes executable by one or more processors and or one or more firmware applications. The processes and or firmware are configured to operate on one or more general purpose microprocessors or controllers a field programmable gate array FPGA an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other hardware capable of performing the actions describe above. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a CPU executes software processes to perform the actions of the present disclosure. Additionally the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.

It is also to be understood that the methods may be employed with any form of memory device including all forms of sequential pseudo random and random access storage devices. Storage devices as known within the current art include all forms of random access memory magnetic and optical tape magnetic and optical disks along with various other forms of solid state mass storage devices. The current invention applies to all forms and manners of memory devices including but not limited to storage devices utilizing magnetic optical and chemical techniques or any combination thereof.

In a preferred embodiment of the present system and method the existence of an email address may be validated via the collection of data elements from various data sources as illustrated in . The data sources may include but are not limited to contacting an external data sources or internal data sources. Examples of contacting an external data source include sending an inquiry to an Email Service Provider ESP or using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP or cross referencing the email address via social media networks and services search engines and API s or publicly accessible services such as those available through a query and response protocol. Examples of an internal data source include proprietary or non proprietary database of local Domains information which can store data such as an email repository with historical information as well as a domain name blacklist associated with previously discovered fraudulent email addresses. The internal data may also include a list of email addresses that is managed by the system or when the user has manually marked as fraudulent or credible. This data may then be accessed during implementation of the present disclosure to prevent recurring examination of an email address. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any additional sources of email data may also be used by implementations of the system.

In an embodiment of the present disclosure once an email address has been obtained by the system the authentication and verification process begins by querying a proprietary or non proprietary database to determine whether any information has previously been collected regarding the email address. If the email address is found in the database with a positive status or is certified wherein the email address has been determined to exist and has a recorded creation date the process may end at this stage and the information from the database will be used. Otherwise in some implementations the system may move to an additional stage to collect more details about the email address.

The external data source inquiry may be sent to one or more Email Service Providers ESP to verify when the email address was created. If the information is retrieved successfully the best available email creation date may be set as the member since date of the account which means the date when the email account was created. If no or if inadequate information is found for the email address in the ESP stage in some implementations the process may moves to a the next external data source.

A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP query for an email creation date may also be used to validate the existence of an email address. If the email address is determined to exist or if for any reason the system is not able to get reasonable and reliable information from this service the data sourcing process may then progress to an additional stage.

One or more inquiries may be sent to large external data repositories as well as corporate and social media services to determine the first time the email address has appeared in one or more sources. A combination of the first posting date associated with the email address and the creation date of the external data repositories and corporate and social media accounts may be used as the Email First Seen Date. If information is found for the email address in one or more sources the system may select the oldest and most reliable information and may move to an additional step in the verification process. If no information is found the next stage may be entered without a previous email first seen date.

In another embodiment of the present disclosure the email address is searched using one or more search engine services. From the results of a query in one or multiple search engines the date of the first record associated with the email address may be used as the Email First Seen Date and the process may move to another step. If no information is found for the email address via any of the queried search engines services the process may move to the next stage without a search engine email first seen date.

In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure information for the email domain may be collected using a query and response protocol or publicly available services such as for example Whois. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that an implementation of the disclosed method may be conducted in any order.

The following is a list of possible data elements and their respective definition that may be captured through various steps implemented in the present disclosure 

After verification and data element collection for each email address an optional prioritization process may be initiated. The prioritization process may be conducted to sort the data element information from most to least important. An example of such a prioritization order may appear as 1 email address found on proprietary database and flagged as certified 2 ESP has provided account information 3 the oldest email activity date was found on social media and on search engines and 4 domain details captured via a database of domain names and other publicly available services. It should be recognized that any other priority order may also be used and that this priority order may be customized to tailor the results according to user preferences.

A scoring logic is then implemented to compute a Fraud Risk Score of each email address the computation may take place on a user computing device . To determine the Fraud Risk Score a value is assigned to each data element. The value is based on a predetermined or user specified scale that takes into account the type and source of the data element information. The following provides an example of a scale that may be used to assign a Fraud Risk Score and shows the score on the left with an exemplary characteristic that an email address may have to be assigned such a score listed on the right 

While the above example provides a scale in which a higher Fraud Risk Score indicates a higher likelihood of an email address being unreliable and or fraudulent one of ordinary skill in the art would also recognize that a numeric or other scale may be used in which a lower Fraud Risk Score indicates a higher likelihood that the email address is fraudulent.

As illustrated in a graphical user interface may display the Fraud Risk Score for each email address. In addition to the Fraud Risk Score a description or explanations for the particular Fraud Risk Score of each email address may be displayed to assist the user understand the results. The description or explanation takes into consideration information collected during the verification and data element search. The following is an example of messages that may be displayed 

The graphical user interface may also display a recommendation based on one or more threshold limits directly related to the risk associated with an email address. For example if a Fraud Risk Score is greater than or equal to 800 the system may display a message such as Fraud Review or Review for Potential Fraud Risk indicating that the user may wish to further investigate the authenticity of the email address. In another example if a Fraud Risk Score between 450 and 550 is assigned the system may display a message such as Unclear Risk or Unclear Risk at this point due to limited email history indicating that the user may wish to undertake further process steps in an attempt to further verify the email address. In yet another example if a Fraud Risk Score is less than or equal to 300 the system may display a message such as Low Fraud Risk or Low Fraud Risk due to email history indicating that the user may have a high degree of confidence that the email address is credible.

In places where the description above refers to particular implementations of computerized systems and methods for email fraud risk assessment and credibility rating it should be readily apparent that a number of modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof and that these implementations may be applied to other embodiments of email risk assessment and credibility rating systems and methods

All features disclosed in this specification including any accompanying claim abstract and drawings may be replaced by alternative features serving the same equivalent or similar purpose unless expressly stated otherwise. Thus unless expressly stated otherwise each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features.

Any element in a claim that does not explicitly state means for performing a specified function or step for performing a specific function is not to be interpreted as a means or step clause as specified in 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6. In particular the use of step of in the claims herein is not intended to invoke the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 112 paragraph 6.
