The lance is formed to prevent the receptacle contact from being removed. The lance is formed so as to extend from the lower surface of the top plate in the inserting direction D in a cantilever shape. A lance claw is formed at the free end of the lance .

The bottom plate has an upper surface . The upper surface is a surface that faces the top plate . An interference part insertion groove is formed on the upper surface . The interference part insertion groove is formed on the counter inserting direction side of the upper surface . The upper side and the counter inserting direction side of the interference part insertion groove are opened.

The left inner wall surface is an inner wall surface that defines the bolting section counter protruding direction side of the interference part insertion groove . The right inner wall surface and the left inner wall surface are opposed to each other. Therefore the gap between the right inner wall surface and left inner wall surface gradually decreases in the inserting direction D.

In this exemplary embodiment as indicated by broken lines in the contact insertion hole is formed by the lower surface of the top plate the upper surface of the bottom plate the right press fit holding surface of the right press fit holding part and the left press fit holding surface of the left press fit holding part .

The mating section is formed so as to protrude from the housing main body in the inserting direction D in a roughly rectangular tube shape. As shown in the mating section provides a mating space S in which the plug connector is received. On a mating top plate of the mating section a lance locking surface locking part on which a locking claw of the lance of the plug housing of the plug connector shown in is caught is formed.

As shown in the receptacle contact is formed by a metal plate M having a somewhat large thickness. As described previously the receptacle contact includes the bolting section and the accommodated section . Specifically the receptacle contact includes an interference part in addition to the bolting section and the accommodated section . The accommodated section includes a held part a tip part and a base end part . The bolting section is roughly in parallel with the accommodated section in the thickness direction. The thickness direction of each of the bolting section and the accommodated section is in parallel with the central axis direction. Further the thickness direction of the interference part is perpendicular to that of the base end part and the like. The thickness direction of the interference part is in parallel with the lengthwise direction. The base end part the held part and the tip part are arranged in this listed order in the inserting direction D.

The held part is a part that is accommodated in the contact insertion hole of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in and held by the housing main body of the receptacle housing . As shown in the held part includes a right bulging part bulging in the bolting section protruding direction and a left bulging part bulging in the bolting section counter protruding direction. The right bulging part and the left bulging part are formed near the tip part . Note that the width in the crosswise direction of the contact insertion hole between the right press fit holding surface of the right press fit holding part and the left press fit holding surface of the left press fit holding part shown in is adjusted so as to be slightly smaller than the width in the crosswise direction of the held part including the right bulging part and the left bulging part shown in .

The tip part is a part that protrudes from the held part in the inserting direction D and is capable of coming into contact with the plug contact of the plug connector see .

The base end part is a part that protrudes from the held part in the counter inserting direction. The base end part has a right shoulder surface and a left shoulder surface . The right shoulder surface is located on the bolting section protruding direction side relative to the held part and faces in the inserting direction D. The left shoulder surface is located on the bolting section counter protruding direction side relative to the held part and faces in the inserting direction D.

The bolting section is a part that protrudes from the base end part in the bolting section protruding direction. A bolt hole for bolting is formed in the bolting section .

As shown in the interference part is a part that protrudes from the base end part . The interference part protrudes in an obliquely downward direction with respect to the base end part . In this exemplary embodiment the interference part protrudes from the base end part in such a manner that the thickness direction of the interference part is roughly perpendicular to that of the base end part . That is the interference part is formed so as to protrude downward from the base end part . The interference part is disposed on the side opposite to the held part across the base end part . The thickness direction of the interference part is in parallel with the lengthwise direction. The interference part has a right end surface and a left end surface . The right end surface is an end surface that faces in the bolting section protruding direction. The left end surface is an end surface that faces in the bolting section counter protruding direction.

Further a lance locking hole is formed in the receptacle contact . The receptacle contact has a lance locking surface that defines the inserting direction D side of the lance locking hole . The lance locking surface is located at roughly the center of the held part in the lengthwise direction. In other words the lance locking surface on which the lance claw of the lance is caught is formed in the held part of the receptacle contact .

In order to assemble the receptacle connector as shown in the receptacle contact is firmly inserted into the gap g of the receptacle housing .

As a result the right shoulder surface and the left shoulder surface of the base end part of the receptacle contact shown in are brought into contact with the right contact insertion restricting surface of the right press fit holding part and the left contact insertion restricting surface of the left press fit holding part respectively of the receptacle housing shown in thus preventing the receptacle contact from being inserted in the gap g of the receptacle housing any further.

In the state shown in the held part of the receptacle contact is press fitted into the contact insertion hole of the receptacle housing so that the held part is held by the receptacle housing . Specifically by press fitting the held part of the receptacle contact into the contact insertion hole the held part is caught in the receptacle housing in the crosswise direction and consequently is held by the receptacle housing . More specifically in the state shown in the right bulging part of the held part of the receptacle contact shown in bites into the right press fit holding surface of the right press fit holding part of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in . Similarly the left bulging part of the held part of the receptacle contact shown in bites into the left press fit holding surface of the left press fit holding part of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in . In this manner as the held part of the receptacle contact is press fitted into the contact insertion hole of the receptacle housing the held part of the receptacle contact is restrained in the receptacle housing in the lengthwise direction and in the crosswise direction.

Further in the state shown in the interference part of the receptacle contact is press fitted into the interference part insertion groove of the receptacle housing . More specifically the right end surface of the interference part of the receptacle contact shown in bites into the right inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in . Similarly the left end surface of the interference part of the receptacle contact shown in bites into the left inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in . In this manner as the interference part of the receptacle contact is press fitted into the interference part insertion groove of the receptacle housing the interference part of the receptacle contact is restrained in the receptacle housing in the lengthwise direction and in the crosswise direction.

Further in the state shown in the receptacle contact is locked by the lance of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . More specifically the lance claw of the lance of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in has penetrated into the lance locking hole of the receptacle contact shown in . As a result the lance claw of the lance of the housing main body of the receptacle housing shown in faces the lance locking surface of the lance locking hole of the receptacle contact shown in . In this manner since the lance claw of the lance of the housing main body of the receptacle housing is caught on the lance locking surface of the lance locking hole of the receptacle contact the held part of the receptacle contact is held by the receptacle housing . This prevents the problem that the receptacle housing could be pulled out in the inserting direction D from the receptacle contact fixed to the battery when for example the connecting cable is accidentally pulled.

Further in the state shown in the tip part of the receptacle contact is located inside the mating space S of the mating section of the receptacle housing as shown in . The bolting section of the receptacle contact is located on the bolting section protruding direction side relative to the receptacle housing .

Further in the state shown in the lengthwise direction F of the receptacle housing coincides with the tangent direction of an imaginary circle C centered on the bolt hole as viewed in the central axis direction as shown in . In other words the bolt hole is deviated from an imaginary extension of the lengthwise direction F of the receptacle housing as viewed in the central axis direction. That is an aspect shown in in which the bolt hole is located on the imaginary extension of the lengthwise direction F of the receptacle housing is excluded from the scope of this exemplary embodiment.

To attach the receptacle connector to the battery terminal unit of the battery shown in as shown in the battery post of the battery terminal unit of the battery is inserted into the bolt hole of the receptacle contact of the receptacle connector and then the nut is screwed on the battery post . In this way the connecting cable can be lead or wired from the front side of the battery .

In this bolting process in this exemplary embodiment as shown in the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector faces the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery . Specifically the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is capable of coming into contact with the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery . Further as shown in in the bolting process the lengthwise direction F of the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is roughly in parallel with the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery as viewed in the central axis direction. Further as shown in in the bolting process the lengthwise direction F of the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is roughly in parallel with the upper surface of the battery main body of the battery as viewed in the direction perpendicular to the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery .

Further to mate the plug connector shown in with the receptacle connector shown in the plug connector is inserted into the mating space S of the mating section of the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector . As a result the locking claw of the lance of the plug housing of the plug connector is caught on the lance locking surface of the mating section of the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector . By this action the plug connector is locked in the receptacle connector . By mating the plug connector with the receptacle connector as described above the plug contact of the plug connector comes into contact with the tip part of the receptacle contact of the receptacle connector . As a result the center conductor of the connecting cable main body of the connecting cable is connected to the battery post of the battery terminal unit of the battery .

Note that as shown in when the nut is screwed on the battery post of the battery terminal unit of the battery a clockwise torque T occurs in the receptacle contact of the receptacle connector . Therefore the receptacle connector tries to rotate in the clockwise direction. However since the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is caught on the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery the clockwise rotation of the receptacle connector is restricted. Note that the state in which the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is caught on the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery means a state in which the rotation of the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is prevented halfway through the rotation by the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery and hence cannot be advanced any further .

Further inside the receptacle connector as shown in the aforementioned torque T is received by the right press fit holding surface of the right press fit holding part of the housing main body of the receptacle housing and the left inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . Specifically when the torque T occurs the right bulging part of the held part of the receptacle contact is immediately received by the right press fit holding surface of the right press fit holding part of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . At the same time the interference part of the receptacle contact is received by the left inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . That is as the interference part of the receptacle contact tries to move relative to the receptacle housing in the bolting section counter protruding direction the interference part is received by the left inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . Therefore even when the torque T occurs the clockwise rotation of the receptacle contact with respect to the receptacle housing is reliably prevented.

On the other hand when the nut is loosened a counter clockwise torque occurs in the receptacle contact of the receptacle connector . Therefore the receptacle connector tries to rotate in the counter clockwise direction. However since the receptacle housing of the receptacle connector is caught on the right side surface of the battery main body of the battery the counter clockwise rotation of the receptacle connector is restricted.

Further inside the receptacle connector as shown in the aforementioned counter clockwise torque T is received by the left press fit holding surface of the left press fit holding part of the housing main body of the receptacle housing and the right inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . Specifically when the torque T occurs the left bulging part of the held part of the receptacle contact is immediately received by the left press fit holding surface of the left press fit holding part of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . At the same time the interference part of the receptacle contact is received by the right inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . That is as the interference part of the receptacle contact tries to move relative to the receptacle housing in the bolting section protruding direction the interference part is received by the right inner wall surface of the housing main body of the receptacle housing . Therefore even when the torque T occurs the counter clockwise rotation of the receptacle contact with respect to the receptacle housing is reliably prevented.

In this exemplary embodiment as shown in the receptacle connector includes a displacement restricting mechanism E that prevents the base end part of the receptacle contact from moving relative to the receptacle housing in the bolting section protruding direction or the bolting section counter protruding direction. Further the displacement restricting mechanism E is formed by the interference part and at least one of the right inner wall surface and the left inner wall surface
