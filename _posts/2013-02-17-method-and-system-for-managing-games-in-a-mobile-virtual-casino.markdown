A flow chart of a method for managing a virtual casino game is shown in . The method begins at block with launching a native application on a mobile device for virtual casino game. The virtual casino game is one of a plurality of virtual casino games on the native mobile application. Each of the plurality of virtual casino games comprises a button to launch the virtual casino game. At block a GPS location for the mobile communication device is determined by the GPS component of the mobile device. At block a secure connection is created over a network between the mobile communication device and a game server. At block an identity of the player on the mobile communication device is authenticated. At block an identity of the player and the location of the mobile communication device is transmitted from the mobile communication device to the game server. At block a geographical location for the mobile communication device is requested from a communications network operator for the mobile communication device. At block the game server determines if the GPS location and the geographical location are within a predetermined tolerance. At block a user interface of the mobile game is transmitted from the game server to the mobile communications device over the network. At block an action of the player and a wager is packaged and transmitted from the mobile device to the game server. At block the player is authenticated and sufficient credit for the wager at a database of a loyalty site is confirmed by the game server.

On an IPHONE device from Apple Inc. the UDID or Unique Device Identifier is a combination of forty numbers and letters and is set by Apple and stays with the device forever.

On an ANDROID based system one that uses Google Inc. s ANDROID operating system the ID is set by Google and created when a user first boots up the device. The ID remains the same unless the user does a factory reset of the phone which deletes the phone s data and settings.

Those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize other identifications e.g. MEID associated with mobile communication devices which can be used to generate a device ID for use by the present invention.

During the launch game stage the game server queries the communications network on which the mobile device operates for the geographical location of the mobile device . The communications network utilizes triangulation nearest cell tower data or the like to provide an approximate geographical location of the mobile device . The communications network transmits the approximate geographical location of the mobile device to game server . The game server then determines if the geographical location provided by the native application on the mobile device is within a predefined boundary of the approximate geographical location of the mobile device provided by the communications network . If the game server determines that the geographical locations are within the predefined boundary and if the location is within a permitted gambling jurisdiction such as the State of Nevada then the game server launches the virtual casino game for the native application .

The PlayGame stage is set forth in . The virtual casino native application queries the game server for starting credits and game limitations for the virtual casino game selected by the end user player. Depending on the jurisdiction the virtual casino game may have wager limitations game rule limitations e.g. splitting cards in blackjack or the like.

The game server then queries the database to determine the value of the player s account . Further the game server queries the database to determine if there are any limitation holds on the player s account . The balance of the player s account and status are transmitted to the game server . The game server verifies the data and then launches the virtual casino game on the virtual casino game native application on the mobile device . The player enters a wager and each wager is tagged with authentication information and a geographical location generated by the GPS component of the mobile device . The wager along with the authentication and GPS data is transmitted to the game server . The game server queries the communications network on which the mobile device operates for the geographical location of the mobile device . The communications network utilizes triangulation nearest cell tower data or the like to provide an approximate geographical location of the mobile device . The communications network transmits the approximate geographical location of the mobile device to game server . The game server then determines if the geographical location provided by the native application on the mobile device is within a predefined boundary of the approximate geographical location of the mobile device provided by the communications network . If the game server determines that the geographical locations are within the predefined boundary and if the location is within a permitted gambling jurisdiction then the game server verifies the balance on the account the rules and limitations then places the wager and returns the result to the virtual casino game native application . The game server also transmits the wager and result amount to the database to debit or credit the player s account based on the results of the wager. Each wager made by the player in playing the virtual casino game on the virtual casino game native application undergoes the same procedure.

In this manner the game server prevents gambling outside of the authorized jurisdiction and prevents fraud against the casino that operates the virtual casino game application since the game server controls the game logic.
