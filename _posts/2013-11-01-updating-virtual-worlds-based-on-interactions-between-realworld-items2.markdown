This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 244 814 filed on Sep. 26 2011 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 174 735 filed Jun. 30 2011 and issued on Oct. 15 2013 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 556 719 the benefit of priority of each of which is claimed hereby and each of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to games and applications and in particular to computer implemented or processor implemented online games such as online role playing games RPGs playable by one or more people from one or more locations.

In many games there is a virtual world or some other imagined playing space where a player of the game controls one or more player characters herein characters player characters or PCs . Player characters can be considered in game representations of the controlling player. As used here the terms player user entity and friend may refer to the in game player character controlled by that player user entity or friend unless context suggests otherwise. A game display can display a representation of the player character. A game engine accepts inputs from the player determines player character actions decides outcomes of events and presents the player with a game display illuminating what happened. In some games there are multiple players wherein each player controls one or more player characters.

In many computer games there are various types of in game assets aka rewards or loot that a player character can obtain within the game. For example a player character may acquire game points gold coins experience points character levels character attributes virtual cash or other in game items of value. In some games the goal of the game may be to acquire in game rewards. For example a player may strive to achieve a high score by accumulating points that are granted for performing in game tasks or overcoming in game obstacles.

Many online computer games are operated on an online social network. Such a network allows both users and other parties to interact with the computer games directly whether to play the games or to retrieve game or user related information.

Many operators of physical i.e. real world locations allow users to conduct a variety of actions on their property such as visiting the location performing certain tasks or actions at the location purchasing goods and services at the location and the like. Goods can include items that are physical and tangible items that are delivered electronically to the user over the Internet and items that are delivered through conventional distribution channels e.g. a common carrier .

As used herein a user is a player of an online computer game. Additionally as used herein an item can include a good or service offered by a location operator. Similarly as used herein a purchase or order can include buying renting or licensing an item from a location operator.

Internet users may maintain one or more accounts with various service providers including online gaming systems online social networking systems online merchant systems physical location systems and the like. Online systems can typically be accessed using browser clients e.g. Firefox Chrome Internet Explorer . Locations may also include network addressable systems that can communicate over a wide area network environment such as the Internet.

In various embodiments methods and systems of updating virtual worlds based on interactions between real world items are disclosed. An interaction between a first real world item and a second real world item is detected. The first real world item is a real world item that is associated with a first player of a computer implemented game and the second real world item is a real world item that is associated with a second player of the computer implemented game. A virtual world of the computer implemented game is updated based on the detection of the interaction.

User is a player of one or more online computer games. Game networking system is a network addressable computing system that hosts the one or more online games. Game networking system can generate store and transmit game account data and game state data associated with one or more users. An online game can be accessed by client system directly via network or via a third party system e.g. a social networking site . Client system can be any suitable computing device such as a personal computer laptop cellular phone smart phone computing tablet and the like. Location is a physical place that has one or more location attributes associated with it. User can visit location and perform one or more location based actions there. Location can contain one or more verification systems which can verify if and when user has performed a location based action at location . Location may also be a logical place that has one or more location attributes associated with it. For example a location may be a chain coffee shop e.g. Starbucks that has many physical places e.g. Moscow Johannesburg San Francisco etc. Thus a user may perform a location based action at a logical Starbucks location by performing the location based action at any one of the physical places where real world Starbucks shops exist. Verification system can generate store and transmit action verification data which is data comprising information on one or more users and one or more location based actions associated with the users.

Location networking system is a network addressable computing system that can receive store and transmit location attribute data action verification data and other data associated with location and verification system . Location networking system can be accessed by the other components in system either directly or via network . In some embodiments user can physically bring his client system to location e.g. if client system is a smart phone . Client system may then be able to interact directly with location or verification system .

Social networking system is a network addressable computing system that maintains social graphs. Social graphs are models of connections between entities e.g. individuals users contacts friends players player characters non player characters businesses groups associations concepts etc. . These entities are considered users of the social graph as such the terms entity and user may be used interchangeably when referring to social graphs herein. A social graph can have a node for each entity and edges to represent relationships between entities. A node in a social graph can represent any entity. In particular embodiments a unique client identifier can be assigned to each user in the social graph. This disclosure assumes that at least one entity of a social graph is a player or player character in an online multiplayer game though this disclosure contemplates any suitable social graph users.

The minimum number of edges required to connect a player or player character to another user is considered the degree of separation between them. For example where the player and the user are directly connected one edge they are deemed to be separated by one degree of separation. The user would be a so called first degree friend of the player. Where the player and the user are connected through one other user two edges they are deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation. This user would be a so called second degree friend of the player. Where the player and the user are connected through N edges or N 1 other users they are deemed to be separated by N degrees of separation. This user would be a so called Nth degree friend. As used herein the term friend means only first degree friends unless context suggests otherwise.

Within the social graph each player or player character has a social network. A player s social network includes all users in the social graph within Nmax degrees of the player where Nmax is the maximum degree of separation allowed by the system managing the social graph such as for example social networking system or game networking system . In one embodiment Nmax equals 1 such that the player s social network includes only first degree friends. In another embodiment Nmax is unlimited and the player s social network is coextensive with the social graph.

In particular embodiments the social graph is managed by game networking system which is managed by the game operator. In other embodiments the social graph is part of a social networking system managed by a third party e.g. Facebook Friendster Myspace . In yet other embodiments user has a social network on both game networking system and social networking system wherein user can have a social network on the game networking system that is a subset superset or independent of the player s social network on social networking system . In such combined systems game networking system can maintain social graph information with edge type attributes that indicate whether a given friend is an in game friend an out of game friend or both. The various embodiments disclosed herein are operable when the social graph is managed by social networking system game networking system or both.

As shown in Player has direct connections with several friends. When Player has a direct connection with another individual that connection is referred to as a first degree friend. In out of game social network Player has two first degree friends. That is Player is directly connected to Friend 1 and Friend 2. In a social graph it is possible for individuals to be connected to other individuals through their first degree friends i.e. friends of friends . As described above each edge required to connect a player to another user is considered the degree of separation. For example shows that Player has three second degree friends to whom he is connected via his connection to his first degree friends. Second degree Friend 1 and Friend 2 are connected to Player via his first degree Friend 1. The limit on the depth of friend connections or the number of degrees of separation for associations that Player is allowed is typically dictated by the restrictions and policies implemented by social network .

In various embodiments Player can have Nth degree friends connected to him through a chain of intermediary degree friends as indicated in . For example Nth degree Friend 1 is connected to Player via second degree Friend 3 and one or more other higher degree friends. Various embodiments may utilize the distinction between the various degrees of friendship relative to Player .

In particular embodiments a player or player character can have a social graph within an online multiplayer game that is maintained by the game engine and another social graph maintained by a separate social networking system. depicts an example of in game social network and out of game social network . In this example Player has out of game connections to a plurality of friends forming out of game social network . Here Friend 1 and Friend 2 are first degree friends with Player in his out of game social network . Player also has in game connections to a plurality of players forming in game social network . Here Friend 2 Friend 3 and Friend 4 are first degree friends with Player in his in game social network and friend 4 is a second degree friend with Player in his in game social network . In some embodiments it is possible for a friend to be in both the out of game social network and the in game social network . Here Friend 2 has both an out of game connection and an in game connection with Player such that Friend 2 is in both Player s in game social network and Player s out of game social network .

As with other social networks Player can have second degree and higher degree friends in both his in game and out of game social networks. In some embodiments it is possible for Player to have a friend connected to him both in his in game and out of game social networks wherein the friend is at different degrees of separation in each network. For example if Friend 2 had a direct in game connection with Player Friend 2 would be a second degree friend in Player s out of game social network but a first degree friend in Player s in game social network. In particular embodiments a game engine can access an in game social network out of game social network or both.

In particular embodiments the connections in a player s in game social network can be formed both explicitly e.g. users must friend each other and implicitly e.g. system observes user behaviors and friends users to each other . Unless otherwise indicated reference to a friend connection between two or more players can be interpreted to cover both explicit and implicit connections using one or more social graphs and other factors to infer friend connections. The friend connections can be unidirectional or bidirectional. It is also not a limitation of this description that two players who are deemed friends for the purposes of this disclosure are not friends in real life i.e. in disintermediated interactions or the like but that could be the case.

The game networking system may determine information related to a social network of a user or an aggregation of the social networks of a user. Such information may include measurements pertaining to the social graphs such as the size width or depth of the social graphs. For example such information may include how many people are in the social graph how fast the social graph is growing or how many branches of a master social graph e.g. a graph of all Facebook users are covered in the social graph. Such information may also include a level of participation in a computer implemented game of the people in the social graph such as a level of success of the people at completing game related quests or how much the people have helped others complete game related quests. A measurement of the value of the social graph may depend on weighted measurements pertaining to information about the people in the social graph. Thus the game networking system may consider a first social graph to be more valuable than a second social graph based on the members of the first social graph having higher levels of participation in a computer implemented game than members of the second social graph even if the second social graph has more members. The game networking system may incorporate measurements pertaining to the social graphs of a user into any of its decisions such as the size of an incentive reward to offer to a player or a location based action to propose to a player.

In an online game a game engine manages the game state of the game. Game state comprises all in game parameters including player character state non player character NPC state in game assets and other virtual items in game obstacles game parameters e.g. internal game clocks game environments and other in game elements or features. Each player controls one or more player characters PCs . The game engine controls all other aspects of the game including non player characters NPCs in game obstacles and other game elements. The game engine also manages game state including player character state for currently active online and inactive offline players.

A player character can have a set of attributes associated with the player character. As used herein player character state can refer to one or more in game attributes of a player character such as in game location assets levels condition health status inventory skill set name orientation affiliation specialty and so on. The game engine may use player character state to determine the outcome of game events sometimes also considering set or random variables. Generally a player character s probability of having a more favorable outcome is greater when the player character has a better state. For example a healthier player character is less likely to die in a particular encounter relative to a weaker player character or non player character.

In various embodiments an online game can provide a mechanism for player characters to acquire in game assets which are a type of virtual item or thing that provides some type of in game benefit to a player character. In some embodiments an in game asset can provide an in game benefit for the player character by improving the player character s state. The improved player character state could increase the player character s likelihood or ability to advance in the game or otherwise improve game play. For example in game assets could be character levels ability points skill points hit points mana points combat bonuses and the like. In game assets can also be virtual representations of real life things such as cash chattel precious valuables personal property real property weapons vehicles titles jobs and the like. In game assets can also include mythical and fantasy things such as manna magical items potions relics artifacts and the like.

An online game can be hosted by game networking system which can be accessed using any suitable connection with an appropriate client system . A player may have a game account on game networking system wherein the game account can contain a variety of information associated with the player e.g. the player s personal information financial information purchase history player character state game state . In some embodiments a player may play multiple games on game networking system which may maintain a single game account for the player with respect to all the games or multiple individual game accounts for each game with respect to the player. In some embodiments game networking system can assign a unique identifier to each player of an online game hosted on game networking system . Game networking system can determine that user is accessing the online game by reading the user s cookies which may be appended to Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP requests transmitted by client system and or by the user logging onto the online game.

As used herein a location is a specific physical place in the real world. For example location could be a store restaurant mall business office building park street venue library or the like. Location can have various systems associated with it including verification system and location networking system . As used herein the operator of location is the person or entity that owns possesses operates or otherwise controls location . Furthermore as used herein a user of location is a person who can enter visit use purchase or perform some other action at location . This can include past present and future users of location . In various embodiments a player of an online game may also be a user of location .

In various embodiments location can have one or more devices for communicating with game networking system . Verification system or location networking system can communicate with game networking system either directly or via network . In some embodiments verification system and location networking system are part of the same computing system.

In various embodiments location can have one or more attributes associated with it. These location attributes include a variety of details about location . Location attributes can include for example details regarding goods and services available at the location such as the type price quantity quality brand size description and other details of the goods and services available at the location the purchase history of goods and services at the location corporate and intellectual property information of the location such as any brands trademarks logos and other such information associated with the location the location based action history of players of one or more online games at the location such as the type of location based actions proposed location based actions performed location based actions and other information regarding location based actions associated with the location personal and demographic information of any users of the location such as name sex race ethnicity age income education employment status address credit information purchase history and other personal or demographic information of the users of the location geographic information of the location such as the position elevation size orientation global position system GPS coordinates relation to other locations local terrain weather and other geographic information of the location and other descriptive information associated with the location.

In various embodiments the location attributes of location can be stored in a location account. The examples described herein assume that the location account is stored on location networking system however this is not intended to be limiting. The location account can be stored on any suitable data store including location networking system game networking system a third party system a distributed data store or any combination of two or more of the above.

In some embodiments the location attributes of location can be determined by accessing a website or other network addressable system that contains details about location . For example a computing system can access a website associated with location such as a corporate website or an online shopping catalog and analyze the website for text keywords prices concepts meta tags and other details associated with location .

In various embodiments location networking system can identify users of location by a variety of methods. The methods described below are not intended to be limiting and one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other methods can be used to identify a user .

In some embodiments location networking system can identify a user when the user purchases an item at location . When a user purchases an item at location location networking system may collect purchase information from the user including the user s name credit card number billing address shipping address email address and so forth. For example if user visits a store and purchases an item with a credit card location networking system could use the information contained on the credit card to identify user .

In some embodiments location networking system can identify a user based on some form of identification presented by the user at location . A user could present a membership card discount card coupon ticket code driver s license passport or other item that contains identifying information about the user at location . For example user may have a ticket with a scannable code e.g. a Quick Response QR code that contains identifying information. The ticket can be scanned at location thereby allowing location networking system to identify user .

In some embodiments location networking system can identify a user based on the user s proximity to location . A user s proximity can be determined using various devices or applications such as a GPS device a social networking site e.g. Facebook Twitter a location tracking site e.g. Foursquare Google Latitude a location reservation site e.g. OpenTable Expedia and the like. Location networking system could then access this proximity information to identify the user . For example if user enters a store he could access Foursquare via any suitable computing device to indicate that he is at the store and Foursquare could transmit this information to location networking system thereby informing location networking system that user is at the store. In another example location could have a QR code printed inside the location which user could photograph with a mobile client system e.g. a smart phone and transmit to location networking system . In yet another example if user makes a reservation to dine at a restaurant on OpenTable location networking system could identify user when he checks in with the ma tre d at the restaurant.

In some embodiments location networking system can identify a user when the user provides an indication of the user s presence at location . User could check in with a host log in to a computing device activate a button or switch or perform some other type of action to indicate the user s presence at location which could then be transmitted to location networking system . For example if user visits a hotel location networking system could identify user when he checks in with the hotel clerk. In another example if user accesses a computing system at location location networking system could identify user when he logs into the computing system.

In some embodiments location networking system or game networking system can identify user based on a search engine query made by the user . For example if user queries a search engine e.g. Google or Yahoo that has information that identifies user that information can be transmitted to location networking system or game networking system along with any other relevant information e.g. the search query made by user that either system could use to identify user .

In some embodiments while identifying a user location networking system may also collect information related to one or more game accounts associated with the user including any unique game account identifiers assigned to the user . For example user may gain entrance to location by presenting a ticket with a scannable QR code which contains information identifying user and information about user s unique identifier on an online game. After this ticket is scanned at location the identifying information can be transmitted to location networking system

In some embodiments location networking system can assign a unique identifier to each user of location . Location networking system can assign a name identification number or other unique identifier to user . Location networking system can also utilize any unique identifier assigned to the user by game networking system

A user of an online game hosted by game networking system can also be user of location . Location operators may find it desirable to provide some type of incentive to encourage these users to perform one or more location based actions. Some users may be incentivized to perform certain location based actions when offered an in game asset for an online game. As used herein an incentive reward is an in game asset in an online game that is offered to a user of the online game for completing one or more location based actions. For example the incentive reward could be a specific in game asset e.g. a Sword of Destruction 5 that provides a particular in game benefit e.g. increasing a player character s ability to defeat in game opponents . As used herein a location based action is a type of action that can be performed at one or more locations by a user of an online game wherein the action is proposed to the user as part of an offer for an incentive reward. For example a location based action could be entering visiting using purchasing or performing some other action at location .

In some embodiments a distributor or manufacturer of an item can incentivize users of an online game to purchase the item from a location. For example the distributor or manufacturer of a specific soft drink may offer e.g. via an interface of the game networking system an in game incentive for purchasing a can of the soft drink from any location. While this disclosure generally discusses location based actions with respect to a location the embodiments disclosed herein are also applicable to location based actions with respect to a distributor or manufacturer of an item unless context suggests otherwise.

An incentive reward may include a providing of an in game asset a changing of an attribute of an in game asset or an enabling of a feature of an online game hosted by game networking system . An incentive reward could be for example game points virtual currency experience points character levels character attributes virtual items or other in game assets. Or an incentive reward could be for example a changing of an attribute e.g. a visual characteristic of an in game asset. Or an incentive reward could be for example an enabling of an in game feature such as a dead drop for virtual items described below or a trading post for virtual items described below .

Or an incentive reward may include an out of game asset. For example an incentive reward may be a real world item such as money or a coupon. Or an incentive reward may be reward points e.g. airline miles such as reward points associated with a credit card. Or an incentive reward may be a real world item that corresponds to a virtual item. For example an incentive reward may be a plastic ring corresponding to a virtual ring purchased by a player character of a user within a virtual world of a computer implemented game.

In various embodiments game networking system can include an incentive offer search system which is a network addressable computing system that is operative to generate and or select an incentive reward in response to a request from another computing system such as location networking system game networking system or client system . The incentive offer search system may be a central system accessible to one or more systems over a wide area network or a local system accessible to a single domain. The present disclosure assumes the incentive offer search system is a subsystem of game networking system however it is possible that the incentive offer search system is part of location networking system or even an independent remote system.

In one embodiment the incentive offer search system includes one or more physical servers and an incentive offer data store. The incentive offer data store can store content information containing incentive offer creative content and Uniform Resource Locators URLs or identifiers to content or other resources hosted by game networking system or location networking system . The content may be stored in association with a game engine or game account information on game networking system

In various embodiments the incentive offer search system determines an appropriate incentive reward to offer to a user for performing one or more location based actions. In various embodiments the incentive offer search system determines an appropriate reward to offer to groups or cohorts of people either to each individual member of the group or to the group collectively. Such groups of people may include in game groups e.g. a party existing within a role playing game or out of game groups e.g. a clan of players that exists independently of a particular game . In some embodiments the incentive offer search system determines an appropriate reward to offer to groups of people regardless of whether the group is associated with the computer implemented game. For example the incentive offer search system may determine an appropriate reward to offer to a church group or members of a Zynga Mafia Wars clan. The incentive reward can be determined by a variety of methods e.g. statically randomly or dynamically .

In some embodiments the incentive reward can be determined statically such that the incentive reward offered is the same for all users. For example user might be offered an incentive reward of 20 000 in virtual poker chips for purchasing a lawnmower at location and this same incentive reward would be offered to all other users.

In some embodiments the incentive reward can be determined dynamically such that the incentive reward offered may vary based on a variety of factors. For example the incentive reward can be determined based on location attributes game state or other parameters.

In various embodiments the incentive offer search system can determine an appropriate incentive reward based on game state data stored on game networking system . The incentive offer search system can access the user s game account to retrieve various game state data e.g. the games played by the user the user s player character state and then identify an incentive reward appropriate for user based on that data.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider thematic topical or categorical relationships between a possible incentive reward and a game state variable to determine an appropriate incentive reward. For example the incentive offer search system may query game networking system to determine that user is a player in Zynga Dragon Wars and that user s player character is a 5th level elf. The incentive offer search system may then determine that an Elven Invisibility Cloak is an appropriate incentive reward for a 5th level elf based on the thematic relationship between the player character s race and the incentive reward.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider player character state such as in game assets and other attributes of a player character to determine an appropriate incentive reward. For example if user has 25 000 in virtual poker chips in Zynga Poker the incentive offer search system may determine that an incentive reward of 10 000 in virtual poker chips is appropriate but if user has 100 000 in virtual poker chips an incentive reward of 30 000 may be determined appropriate based on his current in game assets wherein the incentive reward is scaled to user s current in game assets. In another example if user has five purple gems and zero orange gems in Zynga Treasure Isle the incentive offer search system may determine that two orange gems is an appropriate incentive reward for user based on his current in game assets wherein the incentive reward is selected so that user is not offered a redundant in game asset.

In some embodiments where user plays more than one game hosted by game networking system the incentive offer search system can generate incentive rewards corresponding to one or more of the games. Game networking system can host a plurality of online games and a particular user may play one or more of these games and control one or more player characters in each game. If the user plays more than one game on game networking system the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward corresponding to one or more of these games. The incentive offer search system can determine which games to generate incentive rewards for by examining the user s game account information with respect to each game and analyzing a variety of factors e.g. the user s frequency of play duration of play play preferences social network information . In a particular embodiment the incentive offer search system can generate an incentive reward for one game from the plurality of games. For example if user plays Zynga Poker on average ten hours a week but only plays Zynga Mafia Wars on average five hours per week the incentive offer search system may determine that user prefers playing Zynga Poker and may only generate an incentive reward for that game. Alternatively the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for Zynga Mafia Wars instead as a means of encouraging user to increase his game play time in that game. The offer search system may also consider a user s social network information for multiuser online games that interface with social networking systems. For example if user has twenty friends who play Zynga Poker but fifty friends who play Zynga Mafia Wars the incentive offer search system may determine that user prefers playing Zynga Mafia Wars and only generate an incentive reward for that game.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can generate incentive rewards for two or more games. In one embodiment the incentive offer search system can generate incentive rewards for a plurality of games. For example if user plays both Zynga Poker and Zynga Mafia Wars the incentive offer search system may offer an incentive reward of 10 000 in virtual poker chips for Zynga Poker and a virtual submachine gun for Zynga Mafia Wars . In another embodiment the incentive offer search system can generate incentive rewards for a plurality of games but the offer requires the user to choose which game he wants to receive the incentive reward in. For example using the previous example the incentive offer search system might offer user an incentive reward of 10 000 in virtual poker chips and a virtual machine gun but require user to choose which of the two rewards he wants. In yet another embodiment the incentive offer search system can generate a single incentive reward that can be used in a plurality of games. For example in a variation of the previous example the incentive offer search system might offer user an incentive reward of 10 000 in virtual cash wherein this cash can be used in either Zynga Poker or Zynga Mafia Wars.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can generate an incentive reward for a game hosted by game networking system that user has never played or that has no game account associated with the user . An incentive reward for an unplayed game can be generated even if the user plays other games on game networking system . For example if user has only played Zynga Poker on game networking system the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for another game hosted by game networking system e.g. Zynga Mafia Wars Zynga YoVille to encourage user to try a new game.

In various embodiments the incentive offer search system can determine an appropriate incentive reward based on location attribute data. The location attributes of location can be stored in a location account which can be stored and accessed on any suitable computing system including location networking system game networking system a third party system a distributed computing system or any combination of two or more of the above. The incentive offer search system can access location s location account to retrieve various location attribute data e.g. the goods and services available at the location personal and demographic information of users of the location and then identify an incentive reward appropriate for a user based on that data.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider thematic topical or categorical relationships between a possible incentive reward and a location attribute to determine an appropriate incentive reward. For example the incentive offer search system may query the location account associated with location to determine that location is a grocery store with organic strawberries on sale. The incentive offer search system may then determine that 100 servings of virtual strawberry shortcake in Zynga Caf World is an appropriate incentive reward for performing a location based action at location based on the thematic relationship between and goods available at location and the incentive reward.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider details of the goods or services available at the location to determine an appropriate incentive reward to offer. This can include the type price quantity quality brand size description and other details of the goods and services available at location . For example the incentive reward for purchasing a toaster from a particular appliance store might be a virtual toaster in Zynga YoVille. In one embodiment the incentive reward may improve based on the price of the item. For example the incentive reward for a 50 boombox may be 5000 in virtual poker chips in Zynga Poker but the incentive reward for a 1000 home stereo system may be 200 000 in virtual poker chips.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider any brands trademarks logos and other corporate or intellectual property information associated with the location to determine an appropriate incentive reward. For example if location is a Sears department store the incentive offer search system may determine that a virtual item affixed with the Sears logo is an appropriate incentive reward for performing a location based action at the location .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider personal and demographic information of users of the location to determine an appropriate incentive reward. This can included the name sex race ethnicity age income education employment status address credit information purchase history and other personal or demographic information of the users of the location. For example if user is female the incentive offer search system may determine that a virtual Barbie doll in Zynga YoVille is an appropriate incentive reward for user based on her sex.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider the purchase history of goods and services at the location to determine an appropriate incentive reward. For example if visitors to location often buy fertilizer the incentive offer search system may determine that five applications of fertilizer in Zynga FarmVille is an appropriate incentive reward for performing a location based action at location based on the purchase history there.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider the location based action history of players of one or more online games at the location to determine an appropriate incentive reward. This can include the type of location based actions proposed location based actions performed location based actions and other information regarding location based actions associated with the location. For example if some users often fail to perform a certain location based action when offered an incentive reward of 10 000 in virtual poker chips in Zynga Poker the incentive offer search system may determine an incentive reward of 30 000 in virtual poker chips is an appropriate incentive reward to incentivize performance of this location based action.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can consider the geographic information of the location to determine an appropriate incentive reward. This can include the position elevation size orientation GPS coordinates relation to other locations local terrain weather and other geographic information of the location. For example if location is near a beach the incentive offer search system may determine that a virtual beach towel in Zynga Treasure Isle is an appropriate incentive reward for performing a location based action at location .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is unique to a location where a user performs a location based action. For example the user may only receive an incentive reward for a first in game asset when performing a location based action in New England and the user may only receive an incentive reward for a second in game asset when performing a location based action in Wisconsin. Each incentive reward may be unique by country region e.g. four corners of the U.S. state city or any area. In this way the incentive offer search system may create an asymmetry in the availability of particular incentive rewards. In response users may seek to expand their social networks such that they are able to obtain e.g. through trading with other users incentive rewards that would not otherwise be available to the users.

In various embodiments the incentive offer search system can determine an appropriate incentive reward based on factors other than game state or location attributes.

In some embodiments the incentive reward can be determined based in part on the location based action generated by an action proposal search system described in more detail below . For example if the action proposal search system generates a location based action for user of buying a barbecue from a specific hardware store the incentive offer search system may determine that a virtual super oven in Zynga Caf World is an appropriate incentive reward based on the thematic relationship between the incentive reward and the location based action. In another example the incentive reward for purchasing a bottle of Coca Cola from any location might be a virtual item affixed with a Coca Cola logo.

In some embodiments the incentive reward for performing a location based action can vary over time. The incentive offer search system may generate multiple possible incentive rewards wherein the actual reward received by the user is based on when the location based action is completed. For example an incentive reward for purchasing a lawnmower at location within the next hour may be 20 000 in virtual poker chips but the incentive reward may decrease to only 10 000 in virtual poker chips if the lawnmower is purchased after the hour has ended. In one embodiment the incentive reward may only be offered for a limited time. For example an incentive reward of a virtual sports car might only be offered to the first one hundred users who purchase a toaster from location . In a variation of this embodiment the incentive reward may become less attractive for subsequent purchasers. For example the first user to purchase a toaster from location will get a virtual Porsche while later users will be offered virtual Ford Pintos. The incentive offer search system may present offers such that it is not apparent to the user of the gaming system whether he will get the better item or not. For example user might be presented with an offer that states Limited time offer The first person to buy a toaster today will receive a virtual Porsche in Zynga YoVille subsequent buyers will receive a virtual Ford Pinto . In this case the user viewing this offer may not know whether he will be the first purchaser and may only find out after the item is purchased e.g. when handed the receipt for the purchase .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that represents a number of times or a frequency with which a user completes a location based action. For example users may be offered a selection of in game coffee cups based on the number of times the users purchase coffee at Starbucks each week e.g. users with fewer coffee purchases would have a smaller selection of in game coffee cups to choose from . The incentive reward may also depend on the number of times or a frequency with which the user completes the location based action relative to the number of times or a frequency with which other users complete the location based action. For example a user who purchases more cups of coffee from Starbucks than other users may be offered an in game coffee cup having a different visual characteristic e.g. a different color size or shape than the in game coffee cups of other users.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may ensure that some incentive rewards are offered more rarely than others. In this way the incentive offer search system may create a demand for items that are offered more rarely thereby incentivizing users to expand their social networks to include users who obtain items that are rare relative to other items. In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may correlate the rarity of an incentive reward with a difficulty level of the location based action that users must perform in exchange for the incentive reward. In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may correlate the rarity of an amount of a financial return that an entity associated with the game networking system may receive in exchange for users performing a location based action that is necessary to receive the incentive reward.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward in exchange for a user obtaining a particular set of in game assets. Each of the in game assets of the set may in turn may be offered to users as incentive rewards for completing location based actions. Thus the incentive offer search system may incentivize users to complete a series of tasks to obtain a set of in game assets.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is a composite in game asset where each of a set of in game assets corresponds to a component of the composite in game asset. For example the incentive reward may be an in game food item e.g. an in game McDonald s Big Mac and each of the set of in game assets may be ingredients of the in game food item e.g. two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onion and a sesame seed bun .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is a limited edition reward that is available only to users that perform the location based action during a particular time period or with respect to an event that occurs at the location. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is based on a user performing a location based action at e.g. attending a particular live event e.g. a Grateful Dead or Kiss concert at a location . Or the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that offers the user percentage chance of receiving a shirt signed by the drummer of Def Leopard where the percentage increases based on the number of friends the user influences to attend a Def Leopard reunion concert.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is non transferrable. For example the incentive offer search system may generate a non transferrable reward e.g. an in game mountain climbing badge to each user that climbs a mountain e.g. Mount Everest . Such non transferrable rewards may correspond to personal achievements of the user with respect to a location .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is based on a user performing a first location based action at a first location and a second location based action at a second location e.g. within a specific time period . For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward based on a user checking in at a location in New York and a location in Los Angeles on the same day. In other words the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward based on the user travelling between multiple locations. The incentive reward may correspond to the travelling between multiple locations e.g. the incentive reward may be tied to the distance traveled amount of time spent travelling etc. . For example the incentive reward may be in game jet fuel based on a detection that the user is travelling between locations on an airplane. Or the incentive reward may be related to a path of travel between multiple locations. For example the incentive reward for flying in an airplane over Chicago may be a virtual kielbasa.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that includes a consumable in game asset. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a virtual orange that is based on the user performing a location based action e.g. registering presence at an orange orchard. The incentive offer search system may generate the incentive reward based on a consuming of a consumable in game asset by a player character of the user . For example the incentive offer search system may offer a virtual orange to the user based on a player character of the user having consumed a virtual orange or not having a virtual orange in his inventory. Or the incentive offer search system may not offer the virtual orange to the user if the player character has a virtual orange in his inventory that the player character has not yet consumed.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is based on a positive or negative feeling users have with respect to a location based action a type of location based action a location or a type of location. For example the incentive offer search system may determine levels of negative feelings e.g. levels of boringness hassle or annoyance associated with types of locations e.g. a doctor s office dentist s office and so on based on input from users. Then when a user performs a location based action e.g. sitting in a waiting room the incentive offer search system may provide an incentive reward having a value that is correlated to the level of negative feeling e.g. a level of boringness of performing that location based action. The incentive offer search system may also retrieve the levels of positive or negative feelings from a predetermined table containing correlations of the levels of positive or negative feelings with performing the location based actions at the locations or types of locations. In this way the incentive offer search system may generate an award that causes a user to look forward to visiting a location that he may otherwise not be excited to visit.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system can generate an incentive reward that is only a percentage chance of receiving an in game asset. For example an incentive reward could be a specific percentage chance e.g. 20 40 75 to receive a particular in game asset e.g. a virtual Porsche . After the user has earned the incentive reward game networking system could then determine if the user actually receives the in game asset.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for an unknown or undisclosed in game asset. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a mystery prize for user and present an offer that states Purchase this item at location now and receive a mystery prize in Zynga Dragon Wars The user may not discover what the mystery prize is until the incentive reward is earned by performing an associated location based action or possibly even later e.g. the next time the user logs into game networking system . In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may present an offer that keeps a portion of the prize a mystery to be revealed when the user performs a location based action. For example the offer may present a range of values corresponding to the reward but not the actual value that the user will receive. For example the incentive offer search system may present an offer that states Purchase this item at location now and receive up to 100 000 poker chips in Zynga Poker Then when the user performs the location based action the incentive offer search system may reveal the value of the reward e.g. Congratulations You received 5 000 poker chips in Zynga Poker for purchasing this item at location .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that incorporates an element of chance e.g. a lottery ticket . For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a 10 chance of receiving a free coffee at Starbucks. The percentage of chance may vary according to various criteria such as an estimated value of the player s action with respect to an operator of the location. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a 20 chance of receiving a free coffee at Starbucks for registering presence at Starbucks and an incentive reward for 90 chance of receiving a free coffee at Starbucks for purchasing a coffee at Starbucks.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player or group of players based on a level of influence of the player or group of players. The game networking system may determine a level of influence of a player or group of players in a variety of ways as described below.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward to motivate groups of people. For example an incentive reward me be offered either individually or collectively to a group of people e.g. two or more players of a computer implemented game or a player of a computer implemented game and one or more friends of the player of the computer implemented game . For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is to be offered to each of a group of people based on each one or a particular number or percentage of the group performing a location based action.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that that includes counting a player s vote on a matter. The game networking system may determine a matter for which an entity associated with a computer implemented game e.g. a sponsor of the computer implemented game seeks an opinion of the players in the form of a vote. The game networking system may also receive input as to the possible voting options for the matter. The incentive offer search system may then enable the players to place their votes e.g. select one of the voting options on the matter by performing location based actions. For example the game networking system may seek to determine whether players of a computer implemented game prefer Peet s Coffee or Starbuck s Coffee. The incentive offer search system may then generate an incentive reward that includes counting the player s vote on the matter based on the player performing a location based action e.g. purchasing coffee at a Peet s Coffee or Starbuck s establishment. In this way players may vote with their feet on a matter that is relevant or important to the players of a computer implemented game or an entity associated with the game networking system e.g. a sponsor of a computer implemented game .

In some embodiments the game networking system may only count a player s vote while the player is performing a location based action or for a specific e.g. predetermined time period during or after the player performs a location based action. Thus a result of a vote may change e.g. in a capture the flag style at any given time based on a number of people who are currently performing or have recently performed a location based action. In some embodiments the game networking system may count the player s vote only while the player is performing a location based action. In some embodiments a player s vote may only be counted one time regardless of how many times the user performs an associated location based action. In some embodiments a player s vote will be counted each time or a particular number or percentage of times a player performs a location based action. In some embodiments the game networking system may limit a number of votes a player may place regarding a matter to a maximum number.

In some embodiments the game networking system may count a lack of performance by a player of a location based action as an affirmative vote against a voting option corresponding to the location based action. For example if a player does not purchase a coffee at Starbuck s within a certain time period the game networking system may count the player s non action as a vote against Starbuck s on a matter such as which coffee chain is a favorite of players of a computer implemented game. Or the game networking system may count a performance by a player of an opposite location based action as an affirmative vote against a voting option corresponding to the location based action. For example if a player can vote in favor of Starbuck s as a favorite coffee establishment by registering presence at Starbuck s but the player instead registers presence at Peet s Coffee the game networking system may register the player s action as a vote against Starbuck s on a matter such as a favorite coffee establishment of players of a computer implemented game.

In some embodiments the game networking system may use the result of a vote to determine a next event in a computer implemented game For example if a vote shows that a majority of players of the computer implemented game prefer Starbuck s over Peet s Coffee then player characters of the players may receive virtual items bearing a Starbuck s logo. Or the vote may pertain to a rule of the computer implemented game and the game networking system may change the rule based on the result of the vote.

In some embodiments the game networking system may expose its functionality to one or more third parties to for example enable a third party to conduct market research. For example the game networking system may expose its functionality for collecting votes from players such that a third party can conduct market research based on input from the players For example a third party market research company may wish to determine whether players of a computer implemented game prefer a blended coffee product from Starbuck s or a blended coffee product from Peet s Coffee. The game networking system may enable the market research company to access its voting functionality e.g. via an Application Programming Interface API to specify a matter on which the players are to vote specify the various voting options or specify a location based action that each player is to perform in order to register their votes. The market research company may formulate multiple matters each with multiple voting options thus using the game networking system to present a marketing survey to the players. Additionally the game networking system may enable the market research company to specify various configuration options related to the voting functionality such as how long players must remain present at the location of the location based action for their votes to count whether the players can register multiple votes and whether the players can vote affirmatively against a voting option by performing an additional location based action e.g. a location based action that is opposite to a location based action that is required for a player to register a vote for a voting option . The game networking system may expose its functionality based on a contract e.g. a financial contract between an entity operating the game networking system and the third party market research company.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward based on levels of influence. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player of a computer implemented game based on how much influence the player has over his in game or out of game friends. Or the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player based on the player s effectiveness at exercising influence over his friends to perform a location based action For example the incentive offer search system may offer an incentive reward that varies based on how many of the player s friends perform a location based action at the player s request.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward based on the types of people a player influences. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player that is to be provided to the player based on the player influencing people having a certain level of attractiveness to register presence at a location e.g. a bar or night club . The game networking system may determine a level of attractiveness of the people that the player influences in various ways. For example the game networking system may receive input from other players present at the location regarding the level of attractiveness of the people that the player was able to influence to register their presence at the location. Or the game networking system may perform a real time validation of the attractiveness of the people e.g. via a crowd sourcing platform . As another example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player that is to be provided to the player based on the player influencing people having a particular gender or a particular level of style to perform a location based action.

The game networking system may rank input received from other players based on reliability of past inputs by the other players For example if a player s input has been particularly unreliable in the past e.g. based on feedback received from other players the player s input may be given a lower weighting relative to players who have given more reliable input. This weighting of input from players may be applied to all forms of input received from the players e.g. votes feedback etc. . For example if a player provides input to the game networking system regarding the attractiveness of people that an additional player influences to perform a location based action the game networking system may give the player s input a weighting corresponding the estimated reliability of the player s input. The game networking system may estimate the attractiveness of the people based on an aggregation of weighted inputs received from multiple players.

The incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player based on the player influencing a number of friends to perform a location based action. For example the incentive offer search system may identify that an operator of a location is offering an incentive reward in exchange for a player influencing five friends to register their presence at the location. The incentive offer search system may also generate incentive rewards for each of the people that the player influences. In this way the incentive offer search system may generate rewards cascading down to multiple people encouraging flash sales at a location. Each of the incentive rewards may be unique to the person to whom it is offered e.g. based on profile information retrieved about the person from a social networking system . Or some of the incentive rewards may be the same as other incentive rewards offered to other people. For example the player influencing his friends may receive a different incentive reward than the friends he influences or particular sets of friends of the player e.g. the first set of friends to be influenced by the player may receive different incentive rewards than other sets of friends. In some embodiments the incentive reward may generate an incentive reward for a group or cohort of people based on the cohort influencing any combination of individual people or other cohorts of people to perform the location based action. Individuals or cohorts may be related to a game executing on the game networking system e.g. players of the game or unrelated to the game e.g. a church group . The incentive reward may include a first sub reward to be provided to a player or cohort based on the player or cohort asking an additional player or an additional cohort to perform the location based action and a second sub reward to be provided to the player or the cohort based on the number of completions of the location based action by the additional player or additional cohort.

The incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward for a player based on the player influencing a number of other people to perform a location based action at a particular location based on input from an operator of the particular location. For example if Starbucks is experiencing a slow down in sales at particular physical Starbucks locations in the mid western United States an operator of the Starbucks may interface with the incentive offer search system to request generation of an incentive reward that rewards players or groups of players for influencing people to perform a location based action at physical Starbucks locations in the mid western United States.

The incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is time constrained. For example an incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that offers a player a 30 discount on items sold at a location based on the player attracting a particular number of friends to the location. The 30 discount may be offered in a first hour. In a second hour the 30 discount may be reduced to a 20 discount. In future hours the discount may either be reduced further or increased e.g. based on the player influencing an additional number of people to perform a location based action within an additional time period .

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward based on information collected from a social networking system about players to whom the incentive reward is to be offered. For example the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that is to be offered to players that have more than a threshold number of friends on the social networking system. Or the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that has a value that corresponds to the number of friends of the player on the social networking system . For example the incentive offer search system may offer an incentive reward of X virtual gold coins where X is equal to the number of friends the player has on Facebook.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward based on input received from an operator at the location or based on an identification of an incentive reward offered by the operator made independently of any input received from the operator.

In some embodiments a location based action may be reflected in a computer implemented game independently of an offer of an incentive reward. For example a real world blending system may automatically change an attribute of an in game item e.g. a color of a coffee cup based on the number of times or a frequency with which a user completes a location based action e.g. purchases coffee at Starbucks . Or the real world blending system may enable a feature of a computer implemented game based on a performance of a location based action by the user . For example the real world blending system may enable or disable trading of in game assets between a first user and a second user based on a performance of a location based action by the first user or the second user. Or the real world blending system may enable communication between multiple players of a computer implemented game e.g. enabling a first player to convey a hint to a second player regarding how the second player may advance within the game based on the multiple players performing a location based action at a location. Or the real world blending system may enable multiple players to advance within the game based on each of the multiple players performing one or more location based actions e.g. registering presence at a logical Starbucks location within a specific time frame and then successively purchasing a cup of coffee . Or the real world blending system may automatically provide a user with an in game coffee cup having a Starbucks logo based on a detecting that the user performed the location based action of making a purchase at Starbucks.

The real world blending system may associate a location based action with an in game action. For example the real world blending system may detect that user has come into physical proximity of or handled a real world item at a location e.g. based on a scanning of a product code such as a Universal Product Code UPC by the user . The real world blending system may then reflect the action of the user in the computer implemented game by providing a player character of the user with an in game item corresponding to the scanned real world item. Or the real world blending system may represent the action of the scanning of the item by the user by using the player character of the user to shoplift an in game item from an in game store corresponding to the location at which the user scanned the item. In other words the real world blending system may correlate location based actions with in game actions by player characters. Such in game actions may be analogous or representative of the location based action.

In some embodiments the incentive offer search system may generate an incentive reward that relates to an activity that is performed at the location or is otherwise related to a location or type of location. For example the incentive reward may include unlocking health points within a computer implemented game based on user performing a location based action at a doctor s office. Or the incentive reward may include repairing an in game asset based on the user performing a location based action at a repair shop. In this way the incentive offer search system may generate rewards that make user s mundane tasks meaningful within a computer implemented game and thus more fun .

The real world blending system may perform operations independently of whether the user has been offered an incentive reward for performing a location based action.

A location based action is a type of action that can be performed at location by user of an online game hosted by game networking system . The location based action may be proposed to the user as part of an offer for an incentive reward. A location based action could be for example entering visiting using purchasing or performing some other action at location . Although many of the examples below are described in terms of a single location based action it is contemplated that a location based action may include one or more sub actions or steps e.g. a series of sub action or steps or may itself be a sub action or step of a plurality of location based actions. Thus a location based action may be an aggregation of other location based actions. Each of one or more location based actions of an aggregation of location based actions may be associated with an incentive reward. Additionally a location based action that is an aggregation of additional location based actions may itself be associated with an incentive reward.

In various embodiments game networking system can include an action proposal search system which is a network addressable computing system that is operative to generate and or select a location based action in response to a request from another computing system such as location networking system game networking system or client system . The action proposal search system may be a central system accessible to one or more systems over a wide area network or a local system accessible to a single domain. The present disclosure assumes the action proposal search system is a subsystem of game networking system however it is possible that the action proposal search system is part of location networking system or even an independent remote system.

In one embodiment the action proposal search system includes one or more physical servers and an action proposal data store. The action proposal data store can store content information containing action proposal creative content and URLs or identifiers to content or other resources hosted by game networking system or location networking system . The content may be stored in association with game account information or location account information on game networking system

In various embodiments the action proposal search system determines an appropriate location based action to propose to user in exchange for one or more incentive rewards. The location based action can be determined by a variety of methods e.g. statically randomly dynamically etc. .

In some embodiments the location based action can be determined statically such that the location based action offered is the same for all users. For example the action proposal search system may propose that user purchase a cup of coffee at location in exchange for an incentive reward of 100 in virtual cash and this same location based action would be proposed to all other users.

In some embodiments the location based action can be determined dynamically such that the location based action proposed may vary based on a variety of factors. For example the location based action can be determined based on location attributes game state or other parameters.

In various embodiments the action proposal search system can determine an appropriate location based action based on game state data on game networking system . The action proposal search system can access the user s game account to retrieve various game state data e.g. the games played by the user the user s player character state and then identify a location based action appropriate for user based on that data.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider thematic topical or categorical relationships between a possible location based action and a game state variable to determine an appropriate location based action. For example the action proposal search system may query game networking system to determine that user is a player in Zynga FarmVille and that user s player character has a virtual barn. The action proposal search system may then determine that visiting a particular barn at the Sonoma County Fair is an appropriate location based action for the user based on the thematic relationship between user s virtual barn and the proposed location.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider player character state such as in game assets and other attributes of a player character to determine an appropriate location based action. For example if user has 25 000 in virtual poker chips in Zynga Poker the action proposal search system may determine that playing a hand of real poker in Las Vegas at a 10 limit table is appropriate but if user has 100 000 in virtual poker chips playing five hands of real poker at a 50 limit table may be determined appropriate based on user s current in game assets. In another example if user has a virtual barn with no virtual chickens in it in Zynga FarmVille the action proposal search system may determine that visiting the chicken coop at the Sonoma County Fair is an appropriate location based action for user based on his current in game assets.

In some embodiments where user plays more than one game hosted by game networking system the action proposal search system can generate location based actions corresponding to one or more of the games. Game networking system can host a plurality of online games and user may play one or more of these games and control one or more player characters in each game. If the user plays more than one game on game networking system the action proposal search system may generate a location based action corresponding to one or more of these games. The action proposal search system can determine which games to generate location based actions for by examining the user s game account information with respect to each game and analyzing a variety of factors e.g. the user s frequency of play duration of play play preferences social network information . For example the action proposal search system may determine that buying a cup of coffee from a specific caf is an appropriate location based action to receive an incentive reward in Zynga Caf World. In another example the action proposal search system may determine that donating 10 to an animal cruelty charity is an appropriate location based action to receive an incentive reward in Zynga FarmVille.

In an example embodiment the action proposal search system may generate location based actions corresponding to a game such as a game in which players have a goal of attacking and defending turf e.g. a location e.g. location or set of locations by performing location based actions. For example players may start turf wars to become the boss of a location e.g. a business establishment . To win a turf war players may need to enlist their in game or out of game friends e.g. mob mafia or group encouraging them to perform additional location based actions. Based on their ability to influence other players in group or based on their performance of location based actions to assist other players in their group players may expand their turf collectively or individually. A turf may include multiple locations or one or more regions such as a street block city state and so on. An example embodiment of a game in which players attack and defend turf is the Turf Wars game which is described in more detail with respect to .

In various embodiments the action proposal search system can determine an appropriate location based action based on location attribute data. The location attributes of location can be stored in a location account which can be stored and accessed on any suitable computing system including location networking system game networking system a third party system a distributed computing system or any combination of two or more of the above. The action proposal search system can access location s location account to retrieve various location attribute data e.g. the goods and services available at the location personal and demographic information of users of the location etc. and then identify a location based action appropriate for user based on that data.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider thematic topical or categorical relationships between a possible location based action and a location attribute to determine an appropriate location based action. For example the action proposal search system may query the location account associated with location to determine that location is a grocery store with organic strawberries on sale. The incentive offer search system may then determine that buying a basket of organic strawberries is an appropriate location based action to perform at location based on the categorical relationship between the goods available at location and the location based action.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider details of the goods or services available at the location to determine an appropriate location based action. This can include the type price quantity quality brand size description and other details of the goods and services available at the location. For example if location is an amusement park the action proposal search system may determine that riding a specific roller coaster is an appropriate location based action based on the type of services available there. In particular embodiments the action proposal search system can generate a location based action to incentivize the purchase of particular goods or services such as buying items that are on sale or items the location operator wants to clear from inventory. The location operator can provide preferences for the items that it wants associated with location based offers or the action proposal search system can query the location account and analyze the location s current inventory to dynamically determine an appropriate item. For example if location is an ice cream shop with an oversupply of vanilla ice cream the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing a scoop of vanilla ice cream at location is an appropriate location based action based on the inventory of goods available there.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider any brands trademarks logos and other corporate or intellectual property information associated with the location to determine an appropriate location based action. For example if the operator of location has a patent on a certain method the action proposal search system may determine that performing that patented method is an appropriate location based action.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider personal and demographic information of users of the location to determine an appropriate location based action. This can include the name sex race ethnicity age income education employment status address credit information purchase history and other personal or demographic information of the users of the location. For example if a user of location is a mechanical engineer the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing a textbook on thermodynamics at location is an appropriate location based action based on the user s employment information. In another example if user has never purchased a sandwich from location the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing a sandwich from location is an appropriate location based action for user based on his purchase history. In yet another example if user is 18 years old the action proposal search system may propose to the user to purchase a can of soda but if user is 22 years old the action proposal search system may propose to the user to purchase a bottle of scotch.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider the purchase history of goods and services at the location to determine an appropriate location based action. For example if visitors to location rarely buy a particular item the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing that item at location is an appropriate location based action based on the purchase history of that item wherein the location based action is selected to incentivize purchase of that item.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider the location based action history of players of one or more online games at the location to determine an appropriate location based action. This can include the type of location based actions proposed location based actions performed location based actions and other information regarding location based actions associated with the location. For example if a small fraction of users perform a certain location based action such as playing at a high stakes poker table at a particular casino the action proposal search system may determine that an easier version of that location based action is an appropriate location based action such as playing at a lower stakes poker table. In another example if user has never visited Bozo s Amusement Park the action proposal search system can propose that user purchase a summer pass. If user has already visited Bozo s Amusement Park and it had already been proposed to user to purchase a summer pass the action proposal search system can propose that user purchase cotton candy inside the park. In a particular embodiment the action proposal search system can determine a location based action based on any previous actions that have been proposed to the user based on locations besides the one that is currently specified. For example if the action proposal search system had previously proposed that the user buy a grill at a general store the action proposal search system could then propose that the user purchase steaks or hotdogs at a supermarket.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system can consider the geographic information of the location to determine an appropriate location based action. This can include the position elevation size orientation GPS coordinates relation to other locations local terrain weather and other geographic information of the location. For example if location is a store that sells bread and the store is near a duck pond the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing bread and feeding the ducks is an appropriate location based action based on the geographic information of location . In one embodiment the action proposal search system can determine a location based action based on the local terrain. For example if location is near a beach the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing a swimsuit from location is an appropriate location based action based on the proximity of the location to the beach. In another embodiment the action proposal search system can consider the current weather at the location . For example if the current temperature at an amusement park is 90 F. the action proposal search system may determine that riding a water slide at the park is an appropriate location based action based on the current weather there. In yet another embodiment the action proposal search system can consider the historical weather at the location . For example if the daytime temperature outside location is typically 50 F. in the winter the action proposal search system may determine that purchasing a sweatshirt at location in the winter is an appropriate location based action based on the historical weather there.

In various embodiments the action proposal search system can determine an appropriate location based action based on factors other than game state or location attributes.

In some embodiments the location based action can be determined based in part on the incentive reward generated by the incentive offer search system. For example if the incentive offer search system generates a virtual ice cream machine as an incentive reward for user the action proposal search system may determine that buying a quart of premium ice cream from a specific grocery store is an appropriate location based action based on the thematic relationship between the incentive reward and the location based action.

In some embodiments the incentive reward for performing a location based action can vary over time. The action proposal search system may generate multiple possible location based actions wherein the location based action the user has to perform to receive an incentive reward is based on when the location based action is completed. For example the action proposal search system may determine that swimming 10 laps at a particular swimming pool is an appropriate location based action in the summer but may determine that visiting an ice rink is an appropriate location based action in the winter. In another example the difficulty of the location based action may vary over time. User may have to swim 10 laps in a swimming pool if the location based action is performed within two hours of being generated by the action proposal search system but after two hours user may have to swim 50 laps.

In some embodiments the incentive reward may be based in part on participation e.g. an attendance of a user at an event e.g. a concert like a Grateful Dead or Kiss concert that is held at a location. For example the action proposal search system may generate multiple location based actions corresponding to events the action based proposal search system determines are scheduled to occur at a certain venue over a period of time.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system may determine a location based action based on achievements associated with a location. For example the action proposal search system may determine that an achievement associated with the Himalayas is climbing Mount Everest. Thus the user may be offered an incentive reward e.g. a non transferrable in game mountain climbing badge for climbing Mount Everest. Or the action proposal search system may determine that an achievement associated with Big Burger restaurant is eating a five pound burger. Thus the user may be offered an incentive reward for eating the five pound burger at Big Burger.

In some embodiments the action proposal search system may consider user state such as out of game assets and other attributes of user to determine an appropriate location based action. For example the action proposal search system may consider whether the user owns or has in his possession a real world item that is associated with a virtual item of a computer implemented game. For example if the game networking system detects that the user has in his possession a real world item that corresponds to a virtual item of a virtual world of a computer implemented game e.g. an arrow that corresponds to a virtual arrow provided to a player character of the user the action proposal search system may determine that an appropriate location based action is to bring the virtual item into physical proximity e.g. within a few feet of an additional real world item at the location that corresponds to an additional virtual item e.g. a bow that corresponds to a virtual bow provided to a player character of an additional user of the game .

The action proposal search system may generate location based actions involving any combination of users virtual items or locations. Thus the action proposal system may generate location based actions for each of multiple users to bring any of a set of multiple items to five Starbucks and three record stores in four particular cities.

The game networking system may be configured to detect the location of real world items in various ways. For example to detect a location of a real world item the game networking system may be configured to detect a presence of the real world item on a network. For example a real world item may be integrated with a lithium polymer battery having an embedded Bluetooth chip such that the real world item is uniquely serialized and detectable on the network. Such automatically detectable real world items may be offered as incentive rewards to users. For example the incentive offer search system may determine that an appropriate incentive reward for user performing a location based action is to provide the user with a real world plastic ring that represents a virtual ring of a player character of the user . As another example the game networking system may detect the presence of a real world item at a location based on input from one or more users present at the location.

Features of a real world item with respect to a computer implemented game may be locked and unlocked in a secure manner e.g. using a password communicated to the user over an out of band communication channel such as a foil or scratch off serial number on a card provided with the real world item such that only authorized users may activate or use the real world item with respect to the game. For example by using the password a user of the real world item may bind the real world item to a device e.g. an iPhone or a computer such that the features of the real world item are enabled with respect to the game only when the user is accessing the device to which the real world item is bound. Thus if a player binds a set of playing cards that are linked to the computer implemented game via a wireless device to his iPhone and those playing cards are later stolen the thief of those playing cards will be unable to use them with respect to the game unless he also has access to the user s iPhone.

The locking or unlocking of a real world item with respect to a computer implemented game may also enable a user to give trade or sell the real world item in a marketplace. For example upon acquiring a real world item that is linked to a computer implemented game the provider of the real world item may provide the receiver of the real world item with a password necessary to unlock the features of the real world item with respect to the computer implemented game. The game networking system may then perform verification of the sale e.g. prompt the provider to confirm that he did in fact intend to provide the real world item to the receiver . The game networking system may also charge a fee e.g. to the provider receiver or both to unlock the features of the virtual item with respect to the game after the real world item is exchanged. In this way the game networking system may control or prevent gray or black market exchanging of real world items that are linked to a computer implemented game.

The exchanging of real world items linked to a computer implemented game may include leasing lending temporary trading or temporary swapping of virtual items.

A device e.g. a wireless Bluetooth or radio frequency identification RFID device integrated into the real world item may communicate a unique identifier e.g. its Media Access Control MAC address or service set identifier SSID such that the real world item is uniquely identifiable to the game networking system

A device may be integrated into the real world item that includes sensors for motion detection motion tracking motion acceleration elevation magnetic fields and so on such that the game networking system is able to obtain from the device e.g. via communication with the device information in addition to GPS information regarding the location of the real world item For example the device may have a capability to determine its position relative to an ad hoc collection of other items containing similar devices at a location. Thus in various embodiments the game networking system may obtain finer grained information about the movement of a virtual item at a location than it may obtain from a GPS device integrated into the item. For example the game networking system may be able to determine from an accelerometer or similar device integrated into a real world item a velocity or degree of force used by a player when moving the item. The game networking system may communicate with one or more devices integrated into real world items at a location to obtain information collected by the various devices and then communicate that information back to the devices such that players at a location may be informed e.g. via a client user interface executing on the device of other real world items that are nearby or relevant to a computer implemented game. The game networking system may incorporate information about the real world items into its systems such as the action proposal system e.g. to propose location based actions involving multiple real world items at a location .

An item association system may associate a real world item e.g. a client device such as an iPhone that is in the user s possession with a virtual item such that the real world item becomes representative of the virtual item. For example the item association system may associate a user s iPhone with a virtual sword of a player character of the user . The user may request such an association or the item association system may establish such an association as part of the gameplay of a computer implemented game. The incentive offer search system may determine that an appropriate incentive reward is to offer an association between a virtual item and a real world item. For example the incentive offer search system may determine that an appropriate reward for performing a location based action is to associate the iPhone with a sword of a player character of the user . Or the action proposal search system may use such associations to determine appropriate location based actions.

For example if the user has a real world item representing a virtual sword the action proposal search system may determine that an appropriate location based action is to swing the real world item toward another user present at the location . The game networking system may based on a detecting of the performing of the location based action by the player reflect the performing of the location based action within a virtual world of a computer implemented game. For example if the game networking system detects that user performed a swinging of a real world item representing a virtual sword of a player character of the user toward an additional user at the same location the game networking system may weaken a player character of the additional user within a virtual world of a computer implemented game.

As another example if a real world item representing a virtual item is capable of giving a player character of user special ability or power within a computer implemented game e.g. if the real world item represents a virtual ring that prevents crops of the player character from withering within the computer implemented game the action proposal system may determine that an appropriate location based action is for the user to come within a certain physical distance e.g. within a few feet of the virtual item. Additionally the incentive offer search system may determine that an appropriate reward for performing a location based action is to provide the player character of the user with the special ability or power of the virtual item. The incentive offer search system may provide the player character of the user with the special ability or power while the user is within a predetermined physical distance. The incentive offer search system may provide the player character of the user with the special ability or power for a predetermined amount of time after the user has come within the predetermined physical distance. In various embodiments for virtual items that are unique within a game the corresponding real world item may be assigned a unique identifier e.g. a code or logo to establish a corresponding uniqueness of the real world item.

As another example if the real world items represent virtual items that are combinable within a virtual world of a computer implemented game e.g. a real world item that represents a weapon and a real world item that represents ammunition for the weapon the action proposal search system may determine that an appropriate location based action is to bring the virtual items within a certain physical proximity of one another e.g. within a few feet or inches perform a bumping of the items or to scan one item with the other e.g. via infrared scanning .

The incentive offer search system may select incentive rewards based on particular areas within a location that an operator of the location wants users to visit. For example if an operator of a supermarket wants users to visit particular areas within the supermarket e.g. places where special deals are being offered the operator may request that the item association system establishes associations between real world items e.g. products at specified areas of the supermarket and virtual items that bestow special abilities or powers on player characters of users who come within a predetermined distance of the real world items. Thus users will have an incentive to visit the particular areas within the location .

Furthermore the incentive offer search system may select incentive rewards based on users social networks. For example if the game networking system detects that multiple users of a computer implemented game at a location have real world items in their possession that represent virtual items that are combinable within a virtual world of a computer implemented game the action proposal search system may determine that an appropriate location based action is for the users to come within a certain distance of each other at the location. Or the incentive offer search system may determine that an incentive reward for the users for coming within a certain distance of each other at the location is an in game asset or other benefit relating to the combination of the virtual items represented by the real world items. For example if each user has a real world item corresponding to an ingredient of a virtual potion the incentive offer search system may determine that an appropriate reward for users performing the location based action of bringing the real world items into close physical proximity to one another is to provide each of the player characters of the users with an instance of the virtual potion. Thus the incentive offer search system may encourage users to expand their social networks by engaging with other users e.g. users that are present at the same location at the same time in location based actions.

Or the action proposal search system may determine that an appropriate location based action is for the users to introduce themselves to one another in the real world based on detecting that the users are players of a computer implemented game. Such a location based action may be independent of any real world items that the users own or possess. In some embodiments the action proposal search system may determine that an appropriate location based action is for a player to add other players e.g. other players who are present at the same location as the player e.g. within a predetermined time frame as friends with respect to his in game or out of game social network. In this way the action proposal search system may encourage players to increase the size of their social networks which in turn may increase the players level of influence over other people.

The game networking system may determine an appropriate location based action is for the user to influence other people e.g. at the location or an additional location to perform a location based action e.g. based on the player s level of influence over other people . The game networking system may determine a players level of influence based on various factors including the number of in game or out of game connections of the player e.g. in game friends of the player with respect to a computer implemented game executing on the game networking system or out of game connections of the player with respect to the social networking system how successful the player has been at influencing people e.g. his in game or out of game connections to perform location based actions how well the player has performed within the computer implemented game e.g. a number or magnitude of experience points levels high scores or other achievements awarded to the player or a player character of the player a popularity of the player e.g. a number or activity level of fans of the player a number of publications e.g. blogs news articles etc. mentioning the player and so on. Similarly the game networking system may determine a level of influence of a group of players e.g. based on an aggregation of the levels of influence of the members of the group or separate data pertaining to the group itself such as how successful the group has been at influencing other people to perform location based actions .

The item association system may detect a purchasing selling or trading of a real world item that is associated with a virtual item. For example the item association system may detect that a first user and a second user have completed a location based action that includes a trading of a first real world item and a second real world item. The detecting of the trading may be based on input received from the first user the second user or a third user e.g. a user present at the location that witnesses the trade . The item association module may then reflect the trading of the real world items with respect to the virtual items to which they correspond. For example the item association module may exchange a first virtual item of a player character of the first user with a second virtual item of a player character of the second user where the first virtual item corresponds to the first real world item that was included in a real world trade and the second virtual item corresponds to the second real world item that was included in a real world trade. Thus the real world trade may be reflected by a trading of virtual items by player characters within the computer implemented game. Similarly the item association module may detect real world buying and selling of real items by users and reflect the real world buying and selling of the real world items by for example exchanging virtual items between player characters of a computer implemented game.

The item association system may charge a transaction fee e.g. to a game account of a user to enable the exchanging of real world items to affect a virtual world of a computer implemented game. For example if the item association system detects that a first user has sold a real world item to a second user the item association system may charge a transaction fee to the second user to reflect the transaction within the game e.g. to enable a player character of the second user to receive a virtual item corresponding to the real world item .

A variety of methods can be used to determine and present incentive reward offers to a user. In one embodiment user can access via the user s client system an online game hosted by game networking system . The user s browser client can load and render the content of the webpage. Game networking system may also access the user s game account information and or the location account of one or more locations. This account information may be accessed in a variety of ways. For example game networking system could access data stored in a cookie on client system that is appended to messages transmitted from client system to game networking system . This allows game networking system to identify user and access the appropriate game account information. To access location account information game networking system may directly query location networking system . Alternatively the online game webpage may include code e.g. HTML etc. instructing the client system to call location networking system to retrieve HTML code and or script. For example the online game webpage provided by game networking system may be implemented in an iframe with a src tag identifying the URL of location networking system . When client system consumes the HTML or other code of the page client system transmits a request to location networking system . In one embodiment the request includes a browser cookie or other state object appended thereto that allows location networking system to resolve the identity of user and possibly all or a subset of game state information associated with that user . If a script is used e.g. JavaScript the script when downloaded and executed might be operative to scan various attributes of webpages hosted by location networking system to identify the one or more location attributes and transmit this location attribute data to game networking system . For example the webpage hosted by location networking system may include semantic tags that identify elements of the page that correspond to the types and prices of items available for sale at location . Game networking system may use this information to consider what type of incentive reward to offer user . As mentioned above in response to the call from client system game networking system may access data stored in the cookie corresponding to the game networking system thereby allowing the game networking system to identify user . If game networking system is able to successfully identify user as a player in one or more online games hosted by game networking system it can then trigger the incentive offer search system and the action proposal search system.

In some embodiments even if user is not a user of game networking system the method may include offering an alternative type of incentive reward to user such as an in game benefit or asset that is not normally provided to new players. This might be done for example to encourage user to establish a user account on game networking system . For example if user is not a user of any game hosted by game networking system user might be presented with an incentive reward offer of 100 000 in virtual poker chips if he performs a certain location based action at location and joins Zynga Poker where a typical new poker player only receives 20 000 in virtual poker chips in that game.

The incentive offer search system and action proposal search system can determine an appropriate incentive reward and location based action to present to user . An appropriate incentive reward and location based action can be determined in a variety of ways. Once an appropriate incentive reward and location based action have been determined game networking system can respond to the call from client system with content that includes details of the incentive reward and the location based action to be displayed on the browser client of client system . The incentive reward offer may be rendered for example in a discrete section of the online game interface viewed by user . The offer can include a variety of information about the incentive reward and location based action including a description of the in game reward an image a description of the location and the action to be performed and other details as instructed by the script and other content transmitted in the response received from game networking system

In one embodiment game networking system may generate a unique offer identifier that is associated with the offer transmitted to client system . The offer identifier can be included in the HTML code that becomes part of a Document Object Model DOM of the webpage as maintained by the browser client or other client application. If user performed the location based action game networking system and or location networking system may record the unique offer identifier in association with the offer. After user performs the location based action location networking system may transmit data to game networking system indicating that the location based action has been performed. This can be done in a variety of ways. Once game networking system has confirmed that user has completed the location based action game networking system can then provide the incentive reward to user or his player character. For example game networking system may update user s account to add the in game reward to his in game asset list which will be presented or available to the user the next time he accesses the game. The entities associated with the game networking system and location networking system to the extent they are separate can contract to achieve a variety of revenue exchange or sharing paradigms that arise out of the incentive offers described herein. For example the entity associated with game networking system may receive a payment for each performed location based action. In another embodiment the entity associated with game networking system may receive a payment when user redeems the award.

Other methods are possible for determining and presenting an incentive reward offer and location based action to a user . For example a variety of method steps and data flows are possible. The methods and data flows described above as well as alternatives are described in more detail below.

At operation the game networking system provides an in game asset to the user the in game asset representing a result of a performance of the in game action. For example the result of an in game shoplifting of a virtual item e.g. the in game action determined by the game networking system to correspond to an out of game scanning of a real world item may be an obtaining of an in game asset corresponding to the type of the real world item that was scanned. Thus if the user scans a UPC of a six pack of beer the game networking system may provide the user with an in game asset related to beer.

At operation the game networking system provides an in game asset to the user based on a location of the first location based action being different than a location of the second location based action. The providing of the in game asset may be based on the user performing the first location based action and the second location based action within a particular time period. For example the game networking system may provide an in game asset to the user based on the user registering presence at a location on the East coast and a location on the West coast on the same day. The providing of the in game asset may be related to travelling by the user between the location of the first location based action and the location of the second location based action. For example the game networking system may provide an in game asset to the user based on distance between the location of the first location based action or the second location based action. The in game asset may be selected or generated based on travelling between locations. For example based on a detecting that the user flew on an airplane between two locations the game networking system may provide the user with an in game asset related to air travel e.g. jet fuel .

The first location based action and the second location based action as well as additional location based actions may be derived or received from an entity interested in incentivizing travel through a location. For example a government interested in promoting tourism through a city or town may interface with the game networking system to establish incentives for people to travel to various tourist locations perhaps in a sequential order . As another example a theme park may interface with the game networking system to establish incentives for people to visit key parts of the theme park.

At operation the game networking system provides an in game asset to the user based on the level of positivity or negativity associated with the location based action. For example the game networking system may provide a first in game asset to a user that performs a location based action that is viewed negatively by other users and a second in game asset to an additional user that performs a location based action that is viewed positively by other users where the first in game asset is more valuable than the second in game asset. In this way the game networking system may entertain users by providing them with relatively valuable in game assets when they perform location based actions that are viewed negatively relative to other location based actions.

One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the steps and operations described above can be performed in any reasonable order and that various steps can be reordered added and removed. Additionally any of the steps and operations described above may be combined in various ways.

For example the examples described herein may be adapted to any combination of individual people or groups of people e.g. individual players associated with a game groups of players associated with a game individual people not associated with a game or groups of people not associated with a game . For example the example method R is described with respect to groups of players having a level of influence over a location however the example method may also be adapted to individual players. For example the example method R may be adapted to provide an incentive reward to a first player based on the first player having a level of influence over a location that is greater than a level of influence of a second player over the location. Similarly example methods that are described with respect to individual players may be adapted to groups of players. As another example the examples described herein may be adapted to any type or combination of types of incentive rewards. Thus an example that describes providing an in game asset may be adapted to enable an in game feature or provide another type of incentive reward.

In various embodiments location can have one or more verification systems that can verify when a user has performed one or more location based actions. Verification system can verify performance of a location based action using a variety of methods. Verification system can generate store and transmit action verification data which is data comprising information on one or more users and one or more location based actions associated with the users. Action verification data can be transmitted to location networking system game networking system or client system either directly or via network . In some embodiments the action verification data can be generated by another system such as client system game networking system or location networking system . This disclosure assumes that the action verification data is generated by verification system and transmitted to location networking system however this is not intended to be limiting. Action verification data can include a variety of information regarding a location based action including information indicating the user the location based action if the action was performed by the user when the location based action was performed where the location based action was performed how the location based action was performed and other information related to the location based action. The methods described below are not intended to be limiting and one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other methods can be used to verify performance of a location based action.

In some embodiments if the location based action is purchasing an item at location verification system can verify the purchase using a variety of methods. When user purchases an item at location location networking system may collect purchase information from the user including the user s name credit card number billing address shipping address email address etc. For example if user visits a store and purchases an item with a credit card location networking system could use the information contained on the credit card to identify the user .

In some embodiments if the location based action is verifying the presence of user at location verification system can verify the user s presence at the location using a variety of methods. For example verification system can verify user s presence based on some form of identification presented at location based on the user s proximity to location when the user provides an indication of the user s presence at location and by using other location verification methods.

In some embodiments verification system may verify that the user was present at the location during the time at which a particular event was scheduled to occur. For example to verify that the user was present at a Grateful Dead concert the verification system may verify that the user was present at the venue of the Grateful Dead concert during the date and time the Grateful Dead concert occurred or was scheduled to occur .

Communication between client system location networking system and game networking system can occur over any appropriate electronic communication medium or network using any suitable communications protocols. For example client system as well as various servers of the systems described herein may include Transport Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP networking stacks to provide for datagram and transport functions. Of course any other suitable network and transport layer protocols can be utilized.

In addition hosts or end systems described herein may use a variety of higher layer communications protocols including client server or request response protocols such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP and other communications protocols such as HTTP S FTP SNMP TELNET. In addition a server in one interaction context may be a client in another interaction context. Still further in particular embodiments the information transmitted between hosts may be formatted as HyperText Markup Language HTML documents. Other structured document languages or formats can be used such as XML and the like. Executable code objects such as JavaScript and ActionScript can also be embedded in the structured documents.

In some client server protocols such as the use of HTML over HTTP a server generally transmits a response to a request from a client. The response may comprise one or more data objects. For example the response may comprise a first data object followed by subsequently transmitted data objects. In one embodiment for example a client request may cause a server to respond with a first data object such as an HTML page which itself refers to other data objects. A client application such as a browser will request these additional data objects as it parses or otherwise processes the first data object.

The example data flows in this section are presented with respect to data flow between location networking system and game networking system . One skilled in the art would appreciate that these are presented merely as an example of a data flow between two types of online systems. However the present disclosure is intended to encompass data flows between a game networking system and a variety of other online systems such as online merchant systems online media systems online reviewing systems online search engines and online advertising systems. The example data flows described herein function analogously with these online systems as with location networking systems.

In various embodiments location networking system or game networking system can receive messages identifying a user shown in . For example game networking system can receive a digital message through a network wherein the message contains information about the identity of the user . This message can be sent using any suitable communications protocol.

In one embodiment messages with identifying information received by location networking system or game networking system will have been sent from the user . For example the user could actively use a digital communication device e.g. a computer or a smart phone to send a message to game networking system . In another example the user could passively use a digital communication device e.g. a computer or smart phone to send a message to game networking system by instructing the digital communication device to send a message to game networking system if the device comes within a specified proximity of location . The user s proximity can be determined by a variety of methods e.g. through the use of a Global Positioning System GPS .

In another embodiment messages with identifying information received by game networking system will have been sent from location or location networking system . For example location could use a computing system to send a message to game networking system

In various embodiments user can receive messages identifying both a location based action and an offer for an incentive reward. For example user could receive from game networking system a message describing a location based action and an incentive reward through client system . In another example user could receive a similar message from location networking system . In another example user could receive a message directly from location e.g. through the use of a physical receipt or through the use of a computer at the location .

In various embodiments location networking system or game networking system can receive a message verifying that user performed a proposed location based action. For example game networking system can receive the message in a digital form transmitted over a network. In some embodiments the message verifying that user performed a location based action could have been transmitted by location or location networking system to game networking system through the use of verification system .

Network cloud generally represents one or more interconnected networks over which the systems and hosts described herein can communicate. Network cloud may include packet based wide area networks such as the Internet private networks wireless networks satellite networks cellular networks paging networks and the like. As illustrates particular embodiments may operate in a network environment comprising one or more networking systems such as location networking system game networking system social networking system and one or more client devices . The components of location networking system game networking system and social networking system may operate analogously as such hereinafter they may be referred to simply as networking system . Client devices are operably connected to the network environment via a network service provider a wireless carrier or any other suitable means.

Networking system is a network addressable system that in various example embodiments comprises one or more physical server s and data store s . The one or more physical server s are operably connected to network cloud via by way of example a set of routers and or networking switches . In an example embodiment the functionality hosted by the one or more physical server s may include web or HTTP servers FTP servers as well as without limitation webpages and applications implemented using Common Gateway Interface CGI script PHP Hyper text Preprocessor PHP Active Server Pages ASP Hyper Text Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML Java JavaScript Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX Flash ActionScript and the like.

Physical server s may host functionality directed to the operations of networking system . Hereinafter server s may be referred to as server although server may include numerous servers hosting for example networking system as well as other content distribution servers data stores and databases. Data store s may store content and data relating to and enabling operation of networking system as digital data objects. A data object in particular embodiments is an item of digital information typically stored or embodied in a data file database or record. Content objects may take many forms including text e.g. ASCII SGML HTML images e.g. jpeg tif and gif graphics vector based or bitmap audio video e.g. mpeg or other multimedia and combinations thereof. Content object data may also include executable code objects e.g. games executable within a browser window or frame podcasts etc. Logically data store s corresponds to one or more of a variety of separate and integrated databases such as relational databases and object oriented databases that maintain information as an integrated collection of logically related records or files stored on one or more physical systems. Structurally data store s may generally include one or more of a large class of data storage and management systems.

Client device may execute one or more client applications such as a web browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Apple Safari Google Chrome and Opera to access and view content over a computer network. In particular embodiments the client applications allow a user of client device to enter addresses of specific network resources to be retrieved such as resources hosted by networking system . These addresses can be Uniform Resource Locators URLs and the like. In addition once a page or other resource has been retrieved the client applications may provide access to other pages or records when the user clicks on hyperlinks to other resources. By way of example such hyperlinks may be located within the webpages and provide an automated way for the user to enter the URL of another page and to retrieve that page.

A webpage or resource embedded within a webpage which may itself include multiple embedded resources may include data records such as plain textual information or more complex digitally encoded multimedia content such as software programs or other code objects graphics images audio signals videos and so forth. One prevalent markup language for creating webpages is the Hypertext Markup Language HTML . Other common web browser supported languages and technologies include the Extensible Markup Language XML the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language XHTML JavaScript Flash ActionScript Cascading Style Sheet CSS and frequently Java. By way of example HTML enables a page developer to create a structured document by denoting structural semantics for text and links as well as images web applications and other objects that can be embedded within the page. Generally a webpage may be delivered to a client as a static document however through the use of web elements embedded in the page an interactive experience may be achieved with the page or a sequence of pages. During a user session at the client the web browser interprets and displays the pages and associated resources received or retrieved from the website hosting the page as well as potentially resources from other websites.

When a user at a client device desires to view a particular webpage hereinafter also referred to as target structured document hosted by networking system the user s web browser or other document rendering engine or suitable client application formulates and transmits a request to networking system . The request generally includes a URL or other document identifier as well as metadata or other information. By way of example the request may include information identifying the user such as a user ID as well as information identifying or characterizing the web browser or operating system running on the user s client device . The request may also include location information identifying a geographic location of the user s client device or a logical network location of the user s client device . The request may also include a timestamp identifying when the request was transmitted.

The example network environment described above and in is presented with respect to location networking systems and game networking systems. One skilled in the art would appreciate that these are presented merely as an example of a network environment between two types of online systems. However the present disclosure is intended to encompass network environments that include a game networking system and a variety of other online systems such as online media systems online reviewing systems online search engines and online advertising systems. The example network environment described above performs analogously with these other online systems as with location networking systems.

The elements of hardware system are described in greater detail below. In particular network interface provides communication between hardware system and any of a wide range of networks such as an Ethernet e.g. IEEE 802.3 network a backplane etc. Mass storage provides permanent storage for the data and programming instructions to perform the above described functions implemented in servers whereas system memory e.g. DRAM provides temporary storage for the data and programming instructions when executed by processor . I O ports are one or more serial and or parallel communication ports that provide communication between additional peripheral devices which may be coupled to hardware system .

Hardware system may include a variety of system architectures and various components of hardware system may be rearranged. For example cache memory may be on chip with processor . Alternatively cache memory and processor may be packed together as a processor module with processor being referred to as the processor core. Furthermore certain embodiments of the present disclosure may not require nor include all of the above components. For example the peripheral devices shown coupled to standard I O bus may couple to high performance I O bus . In addition in some embodiments only a single bus may exist with the components of hardware system being coupled to the single bus. Furthermore hardware system may include additional components such as additional processors storage devices or memories.

An operating system manages and controls the operation of hardware system including the input and output of data to and from software applications not shown . The operating system provides an interface between the software applications being executed on the system and the hardware components of the system. Any suitable operating system may be used such as the LINUX Operating System the Apple Macintosh Operating System available from Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino Calif. UNIX operating systems Microsoft Windows operating systems BSD operating systems and the like. Of course other embodiments are possible. For example the functions described herein may be implemented in firmware or on an application specific integrated circuit.

Furthermore the above described elements and operations can be comprised of instructions that are stored on non transitory storage media. The instructions can be retrieved and executed by a processing system. Some examples of instructions are software program code and firmware. Some examples of non transitory storage media are memory devices tape disks integrated circuits and servers. The instructions are operational when executed by the processing system to direct the processing system to operate in accord with the disclosure. The term processing system refers to a single processing device or a group of inter operational processing devices. Some examples of processing devices are integrated circuits and logic circuitry. Those skilled in the art are familiar with instructions computers and storage media.

When a player initiates turf war the game networking system may notify various players of the Turf Wars game. For example the boss of the location the boss s mafia or the initiator s mafia may be notified that the initiator has started a turf war at the selected location. The notification may indicate the rules of the turf war. Examples of rules may be that the initiator will win the turf war e.g. become the boss of the location if the number of the initiator s mafia that registers presence at the location within a time frame e.g. one hour exceeds the number of the boss s mafia that registers presence at the location within the time frame. Or the rules may specify that the initiator of the turf war will become the boss of the location if the initiator s mafia spends more money at the location within a predetermined time period than the current boss s mafia. Or the rules may specify that the initiator will win the turf war if a particular number e.g. five members of the initiator s mafia each perform a location based action at the location before a particular number e.g. five of the current boss s mafia each perform a location based action at the location. The rules may also take into account virtual items in the inventories of player characters of the players. For example if the initiator s mafia has more powerful weapons than the current boss s mafia it may be easier for the initiator s mafia to win the turf war e.g. the initiator s mafia may not need to register as much presence at the location or spend as much money at the location to win the turf war . The user interface F may also include the navigation bar described above.

As described above an aspect of a computer implemented game may include a shoplifting gaming mechanic in which a player of the computer implemented game is able to shoplift or otherwise obtain a virtual item by performing a location based action such as scanning a product code of a corresponding real world item. The shoplifting gaming mechanic may enable players to steal virtual items from one another or groups of players to steal virtual items from other groups of players. The shoplifting gaming mechanic may include an aspect of enabling a player or group of players to set an alarm e.g. by performing a location based action thus protecting a real world item that is the subject of a location based action that is to represent a shoplifting of a virtual item. When the alarm is set off e.g. by a player attempting to perform a location based action that is required to steal the item the player s who set the alarm may be notified and be presented with various options in response to the setting off of the alarm. For example the player or group of players who set the alarm may be given an option to perform a location based action to steal the item back from player s who performed the location base action to steal the item. Or the player or group of players who set the alarm may be given the option to punish a player character of the thieving player within the computer implemented game e.g. decreasing the mana of a player character or imprisoning the player character . Additionally the shoplifting gaming mechanic may include a notification element for notifying an additional player group of players or an operator of a location of a shoplifting action by a player independently of whether an alarm is set. Thus rival groups or clans may be notified of a shoplifting action of a player and be given various options to counter the shoplifting action by the player. Or the shoplifting action may be reported to an operator of the location where a shoplifting action occurs such that the operator may adapt to the popularity of particular shoplifting actions e.g. by distributing popular items strategically within the location .

The game networking system may be configured to determine a first value associated with a shoplifting of a virtual item by performing a location based action e.g. through brand impressions disseminated through a social network of the player who shoplifts the item and a second value associated with an actual purchasing of the real world item at the location. The game networking system may then adjust the incentive rewards for performing a location based action based on whether the location based action is a shoplifting action or an actual purchasing action. Thus a player who is highly influential e.g. has many in game and out of game social connections that he has successfully influenced in the past may receive an offer for performing a location based action to shoplift an item that is more valuable than an incentive reward that is offered to an additional player who actually purchases the real world item at the location but is less influential than the player.

Additionally the game networking system may associate a fungibility attribute of a virtual item corresponding to a real world item based on whether the virtual item is obtained via a shoplifting action or via a purchasing of the real world item at a location. Thus a virtual sword that is obtained by a player character of a player based on the shoplifting gaming mechanic may not be interchangeable with a virtual sword that is obtained by a player character of the player based on the player actually purchasing a real world sword corresponding to the virtual sword. However two virtual swords obtained by the same means e.g. the shoplifting gaming mechanic may be treated as interchangeable within a computer implemented game.
