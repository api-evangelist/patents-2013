The present application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application No. 61 717 874 filed Oct. 24 2012 and entitled RETAIL FUELING ENVIRONMENT UTILIZING POWERED COMMUNICATION OVER LEGACY CABLING the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth verbatim herein in its entirety and relied upon for all purposes.

The subject matter described herein relates generally to retail fueling environments commonly referred to as service stations. More particularly subject matter described herein relates to a retail fueling environment in which powered communications are provided over legacy cabling.

Fuel dispensing sites typically include one or more fuel dispensers and at least a backroom with one or more components to communicate with the one or more fuel dispensers. The backroom components operate the fuel dispenser to activate dispensing process consumption data facilitate video surveillance perform leak detection perform valve status detection or additional operations effectuated by communicating with the fuel dispensers. Fuel dispensing sites typically run power to each fuel dispenser at a forecourt or at least to a central power source at the forecourt and the backroom components are powered as well. Power for the backroom components is typically standard alternating current AC power with accessible outlets and available branch circuits such that a backup power source e.g. uninterruptible power supply UPS can be utilized with the backroom components. Fuel dispensers are typically hardwired and thus may not have a backup power source or may have an insufficient backup power source for during at least a portion of a power outage.

Fuel dispensers and backroom components typically communicate via a 2 wire communication protocol such as currently loop RS 422 485 or similar protocols. With the development of technology mechanisms for providing newer protocols and cabling as well as backup power sources have been implemented but require significant construction costs to run new cabling. Wireless protocols can also be used for high speed communications between the backroom and fuel dispensers but cannot solve power outage issues. In addition 2 wire current loop RS 422 485 or similar communications circuits are sensitive to direct current DC or AC voltages imposed on a communications cable. Thus application of power over the legacy 2 wire cables can cause damage to related circuitry and or components receiving communications over the cabling. Additionally these communications links typically provide 10 kilobits per second kbps or less bandwidth which is not sufficiently large for some desired applications.

The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein to provide a basic understanding thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that follows.

Various aspects described herein are directed to facilitating high bandwidth communications over legacy cabling such as 2 wire cabling and powering the high bandwidth communications equipment over the legacy cabling. Using communications with combined power over the cabling can allow components on a backup power source to power components for which backup power is not otherwise available during power outages. In addition aspects described herein can preserve legacy communications among components when power is normally available. In an example the concepts can be applied to a fuel dispensing environment where one or more backroom components can communicate with one or more fuel dispensers over preexisting 2 wire cabling installed in the forecourt. The backroom components can use a powered communication mechanism to communicate with the one or more fuel dispensers in certain cases e.g. to obtain mission critical data therefrom during power outage . The powered communications allow the backroom components to power the fuel dispensers during at least part of the power outage to facilitate receiving or transmitting the mission critical data.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative however of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.

Reference will now be made in detail to various aspects one or more examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation and not limitation of the aspects. In fact it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made in the described aspects without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. For instance features illustrated or described as part of one example may be used on another example to yield a still further example. Thus it is intended that the described aspects cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

Described herein are various aspects relating to providing powered communications between components over legacy cabling to allow communication of critical data in the event of a power outage or other limited power scenarios. The powered communications can be selectively provided to allow legacy communications when full power is available. In one example a component can detect power outage or other limitation and can determine to activate powered communications this can be performed by a control signal input to a dual relay that switches between legacy communications or other non powered communications and powered communications based on the control signal. In a specific example aspects described herein are employed in a fuel dispensing environment to allow one or more backroom components to obtain critical data from fuel dispensers over legacy 2 wire cabling in a power outage or limited power scenario.

As used in this application the terms component module system and the like are intended to include a computer related entity such as but not limited to hardware firmware a combination of hardware and software software or software in execution. For example a component may be but is not limited to being a process running on a processor a processor an object an executable a thread of execution a program and or a computer. By way of illustration both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and or distributed between two or more computers. In addition these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system distributed system and or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.

Moreover the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or. That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B. In addition the articles a and an as used in this application document and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean one or more unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.

Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices components modules and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices components modules etc. and or may not include all of the devices components modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.

In the event of a power outage or other power limitation e.g. planned or unplanned at power source backroom can activate powered communications with fuel dispenser and or over the legacy cabling to communicate critical data therewith. In one example the backroom which can include various components for communicating with and operating fuel dispensers and can detect the power outage or other limitation and switch from legacy communications to powered communications over the legacy cabling to facilitate acquisition or provisioning the critical data from to fuel dispensers and . The critical data also referred to herein as mission critical data can include pending transaction data video surveillance data leak detection data valve status data or similar data that should be preserved or communicated even when power is lost. For example the power from the powered communications can be used to power a modem at the fuel dispensers and for communicating the critical data.

When power is returned via power source backroom can revert from powered communications with fuel dispensers and to legacy communications over the legacy cabling. It is to be appreciated that the fuel dispensers can protect legacy interfaces during the power outage to prevent powered communications from reaching associated circuitry. In another example backroom and fuel dispensers and can communicate using wireless technologies over respective modems. In this example backroom transmits power signals over legacy cabling in the event of a power outage and fuel dispensers and can power wireless modems via the signals for wirelessly communicating with backroom . In any case when the power outage subsides backroom can revert to legacy communication with fuel dispensers and over the legacy cabling. Moreover communications over the modem of fuel dispensers and whether wired or wireless can continue when power is restored to provide higher bandwidth than the legacy communications and the modem can be powered by the power source instead of powered communications from the backroom in this example.

Dispenser components can be part of a dispenser communication module DCM protocol processor module PPM etc. within one or more fuel dispensers and can include a corresponding filter splitter for separating broadband communications from power signals or legacy communications from a backroom a relay for passing the 2 wire signal where present or opening where DC power signals are received from the backroom so as not to damage the 2 wire current loop interface or related circuitry for example. A 2 wire current loop interface is provided for processing 2 wire communications into data output. Dispenser components further include a diode coupler for enabling power received from the powered communications and or from a mains DC power source to power some of the dispenser components . Dispenser components also include a broadband communications modem for receiving high speed communications from broadband communication modem over the legacy cabling a control microprocessor with power supervisor and watchdog timer for determining whether to close relay and a super capacitor and charging circuit for providing a level of backup power at the dispenser components for a portion of a power outage.

According to an example relays and enable connection of the 2 wire circuits over legacy cabling when power is sufficiently available and or can facilitate powered communications when power is not sufficiently available. For example when power is on or at least at a threshold available power legacy communications from the backroom components to dispenser components can subsist. For example the 2 wire portion of dual relay is normally closed N.C. allowing 2 wire current loop interface output to pass to filter splitter . In this example the DC power supply portion of dual relay is in a normally open N.O. state and does not allow DC power to pass to filter splitter in this state. Relay can be normally open N.O. to prevent powered communications unexpectedly reaching 2 wire current loop interface in a normal operating state.

Control microprocessors and can respectively operate relays and through control signaling. Thus when power is sufficiently available microprocessor does not communicate a control signal to dual relay and microprocessor does communicate a control signal to relay to close the circuit. In this example dual relay passes legacy communications from 2 wire current loop interface over a DC coupled low pass filter LPF connection between the backroom components and dispenser components . In the event of a planned or unplanned power outage for example microprocessor can communicate a control signal to relay to cause the legacy communication portion to open and the DC power supply portion to close and microprocessor terminates the control signal to relay to prevent DC power signals from passing to the 2 wire current loop interface . It is to be appreciated that DC power supply can be used to operate the microprocessor and or to charge capacitor as well during a power outage in one example.

In this regard it is to be appreciated that microprocessors and can control the relays and based in part on communicating with one another. In one example microprocessors and can communicate using broadband communication modems and . Regardless of the state of relays and broadband communications modem can communicate with broadband communications modem via filter splitters and over legacy cabling therebetween such as video advertisements or other information promotional data critical data etc. As depicted broadband communications modems and can establish an AC coupled high pass filter HPF connection to facilitate communicating AC signals without DC current over the legacy cabling. This communication can occur alongside 2 wire communication or power signaling e.g. as the DC coupled LPF connection depending on a state of dual relay .

For example broadband communications modems and can communicate over the legacy cabling using very high digital subscriber line VDSL VDSL2 asymmetric digital subscriber line ADSL Broadband over Power Line e.g. HomePlug HomePlug AV etc. time division multiplexing TDM time division multiple access TDMA and or similar technologies. This allows for more bandwidth for communications between the backroom and dispensers than legacy communication protocols. For example the technology utilized can include state machines for maintaining synchronization states and or overhead communications between the modems and as described further herein e.g. out of sync show time or similar DSL states .

Microprocessors and can leverage this communication to determine whether when to use legacy and or powered communications. Where microprocessors and determine to activate legacy communications for example microprocessor can communicate a control signal to the dispenser relay which operates N.O. to close the relay thus enabling the 2 wire interface circuit. The power supervisor of the microprocessor can be utilized to ensure this behavior when the link between broadband communications modems and is in a certain state for example. This can include a show time state for digital subscriber link DSL technology indicating that the DSL link is active and communication with backroom microprocessor is reliable in one example which can be communicated over modem synchronization and state buses as depicted. In addition the power supervisor of microprocessor can send the control signal to relay further based on whether microprocessor and microprocessor agree e.g. via communications over broadband communications modems and that it is safe to switch the relay . Other communications technologies have state equivalents to DSL show time that can be communicated e.g. unique word acquisition in TDM TDMA systems . Moreover in this example microprocessor can accordingly terminate a control signal to dual relay to facilitate switching from powered communications to legacy communications. In this regard the microprocessors and can each have interfaces for DSL or other broadband communications technology link status relay control power sensing etc.

In one example microprocessors and or can determine that a planned or unplanned power outage has occurred and can communicate over the broadband communications link to determine to switch to powered communications. For instance the backroom components can have switched to power by super capacitor and the dispenser components can have switched to power by super capacitor . This can allow the microprocessors to communicate for at least a period of time during the power outage. In one example after a period of time of being powered by the capacitors the microprocessors and can determine to switch to powered communications which can include one of the microprocessors making the decisions and communicating to the other expiration of a related timer at both microprocessors and etc. In another example microprocessor can determine that power is lost or that the link to the backroom via broadband communications modem is down. In any case microprocessor can terminate the control signal to relay or otherwise the microprocessor loses power as well causing termination of the control signal which causes the relay to open and not pass the signals to 2 wire control loop interface . This can safeguard the 2 wire control loop interface from powered communications as the signals may be powered due to microprocessor also detecting the power outage and communicating a control signal to dual relay to facilitate powered communications.

It is to be appreciated that though the microprocessors and can perform processes to determine whether to switch to powered communications using steps described above other processes are possible as well. For example microprocessors and can utilize processes defined based on other equipment installed at the site as described in further detail below e.g. site wiring whether there is a common AC mains power source etc. to determine whether and or how to switch to powered communications in the event of an outage.

Filter splitter passes received signals or at least a DC coupled LPF component thereof to diode coupler . Thus where the signals are powered communications the diode coupler can use the received DC power portion of signals to power broadband communications modem e.g. and microprocessor and capacitor as well for receiving the AC coupled HPF portion of the signal from filter splitter .

Once power is restored or is at least at a threshold level diode coupler allows for power from mains DC which can be converted AC power from a power source to power broadband communications modem . It is to be appreciated that the diode coupler could be replaced with a relay if circuit design constraints require in which case processor can control the relay. In addition when power is restored microprocessors and can communicate via broadband link communications to determine when to activate legacy communications. For example microprocessors and can wait for a show time status for the broadband link. When this occurs for example microprocessor can terminate the control signal to relay and microprocessor can communicate a control signal to relay which refrains from powered communications at the relay and allows 2 wire communications over the legacy cabling as described.

Moreover to provide failsafe protection for the 2 wire circuits which can include or communicate via 2 wire current loop interface the watchdog timer at microprocessor can disconnect the 2 wire interface e.g. by terminating the control signal to relay if the dispenser microprocessor malfunctions. Similarly the watchdog timer of the backroom microprocessor can refrain from enabling coupling of DC power to the legacy cable interface via dual relay e.g. by terminating a control signal to relay leaving a portion related to DC power supply in an open state if microprocessor malfunctions. Either watchdog timer event can require replacement of the defective microprocessor before normal function continues however redundant processors not shown can be provided for added reliability in another example. Furthermore to prevent switching glitches at power on or off instants it is apparent that the unpowered normal state of the dispenser relay can be N.O. such to render 2 wire current loop interface normally disconnected while the normal state of the backroom relay is N.O. for the DC power supply portion such to render DC power supply as normally disconnected as described above.

Furthermore different behaviors for power outages of various lengths can be defined if desired and or can be site specific. For example the microprocessors and can each utilize a super capacitor or respectively that enables running timers in the backroom and dispensers for example to inhibit switching to powered communications during short power outages and or to store data regarding past and current link states. A super capacitor can be utilized to avoid life expectancy and temperature range problems with batteries. The super capacitor can typically hold up processor power for times longer than typical short term power outages of less than 1 minute. Following expiration of a time however microprocessors and can determine to switch to powered communications as described.

For example operation of the broadband communication link can be critical for enabling of 2 wire circuits as the backroom can surmise the dispenser power state by link status. An out of sync status e.g. in DSL or a status other than show time for a time longer than short term power outages that can be handled by the super capacitors and can be detected by the microprocessors and and used to enable powered communication over the legacy cabling as described. For example the microprocessors and can both detect the time of the status one of the microprocessors or can detect the time and notify the other over the broadband link etc. Similarly where microprocessors and or detect a certain mode for the broadband link e.g. show time mode for DSL before expiration of the time or before the threshold capacity is reached by capacitor and or the appropriate control signals can be sent to or terminated from respective relay or . Thus the capacitors and can be a first measure to handle a power outage and the microprocessors and can communicate to move to powered communications if power has not returned after the specified time.

Further site specific options can be configured as well. For example a common AC mains power source can be assumed for the backroom and dispensers to optimize the decision time for enabling the DC power supply in the backroom in the event of a power outage. In one example this option can be enabled based on actual site wiring implementation. Other parameters such as time lengths for performing switch of relay and or can also be programmable. External elements to the system such as point of sale terminals forecourt controllers etc. can be utilized to configure monitor and control the system set various thresholds or constraints for detecting power outage switching to powered communications etc. In one example such components can communicate with the system by a remote connection to one or more of broadband communications modems or or other connections thereto and microprocessors and can accordingly generate control signals to the relays and based on commands from the components.

In addition in one example a DSL out of band signaling channel of broadband communications modem and or can be used for relay and 2 wire isolation state control if necessary or in lieu of use of the modem synchronization and control bus depending on modem technology. Thus in this example broadband communications modem and or can send the control signal to relay or over the out of band signaling channel e.g. once the show time state is detected . Moreover it is to be appreciated that the concepts described herein can be used with substantially any system for powering communications over at least a portion of legacy cabling. In one example embodiments of the present invention may be utilized in non dispenser applications such as tank farms or other remote applications not needing AC mains power. In such examples the system can use constantly powered communications e.g. DSL powered as described over legacy cabling.

Moreover data interfaces are depicted as well such as 2 wire data input to 2 wire current loop interface and output from 2 wire current loop interface a broadband Primary Data Interface and Auxiliary Data Interface as noted in . The Primary Data Interface can correlate to an interface for allowing applications at the backroom to communicate with applications at the dispensers. The Auxiliary Data Interface is shown connecting to microprocessors and and can include one or more low data rate interfaces such as RS 232 serial ports for defining behavior of microprocessors and in certain scenarios and or to otherwise operate the microprocessors and . The microprocessors and have access to the overhead communications bus to the modems and respectively as shown. Various modem technologies can provide overhead data channel or signaling data channel interfaces which can be used for low data rate Telco applications such as indicating line or equipment state. In an example however the overhead channel can be utilized as a generic low rate data interface. For example the microprocessors and provide appropriate multiplexing of auxiliary data interfaces to the overhead communications bus. This can facilitate processes to conserve power as described herein. The interfaces can be physical interfaces such as physical ports for connecting cabling graphical user interfaces GUI application programming interfaces API etc.

It is to be appreciated that the amount of power that can be sent over the legacy cabling is a function of cable length and wire gauge and in some cases can be limited for example to meet intrinsic safety requirements. Because the power may be limited the dispenser components can exist on a single printed wiring board where the auxiliary data interfaces connect directly to sensors or other equipment that generate critical data. This allows mission critical systems to operate independent of the Primary Data Interfaces of the modems and which are typically an Ethernet USB or other high bandwidth data interface. The power budget can be evaluated for various applications to determine if this feature is needed otherwise additional electronics can be powered for example devices connected to the primary data interface.

Though not shown it is to be appreciated that the backroom can employ multiple modems in one example. For instance the modem 2 wire current loop interface dual relay and filter splitter can be replicated for each dispenser on the forecourt. The Modem Synchronization and State Bus and Overhead Communications Bus can then extend between the control microprocessor and all modems in the backroom.

According to an example broadband communications modems and can establish a radio frequency RF connection using various wireless technologies e.g. WiFi cellular technologies Bluetooth ZigBee etc. and can communicate directly and or via one or more intermediate nodes e.g. a network switch a router the Internet a mobile network etc. . The components and operate similarly as in except that high speed communications need not occur over legacy cabling because the modems and communicate wirelessly. Thus in the event of a power outage or other power limitation the backroom can provide power signals from DC power supply to the dispenser by activating a control signal to dual relay causing the 2 wire current loop interface portion of the relay to open and the DC power supply portion to close. Diode coupler receives the DC power signal and powers broadband communications modem for communicating with broadband communications modem over the wireless connection microprocessor and or capacitor .

As described the power outage or signals from microprocessor can cause microprocessor to terminate a control signal to relay which is normally open causing the relay to open and not forward the DC power signals to 2 wire current loop interface . When power is restored and diode coupler can use mains DC power to power the modem microprocessor and or capacitor microprocessors and can communicate to determine when to reactivate the control signals to relays and as described to facilitate 2 wire communications over the legacy cabling.

Referring to methodologies that can be utilized in accordance with various aspects described herein are illustrated. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts as some acts can in accordance with one or more aspects occur in different orders and or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram. Moreover not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more aspects.

At dispensers can be optionally notified of the power outage. For example this can include communicating a notification to the dispensers over a broadband communications link where the dispensers are able to switch to alternate power for at least a portion of the power outage e.g. using a super capacitor . In one example the notification can cause the dispensers to open a relay connected to a legacy interface for ceasing signal passage thereto based on the power outage.

At a control signal can be communicated to a relay based on the power outage. The control signal for example can cause the relay to open a portion of the relay related to a legacy interface and close a portion of the relay related to signals received from a power supply to facilitate powered communications as described herein.

At it can be determined whether power has returned from the power outage. This can be detected for example based on a local determination of receiving power a detected or indicated switch from the super capacitor or an indication that the capacitor is charging a notification from the power source etc. If power has not returned it can be continually checked until it does. This can be an event driven determination as well in one example.

If power has returned at a connection status over a broadband link with one or more dispensers can be determined. If the connection status is good at e.g. show time status for DSL the control signal is terminated at which can cause the relay to close the legacy interface portion and open the DC power supply portion to allow legacy communications to pass. If the connection status is not good or is in another defined state the status can be continually checked until it reaches the desired state for example.

At a control signal to a relay can be terminated. For example the control signal can cause the relay to close and pass signals to a legacy interface thus terminating the control signal which can cause the relay to not pass signals to the legacy interface. This can allow for passing power over legacy cabling without damaging the legacy interface.

At it can be determined whether power has returned. For example this can include a local determination that power is available a detected or indicated switch from powering by a super capacitor or an indication that the capacitor is charging a notification from the power source a notification from a backroom etc. If the power has not returned it can be continually checked or otherwise be an event driven determination.

If power has returned at a connection status over a broadband link with the backroom can be determined. If the connection status is good at e.g. show time status for DSL the control signal is communicated to the relay at which can cause the relay to close the legacy interface portion to allow legacy communications to pass. If the connection status is not good or is in another defined state the status can be continually checked until it reaches the desired state for example.
