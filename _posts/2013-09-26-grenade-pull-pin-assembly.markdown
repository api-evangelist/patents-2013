title: Grenade pull pin assembly
abstract: A grenade fuze assembly includes a fuze body, a striker lever pivotally mounted to the fuze body, and a pull pin assembly. The pull pin assembly includes a pull pin attached to a pull ring and a pull pin retainer fixed to the pull pin on a side of the striker lever opposite the pull ring. The pull pin retainer includes a through hole. The two legs of the pull pin are disposed in the through hole and deformed around the retainer to fix the retainer to the pull pin. The retainer includes a pair of nest areas on opposing sides of the retainer. The free end of each of the two pull pin legs is disposed in a respective nest area.

A major concern with grenade fuze assemblies is the retention of the pull pin assembly. The pull pin assembly includes a pull ring and a pull pin. The pull pin has a retention requirement that is a pull force range required to pull the pin out of the grenade fuze. The pull force range may be for example about 20 25 pounds force. A known pull pin includes a duck bill shape that functions to retain the pull pin until the required pull force is applied.

The grenade user may bend or deform the sharp ends of the duck bill pull pin to eliminate the exposed sharp edges. The grenade user may also bend or deform the sharp ends of the duck bill pull pin in an effort to increase what is perceived as an inadequate too small pull force. Bending or deforming the duck bill pull pin can drastically change the pull force needed to remove the pull pin from the fuze leading to an unsafe grenade.

A need exists for a grenade pull pin that does not have sharp edges that provides a more reliable and accurate pull out force and that conveys confidence to the user that the pull force is adequate.

One aspect of the invention is a pull pin retainer for retaining a pull pin of a grenade fuze assembly. The pull pin retainer includes a generally cylindrical body a central longitudinal axis parallel top and bottom surfaces and a through hole that is coaxial with the central longitudinal axis. A channel is formed in the top surface. The channel is centered on the central longitudinal axis and extends in a first direction completely across the top surface and partially across the top surface in a second direction normal to the first direction.

The pull pin retainer includes a planar surface that is normal to the central longitudinal axis parallel to the top surface and located interior of the top surface. A pair of coplanar surfaces are disposed on respective opposite sides of the planar surface. The coplanar surfaces are parallel to the planar surface and located axially further from the top surface than the planar surface. A pair of second surfaces join respective ones of the pair of coplanar surfaces to the planar surface. A fulcrum is defined by the intersection of the through hole and the planar surface. A pair of second fulcrums are defined by intersections of the planar surface with respective ones of the pair of second surfaces.

The pull pin retainer includes a pair of nest areas. Each nest area is defined by an area that is radially outward of one of the second surfaces and axially above one of the coplanar surfaces that joins the one of the second surfaces.

The pair of second surfaces may be parallel to each other normal to the planar surface and normal to respective ones of the pair of coplanar surfaces.

Another aspect of the invention is a grenade fuze assembly including a fuze body and a striker lever pivotally mounted to the fuze body. The grenade fuze assembly includes a pull pin assembly having a pull pin attached to a pull ring. The pull pin has two legs inserted through the striker lever and the fuze body to prevent rotation of the striker lever. The grenade fuze assembly includes a pull pin retainer disposed on a side of the striker lever opposite the pull ring. The pull pin retainer includes a through hole with the two legs of the pull pin disposed in the through hole and deformed around the retainer to fix the retainer to the pull pin. The retainer includes a pair of nest areas disposed on opposing sides of the retainer. The free end of each of the two legs is disposed in a respective nest area.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring to a grenade fuze assembly includes a fuze body and a striker lever pivotally mounted to fuze body . A novel pull pin assembly includes a pull pin and a pull ring attached to pull pin . Pull pin may be made of a wire for example. A pull pin retainer is fixed to an end of pull pin . Pull pin retainer is disposed on a side of striker lever opposite pull ring .

Referring to pull pin retainer has a generally cylindrical body and a central longitudinal axis A. A top surface is parallel to a bottom surface . A centrally located through hole is coaxial with axis A. A channel formed in top surface is centered on axis A and extends completely across top surface in a direction B and partially across top surface is a direction C normal to direction B. Channel defines a planar surface that is normal to axis A parallel to top surface and located below or interior to top surface . A pair of coplanar surfaces are disposed on opposite sides of planar surface parallel to planar surface and located further axially away from top surface than planar surface . Coplanar surfaces are joined to planar surface by respective surfaces . Surfaces may be parallel to each other. Surfaces may be normal to both planar surface and coplanar surfaces .

In a known manner pull pin is inserted through striker lever and fuze body to prevent rotation of striker lever . Then pull pin retainer is fixed to pull pin .

Referring to pull pin has two legs . The two legs are inserted into through hole . The retainer slides down pin until bottom surface of retainer abuts striker lever . Each leg is bent around a fulcrum formed by planar surface and through hole . The bend in each leg around fulcrum may be for example about ninety degrees. Then each leg is bent again around respective fulcrums . Fulcrums are formed by the intersection of planar surface and surfaces respectively. The bend in each leg around respective fulcrums may be for example about ninety degrees.

After legs are twice bent the free ends of legs rest on or just above respective coplanar surfaces . The areas radially outward of surfaces and above coplanar surfaces are nest areas for ends of legs . Preferably bottom surface abuts striker lever .

The mechanical properties of the material used to make pull pin may be modified to change the pull force needed to remove pull pin from retainer . The needed pull pin forces can also be affected by the bend shapes or profiles of retainer . Reliance on the mechanical properties of the pull pin material enables a more consistent pull pin force compared to reliance on the geometry of the duck bill design.

The use of pull pin retainer can also function as a usage or tampering indicator. After pull pin is removed from the grenade fuze assembly retainer drops off of assembly . Because legs of pull pin are deformed past retainer the original bending of legs would be most difficult to replicate. Evidence of an attempt to reassemble retainer to pull pin would most likely be a failure to replicate the original bending and or scarring or marks on legs .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
