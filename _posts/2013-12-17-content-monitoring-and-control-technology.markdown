The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Multiple types of content such as audio e.g. music podcasts video and still images e.g. photographs may be made available over the content delivery network . Licensed and license free content may be made available. For example licensed content may be acquired from a content owner .

Content may be made available from a variety of sources. For example Internet content may be accessed from an Internet link e.g. URL Uniform Resource Locator . Content may also be accessed from peer to peer networks. For example content may be accessed from one or more BitTorrent clients which are part of one or more BitTorrent swarms . Content may be accessed from other sources such as from a television broadcast e.g. MSO Multiple System Operator cable satellite local or from content e.g. photographs audio previously recorded video available from devices e.g. DVR stereo computer DVD Digital Video Disc player connected to a user s home network and or located in a user s home.

Content curators may use a content curator portal to define custom channels which may be made available for subscription by end users . The content curators may be commissioned to search for select and organize multiple types of content from various sources into channels. Content curators may for example organize channels by topic or genre. Content curators may for example select licensed content license free content BitTorrent content or content from their private collection to name a few examples.

Channels may be offered for free to end users or end users may subscribe to channels on a fee basis. Users may rate or rank channels or content curators based for example on programming selection sequencing and quality. Content curators may be promoted for example based on popularity.

Content owners may be compensated for the use of licensed content that they own which is used in channels defined by content curators . For example the system may provide support for digital rights management DRM . By allowing access to their licensed content content owners may experience increased distribution and revenue and targeted exposure in focused channels. Multiple revenue agreements may be possible such as per use agreements subscription revenue sharing and advertisement revenue sharing.

A content curator may work with one or more advertisers such as an ad agency to include advertisements on a channel. For example an advertisement may be displayed if a user switches a channel or when a program finishes. As another example advertisements may be displayed on the display of a remote control device such as while a program is being displayed on a television. Content curators advertisers and content owners may share advertising revenue. Sharing in advertising revenue may provide an incentive for content curators to create interesting and popular channels. A content curator may work with one or more advertisers to create one or more advertisements which are customized and targeted for one or more particular channels. End users may customize advertisement viewing preferences such as by specifying preferred topics preferred or excluded companies region preferences etc.

Advertisers may use an advertiser portal to upload advertisements and to control advertisement publication. Advertisers may define and apply advertisement insertion rules to particular advertisements and or may allow a content curator to decide when and how to insert the advertisements into channels defined by the content curator . APIs Application Programming Interfaces may be provided which allow advertisers to enable the system to interface with standard advertisement inventory management systems to allow for control and management of advertisements . Various advertisement pricing plans may be supported such as individually priced ads or bulk pricing. Other advertising features may be included such as online purchasing of items or providing customer contact options.

Advertisers content curators and content owners may access user viewing behavior data. Advertisers may access user viewing behavior data such as viewed channels viewed content viewed advertisements advertisement display frequency advertisement viewed length user actions during advertisement display user characteristics advertisement and content view times advertisement and content view counts and hosting channel information to monitor reach and performance of advertising campaigns. Advertisements may be targeted to specific users based on recorded user viewing behavior data. Content curators may access user viewing behavior data to learn about behaviors of end users who subscribe to their channels. Content owners may access user viewing behavior data to learn about their fan base such as accessing information about user demographics time of day of access and user actions during content display. Content presentation and playback may be customized and personalized for a particular end user based specifically on recorded user viewing behavior of the particular end user and generally on recorded user viewing behavior of all users.

User viewing behavior data may be captured for example by a media player and or a downloader device . The media player and or the downloader device may play content included or ordered on a channel defined by a content curator . In some implementations the media player may play content downloaded from the content delivery network by the downloader device . In some implementations the media player and the downloader device are different logical functions of the same physical device. In other implementations the media player and the downloader device are different physical devices. In some implementations the media player is a software application which may be executed for example on a computing device such as a desktop or laptop computer.

The media player and or the downloader device may be connected to external media storage devices respectively. The external media storage devices may be for example USB Universal Serial Bus drives. The external media storage devices may be used for example to transfer data to from the media player or the downloader device respectively such as to transfer data to from a computing device.

The media player and or the downloader device may communicate wirelessly with one or more remote control devices . The end user may navigate through channels and perform other functions using the remote control device . The remote control device may communicate e.g. using Infrared IR technology of radio frequency RF technology with the television the media player and or the downloader device . The remote control device also may communicate over a network with the media player and or the downloader device to control functions of the media player or the downloader device . The remote control device may include a small display screen that displays preview content and or advertisements.

The media player and or the downloader device may download content from the content delivery network without consuming resources of a computing device owned by the end user . For example content may be downloaded into the home of an end user without using resources of a personal computer owned by the end user . The media player and the downloader device may use less electricity than a personal computer thus reducing the electric bill of the end user . The media player and or the downloader device may connect to other computing devices connected on a user s home network. The media player and or the downloader device may include built in functionality to communicate with and download information from a peer to peer network such as the BitTorrent swarm .

The end user may search for and subscribe to content using an end user content search portal . For example the end user content search portal may provide a directory listing of available defined channels. The directory listing may be organized in a hierarchy of categories and sub categories. A particular channel may appear in one or more categories or sub categories. The end user content search portal may also provide a search function to allow end users to search for available defined channels based on a keyword search. As another example users may search for channels based on other criteria such as sorting channels based on channel or content curator popularity or ranking. An end user may subscribe to a defined channel for example by selecting a channel link displayed in a directory listing or in a list of search results.

The end user may also search for and initiate download of individual content items to the downloader device using a partner site such as a BitTorrent search engine . As another example the end user may send an email which includes a content link to an email address associated with their downloader device to initiate an automatic download to the downloader device of the content linked to by the content link. The content link may refer to a content file available on the Internet and may be a reference to a video resource available from a streaming video website. The end user may send an email with an attachment to an email address associated with the downloader device to initiate a download of the attachment to the downloader device . The end user may use an end user content download portal to search for and to select content to download to the downloader device .

The content and directory database stores information about content and also information about defined channels. Download jockeys may use a download jockey portal to define channels and to manage defined channels. The download jockey portal may display a listing of licensed and license free content available in the content and directory database . The download jockey portal may also provide a search function which allows the download jockey to search for content available in the content and directory database and to also search for content included in the private collection of the content curator or content available on the Internet such as content available from peer to peer networks such as BitTorrent .

The download jockey portal may communicate with a download jockey server . For example a channel definition defined using the download jockey portal may be sent to the download jockey server which may communicate with the server system to request that the channel definition be stored in the content and directory database . As another example information for existing channel definitions associated with a particular download jockey may be retrieved from the content and directory database and sent from the download jockey portal server to the download jockey portal for display.

In some implementations the download jockey portal server is one physical server computing device and in other implementations the download jockey portal server includes multiple physical server computing devices. Similarly in some implementations the server system is one physical server computing device and in other implantations the server system includes multiple physical server computing devices. In some implementations multiple physical server computing devices are used with some or all server computing devices implementing both the download jockey portal server and the server system . In some implementations one physical server computing device is used with the one physical server device implementing both the download jockey portal server and the server system .

The network may be one or more public or private wired or wireless networks such as the Internet or may be a Session Initiated Protocol SIP network such as the PsipTN network offered by TelTel . The network may include for example one or more of the Internet Wide Area Networks WANs Local Area Networks LANs analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks e.g. a PSTN Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN and Digital Subscriber Line xDSL radio television cable satellite and or any other delivery or tunneling mechanism for carrying data services. The network may include multiple networks or subnetworks each of which may include for example a wired or wireless data pathway.

Content may be downloaded or streamed to one or more user media player downloader devices . For example content corresponding to a user subscribed channel may be automatically downloaded or streamed to the media player downloader device in response to a user selection of a corresponding channel. As another example a user may search for and download or stream content to the media player downloader device . A user may using a remote user device monitor and manage user initiated downloads. The remote user device may be any type of electronic device configured to exchange communications with the server system over a network. The remote user device may be a general purpose computer e.g. a desktop personal computer a workstation or a laptop computer a mobile or wireless device or a device designed for a specific function e.g. a cell phone a smart phone a tablet PC a personal digital assistant PDA etc. .

A PDR DDR and RDR may include a content file name or identifier to identify a content file associated with a particular action e.g. play content download content preview content . In some implementations a content identification platform may be used to identify content. For example the media player device may generate a digital signature of a content file and may send the digital signature to the content identification platform over a content delivery network . The content identification platform may compare the digital signature to digital signatures of known content files. If the content identification platform finds a digital signature of a known content file that matches the received digital signature the content identification platform may send a corresponding content title to the media player device .

The remote control device may be for example a television remote control a mobile telephone and or may be or include a component of a personal computer PC or gaming system a laptop a handheld or tablet computer a personal data assistant PDA a portable music player a beeper or other communication device or a handheld or portable electronic device for gaming communications and or data organization.

The system monitors content download activity content playing activity and remote control activity of a media system that leverages a content delivery network in controlling content delivered to the media system . For example and in reference to the system may monitor content download activity performed using the downloader device content playing activity performed using the media player device and remote control activity performed using the remote control .

Content download activity may be stored in a DDR. Content download activity may include for example the downloading of a content file to a media player downloader device such as the downloading of a content file included in a channel or the downloading of a podcast or other content using RSS Real Simple Syndication technology. Generating a DDR is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system identifies a content file being downloaded by a downloader device included in a media system . A content file may be identified for example by a content file name e.g. title and or by a content file identifier. A content file title may be identified using a content identification platform e.g. platform that compares a digital signature of the content file to digital signatures of known content files.

The system identifies a size of the content file being downloaded . The size of a content file may be the size that the content file occupies in storage. The size may be determined for example by querying metadata associated with the file. The size may also be determined by querying a database system for the size of database content associated with the content file or by querying a file system for a file attribute which indicates the size of the content file. As another example the size of the content file may be computed by processing the file.

The system monitors status of the download including timing data related to start and completion of the download . For example a download status may be maintained with possible status values including for example completed aborted and in progress. A timestamp may be recorded for example when a download starts when a download completes and when a download is abandoned or halted.

The system generates a download detail record based on the identified content file the identified size and the monitored status of the download . illustrates an example table of example DDRs and . Each DDR and includes the following fields status file name size finished time lapsed time and start time . Each DDR and may include a value for each of the fields and for some DDRs some of the fields and may be empty or NULL . The DDR indicates that a download of file File1.m4v of size one hundred twenty and two tenths megabytes MB began on July twentieth at 1 03 04 and finished thirty minutes and twelve seconds later at 1 33 16. The DDR indicates that a download of the file File2.m4v of size thirty seven and three tenths MB began on July twentieth at 1 03 20 and that the download is still in progress with a last recorded lapsed time of ten minutes eleven seconds.

Content playing activity may be stored in a PDR. Generating a PDR is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system identifies a content identifier of a content file being played by a media player downloader device included in a media system . A content file may be identified for example by a content file name e.g. title and or by a content file identifier. A content file title may be identified using a content identification platform e.g. platform that compares a digital signature of the content file to digital signatures of known content files.

The system identifies a media player identifier for the media player downloader device included in the media system . For example the media player downloader device may retrieve a media player identifier identifying the media player downloader device from electronic storage of the media player downloader device. As another example a media player identifier may be retrieved from a database external to the media player downloader device.

The system monitors commands controlling playing of the content file by the media player downloader device and timing data associated with the commands . For example the media player downloader device may record in response to actions such as play stop fast forward rewind or genre browse an indicator of the action and a timestamp of the action.

The system generates a play detail record based on the content identifier the media player identifier and the monitored commands and timing data . illustrates an example table of example PDRs and . Each PDR and includes the following fields player identifier content identifier command start time and end time . Each PDR and may include a value for each of the fields and for some PDRs some of the fields and may be empty or NULL .

The PDR indicates that a content file with identifier 654123 was played on June twenty second from time 1 02 11 to 1 02 19 on a media player downloader device with identifier 234567 . In some implementations the PDR may also be stored in addition to the PDR . The PDR indicates that playing of the content file with identifier 654123 was stopped on the media player downloader device with identifier 234567 at 1 02 19 on June twenty second. The PDR indicates that the content file with identifier 654123 was fast forwarded on June twenty second starting at time 2 20 11 and ending at time 2 20 19 on the media player downloader device with identifier 234567 . The PDR indicates that the content file with identifier 654123 was rewound on June twenty second starting at 4 55 12 and ending at time 4 56 22 on the media player downloader device with identifier 234567 . The PDR indicates that a streaming content file with identifier 655227 was played on June twenty third starting at time 3 48 19 and ending at time 4 48 11 on the media player downloader device with identifier 234567 .

Remote control activity may be stored in a RDR. Generating a RDR is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system detects an action taken by a remote control that controls operation of a media system . For example a user may select a button on the remote control such as a play button stop button rewind button fast forward button genre up button genre down button channel up button channel down button or call button.

The system identifies a remote control identifier for the remote control that controls operation of the media system . For example a remote control identifier may be retrieved from electronic storage of the remote control. As another example a remote control identifier may be retrieved from a database external to the remote control.

The system identifies a channel identifier for a channel associated with the action taken by the remote control to the extent one exists . For example some but not all remote control actions correspond to a channel. For example actions which have an associated channel identifier may include play stop fast forward rewind channel up channel down and switch to channel. Actions which do not relate to a channel include for example genre up genre down and place call. A channel identifier may be identified based on a current channel number e.g. a content file acted on may be playing on a current channel . A channel identifier may be identified based on a channel number of a switched to channel e.g. based on a channel up channel down or switch to channel action .

The system identifies a content identifier for content associated with the action taken by the remote control to the extent one exists . For example some but not all remote control actions correspond to a content file. For example actions which have an associated content identifier may include play stop fast forward and rewind. Actions which do not relate to a content file include for example genre up genre down place call channel up and channel down. A content identifier for an acted on content file may be identified for example by the remote control and or by the media player downloader device.

The system determines timing data related to the action taken by the remote control . For example a timestamp may be recorded when an action is performed using the remote control.

The system generates a remote control detail record based on the detected action the remote control identifier the channel identifier the content identifier and the determined timing data . illustrates an example table of example RDRs and . Each RDR and may include for example the following fields a remote control identifier a channel identifier a content identifier an action indicator a start time and an end time for some RDRs some of the fields and may be empty or NULL .

The RDR indicates that a remote control with identifier 234567 initiated a play action of a content file with identifier 654123 on a channel number one at time 1 03 13 on June twenty second. The RDR indicates that playback of the same content file was stopped at time 1 03 29 using the same remote control. The RDR indicates that the same remote control was used to initiate a call at time 1 04 14 on June twenty second and that the call ended at time 1 04 19.

The RDR indicates that a user logged into a remote control with identifier 234563 on June twenty second at time 1 05 11. The RDR indicates that a user used the same remote control to browse content items on a channel number two starting at time 1 05 11 on June twenty second and ending at time 1 05 21. The RDR indicates that the same remote control was used to view preview content for a content file with identifier 654135 starting at time 1 05 21 on June twenty second and ending at time 1 05 22. The RDR indicates that the same remote control was used to fast forward the content file beginning at time 1 05 22 on June twenty second and ending at time 1 05 23. The RDR indicates that the same remote control was used to browse genres starting at time 1 05 25 on June twenty second and ending at time 1 05 28.

Returning to the system tracks data descriptive of use of the media system based on the monitoring . For example content playing activity may be stored in one or more PDRs content download activity may be stored in one or more DDRs and remote control activity may be stored in one or more RDRs. For example and in reference to one or more PDRs DDRs and RDRs may be stored in the end user database . The PDR may include information such as the information illustrated in the PDR the DDR may include information such as the information illustrated in the DDR and the RDR may include information such as the information illustrated in the RDR .

The system performs one or more operations related to at least one of the media system and the content delivery network based on the tracked data descriptive of use of the media system . Performing one or more operations based on the tracked data is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system aggregates tracked activity data for multiple different media systems that leverage a content delivery network . For example and in reference to the end user database may be queried for tracked activity data for multiple media systems e.g. media player device that leverage the content delivery network . Tracked activity data may include for example content download activity content playing activity and remote control activity.

The system analyzes the aggregated activity data to detect activity patterns of the multiple different media systems . For example illustrates example detected activity patterns and . The pattern corresponds to detecting based on monitoring activity patterns of multiple users a place in a content file to which users frequently fast forward or rewind. The pattern corresponds to detecting based on monitoring multiple downloads of multiple content files by multiple users a frequently downloaded content file with a relatively long download duration time. The pattern corresponds to identifying multiple users with similar activity patterns. For example groups of users may be identified where each user in a group subscribes to the same set or to a similar set of channels and or plays the same or similar content files.

Returning to the system determines one or more operations related to the content delivery network based on one or more detected activity patterns . For instance in the example of an operation may be determined based on the pattern an operation may be determined based on the pattern and an operation may be determined based on the pattern . The operation corresponds to setting a hot index at the place in content detected in the pattern e.g. the place in content to which users frequently fast forward or rewind .

The operation corresponds to improving download speed of the frequently downloaded content file with relatively long download duration time detected in the pattern . For example the content file may be cached such as to one or more proxy caches associated with one or more network service providers. As another example the content file may be compressed or further compressed to decrease the size of the content file and to decrease the download duration time.

The operation corresponds to grouping the identified users with similar activity patterns and taking action for the group. For example users with similar activity patterns may be grouped into a social network. If one or more users of the group subscribe to a new channel or download a new content file the new channel or new content file may be suggested to all members of the group.

Returning to the system performs the determined one or more operations related to the content delivery network . For instance in the example of the operation may be performed e.g. setting a hot index at the detected place in content the operation may be performed e.g. caching or compressing the frequently downloaded content file and the operation may be performed e.g. grouping users with similar activity patterns into a social network and suggesting content to group members based on new content identified by one or more individual group members . In these examples the operations impact multiple users media systems included in the content delivery network.

The system aggregates tracked activity data for a media system that leverages a content delivery network . For example and in reference to the end user database may be queried for tracked activity data for the media player device . Tracked activity data may include for example content download activity performed using the downloader device content playing activity performed using the media player device and remote control activity performed using the remote control device .

The system analyzes the aggregated activity data to detect activity patterns of the media system . For example illustrates example detected activity patterns and . The patterns and correspond to recognizing an activity pattern of the user of the media system associated with a particular feature. For example a user may have activity patterns which indicate that the user has an interest in sports that the user has children that the user owns their home that the user lives in a particular region or that some other interest or demographic characteristic applies to the user. For example a pattern of subscribing to children oriented channels and or watching children oriented content files may be associated with a user having children.

The pattern corresponds to detecting duplicate download requests of a content file associated with multiple channels. For example one content file may be added to two or more different channels. A first download request may be associated with the inclusion of the content file in a first channel and a second download request may be associated with the inclusion of the content file in a second channel.

Returning to the system determines one or more operations related to the media system based on one or more detected activity patterns . For instance in the example of an operation may be determined based on the pattern an operation may be determined based on the pattern and an operation may be determined based on the pattern . The operations and correspond to inferring that the user has the feature associated with the activity pattern recognized in patterns and respectively e.g. inferring that the user has children that the user is interested in sports that the user lives in a particular region .

The operation includes suggesting a channel to a user based on the inferred feature. For example a children s programming channel sports channel or regional channel may be suggested to the user. The operation includes targeting an advertisement to the user based on the inferred feature. For example an advertisement for children s products sports equipment or a regional establishment may be targeted to the user.

The operation corresponds to stopping redundant download of the content file associated with multiple channels e.g. to avoid downloading multiple copies of the content file to the same media player downloader device . For example the content file may be downloaded once and multiple channels may be controlled to reference the single content file. A reference count may be maintained to represent the number of channels associated with the content file. In some implementations the reference count may be decremented when the content file is watched on a particular channel and the content file may be marked as available for deletion if the reference count reaches zero.

Returning to the system performs the determined one or more operations related to the media system . For instance in the example of the operation may be performed e.g. suggesting a channel to a user based on an inferred feature the operation may be performed e.g. targeting an advertisement to a user based on an inferred feature and the operation may be performed e.g. stopping redundant download of a content file associated with multiple channels and controlling the multiple channels to reference a single content file .

The system accesses tracked content download activity data . For example and in reference to one or more DDRs may be accessed from the end user database .

The system accesses tracked content playing activity data . For example and in reference to one or more PDRs may be accessed from the end user database .

The system accesses tracked remote control activity data . For example and in reference to one or more RDRs may be accessed from the end user database .

The system analyzes a combination of two or more of the tracked content download activity data the tracked content playing activity data and the tracked remote control activity data to detect activity patterns . For example and as illustrated in a pattern of remote control activity relative to content playing activity may be detected. As another example a pattern of remote control activity during content playing activity may be detected. As yet another example a pattern of content playing activity relative to content download activity may be detected. Other patterns may be possible such as a pattern relating remote control activity to content download activity or to a pattern relating content playing activity content download activity and remote control activity.

The pattern may include for example detecting that a user typically uses a remote control after a certain amount of time has passed since starting content playback. For example it may be detected that a user typically uses the remote control one minute or ten minutes after starting content playback. As another example the pattern may include detecting that a user often browses preview content of upcoming content on a channel while watching a currently playing content item on a channel. The pattern may include for example detecting an amount of remote control activity that a user performs while watching content. The pattern may include for example detecting a pattern of how soon a user watches a content file after a content file is downloaded. For example some users may typically watch a content file within one day of when the content file is downloaded and other users may typically watch a content file on average ten days after a content file is downloaded.

The system determines one or more operations based on one or more activity patterns detected by analyzing the combination of tracked data . For instance in the example of an operation may be determined based on the pattern an operation may be determined based on the pattern and an operation may be determined based on the pattern . The operation corresponds to controlling delivery and presentation of content on the remote control based on the detected pattern of remote control activity relative to content playing activity. For example the operation may include targeting advertisements to a user for display on the remote control at a time when the user typically uses the remote control. As another example the operation may include preloading preview content onto a remote control for channels for which the user typically views preview content.

The operation may include for example decreasing a weighting of a user s watching of content if the user is performing an amount of remote control activity above a threshold while viewing the content. For example a weighting used to determine an amount to charge for advertising played during the playing of the content may be decreased if the user s remote control activity indicates that the user may not have been paying attention to the content. The operation may include for example prioritizing download of content to users who typically view content shortly after content is downloaded and assigning a lesser priority to download of content to users who typically wait for a longer time before watching downloaded content.

Returning to the system performs the determined one or more operations . For instance in the example of the operation may be performed e.g. controlling delivery and presentation of content based on a pattern of remote control activity relative to content playing activity the operation may be performed e.g. reducing impact of content playing activity because of use of the remote control during content playing and the operation may be performed e.g. controlling download of new content based on a detected pattern of content playing activity relative to content download activity .

The system accesses tracked activity data for media systems that leverage a content delivery network . For example and in reference to the end user database may be queried for tracked activity data for multiple media systems e.g. media player device that leverage the content delivery network . Tracked activity data may include for example content download activity content playing activity and remote control activity. The content download activity the content playing activity and the remote control activity may relate to entertainment content that a user experiences for entertainment purposes and or may relate to advertisement content. When the content download activity the content playing activity and the remote control activity relates to advertisement content the system tracks when and which advertisements are downloaded and played and tracks remote control activity related to the advertisement content.

The system calculates usage statistics for channels and content files made available through the content delivery network based on the tracked activity data . For example the system may determine how many times a content file has been watched e.g. in general or by users living in a particular geographic region the number of subscribers for a channel e.g. in general or users living in a particular geographic region or how many times a channel has been watched. Usage statistics may be calculated for example based on the tracked content download activity content playing activity and remote control activity. The system also may track usage statistics for advertisement content files. For instance the system may track statistics on which existing advertisements are played how many times paused rewound etc. The system may use the usage statistics for advertisement content files for the purpose of determining which future advertisements to push to the user.

The system determines revenue sharing among entities associated with the content delivery network based on the calculated usage statistics . For example illustrates a system which includes a content delivery network . A content curator and a content owner are associated with the content delivery network . The content curator may define one or more channels using a content curator portal and the content owner may make one or more licensed content items available over the content delivery network .

A revenue sharing engine may calculate revenue sharing among the content curator the content owner and the owner of the content delivery network . The revenue sharing engine may determine revenue sharing based on usage statistics calculated based on activity data accessed from an end user database . For example based on usage statistics calculated from data from DDRs and PDRs from the end user database thirty percent of generated revenue may be allocated for the content curator thirty percent for the content owner and forty percent for the owner of the content delivery network .
