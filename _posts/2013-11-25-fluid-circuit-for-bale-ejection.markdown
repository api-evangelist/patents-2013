title: Fluid circuit for bale ejection
abstract: A hydraulic circuit mechanically link to a tailgate of an agriculture harvester. The hydraulic circuit of the present invention can be used to facilitate the transition of hydraulic states from a quick speed to a slow speed, when opening and closing the tailgate. The hydraulic circuit comprises a restrictive orifice and a fluid stop valve that, when opened, diverts the path of pressurized fluid away from a hydraulic actuator during the actuator's extension. The diversion of pressurized fluid away from the hydraulic cylinder or through the restrictive orifice substantially reduces the speed at which the panel opens or closes.

The present invention relates generally to package crop balers and more particularly to an improved system and method of raising and closing a tailgate of a baling mechanism.

For many years agricultural balers have been used to consolidate and package crop material so as to facilitate the storage and handling of the crop material for later use. Usually a mower conditioner cuts and conditions the crop material for windrow drying in the sun. When the cut crop material is properly dried a round baler is pulled along the windrows to pick up the crop material and form it into cylindrically shaped round bales. More specifically the pickup of the baler gathers the cut and windrowed crop material from the ground and then conveys the cut crop material with a conveyor such as a rotating conveying rotor into a bale forming chamber within the baler. The pickup assembly has a drive mechanism that operates to activate both the pickup and the conveying rotor and the pickup drive mechanism is operably connected to and driven by the main drive mechanism of the baler. The baling chamber consists of a pair of opposing sidewalls with a series of belts that rotate and compress the crop material into a cylindrical shape. When the bale has achieved a desired size and density the round baler wraps the bale with twine or other wrapping material such as film or net to ensure that the bale maintains its shape and density. Then the operator raises the tailgate of the baler and ejects the bale onto the ground. The tailgate is then closed and the cycle repeated as necessary and desired to manage the field of cut crop material.

The rotor conveyor mechanism rotor or rotor mechanism between the pickup and the bale forming chamber is usually referred to as the stuffer because it stuffs the crop material into the gap between the floor roll and the starter roll into the bale forming chamber.

Opening and closing of the tailgate has been controlled by a flow valve which was located between a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid and an actuator. The position of the flow valve was controlled by a hydraulic lever. To increase efficiency the rate of opening and closing of the tailgate should be rapid. However such rapid movement of the tailgate can lead to damage to the baler. Therefore to slow the rate of opening and closing near the end of the opening or closing portion of the cycle the hydraulic valve has been feathered by positioning the hydraulic lever between its fully open position and its fully closed position. This solution depends on the skill of the operator and requires the attention of the operator.

Exemplary prior art tailgate opening and closing mechanisms which do not vary the speed of opening or closing are shown in Viesselmann et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 622 104 and Anderson U.S. Pat. No. 6 272 825. Biziorek et al. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0247215 discloses a round baler that varies the speed of the opening and closing of the tailgate using tailgate position sensors.

In order to prevent rapid decelerations of the tailgate when it meets its closing stops the Viesselmann system includes an orifice that continuously slows the flow of oil to and from the tailgate hydraulic actuators to effectively cushion the closing of the tailgate. The flow restriction valve assembly of Anderson is either open or closed and prevents the tailgate from slamming shut. The result is that the tailgate motion is slowed and the open and close cycle time of the tailgate is increased making the baling operation less efficient.

To improve efficiency it is desirable to restrict flow of the fluid to the actuator only near the end of the opening and closing motions. While the flow of hydraulic fluid to the tailgate actuator of Biziorek is regulated by valve device the control system of Biziorek requires a number of positional sensors to determine the position of the tailgate. The addition of the positional sensors increases the cost of the baler due to increased installation cost as well as the addition of components that are subject to failure. Additionally an important functional limitation of Biziorek is the valve in the fluid circuit that forcibly causes the hydraulic system to change speed when either in a closed or open state.

The embodiments provided herein provide for an improved baler by providing faster and smoother tailgate operation and providing less stress on the tailgate that is involved in ejecting the bale with efficient operation and advantages over prior controllers of tailgate operation. Rather than forcibly causing the tailgate to close by opening and shutting of a single valve some embodiments accomplish a smoother opening and closing function the tailgate by utilization of the combination of one or more check valves and a restrictive orifice which cause back pressure in the circuit. Float of the tailgate is accomplished while the tailgate is in a substantially open positions and while the circuit is in one or more of the hydraulic states described herein.

Embodiments of the present invention address and overcome one or more of the above shortcomings and drawbacks by providing agricultural harvesters including balers and combines that comprise the disclosed hydraulic circuit so that crop material is more efficiently transported and ejected from the bale chamber. This technology is particularly well suited for but by no means limited to round balers cotton harvesters and or combines comprising a baling mechanism.

The first hydraulic path also comprises the return of pressurized fluid from the hydraulic cylinder to the tractor in a second length of the first hydraulic path. The steady flow of pressurized fluid into the disc side of the hydraulic cylinder and out of the rod side of the hydraulic cylinder causes the extension of the actuator and the quick opening of the tailgate not depicted . In this first hydraulic state fluid stop valve A is closed.

A baler controller measures the amount of time T it takes for the cylinder to open a first switch SW and close a second switch SW. From this time the controller can determine how fast the tailgate is moving and how far the tailgate has moved. When the baler controller determines that the tailgate has reached a predetermined or preprogrammed distance from its fully closed position or a desired distance in some embodiments nearing the end of stroke or that it is open sufficiently wide to eject the growing bale in the bale chamber the second switch SW closes and the first switch SW opens thereby causing the fluid controller to open Valve A. The close of switch SW and the opening of fluid stop valve A indicates the transition from the first hydraulic state to the second hydraulic state.

The third hydraulic state is depicted in . Similar to the opening phase of the tailgate depicted in the closing phase of the tailgate is accomplished by at least two hydraulic states each corresponding to its own hydraulic path. Once the flow of pressurized fluid has reversed a first length of the third hydraulic path involves flow of pressurized fluid from the source of the pressurized fluid freely flows to the second fluid opening of the hydraulic cylinder building a volume of fluid in the rod end of the hydraulic cylinder and causing the return of fluid from the disc end of the hydraulic cylinder to the source of pressurized fluid . The arrow labeled F depicts the movement of the rod and disc in the hydraulic cylinder . This completes a first hydraulic path. A second hydraulic path of the third hydraulic state comprises pressurized fluid from the disc end of the hydraulic cylinder exiting the first fluid opening of the hydraulic cylinder and returning to the source of the pressurized fluid through fluid stop valve A and through a third check valve C. Free flow of pressurized fluid into the second fluid opening causes a quick closing phase to a predetermined distance calculated by the baler controller a predetermined time T calculated by the baler controller or manually engaged the operator who can trigger the first or second switches SW SW. Free flow of pressurized fluid from the hydraulic cylinder to the source of the pressurized fluid is accomplished by open fluid stop valve A so that fluid bypasses the restrictive orifice . The tailgate closes at a steady rate. After triggering the baler controller or optionally reversing the states of the switches SW SW from a first to second or second to first state the hydraulic circuit transitions from a third hydraulic state to a fourth hydraulic state. In alternative embodiments the position of one or more serpentine arms in the baling mechanism may trigger the transition from a first to a second hydraulic state and or from a third hydraulic state to a fourth hydraulic state. Serpentine arms are generally known in the art and are in operable connection with one or more baling belts of a baling mechanism. The serpentine arm or arms are designed to move generally upward or downward to add or remove slack in the one or more baling belt while a bale is changing size within a baling mechanism. Due to the one or more serpentine arms changing position as the bale grows in some embodiments transition from a first to a second hydraulic state and or from the third hydraulic state to the fourth hydraulic state may depend wholly or partially on the position or movement of one or more serpentine arms. One or more triggers for such a transition may occur by the presence of positional or optical sensor at a particular height within a bale chamber or baling mechanism.

In a fourth hydraulic state depicted in the tailgate is transitioned from a quick closing motion to a slow closing motion by closing fluid stop valve A. The first length of the fourth hydraulic path is identical to the first length of the third hydraulic path but by closing fluid stop valve A pressurized fluid from the disc end of the hydraulic cylinder is forced to pass through the restrictive orifice . The restrictive orifice only allows slow flowing pressurized fluid to return to the source of the pressurized fluid bypassing the first one way check valve . In a fourth hydraulic state the rod and disc of the hydraulic cylinders float to a fully closed position the fully closed position denoted by dotted lines in the hydraulic cylinder .

At or near the end of the tailgate close stop valve A is closed. In the embodiment depicted in switch SW is triggered by the contracting singe acting hydraulic cylinder . The flow from the hydraulic cylinder through the fluid opening and into the hydraulic system with the stop valve closed comprises a hydraulic path comprising the flow of pressurized fluid through the restrictive orifice . Flow of the fluid through the restrictive orifice creates a slow deceleration of the rate at which the cylinder contracts thereby slowing and floating a tailgate of the baling mechanism in operable connection with the single acting cylinder . Dotted lines beside the hydraulic path in represent the slow rate of flow of the pressurized fluid in the circuit after it passes through the restrictive orifice .
