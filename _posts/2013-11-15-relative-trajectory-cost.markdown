As air traffic and the number of airline flights continue to grow congestion and delays are becoming an increasing concern. When new programs are implemented to alleviate congestion and delays airlines must determine how to participate in the programs while maintaining the airlines operational efficiencies.

Illustrative examples of the present disclosure include without limitation a method device and computer readable storage medium. In one aspect a method for determining routes in a Collaborative Trajectory Options Program CTOP enabled Air Traffic Management system is described. A first trajectory with a lowest Network Cost and having an assumed ground delay is identified. A Relative Trajectory Cost of zero is assigned to the first trajectory. A second trajectory is identified and the assumed ground delay of the first trajectory is iteratively incremented until a Network Cost for the first trajectory including the assumed ground delay is approximately equivalent to the Network Cost of the second trajectory. A Relative Trajectory Cost for the second trajectory is determined based at least in part on the iteratively incremented assumed ground delay which was added to the first trajectory in order to make the Network Cost of the two trajectories approximately equivalent.

In another aspect a device configured to determine routes in a Collaborative Trajectory Options Program CTOP enabled Air Traffic Management system is provided. The device may include a processor and memory. A first route is determined and a first network cost and ground delay associated with the first route are determined A relative trajectory cost is assigned to the first route. A second route is identified and the ground delay for the first route is iteratively incremented until a second network cost associated with the second trajectory is approximately equivalent to the first network cost. A relative trajectory cost for the second trajectory is determined based at least in part on the iteratively incremented ground delay for the first route.

In another aspect a computer readable storage medium is provided. One or more trajectories for a given departure destination are identified. Relative trajectory costs for the one or more trajectories are determined based at least in part on associated network costs and assumed ground delays. An ordered list of the one or more trajectories is determined based on the determined relative trajectory costs.

Other features of the disclosure are described below. The features functions and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various examples or may be combined in yet other examples further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.

Congestion and uncontrollable events such as adverse weather often cause significant delays to commercial airplane flights. If a constraint such as adverse weather is in the airspace along a flight route and an airline has only one flight plan filed that takes a flight through that constraint then the only option for that flight is to accept a ground delay or manually cancel and re file a flight plan that takes the flight outside the constraint. A prolonged ground hold may lead to delay propagation passenger misconnections and crew misconnections and different trajectories having different fuel burn costs.

The Federal Aviation Administration FAA is planning to implement a new traffic management initiative referred to as the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program CTOP to better balance demand with capacity and manage the constrained airspace resource in specific areas. Under the CTOP program an airline may submit trajectory options that the airline is willing to be assigned for a given flight. Each trajectory option may be submitted along with a Relative Trajectory Cost RTC value indicating how many minutes the airline is willing to hold on the ground on its most preferred trajectory compared to a secondary trajectory option. However one problem is that airlines may not have the capability or may otherwise have difficulties determining the most advantageous route preferences and comparing one trajectory to another trajectory. Consequently it may be difficult for an airline to translate their operational impacts into a single number of minutes as the RTC value currently requires. This disclosure describes a method for calculating the full operational impact of the RTC values and thus ensuring that the most beneficial trajectory priorities from the airline point of view are communicated to Air Traffic Management ATM . The present disclosure describes methods for determining preferred trajectory options by taking into account operational impacts such as fuel burn schedule passengers and crew as illustrated in .

Under the CTOP program operators submit alternative routes of their choice around or away from a constraint thus providing additional options for air traffic controllers to expedite flights away from congested airspace. Such options may be submitted as a trajectory option set TOS . Flights that have submitted a trajectory option set may be exempt from ground delays or in flight reroutes associated with such constraints. If an airline is participating in the CTOP program and has submitted a TOS with multiple route options that the airline would be willing to consider to fly around a constraint re routing may be performed automatically. For example when a constraint is identified a flight may be automatically be placed on a route that the airline has pre selected to avoid the constraint.

Referring to illustrated is a flight route map including a constraint . Under the CTOP program airlines may submit various trajectory options which the airlines are willing to accept for a given flight e.g. departure destination pair . These trajectories are expressed as a TOS. A message describing the TOS may be sent to ATM for flights affected by the constraint. One example of the contents of a TOS message is shown in . The Relative Trajectory Cost RTC is shown in the leftmost column of . In this example the most preferred trajectory has an RTC value of zero. The second preferred option has an RTC value of 30. These RTC values express to ATM that in case the most preferred trajectory is associated with a ground hold of at least 30 minutes while the second trajectory currently has no ground hold then the second trajectory will be awarded to the airline. More specifically ATM will sum the RTC value for each trajectory with the required ground hold for the trajectory. This sum may be denoted as S. The flight will be assigned the trajectory which has the lowest S value.

In one example illustrated in the disclosed method may be implemented in a system that includes a disruption management function and a flight planning engine . The disruption management function and flight planning engine may have access to operational information regarding flight schedule crew passengers and flight trajectories. The disruption management function may be configured to determine an optimal combination of recovery actions in order to recover from an operational disruption to the flight schedule. Together with the recovery determination a Network Cost may be provided based on the current state of the network. This Network Cost may include the cost of recovering disrupted passengers recovering crew and recovering aircraft. This may be further illustrated in . The Network Cost may also be referred to as Extended Network Cost in some implementations.

In some example implementations the disruption management function and flight planning engine may also be configured to determine an optimal selection of flight trajectories from a network point of view. The disruption management function and flight planning engine may be configured to ensure that flight trajectories are not only determined from the operation of a single flight but rather from the optimal operation of the entire airline network. The disruption management function and flight planning engine may for example take fuel and congested air sectors into account. The disruption management function and flight planning engine may also be configured to calculate an Extended Network Cost ENC which takes passenger impact trajectories and fuel into account as shown below in one example.

Aspects of the disruption management function and flight planning engine are further described in Bo Vaaben Sustainable Disruption Management 2012 ISBN 978 87 92706 03 4 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In one example implementation the Extended Network Cost may be used to calculate the RTC values using the following process.

The lowest cost trajectory A in a TOS which may in one example have the lowest fuel burn is assigned RTC 0 and the Extended Network Cost is calculated. This is denoted ENC A d where d is the assumed ground delay associated with this trajectory.

The RTC of a second trajectory option B is calculated by letting the ground hold of trajectory A increase incrementally until ENC A d ENC B 0 .

For example referring to the example shown in the TOS includes six trajectories. In this example two trajectories marked T and T are considered. The lowest cost trajectory with the lowest fuel burn is trajectory T which is assigned RTC 0. Other trajectories will have their RTC values calculated relative to this trajectory. It is noted that trajectory T traverses the most capacitated part of the Flow Control Area FCA which is marked as the thicker line of constraint in . The most capacitated part of the Flow Control Area is likely to apply ground holding for this trajectory. The Extended Network Cost for trajectory T is however initially calculated using the assumption of zero ground holding. Following the notation from above we denote this as ENC T 0 .

Next the RTC value for trajectory T is calculated which is calculated using the method described above. Initially ENC T 0 is calculated. Assuming an incremental ground hold step of 5 minutes the following values may be calculated 

Using the above procedure the RTC values may be calculated to take into account the entire network operation impact of choosing one trajectory over another for a CTOP flight.

Operation illustrates assigning trajectory T with RTC 0. Operation illustrates calculating the Extended Network Cost for trajectory T assuming no ground delay. This may be denoted ENC T d where d is the assumed ground delay associated with this trajectory. The RTC of the second trajectory option T may be calculated by letting the ground hold of trajectory T increase incrementally until the ENC T d ENC T 0 .

Operation illustrates that X is the current delay where d denotes the incremental ground hold. In this example an incremental ground hold step of 5 minutes is used. It should be understood that the incremental ground hold step d can be other values of time or other unit as appropriate. The RTC value for trajectory T may be calculated using the method described above. ENC T X for trajectory T with X minutes delay is calculated in operation . Operation illustrates determining if ENC T X ENC T 0 . If the values are not approximately equivalent then operation may be followed by operation . Operation illustrates incrementing X by the incremental ground hold of 5 minutes and operation may be followed by operation . If the values are approximately equivalent then operation may be followed by operation . Operation illustrates assigning X as the calculated RTC for T.
