title: Code-based RFID loss-prevention system
abstract: In RFID systems employed for loss prevention, an item supplier or an ingress reader writes an ownership code associated with an organization or facility into a tag, indicating that an item to which the tag is attached is associated with the facility and not foreign. At checkout or point-of-sale an authorization reader or mobile device writes a computed code and/or a ticket into the tag indicating that the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility. At point-of-exit an exit reader determines if the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility by verifying the ownership code and the code or ticket. The loss-prevention system may issue an alert or sound an alarm if a facility-associated item is leaving the facility without a proper code or ticket indicating that the item is approved to leave.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 890 628 filed on Sep. 25 2010 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 593 257 on Nov. 26 2013. The disclosures of this patent application are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Radio Frequency Identification RFID systems typically include RFID readers also known as RFID reader writers or RFID interrogators and RFID tags. RFID systems can be used in many ways for locating and identifying objects to which the tags are attached. RFID systems are useful in product related and service related industries for tracking objects being processed inventoried or handled. In such cases an RFID tag is usually attached to an individual item or to its package.

In principle RFID techniques entail using an RFID reader to interrogate one or more RFID tags. The reader transmitting a Radio Frequency RF wave performs the interrogation. The RF wave is typically electromagnetic at least in the far field. The RF wave can also be predominantly electric or magnetic in the near field. The RF wave may encode one or more commands that instruct the tags to perform one or more actions.

A tag that senses the interrogating RF wave may respond by transmitting back another RF wave. The tag either generates the transmitted back RF wave originally or by reflecting back a portion of the interrogating RF wave in a process known as backscatter. Backscatter may take place in a number of ways.

The reflected back RF wave may encode data stored in the tag such as a number. The response is demodulated and decoded by the reader which thereby identifies counts or otherwise interacts with the associated item. The decoded data can denote a serial number a price a date a destination other attribute s any combination of attributes and so on. Accordingly when a reader receives tag data it can learn about the item that hosts the tag and or about the tag itself.

An RFID tag typically includes an antenna section a radio section a power management section and frequently a logical section a memory or both. In some RFID tags the power management section included an energy storage device such as a battery. RFID tags with an energy storage device are known as battery assisted semi active or active tags. Other RFID tags can be powered solely by the RF signal they receive. Such RFID tags do not include an energy storage device and are called passive tags. Of course even passive tags typically include temporary energy and data flag storage elements such as capacitors or inductors.

RFID technology may be employed in loss prevention systems used for example by retailers. Point of Exit PoE readers deployed at store exits read tagged items exiting the store and determine if the item is approved to leave. However the determination can be challenging. In one approach a store database maintains information about all items in the store and indicates if an item is approved to leave. The PoE reader then checks the database for approval. Unfortunately implementing the database may be costly and or complex especially for large stores that contain a large number of items multiple entrances and exits and multiple Point of Sale or checkout registers collectively PoS that must continually update the database.

In another approach the tags themselves retain information about whether they are approved to leave the store and the PoE reader checks each tag for approval. Authorization readers at PoS may write a bit or bits to each tag indicating that the item is approved to leave. Unfortunately this approach is susceptible to thieves using unauthorized readers to illegitimately set the bit or bits typically necessitating a password based authorization system that is complicated to maintain and use and is itself susceptible to attack.

Finally for both approaches foreign tags entering a store such as a tag carried by a consumer on his or her person may further complicate the situation because the PoE reader must determine if a departing item is foreign or stolen.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Embodiments are directed to RFID systems for loss prevention. An ownership code OC associated with an organization or facility is stored in a tag indicating that an item to which the tag is attached is associated with the facility and not foreign a foreign tag indicates an item not associated with the facility . In one embodiment an authorization reader writes a code or abridged code computed by an algorithm into the tag to indicate that the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility. The code may be based on information stored in the tag such as the tag s item identifier or other tag information collectively an item identifier or II and or other information such as the OC or an authorization reader identifier. The code may be generated based on a secret or private key associated with the facility in which case the code is referred to as a digital signature DS . The authorization reader may also or instead write a temporal parameter TP to the tag or use the TP to compute the code. A TP may include a ticket value selected from a scratchlist may be based on a date or time for example a date and or time of the authorization for the tagged item to be removed may be based on the location or identity of the authorization reader and or may be based on information stored on the tag e.g. tag item identifiers . A PoE reader verifies that for items whose OC is associated with the facility the code abridged code and or TP stored on the tag are legitimate or proper and therefore the item is approved to leave the facility.

These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of aspects as claimed.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. These embodiments or examples may be combined other aspects may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.

As used herein memory is one of ROM RAM SRAM DRAM NVM EEPROM FLASH Fuse MRAM FRAM and other similar information storage technologies as will be known to those skilled in the art. Some portions of memory may be writeable and some not. Command refers to a reader request for one or more tags to perform one or more actions. Protocol refers to an industry standard for communications between a reader and a tag and vice versa such as the Class 1 Generation 2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz 960 MHz by EPCglobal Inc. Gen2 Specification version 1.2.0 of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reader and tag communicate via signals and . When communicating each encodes modulates and transmits data to the other and each receives demodulates and decodes data from the other. The data can be modulated onto and demodulated from RF waveforms. The RF waveforms are typically in a suitable range of frequencies such as those near 900 MHz 13.56 MHz and so on.

The communication between reader and tag uses symbols also called RFID symbols. A symbol can be a delimiter a calibration value and so on. Symbols can be implemented for exchanging binary data such as 0 and 1 if that is desired. When symbols are processed by reader and tag they can be treated as values numbers and so on.

Tag can be a passive tag or an active or battery assisted tag i.e. a tag having its own power source . When tag is a passive tag it is powered from signal .

Tag is typically although not necessarily formed on a substantially planar inlay which can be made in many ways known in the art. Tag includes a circuit which may be implemented as an IC . In some embodiments IC is implemented in complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS technology. In other embodiments IC may be implemented in other technologies such as bipolar junction transistor BJT technology metal semiconductor field effect transistor MESFET technology and others as will be well known to those skilled in the art. IC is arranged on inlay .

Tag also includes an antenna for exchanging wireless signals with its environment. The antenna is often flat and attached to inlay . IC is electrically coupled to the antenna via suitable antenna contacts not shown in . The term electrically coupled as used herein may mean a direct electrical connection or it may mean a connection that includes one or more intervening circuit blocks elements or devices. The electrical part of the term electrically coupled as used in this document shall mean a coupling that is one or more of ohmic galvanic capacitive and or inductive.

IC is shown with a single antenna port comprising two antenna contacts electrically coupled to two antenna segments and which are shown here forming a dipole. Many other embodiments are possible using any number of ports contacts antennas and or antenna segments.

In operation the antenna receives a signal and communicates it to IC which both harvests power and responds if appropriate based on the incoming signal and the IC s internal state. If IC uses backscatter modulation then it responds by modulating the antenna s reflectance which generates response signal from signal transmitted by the reader. Electrically coupling and uncoupling the antenna contacts of IC can modulate the antenna s reflectance as can varying the admittance of a shunt connected circuit element which is coupled to the antenna contacts. Varying the impedance of a series connected circuit element is another means of modulating the antenna s reflectance.

In the embodiments of B and C antenna segments and are separate from IC . In other embodiments the antenna segments may alternatively be formed on IC . Tag antennas according to embodiments may be designed in any form and are not limited to dipoles. For example the tag antenna may be a patch a slot a loop a coil a horn a spiral a monopole microstrip stripline or any other suitable antenna.

The components of the RFID system of may communicate with each other in any number of modes. One such mode is called full duplex. Another such mode is called half duplex and is described below.

RFID reader and RFID tag talk and listen to each other by taking turns. As seen on axis TIME when reader talks to tag the communication session is designated as R T and when tag talks to reader the communication session is designated as T R . Along the TIME axis a sample R T communication session occurs during a time interval and a following sample T R communication session occurs during a time interval . Of course interval is typically of a different duration than interval here the durations are shown approximately equal only for purposes of illustration.

According to blocks and RFID reader talks during interval and listens during interval . According to blocks and RFID tag listens while reader talks during interval and talks while reader listens during interval .

In terms of actual behavior during interval reader talks to tag as follows. According to block reader transmits signal which was first described in . At the same time according to block tag receives signal and processes it to extract data and so on. Meanwhile according to block tag does not backscatter with its antenna and according to block reader has no signal to receive from tag .

During interval tag talks to reader as follows. According to block reader transmits a Continuous Wave CW signal which can be thought of as a carrier that typically encodes no information. This CW signal serves both to transfer energy to tag for its own internal power needs and also as a carrier that tag can modulate with its backscatter. Indeed during interval according to block tag does not receive a signal for processing. Instead according to block tag modulates the CW emitted according to block so as to generate backscatter signal . Concurrently according to block reader receives backscatter signal and processes it.

Local block is responsible for communicating with the tags. Local block includes a block of an antenna and a driver of the antenna for communicating with the tags. Some readers like that shown in local block contain a single antenna and driver. Some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers and a method to switch signals among them including sometimes using different antennas for transmitting and for receiving. Some readers contain multiple antennas and drivers that can operate simultaneously. A demodulator decoder block demodulates and decodes backscattered waves received from the tags via antenna driver block . Modulator encoder block encodes and modulates an RF wave that is to be transmitted to the tags via antenna driver block .

Local block additionally includes an optional local processor . Local processor may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include by way of examples and not of limitation digital and or analog processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors DSPs controllers such as microcontrollers software running in a machine such as a general purpose computer programmable circuits such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs Field Programmable Analog Arrays FPAAs Programmable Logic Devices PLDs Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASIC any combination of one or more of these and so on. In some cases some or all of the decoding function in block the encoding function in block or both may be performed instead by local processor . In some cases local processor may implement an encryption or authorization function in some cases one or more of these functions can be distributed among other blocks such as encoding block or may be entirely incorporated in another block.

Local block additionally includes an optional local memory . Local memory may be implemented in any number of ways known in the art. Such ways include by way of examples and not of limitation nonvolatile memories NVM read only memories ROM random access memories RAM any combination of one or more of these and so on. These memories can be implemented separately from local processor or in a single chip with local processor with or without other components. Local memory if provided can store programs for local processor to run if needed.

In some embodiments local memory stores data read from tags or data to be written to tags such as Electronic Product Codes EPCs Tag Identifiers TIDs and other data. Local memory can also include reference data that is to be compared to the EPC codes instructions and or rules for how to encode commands for the tags modes for controlling antenna secret keys key pairs and so on. In some of these embodiments local memory is provided as a database.

Some components of local block typically treat the data as analog such as the antenna driver block . Other components such as local memory typically treat the data as digital. At some point there is a conversion between analog and digital. Based on where this conversion occurs a reader may be characterized as analog or digital but most readers contain a mix of analog and digital functionality.

If remote components are indeed provided they are coupled to local block via an electronic communications network . Network can be a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN a Wide Area Network WAN a network of networks such as the internet or a mere local communication link such as a USB PCI and so on. In turn local block then includes a local network connection for communicating with communications network . Communications on the network can be secure such as if they are encrypted or physically protected or insecure if they are not encrypted or otherwise protected.

There can be one or more remote component s . If more than one they can be located at the same location or in different locations. They can access each other and local block via communications network or via other similar networks and so on. Accordingly remote component s can use respective remote network connections. Only one such remote network connection is shown which is similar to local network connection etc.

Remote component s can also include a remote processor . Remote processor can be made in any way known in the art such as was described with reference to local processor . Remote processor may also implement an encryption function similar to local processor .

Remote component s can also include a remote memory . Remote memory can be made in any way known in the art such as was described with reference to local memory . Remote memory may include a local database and a different database of a Standards Organization such as one that can reference EPCs. Remote memory may also contain information associated with command tag profiles keys or the like similar to local memory .

Of the above described elements it may be advantageous to consider a combination of these components designated as operational processing block . Operational processing block includes those components that are provided of the following local processor remote processor local network connection remote network connection and by extension an applicable portion of communications network that links remote network connection with local network connection . The portion can be dynamically changeable etc. In addition operational processing block can receive and decode RF waves received via antenna and cause antenna to transmit RF waves according to what it has processed.

Operational processing block includes either local processor or remote processor or both. If both are provided remote processor can be made such that it operates in a way complementary with that of local processor . In fact the two can cooperate. It will be appreciated that operational processing block as defined this way is in communication with both local memory and remote memory if both are present.

Accordingly operational processing block is location independent in that its functions can be implemented either by local processor or by remote processor or by a combination of both. Some of these functions are preferably implemented by local processor and some by remote processor . Operational processing block accesses local memory or remote memory or both for storing and or retrieving data.

RFID reader system operates by operational processing block generating communications for RFID tags. These communications are ultimately transmitted by antenna block with modulator encoder block encoding and modulating the information on an RF wave. Then data is received from the tags via antenna block demodulated and decoded by demodulator decoder block and processed by processing operational processing block .

Embodiments of an RFID reader system can be implemented as hardware software firmware or any combination. It is advantageous to consider such a system as subdivided into components or modules. A person skilled in the art will recognize that some of these components or modules can be implemented as hardware some as software some as firmware and some as a combination. An example of such a subdivision is now described together with the RFID tag as an additional module.

An RFID tag is considered here as a module by itself. RFID tag conducts a wireless communication with the remainder via the air interface . It is noteworthy that air interface is really only a boundary in that signals or data that pass through it are not intended to be transformed from one thing to another. Specifications as to how readers and tags are to communicate with each other for example the Gen 2 Specification also properly characterize that boundary as an interface.

RFID system includes one or more reader antennas and an RF front end module for interfacing with reader antenna s . These can be made as described above.

RFID system also includes a signal processing module . In one embodiment signal processing module exchanges waveforms with RF front end module such as I and Q waveform pairs.

RFID system also includes a physical driver module which is also known as data link module. In some embodiments physical driver module exchanges bits with signal processing module . Physical driver module can be the stage associated with the framing of data.

RFID system additionally includes a media access control module which is also known as MAC layer module. In one embodiment MAC layer module exchanges packets of bits with physical driver module . MAC layer module can make decisions for sharing the medium of wireless communication which in this case is the air interface.

RFID system moreover includes an application programming library module . This module can include application programming interfaces APIs other objects etc.

All of these RFID system functionalities can be supported by one or more processors. One of these processors can be considered a host processor. Such a host processor might include a host operating system OS and or central processing unit CPU as in module . In some embodiments the processor is not considered as a separate module but one that includes some of the above mentioned modules of RFID system . In some embodiments the one or more processors may perform operations associated with calculating and or writing an OC and or a DS to the tag as part of a loss prevention system.

User interface module may be coupled to application programming library module for accessing the APIs. User interface module can be manual automatic or both. It can be supported by the host OS CPU module mentioned above or by a separate processor etc.

It will be observed that the modules of RFID system form a chain. Adjacent modules in the chain can be coupled by appropriate instrumentalities for exchanging signals. These instrumentalities include conductors buses interfaces and so on. These instrumentalities can be local e.g. to connect modules that are physically close to each other or over a network for remote communication.

The chain is used in one direction for receiving RFID waveforms and in the other direction for transmitting RFID waveforms. In receiving mode reader antenna s receives wireless waves which are in turn processed successively by the various modules in the chain. Processing can terminate in any one of the modules. In transmitting mode waveform initiation can be in any one of the modules. Ultimately signals are routed to reader antenna s to be transmitted as wireless waves.

The architecture of RFID system is presented for purposes of explanation and not of limitation. Its particular subdivision into modules need not be followed for creating embodiments. Furthermore the features of the present disclosure can be performed either within a single one of the modules or by a combination of them.

As mentioned previously embodiments are directed to employing RFID readers and tags in a loss prevention system. Embodiments additionally include programs and methods of operation of the programs. A program is generally defined as a group of steps or operations leading to a desired result due to the nature of the elements in the steps and their sequence. A program is usually advantageously implemented as a sequence of steps or operations for a processor.

Performing the steps instructions or operations of a program requires manipulating physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities may be transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated or processed according to the steps or instructions and they may also be stored in a computer readable medium. These quantities include for example electrical magnetic and electromagnetic charges or particles states of matter and in the more general case can include the states of any physical devices or elements. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to information represented by the states of these quantities as bits data bits samples values symbols characters terms numbers or the like. It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are associated with the appropriate physical quantities and that these terms are merely convenient labels applied to these physical quantities individually or in groups.

Embodiments furthermore include storage media. Such media individually or in combination with others have stored thereon instructions of a program made according to the embodiments. A storage medium according to the embodiments is a computer readable medium such as a memory and is read by a processor of the type mentioned above. If a memory it can be implemented in a number of ways such as Read Only Memory ROM Random Access Memory RAM etc. some of which are volatile and some nonvolatile.

Even though it is said that the program may be stored in a computer readable medium it should be clear to a person skilled in the art that it need not be a single memory or even a single machine. Various portions modules or features of it may reside in separate memories or even separate machines. The separate machines may be connected directly or through a network such as a local access network LAN or a global network such as the Internet.

Often for the sake of convenience only it is desirable to implement and describe a program as software. The software can be unitary or thought of in terms of various interconnected distinct software modules.

As described above an authorization reader may authorize a tag and its associated item to leave a particular facility by writing a computed code and or temporal parameter to the tag. A code as used herein is a numerical value that may be expressed as a single or multi bit value in a binary octal hexadecimal decimal or any other suitable format. The authorization reader may compute the code based on an algorithm with one or more different inputs. For example the code may be computed based on an algorithm having one or more arithmetic operations logical operations bit shifting operations truncation operations i.e. operations that reduce the bit length of an input code for example by discarding input code bits extension operations i.e. operations that increase the bit length of an input code for example by padding or concatenation and or any other suitable operations that output a code. The inputs into the algorithm may include identifiers such as the II the OC and or reader identifier s one or more temporal parameters or any other suitable parameters.

In some embodiments an authorization reader uses a cryptographic algorithm to compute the code. In this case the code is known as a digital signature . Digital signatures allow the authenticity and integrity of a digital message to be verified. are flow diagrams illustrating generating and verifying a digital signature DS .

Digital signatures are typically referred to in the context of asymmetric cryptography. A signatory also referred to as a sender possesses a private public key pair where the private and public keys are mathematically related to each other. The sender uses the private key to generate the DS. A recipient uses the sender s public key to verify the DS. A verified DS gives the recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender and that it was not altered in transit.

A message authentication code MAC is the digital signature equivalent in the context of symmetric cryptography. A signatory also referred to as a sender possesses a secret key and the sender uses the secret key to generate the MAC. A recipient can use the same secret key to verify the MAC. A verified MAC gives the recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender and that it was not altered in transit. The term digital signature or DS as used in this disclosure may refer to a DS generated using asymmetric cryptography or to a MAC generated using symmetric cryptography.

An important attribute of digital signatures is that they are difficult to forge or clone. A number of standards have been developed for digital signatures. The Digital Signature Standard DSS is a U.S. Government standard for digital signatures. DSS is specified in Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS 186 1 and FIPS 186 3. FIPS 186 1 specifies two digital signature algorithms the Digital Signature Algorithm DSA and the RSA digital signature algorithm. FIPS 186 3 includes a third digital signature algorithm the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA . FIPS 180 3 Secure Hash Standard SHS specifies the hash functions to be used in conjunction with FIPS 186 1 and FIPS 186 3.

In some embodiments digital signatures may be generated without using a separate hash using a digital signature scheme with message recovery. In such embodiments DS may be generated directly from data and digitally signed data only includes DS . During verification the DS is directly decrypted with the public key to provide data . Of course other digital signature schemes may be used.

Item is typically delivered to facility with a tag having a preprogrammed II. In some embodiments tag may arrive pre preprogrammed with both an II and an OC. In other embodiments item may be delivered without tag and a tag is programmed with an II and an OC and attached to item in the facility. In yet other embodiments item may be delivered with a blank or unprogrammed tag leaving the II and OC to be programmed within the facility. Regardless of the tagging approach item enters point of ingress . An optional ingress station including an ingress reader reads tag and if the tag is lacking an II or OC writes them into the tag at operation . Note that ingress station can be located anywhere in facility can be outside the facility can be a separate facility which performs tag encoding or could even be a mobile reader such as a handheld device. In some embodiments separate readers may be used to write the II and the OC into the tag. A reader may check to see if the tag lacks an II or OC before writing or may write the II OC without checking. Regardless of the methodology after ingress and encoding the tagged item containing an II and OC will be at location in the facility.

Items must be authorized to leave the facility. The authorization process is performed at authorization station using authorization reader . As described in process authorization reader interrogates tag attached to item confirms that the OC is associated with facility computes a code C using an algorithm and writes the code C into the tag. In some embodiments C may be computed at least in part from the tag s II the OC and or a TP. C may also or instead include a DS generated as described above. A tag with a proper C is authorized to leave the facility. Authorizing reader may also write the TP into tag memory.

In some embodiments the code C written to the tag may instead be an abridged code formed from an original longer computed code where the abridging comprises at least one of truncating compressing selecting certain bits from and or otherwise reducing the longer computed code. For example code C may be an abridged version of an original computed DS formed by truncating the original DS compressing the original DS and or selecting a subset of bits from the original DS. In some embodiments an abridging algorithm may be specific to a particular tag a particular group of tags a facility e.g. facility or any particular entity. In other embodiments the abridging algorithm may be generally used for RFID tags. Authorizing reader may write an abridged code into the tag because the tag does not have sufficient memory or does not have sufficient tag memory space allocated for the original computed code. In some embodiments authorizing reader may write an abridged code to speed up the write process. In other embodiments the abridged code may be generated based on an authentication mechanism. For example the tag may store an identifier identifying how the abridged code was abridged e.g. whether via truncation compression selection of a subset of bits etc. and if via truncation or selection of bits which portion or bits of the longer code was truncated or kept and subsequent readers e.g. PoE reader below may use the stored portion identifier to authenticate the abridged code.

At the facility point of egress a PoE reader located at PoE station interrogates the tag and reads its OC C and optionally its TP and or II. As described at operation PoE reader checks the tag s OC and if the item is associated with the facility then verifies that C is proper. In some embodiments PoE reader knows the algorithm and inputs used to compute C and verifies C by computing a new verification value with the algorithm and inputs and comparing the verification value with C. If C is an abridged version of another computed code PoE reader may compute the new verification value determine the abridging algorithm used to form C e.g. whether the abridging algorithm includes truncation compression selection of a subset of bits etc. derive an abridged verification value corresponding to C from the computed verification value based on the abridging algorithm and compare the abridged verification value to C. PoE reader may determine the abridging algorithm based on an identifier stored in the tag as described above and or information stored at PoE reader about the tag. In other embodiments PoE reader may instead use C in a reverse computation. For example PoE reader may reverse the algorithm or know the reversed algorithm and use the reversed algorithm to compute the initial inputs given C. If PoE reader knows what the correct initial inputs should be it can compare the computed initial inputs with the correct initial inputs to verify C. In embodiments where C includes a DS PoE reader may verify the DS using the facility s secret for symmetric cryptosystems or using the facility s public key for asymmetric cryptosystems. For situations where C includes an abridged version of an original DS and PoE reader knows the cryptographic algorithm and inputs used to compute the original DS PoE reader may determine the abridging algorithm used to form C as described above compute a verification DS derive an abridged verification DS corresponding to C from the verification DS based on the abridging algorithm and compare the abridged verification DS to C. If PoE reader verifies that C is proper then item may be removed through point of egress . If C is not proper then PoE station may sound an alarm or otherwise notify authorities that an unauthorized item is departing the facility. Points of ingress and egress and may include doors doorways hallways ramps garages and similar.

In some embodiments the TP may include one time disposable codes referred to herein as tickets to supplement and or entirely replace C. A ticket encodes some information known to both an authorization reader e.g. authorization reader and a PoE reader e.g. PoE reader and is used by an authorization reader to indicate to a PoE reader that a particular item or tag is authorized to leave the facility. In typical embodiments tickets are multi bit values i.e. include more than one bit .

As mentioned above tickets are one time disposable codes. After authorization reader assigns the selected ticket to tag it disposes of the selected ticket to prevent reuse by the authorization reader . For example the authorization reader may dispose of the selected ticket by deleting the ticket from its memory flagging the ticket in reader memory associating an identifier e.g. an authorization reader identifier an item identifier a tag identifier and or a TP with the ticket in reader memory or otherwise indicating that that selected ticket has been used. As a result each tag authorized to leave facility stores a different TP for at least a period of time.

Subsequently at the facility point of egress PoE reader will read the TP stored on tag in addition to confirming the OC at operation . PoE reader itself knows the tickets that authorization reader knows and can confirm if the TP stored on tag includes a known ticket or is derived from a known ticket and therefore presumably written by authorization reader . Moreover PoE reader can determine if the ticket stored on tag is new i.e. previously not read by a PoE reader or has been previously observed by a PoE reader. If the ticket stored on tag is new then PoE reader assumes that tag is authorized to leave i.e. that authorization reader authorized the tag to leave by storing the ticket on the tag and allows tag and item to leave facility . PoE reader then updates its known tickets to indicate that the ticket stored on tag has now been seen. For example PoE reader may flag the ticket or associated it with one or more identifiers e.g. the II the OC and or identifier s associated with the PoE reader or the authorization reader . Subsequently if PoE reader sees a tag with the same previously read ticket under certain circumstances e.g. after some time has passed or if there is a mismatch between an identifier associated with the tag and an identifier previously associated with the ticket it may assume that an attacker is trying to remove unauthorized items from facility and may sound an alarm or otherwise notify authorities. Similarly if an unknown ticket is stored on tag or if no ticket or an otherwise invalid ticket is stored on tag then PoE reader may also sound an alarm or otherwise notify authorities.

At operation mobile device interrogates tag to retrieve an II and an OC. Mobile device then provides the II OC to authorizing entity . In some embodiments mobile device may provide additional information to authorizing entity . For example a mobile device associated with a customer may provide payment information e.g. payment authorization or proof of payment for the item . A mobile device associated with an employee may provide employee identification information and or transportation information for item .

In response authorizing entity computes a code C e.g. as described above in and or selects a ticket e.g. as described above in and provides the code C ticket to mobile device . In some embodiments mobile device may itself compute at least a part of code C and or select the ticket. For example authorizing entity may provide some information or seed value to mobile device for computing code C or selecting a ticket. Mobile device which is capable of storing data on RFID tags either inherently or using an external attachment then stores the code C ticket and or writes the code C ticket into tag . At operation PoE reader may verify the code written into tag or stored on mobile device as described above in updating a known ticket list if necessary. In situations where mobile device stores the provided code instead of writing it into tag PoE reader may determine if mobile device accompanies tag when departing facility and if mobile device stores a correct code C and or ticket . If so PoE reader may allow tag to leave facility otherwise PoE reader may sound an alarm or otherwise notify authorities.

As described above tickets are one time disposable codes that an authorization reader stores on a tag to indicate to a PoE reader that the tag is authorized to leave a facility. Tickets may be generated by a facility e.g. facility a parent of the facility an organization associated with the facility a security agency or organization or any other suitable entity and then distributed to authorization and PoE readers. Since a PoE reader may determine whether a tag storing a ticket is authorized to leave based on whether its stored ticket has been previously seen ticket generation may be configured to assure that each ticket is substantially unique for at least a period of time. For example tickets may be a randomly generated number may be based on a particular tag or tag type item or item type or other identifier may be based on information related to the authorization reader or may be based on any other suitable data. New tickets may be generated periodically e.g. every minute hour day week month etc. or dynamically e.g. as needed . A particular ticket may be guaranteed to be unique at least with respect to the facility for a particular predefined or dynamic period of time e.g. minutes hours days weeks months etc. . Similarly ticket distribution may be configured to assure that different authorization readers do not inadvertently assign the same ticket to different tags.

Whereas an authorization reader may receive a portion of scratchlist a PoE reader e.g. PoE reader may receive the entire scratchlist because the PoE reader may see tags with tickets stored by any of the authorization readers. If multiple PoE readers exist at a facility each PoE reader may receive a copy of scratchlist .

In some embodiments multiple authorization readers may select tickets from the same scratchlist portion as needed and may update the scratchlist in real time to prevent different authorization readers from selecting the same ticket. In this case the scratchlist may not be divided into portions. In some embodiments a central controller may distribute tickets or groups of tickets as needed and may update the scratchlist as tickets are used.

In some embodiments authorization readers may be provided with one or more ranges of ticket values to assign to tags instead of explicit ticket values. For example an authorization reader may be provided a ticket value range in the form of a starting ticket value e.g. ticket 1 an ending ticket value e.g. ticket 101 and an increment value e.g. increment by 1 2 3 or a dynamic value within the range. The authorization reader may then select tickets to assign to tags based on the starting increment and ending values. For example if an authorization reader is provided with a starting ticket value of 1 an ending ticket value of 10 and an increment value of 2 the reader may assign ticket values 1 3 5 7 and 9. In some embodiments authorization readers may be provided with multiple ranges and different authorization readers may be provided with different ranges. PoE readers may know the range s assigned to the authorization readers and may be able to use the ranges to verify a ticket written to a tag.

In some embodiments when a PoE reader verifies that a read TP is both present in its locally stored scratchlist and has not been previously read the reader may store a timestamp a location identifier and or identifiers associated with the PoE reader the tag or the attached item in the other field associated with the read TP. Subsequently if the PoE reader encounters a tag with a previously read TP it may retrieve a tag or item identifier from the tag and compare it to the tag item identifier it has stored in the other field associated with the TP. If the identifiers match then the PoE reader may assume that the tag and associated item are re entering or re exiting the facility. On the other hand if the retrieved identifier does not match the stored identifier then the PoE reader may assume that the item is not authorized to leave the facility and may sound an alarm or otherwise notify authorities.

As indicated by comment II identifies the item to which the tag is attached. II may be a tag identifier TID an electronic product code EPC a unique item identifier UII a serialized global trade item number SGTIN or similar. Also as indicated by comment OC identifies the facility a parent of the facility an organization associated with the facility a manufacturer a retail seller etc. with which the item is associated. As indicated by comment C may be calculated based on an algorithm with one or more inputs. For example C may be calculated based on II OC TP and or a facility or authorization reader s secret or private key if C includes a DS . In some embodiments C may instead be an abridged version of a longer code as described above. TP may include a ticket selected from a scratchlist e.g. scratchlists or in an abridged ticket derived from a selected ticket and or other data e.g. data in optional other field s in as indicated by comment .

As indicated by comment RFID tag and by association the item attached to RFID tag may be considered authorized for removal from the facility if C and or TP is regarded as proper. For example C may be regarded as proper based on an algorithm and one or more inputs. TP may be regarded as proper based on whether an included ticket is present or derived from a ticket present in a scratchlist stored at or accessible by a PoE reader and whether it has been previously seen by a PoE reader. Of course as described above if OC of RFID tag does not match the facility s OC or if OC does not exist then RFID tag and by association the item attached to RFID tag may be considered to be not associated with the facility and therefore authorized for removal from the facility regardless of C or TP. To inhibit the unauthorized removal of items II and OC may be write locked or permanently write locked and thereby rendered unchangeable. According to some embodiments C and or TP may be unlocked or permanently unlocked to facilitate erasure or overwriting for items returned to the facility. For example a customer with a mobile device e.g. mobile device may purchase an item attached to tag causing C and or TP to be stored on tag . Subsequently the customer may decide to return the item and the mobile device may erase C and or TP from tag .

Process begins with operation where the reader reads a tag s OC. At optional decision operation the reader determines whether the tag s OC matches the facility s OC. If the tag s OC does not match the facility s OC or does not exist then the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility at operation . If the tag s OC matches the facility s OC then the PoE reader may read the tag s II at optional operation and may read optional code s such as tag feature information or the TP at optional operation . At operation the reader reads a code C associated with the tag. For example the code C may be stored on the tag or on a mobile device associated with the tag. At operation the reader verifies the code C. For example the reader may compute a new verification value using a known algorithm and inputs and compare the new verification value with C. The reader may also or instead reverse the computation of C to derive its associated inputs and compare them to known correct inputs. If C includes a DS or a portion of a DS the reader may verify the DS using a process like that of or by computing a new verification DS as described above in . In some embodiments the reader may read a key or authorization reader identifier to determine the correct algorithm or key to use to verify C. In other embodiments the reader may iterate through its known algorithms or keys to verify C. At decision operation if the PoE reader finds C to be proper then the tagged item is allowed to leave the facility at operation . If the PoE reader finds C to be improper then the tagged item is not allowed to leave the facility at operation . One method for preventing an item with an improper C from leaving a facility is by triggering an alert or alarm such as at optional operation . Although this document describes the reader operations as proceeding serially those skilled in the art will recognize that in any deployed RFID system one or more of these operations may be merged for example the authorization reader may read the tag s II OC C and TP all at once .

Process and also apply in situations where a code C and or a ticket is stored in a mobile device as described above in and . However instead of reading the code C and or the ticket from the tag the reader reads the code C and or the ticket from the mobile device. In some embodiments a particular code C or ticket may be associated with and authorize multiple tags and attached items to be removed from the facility.

The operations described in processes and are for illustration purposes only. An RFID based loss prevention system and its operations may be implemented employing additional or fewer operations and in different orders using the principles described herein.

The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and or processes via the use of block diagrams and or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams and or examples contain one or more functions and or aspects it will be understood by those within the art that each function and or aspect within such block diagrams or examples may be implemented individually and or collectively by a wide range of hardware software firmware or virtually any combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the RFID embodiments disclosed herein in whole or in part may be equivalently implemented employing integrated circuits as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems as one or more programs running on one or more processors e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors as firmware or as virtually any combination thereof and that designing the circuitry and or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure.

The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure in addition to those enumerated herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods configurations antennas transmission lines and the like which can of course vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

With respect to the use of substantially any plural and or singular terms herein those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and or application. The various singular plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.

It will be understood by those within the art that in general terms used herein and especially in the appended claims e.g. bodies of the appended claims are generally intended as open terms e.g. the term including should be interpreted as including but not limited to the term having should be interpreted as having at least the term includes should be interpreted as includes but is not limited to etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example as an aid to understanding the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations. However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an e.g. a and or an should be interpreted to mean at least one or one or more the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number e.g. the bare recitation of two recitations without other modifiers means at least two recitations or two or more recitations .

Furthermore in those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B and C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B and C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms whether in the description claims or drawings should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms either of the terms or both terms. For example the phrase A or B will be understood to include the possibilities of A or B or A and B. 

As will be understood by one skilled in the art for any and all purposes such as in terms of providing a written description all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves thirds quarters fifths tenths etc. As a non limiting example each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third middle third and upper third etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as up to at least greater than less than and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally as will be understood by one skilled in the art a range includes each individual member. Thus for example a group having 1 3 cells refers to groups having 1 2 or 3 cells. Similarly a group having 1 5 cells refers to groups having 1 2 3 4 or 5 cells and so forth.
