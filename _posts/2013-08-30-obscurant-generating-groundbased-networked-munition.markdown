The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention generally relates to the field of munitions such as landmines. Particularly the present invention relates to an Ottawa Convention compliant system that replaces the current battlefield utility provided by anti personnel landmines. The present system utilizes obscurants to inhibit and deter the enemy s ability to breach and clear ground based mine and munition systems.

Current United States Army tactics are to utilize anti vehicular landmines during military operations to limit the enemy s ability to maneuver on the battlefield. Anti personnel landmines emplaced among the anti vehicular landmines are used solely to inhibit the enemy in their ability to clear the anti vehicular landmines.

In an effort to end the risk to noncombatants from unexploded landmines the United States developed anti personnel landmines APLs and anti vehicle landmines AVLs that self destruct and self deactivate with a high degree of reliability.

The current United States landmine policy stems from its obligations under the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons COW and Amended Protocol II of the CCW and a desire to mitigate civilian casualties caused by landmines. This policy seeks to strike a balance between maintaining the ability to use landmines in future military conflicts and addressing the humanitarian concerns raised by persistent landmines.

The United States has been assessing the effects of the Ottawa Convention on its landmine policy. The Ottawa Convention bans the manufacture and use of all anti personnel landmines which it defines as a mine designed to be exploded by the presence proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate injure or kill one or more persons. The convention however does not apply to anti vehicle landmines.

Membership in the Ottawa Convention would obligate the United States to cease the manufacture and use of all anti personnel landmines regardless of circumstances. The entire United States stockpile of anti personnel landmines would be banned regardless of whether they are detectable self destructing self deactivating or deployable pursuant to the requirements of Amended Protocol II.

As a result the United States would rely purely on anti vehicle landmines for military fields operations. However anti vehicle landmines can be cleared by personnel or de miners who will no longer be deterred by the presence of anti personnel landmines.

There is therefore a need for a system for use as an integral part of anti vehicle landmines munitions or as a standalone device that deters enemy de mining efforts. This system should pose no risk to non combatants yet still prevent de miners from having free movement within the anti vehicle landmine munition field. This in turn would mitigate the ability to de mine the anti vehicle munitions within the field. The need for such a system has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention complies with the intent of the Ottawa convention by addressing the humanitarian concerns related to anti personnel landmines while still providing an effective means of deterring enemy de miners from clearing anti vehicle mine munition fields through the use of obscurants. This system prevents de miners from having free movement within the landmine munition field which in turn would mitigate the ability to de mine the anti vehicle mines munitions within the field.

To this end the present system incorporates an obscurant generating device or obscurant generator and can be integral to an anti vehicle landmine munition or used as a standalone device. The system uses personnel sensors to detect movement within a mine munition field. Based on the sensed movement the system selectively initiates the optimal number of obscurant generators. This will prevent the intruders from having free movement within the field which in turn will mitigate their ability to defeat the anti vehicle mines munitions within the field.

The system can be networked with a plurality of other munitions sensor systems to activate the obscurant generators that provide optimal concealment. The system is also capable of preventing multiple concurrent intrusions and can be used in a fully autonomous mode.

As a result the present system will be compliant with the Ottawa Convention. It maintains overall effectiveness of ground based anti vehicle mine munition systems.

The present invention provides mine munition field protection by deterring or delaying the clearing of the anti vehicle mine munition systems. This system can be fully autonomous and does not require any additional modifications to existing Tactics Techniques and Procedures TTP s to meet the requirements of the Ottawa treaty nor does it add additional Military Occupational Specialties MOS s or manpower to employ.

Furthermore this system can be used to inhibit the enemy s ability to clear or counter other ground based systems including but not limited to networked munitions systems and sensors.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

In the present illustration the munitions represent anti vehicle mines or devices that are physically distributed across the mine field . The munitions are also wirelessly networked to exchange sensed collected and calculated data in order to ensure an optimal cloaking obscurant coverage. Alternatively some or all the munitions can be connected via cables or wires for a selective distribution of data and power.

The arrows that are labeled indicate various exemplary non exclusive data and or power interconnections between the munitions . In addition while the munitions are shown as being interconnected to form an internal network with a distributed processing power it should be clear that the munitions can also be connected to an external network for added control.

In operation some or all the munitions continuously scan the mine field for movement of intruders . The various scanning fields of the munitions are indicated by the numeral reference . Scanning is performed by some combination of widely available personnel detection sensors including but not limited to electro optical infrared EO IR sensors radars passive infrared FIR sensors and seismic sensors. Complementary sensing modes and tailored algorithms perform target discrimination to prevent false detections on non humans.

While the sensors are exemplified by a single box that is placed within the mine field it should be understood that some or all the sensors may be distributed and networked throughout the mine field . Alternatively some or all the sensors may be incorporated within the munitions .

Once the intruder for intruders is identified then the munitions start an internal communication to share data that are sensed by the various munitions . As an example the sensed data can be the intruder s position proximity and direction of movement the wind direction and any other relevant data such as human or non human intruder speed of intruder number of intruders etc. that are sensed by the munitions .

Based on the sensed data the munitions individually or collectively calculate the optimal cloaking obscurant coverage and trigger the appropriate munitions such as to dispense an obscurant field as shown in in order to conceal the munitions that are expected to be detected and demined by the intruder .

While the munitions can be identical in function and design it should be clear that only some of the munitions may include the obscurant generation feature while other munitions can assume specialized functions such as telecommunications processing obscurant generation etc.

The shape of the housing is not crucial to the implementation of the present invention. In this particular embodiment the housing has a generally circular cross section.

The munition further includes a munition housing that protects the internal components of the munition .

The housing further includes a plurality of obscurant compartments that protrude from a peripheral body of the housing . Preferably but not necessarily the obscurant compartments are symmetrically peripherally disposed relative to the peripheral body . In addition while only four obscurant compartments are illustrated it should be clear that a different number of compartments may be used.

As an example a single compartment may be formed. Furthermore while in the preferred embodiment the obscurant compartments are filled with the same obscurant material or obscurant generator it should be clear that each of some of the obscurant compartments may dispense an obscurant of a different composition.

When the munition is triggered it dispenses the obscurant contained in the obscurant compartments in the form of a cloud that minimizes the intruder s visibility.

As an example each obscurant compartment includes a volume that is filled with Terephthalic Acid TA having a chemical formula C8H6O4 . If should be understood that obscurant compositions are available known or will become available.

Once a valid target signature is obtained based on the collected data an obscurant controller electronics and processor issues a fire command. The fire command functions an electric match i.e. which in turn ignites a starter slug i.e. . The burning started slug catches fire causing the TA smoke mixture to produce a thick white smoke. The duration of smoke screen or cloud may range between approximately 25 to 70 seconds average burn time.

In addition based on the collected data the triggering of the munition does not necessarily cause the entire load of obscurant within the obscurant compartments to be dispensed. Rather it would be preferable to dispense only the required amount of obscurant that is necessary to provide the desired cloaking result.

The obscurant release ports from which the obscurant is dispensed are opened since the obscurant is of a solid composition and does not require protection from the elements. The obscurant release ports can be designed so that they are out of direct line with the actual obscurant material.

Furthermore the triggering of the munition may cause the obscurant compartments to be activated sequentially rather than concurrently after a predetermined or desired time delay such as one second or a fraction thereof to achieve the desired cloaking cloud density.

As further illustrated in each obscurant compartment includes a valved obscurant release port that selectively allows the release of the obscurant as instructed by the obscurant controller electronics and processor .

In this embodiment the obscurant controller electronics and processor is illustrated as being housed within the housing of the munition . It should be clear that the obscurant controller electronics and processor can be a separate standalone device that collects the data from the various munitions in the field .

The obscurant controller electronics and processor can be located within the field at a close distance from the field or remotely from the field . The obscurant controller electronics and processor can include a telecommunications module e.g. a transceiver and a processor or CPU .

The function of the obscurant controller electronics and processor is to collect the data that are collected or sensed by the various munitions and to calculate the most optimal cloaking path which will prevent the intruders from having free movement within the field and will thus mitigate their ability to defeat the anti tank anti vehicle munitions within the field . The munition can be designed to prevent multiple intrusions and can be used in a fully autonomous mode.

Upon determination of the optimal cloaking path the obscurant controller electronics and processor activates an obscurant initiator in order to selectively open the obscurant release ports for releasing the obscurant. As shown in the exemplary embodiment of the obscurant initiator houses an electronic match and starter slug .

A communications module is emplaced within the housing to enable the munition to communicate with the other munitions in the field or with a remote location.

The remaining components of the munition include a warhead a warhead energetic charge warhead electronics and a power module all of which are either known or available in the art and thus will not be described herein in detail. The power module provides the necessary power to the munition warhead and related energetic function and further to the other internal electronic components described herein that relate to the dispensation of the obscurant.

The obscurant generating device includes a housing that is generally similar in structure and composition to the housing . A flat or dome shaped munition housing that accommodate the various valved obscurant release ports i.e. of the obscurant generators only two obscurant generators are illustrated in .

A power module that is similar in design and function to the power module is placed centrally or axially to power the obscurant generators the obscurant controller electronics and processor and an obscurant initiator .

In this embodiment the obscurant initiator is placed near a bottom plate along side the obscurant controller electronics and processor . The obscurant initiator houses an electronic match and a starter slug .

The sensed data are fed to an onboard processor that forms part of the obscurant controller electronics and processor . In turn the onboard processor determines at decision step if a target such as an intruder has been detected or verified by the sensor processor . If it has not then the sensor processor keeps analyzing the input sensor data .

If however the sensor processor determines at decision step that the target has been verified a central processor that forms part of the obscurant controller electronics and processor analyses additional data such as target data from the field wind data from the field target data to the field and wind data to the field . The additional data may be transmitted to the central processor via a wireless or radio network .

The central processor determines at step if the dispensation conditions for dispensing the obscurant i.e. are met. If it is determined that these conditions have not been met then the central processor keeps analyzing the acquired data and monitoring dispensation conditions.

Once the central processor determines at decision step that the dispensation conditions are met then it determines the dispensation pattern including the selection of the obscurant compartments from which the obscurant will be dispensed as well as the obscurant dispensation rate.

In this particular example four obscurant dispensers are respectively associated with the obscurant compartments . The dispensation pattern of the obscurant is optimized so that the obscurant cloud is maximized.

It should be understood that other modifications might be made to the present obscurant generating ground based networked munition design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
