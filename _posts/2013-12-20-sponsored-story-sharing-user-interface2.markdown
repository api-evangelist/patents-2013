This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 619 894 filed Sep. 14 2012 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 020 745 filed Feb. 3 2011. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 619 894 is also a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 12 193 702 filed Aug. 18 2008 which claims priority to the U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 985 631 filed Nov. 5 2007. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.

This disclosure relates generally to social networking websites and other systems in which users can form connections with other users.

This disclosure hereby incorporates by reference commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 968 786 entitled Targeting Social Advertising to Friends of Users Who Have Interacted with an Object Associated with the Advertising filed 15 Dec. 2010.

This disclosure hereby incorporates by reference commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 884 010 entitled Action Clustering for News Feeds filed 16 Sep. 2010.

Social networks or social utilities that track and enable connections between users including people businesses and other entities have become prevalent in recent years. In particular social networking websites allow users to communicate information more efficiently. For example a user may post contact information background information job information hobbies or other user specific data to a location associated with the user on a social networking website. Other users can then review the posted data by browsing user profiles or searching for profiles including specific data. Social networking websites also allow users to associate themselves with other users thus creating a web of connections among the users of social networking website. These connections among the users can be leveraged by the website to offer more relevant information to each user in view of the users own stated interests in their connections.

A system such as a website that allows users to interact with the system typically stores a record for each users of the system. These records may comprise information provided by the user as well as information gathered by the system related to activities or actions of the user on the system. For example a system may require a user to enter information such as contact information gender preferences interests and the like in an initial interaction with the system which is stored in the user s record. A user s activities on the system such as frequency of access of particular information on the system also provide information that can be stored in the user s record. The system may then use information provided by the user and information gathered about the user to customize interactions of the system with the user. For example a website selling books may keep track of a users previous purchases and provide the user with information on related books during subsequent interactions with the system. Information in a user s profile may also be used by the system to target sponsored stories that are of interest to the user. Using information collected from and about users results in a system that is more efficient and beneficial for both the user and the system.

Users interacting with the social network may post stories or status updates to a live activity stream such as a news feed. A news feed is a data format typically used for providing users with frequently updated content. A social networking system may provide various news feeds to its users where each news feed includes content relating to a specific subject matter or topic or other users. Various pieces of content may be aggregated into a single news feed. In some implementations a social networking system may provide a news feed that includes selected entries corresponding to activities of a user s first degree contacts or pages or topics that a user has indicated an interest for. Individual users of the social networking system may subscribe to specific news feeds of their interest. A group of related actions may be presented together to a user of the social networking system in the same news feed. For example a news feed concerning the event organized through the social networking system may include information about the event such as its time location and attendees and photos taken at the event which have been uploaded to the social networking system.

Generally news feeds are customized for each member only the status updates and stories posted by their connections are displayed. In this manner members of the social network may quickly access their direct connections status updates story postings and other interactions with the social network in a single stream obviating the need to individually check their connections profile pages.

However given the vast number of contacts the average member of a social network has and the prodigious amounts of status updates posted by users it is possible that stories of interest to the user are lost in the unending stream of their news feed. Furthermore sponsors may wish to pay for permanence of a particular story in members news feeds this functionality is unavailable in typical social networking systems.

Typically sponsors pay for a static advertisement to be displayed to a member of the social network. In particular embodiments advertisements may be displayed to a member s home page on the social network mobile devices third party web pages and applications television and other video streams or any other particular display accessed by a member of the social network. Despite data mining techniques that match users based on their preferences activities or other data stored in their social networking profile to the most relevant sponsored or promoted stories no system currently exists for promoting a story from a user s news feed to the sponsored stories space of a social network home page. Sponsored or promoted stories generated from actual stories in users news feeds are more likely to be viewed by users because they generally involve interactions or suggestions by their connected friends or fan pages that they are connected or subscribed to.

A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system including add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. As described herein sponsors or specific users may promote specific news feed stories to sponsored story space on users social networking pages thereby increasing the permanence and viewing frequency of these stories.

According to one embodiment a method of monitoring activity stream for creating sponsored stories includes monitoring an activity stream to identify actions that match stored sponsored story specifications for providing one or more sponsored stories to a viewing user. The sponsored story specifications include a visual specification for the sponsored story and matched sponsored stories are ranked for a viewing user. Users can set privacy preferences related to sponsored stories. The ranking and privacy settings contribute to which sponsored stories are provided for display to the viewing user.

Particular embodiments relate to a social networking environment including a social networking system and related systems that integrate individual stories status updates and user interactions with an advertising system. A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and then add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Once they are members of the social network the users may interact with the social network itself by posting stories and status messages on their own page other users by commenting posting stories etc. on other users pages or with non user entities such as fan pages that they subscribe to online deals they redeem or subscribe to or locations that they check in to.

Implementations of this disclosure extend these concepts by allowing sponsors or specific users to export by promoting specific news feed stories to sponsored story space on users social networking pages thereby increasing the permanence and viewing frequency of these stories. In one example a user may want to promote one of his news stories so that more of his connected friends can see the story in a more frequent and permanent view. For example a sponsor who publishes an application such as a social networking game may wish for status updates generated with its application to have permanence on the application user s friends homepages. In another example a sponsor associated with a page on the social network may want to promote news stories when a user connects to the page on the social network or to an object associated with the sponsor off network. In another example the proprietor of a store may wish to promote news stories to a user s friends when that user checks in or indicates that he physically visited the store. In another example the proprietor of a store may wish to promote news stories to a user s friends when that user subscribes purchase or redeems a deal or coupon associated with the sponsor. Other embodiments are readily envisioned by the disclosure and are described in detail below.

Client devices comprise one or more computing devices that can receive member input and can transmit and receive data via network . For example client devices may be desktop computers laptop computers smart phones personal digital assistants PDAs or any other device including computing functionality and data communication capabilities. Client devices are configured to communicate via network which may comprise any combination of local area or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. Third party website and action terminal are coupled to network for communicating messages to social networking website about the members actions off website .

Social networking website comprises a computing system that allows members to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein. Social networking website stores member profiles that describe the members of a social network including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history hobbies or preferences location and the like. Website further stores data describing one or more relationships between different members. The relationship information may indicate members who have similar or common work experience group memberships hobbies or educational history. Additionally social network host site includes member defined relationships between different members allowing members to specify their relationships with other members. For example these member defined relationships allow members to generate relationships with other members that parallel the members real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Members may select from predefined types of relationships or define their own relationship types as needed.

Web server links social networking website via network to one or more client devices as well as to one or more third party websites . Web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between social networking website and client devices or third party websites . The messages can be instant messages queued messages e.g. e mail text and SMS messages or any other suitable messaging technique.

Action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about member actions on or off social networking website . News feed generator generates communications for each member about information that may be relevant to the member. These communications may take the form of stories with each story being an information message comprising one or a few lines of information about an action in action log that is relevant to the particular member. The stories are presented to a member via one or more pages of the social networking website for example in each member s home page or news feed page.

Ad server executes one or more ad selection algorithms. Ad server is communicatively coupled to the database of ad requests and to action log for this purpose.

A sponsor uses sponsor GUI to specify the type of stories it wants promoted to the sponsored story section of users pages. Examples of Sponsor GUI are depicted in . Sponsor GUI provides a method for the sponsor to create story filters to locate specific types of news feed stories for promoting to the sponsored story space of a user s home page. Once the sponsor sets up its preferences for the types of stories it wishes to promote to the sponsored story portion the sponsor specifications are stored into stream sponsored story specification database .

In step upon finding a match sponsored story application pulls the matching entry out of activity stream and formats the entry into a predetermined visual specification. In particular embodiments the visual specification is dictated by the social networking system to mimic a regular news feed story. In other embodiments special identifiers may be added by the social networking system to indicate that the story is a sponsored story. In other embodiments the visual specifications are entered by the sponsor through the Sponsor GUI at the time of stream story specification. In such an embodiment the visual specification is stored along with the story specification in the stream sponsored story specification database . In particular embodiments the sponsor is given limited discretion as to the visual specifications for the promoted stream story subject to predetermined constraints imposed by the social networking system.

In step after the story is formatted pursuant to the visual specification or by the social networking system to visually comport with a news feed story the sponsored story is passed to sponsored story system .

In step after a social story is formatted into a sponsored story it is priced and directed toward users in a similar manner as a social ad. In particular embodiments the user may also add a weight to the story to alter its direction toward users. For example certain stories may decay quickly such as check ins and are not displayed to other users beyond a predetermined threshold time period from the story generation. In other embodiments user specified temporal factors such as deadlines may increase the weight of the sponsored story so that it is promoted over other sponsored stories lacking time sensitivity.

In particular embodiments ad targeting is based upon an affinity score calculated by social networking website . A member may have affinities for other members types of actions types of objects and content. Accordingly a calculated affinity score may be based on a weighted function that takes into account the set of affinities for the particular member for each type of data field that is in a candidate story. The website may obtain a member s affinities based on the member s express interests whether provided directly or indirectly for example through communications with other members or impliedly based on the member s actions e.g. a member s checking of another member s page indicates an interest in that other member or clicking on particular types of links may indicate an interest in similar links . An affinity as measured for example by an affinity score need not be an actual subjective interest or lack of interest that a member has for something i.e. the member likes punk rock music and dislikes vegetarian restaurants but rather it may merely be a correlation between something in the candidate story and some information stored in connection with that member whether is an action taken by the member a communication involving the member a characteristic feature or expressed interest in the member s profile.

The bid amount specified in the sponsored story request may indicate an amount of money that sponsor will pay for each time a member presented with the sponsored story clicks on it. In particular embodiments the sponsor may be a non profit or charity where the bid amount is given at little or no cost. Alternatively the bid amount may specify an amount that sponsor will pay the website operator each time the sponsored story is displayed to a member or a certain number of members or each time the sponsored story is clicked on by a member or a certain number of members. In another embodiment the sponsor may pay a set amount per month or period of time and the social networking website will determine the bid amount or how and when to display the sponsored stories. In addition the sponsored story request may allow sponsor to specify targeting criteria. This targeting criteria may be a filter to apply to fields of a member s member profile or other object or it may include free form text such as wall posts comments and messages. In particular embodiments to optimize the targeting and selection of sponsored stories for users of a social network social information gathered on and off the social network about a user is leveraged to infer interests about users of the social network. A social network may maintain a social graph that identifies the mapping of connections among the users including entities such as businesses applications groups etc of a social network and the social network may also maintain profiles that contain full or partial information about each of the users in the social network. Targeting may be based one or more factors such as member demographics age gender location birth date age education level employers employment type work history and experience hobbies and or preferences. These factors may draw from explicit member statements such as listing it on their profile connections to other members or entities or through user entered text on and off the social networking site. In another embodiment these factors may be implicitly or inferred by the social network.

One or more sponsored stories available to the social network may contain targeting criteria for determining whether the sponsored story should be targeted to a particular user. While the social network may have sufficient information about some of its users to apply the targeting criteria the social network may not have sufficient information about other users to apply the targeting criteria. Rather than missing out on the opportunity to target sponsored stories to this latter group of users embodiments use the information for other users to whom a particular user is connected when the social network does not have sufficient information to apply the targeting criteria to the user. This may be thought of as inferential targeting because a user s likely interest in a particular ad is inferred based on whether that user s connections e.g. friends in the social network are good candidates for the sponsored story based on its targeting criteria.

Upon selecting user control the user is presented with another set of drop down commands . Drop down menu lists all the entities with which a user is associated in the social network. Examples of such an entity include but are not limited to pages that the user has created to interact with fans of the page such as for a musician or TV show applications associated with the user such as social networking games deals or coupons associated with the user and physical locations associated with the user that members of the social network may check in to to indicate that they or others were physically at the location.

After the user has selected the entity associated with the user to be included in the stream sponsored story specification the user selects using drop down menu the types of interactions members of the social network have with the entity on and off the social network that the user would like to promote to the sponsored story space. User interactions include but are not limited to tagging sharing liking commenting on media or mentioning a user in a status update or comment fringing someone RSVPing or inviting a user to an event or game and the like. Other user interactions include but are not limited to check ins and other location based social interactions sharing a link from a third party website liking a post or page from a third party site buying redeeming or subscribing to deals and other promotions and interacting with an application on or off the social network. Any time a user makes a connection or performs a social action on the social network a new story is generated in activity stream that may ultimately be promoted.

Depending on the type of entity selected in drop down menu the interactions available in menu available to the user vary. For example if the user selects a page such as for a band or musician from menu the interactions in may include when a member likes the page when a member posts a link on page when the page owner generally but not necessarily the user of the sponsor GUI itself posts a link on the page or when a member shares a link to an external website that is related to the page. As another example if the user of the sponsor GUI selects a place such as a store location from drop down menu the GUI may show in drop down menu when a member of the social network checks in to the place when a member of the social network gives a review of the place greater than a predetermined threshold or when a member of the social network likes the place.

As described above actions by users performed off of a social networking website e.g. actions on third party websites or in the real world may be used to generate sponsored stories on the social networking website. Conversely in particular embodiments a social networking website can collect its users actions and then present sponsored stories or other information concerning actions taken by its users on third party websites. In this way the techniques for promoting actions using this information can be extended beyond a social networking website itself.

Alternative embodiments are contemplated by the disclosure that may be contemplated by ones of ordinary skill in the art. In particular embodiments the user may specify geographic or temporal criteria used by sponsored story system in determining which users to display the sponsored story to. For example a user may desire to promote a promotion that expires in three days and may specify to only promote stories for the next three days. In other embodiments the user may specify to promote stories only for users located with a specific geographic location. In particular embodiments user may specify a threshold of people taking the same action. For example a user may want to display friend check ins to members of the social network only if two or more friends of the user check in to a given location substantially simultaneously. In such an embodiment sponsored story application may search for multiple check ins to a given location by friends of a specific users within a predetermined time period. If such stories are found sponsored story application may aggregate the plurality of stories into a single sponsored story. After the user is satisfied with the specifications of the stream sponsored story that has just been created the user may utilize controls and to save and activate the sponsored story respectively.

In a user s news feed recommendation space sponsored story space notifications and questions are depicted. In particular embodiments elements are displayed on a social networking user s home screen. In particular embodiments element is displayed on a user s home screen and one or more of elements are displayed at all times. This disclosure contemplates any arrangement of elements and any degree of persistence. In particular embodiments elements are displayed on other user s pages. In particular embodiments these other users may be the user s friend. In other embodiments these other users may be otherwise associated with the user. In particular embodiments the display of elements to other users is determined by sponsored story system . Sponsored story system accesses a database of user privacy preferences when determining which users to display the sponsored story to. For example if a user has previously specified that he or she does not wish to see sponsored stories from a particular company sponsored story system will not display stories promoted by that particular company. In particular embodiments sponsored story system accesses the visibility and privacy settings of the user that generated the news feed story to be promoted and uses the settings in determining which users to display the promoted story to. For example a user may have multiple friend lists and members belonging to one or more different lists may be prevented from viewing specific stories types of stories or the user s news feed altogether. sponsored story system respects these settings so that only friends of the user who are granted access to view the news feed story to be promoted are displayed the promoted stream sponsored story. This disclosure contemplates various methods of determining which users to display element to as envisioned by those of ordinary skill in the art. News feed includes news feed stories . These stories are generated specifically for a user based upon the activities the user s friends or other entities the user is associated with. News feed story is an example of a news feed story that has been selected for promoting to sponsor space . When sponsored story application detects a match in activity stream to a sponsor s stream sponsored story specification from stream sponsored story specification database sponsored story is formatted to resemble a news feed story and sent to sponsored story system . In this particular example the stream story relates to a story when four friends of a user liked the entity Toys R Us. Formatted sponsored story is promoted to the user or another set of users by sponsored story system .
