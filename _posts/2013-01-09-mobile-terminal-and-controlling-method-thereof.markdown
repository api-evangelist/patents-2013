And configuration information related to this arrangement state may be saved in an external device by the backup restoration application.

The data or informations saved by the backup restoration application may be restored in the same terminal or a terminal of a different version automatically or user selectively.

Meanwhile the detailed application information is saved in the memory and more particularly in a file system separate from the corresponding application due to a software structure. And an authority of access to the detailed application information saved in the file system may be granted to the application related to the corresponding detailed application information only. For instance detailed call application information related to a call log may be read and saved in a manner of being accessed by the call application only.

Basically in the backup restoration process a backup restoration application is not allowed to access detailed application information of another application. Hence even if the backup restoration application performs the backup restoration process it may be unable to completely restore the detailed application information. Exceptionally a program having a root authority of accessing all applications may be only able to access detailed application information on a specific application.

In case that an authority of accessing detailed application information on a different application is granted to a specific application since it may be vulnerable to hacking the root authority is not normally granted to an individual application.

Therefore in order to exactly back up and restore all data installed on a terminal i.e. a corresponding application detailed application information and configuration information at a user specific level via a backup restoration application it may be requested to use a root authority for accessing a different application.

According to an example embodiment of the present invention in order to perform a backup restoration process via a backup restoration application a backup restoration service having a root authority is loaded in advance and the backup restoration application is then enabled to perform the backup and restoration in a manner of accessing a detailed application information on an individual application.

Referring to each application may be able to access detailed application information on the corresponding application but a backup restoration application for the backup of the corresponding application is unable to access the detailed application information. Hence even if the backup and restoration is completed the detailed information on the corresponding application may not be restored.

Referring to each application may be able to access detailed application information on the corresponding application but a backup restoration application for the backup of the corresponding application is still unable to access the detailed application information in direct. Yet according to an example embodiment of the present invention the backup restoration application checks the detailed application information via a backup restoration service having a root authority instead of directly accessing the detailed application information and may be then able to back up and restore the corresponding information.

In particular according to an example embodiment of the present invention in association with a detailed application information which is not accessible by a backup restoration application according to a related art on each application is accessed via a backup restoration service having a root authority for the corresponding application and the corresponding information can be backed up and restored.

Referring to a plurality of applications including a 1application a 2application and a backup restoration application exist in an application layer of an Android platform.

In particular the 1application is able to freely read and save a file in a file system by accessing the file as a detailed application information on the 1application . And the 2application is able to freely read and save a file in the file system by accessing the file as a detailed application information on the 2application . Yet as mentioned in the foregoing description an authority for directly accessing each of the detailed application informations and is not granted to the backup restoration application for the backup and restoration of each of the 1application and the 2application .

When the mobile terminal according to an example embodiment the present invention performs the backup restoration application the backup restoration application may be able to access the file system via a backup restoration service of a Linux layer and may be then able to back up and restore the detailed application informations and .

Referring to the controller creates a backup restoration service having a root authority S . The controller establishes a channel between the created backup restoration service and a backup restoration application S . The controller activates the backup restoration application and then performs a backup operation on data S . The controller performs a restoration operation on the mobile terminal via the active backup restoration application.

In the following description based on the flowchart for the backup restoration method described with reference to an example embodiment of the present invention is explained.

Regarding the creation of the backup restoration service a procedure in an init process is described. In this case a mode process operating on Linux is created and activated in the init process. According to an example embodiment of the present invention a root authority for accessing detailed application information on each application can be performed not in an application layer but in a Linux layer. Hence a process for the Linux layer to grant the root authority is required.

Roles played in the init process may be schematically categorized into init.rc file analysis and activation device driver node creation end processing of a detailed process property service termination and the like.

In particular the init.rc file is the filed used in the init process and defines a service and an action. According to an example embodiment of the present invention in order to grant a root authority to a backup restoration application a root authority granted content may be added to the init.rc file.

The action defined in init.rc may mean such a function automatically executed in case of an init process activation as export mkdir and the like. And the service defined in init.rc may mean a process executed by the init process.

According to an example embodiment of the present invention in order to execute a backup restoration service having a root authority a backup restoration service for a backup restoration application is defined in the init.rc.

In particular in order for a backup restoration application to execute a backup restoration service having a root authority for a backup the backup restoration service is performed in a grammar format as follows.

The above grammar is exemplarily shown to execute a backup restoration service having a backup root authority. Hence when the above content is described in the init.rc the backup restoration service having the root authority can be executed or created in the backup restoration process through the corresponding content. According to the grammar for the backup restoration service each new service is executed. When the service is executed a socket is created. And a channel of communication with an application is established using the created socket.

After the backup restoration service has been created the controller establishes a channel between the created backup restoration service and the backup restoration application S .

Thus after the backup restoration service having the rot authority has been created via the init process the socket for the channel establishment between the backup restoration service and the backup restoration application is created.

Referring to init.rc is red via the process of an init process S . A backup restoration application is created as described in the init.rc and a socket is created S . In this case the socket is a means for connecting communication between the backup restoration service and a backup restoration application . The backup restoration application delivers a public key to the backup restoration service via the socket S . In response to the delivered public key the backup restoration service replies with another public key S . Through this procedure a channel is established between the backup restoration service and the backup restoration application.

In case that the channel is established between the backup restoration service and the backup restoration application as mentioned in the foregoing description the backup restoration application may be able to access a detailed application information on each application and may be then able to backup and restore the accessed detailed application information.

After the channel has been established between the backup restoration service and the backup restoration application the backup restoration application performs a backup operation S .

When the backup restoration application is activated as mentioned in the foregoing description it is assumed that the detailed informations are accessible in a manner of accessing a file system via the backup restoration service.

The backup restoration application may be able to perform the backup operation by periods. As mentioned in the foregoing description the backup operation may save data related to the terminal in an external storage device or the memory of the terminal . Optionally only if a user selects to activate the backup restoration application the backup operation may be performed.

With respect to the backup operation a user may be able to select a target to back up. In particular in case that the backup restoration application is activated for a backup operation initiation all data related to the terminal e.g. applications detailed application informations configuration informations etc. may be displayable. And the backup operation may be performed on the data selected from the displayed data.

With respect to the backup restoration application a target not to be backed up may be managed using a blacklist. For instance in case that applications are usable for a specific terminal type only even if the applications are backed up and restored they may not be correctly operable in the restored terminal. This specific data is managed using the blacklist and may be selected as an exception of the backup target. And the blacklist may be saved in the memory . The controller may be able to automatically determine and manage the data belonging to the blacklist. Yet even if the data are managed using the blacklist summary information on the application corresponding to the blacklist may be saved.

With respect to the backup restoration application a target to be necessarily backed up may be managed using a white list. Hence data e.g. application etc. managed using the white list may be automatically backed up despite not being selected as a backup target by a user.

After the backup operation has been performed the backup restoration application performs a restoring process S .

With respect to the restoring process the backup restoration application may be able to perform the process using the root authority via the backup restoration service if necessary.

According to an example embodiment of the present invention performing the restoring process may include the sub operations shown in .

Referring to a backup restoration application performs a basic restoration operation S . With respect to the basic restoration operation the backup restoration application may be able to restore information using a backup restoration service having a root authority.

The backup restoration application may display an indicator window related to the restoration operation S . Thereafter the backup restoration application may determine one of the following four cases as a restoration error and may be able to perform a restoration operation on each restoration error. The cases provided as the restoration errors can be categorized into 1 a case that a specific application does not exist in a restoring process S 2 a case that a higher version of a specific application exists in a restoring process S 3 a case that an application of the same version is already installed in a restoring process S and 4 a case that an application not operating in a specific terminal exists S .

First of all the indicator window display for the restoring process is described with reference to as follows.

Referring to the display unit may display a window for inquiring a user whether to perform a backup restoration operation. With respect to performing the backup restoration operation the terminal may initiate the backup or restoration operation in accordance with a selection made by a user which depends on the user s selection. And a user s intention may be queried in association with the user s selection.

Referring to the display unit may display an indicator window displayed if the restoration operation is initiated by activating the backup restoration application.

The indicator window related to the restoration operation may continue to be displayed while the restoring process is performed. Alternatively the indicator window may be displayed only if the restoration operation is completed.

The indicator window may display a restoration result or a restoration status of data which are the restoration targets of the backup restoration application. For instance the indicator window may indicate such a restoration status as a restoration result completion a restoration preparation in progress a restoration failure a partial restoration completion an installation necessity and the like.

With respect to the indicator window shown in for example a restoring process for an A application is in progress up to 80 and a restoring process for a B application or a D application is completed. Moreover a C application has failed in restoration. For another example a case of a restoration preparation in progress or a case of an installation necessity may exist.

If each of a plurality of applications or data displayed on the indicator window is selected it may be able to display information on the corresponding application or data. For instance if an E application displayed on the indicator window is selected it may be able to additionally display detailed information indicating which portion of the E application is restored or not.

In the following example embodiments of the present invention the four kinds of operations provided as restoration errors are explained in detail with reference to .

First of all in the restoring process since a terminal environment in the course of a backup may differ from a terminal environment in the course of a restoration the present invention may be able to perform the following exemplary operations.

First of all the 1restoration error i.e. the case that a specific application does not exist in a restoring process S is described with reference to as follows.

In case that a specific application is not installed in the restoring process there is a problem that it is unable to restore detailed application information on the specific application. Hence according to an example embodiment of the present invention a following procedure is performed in case that a specific application does not exist in a restoring process.

First of all the case that a specific application does not exist in a restoring process is described as follows.

Referring to in case that a specific application does not exist the controller may ask a user whether to install the non existing specific application via the display unit S . In particular the display unit may query a user s intention via a query window .

The controller checks whether a user s consent to whether to install the corresponding application via the query window S .

Referring to if the user gives his consent to install the corresponding application S the backup restoration application may be able to install the corresponding application downloaded from an external server via the wireless communication unit . In this case the external server may mean such a server capable of delivering applications as Android market and the like.

Meanwhile if the corresponding application delivered from the external server is installed the backup restoration application may be able to restore detailed application information on the corresponding application.

Referring to if the user selects not to install the corresponding application S the backup restoration application deletes the information on the corresponding application from the display window . Compared to the former display window shown in the latter display window shown in displays that the F application which needed to be installed is deleted.

In the following description the 2restoration error i.e. the case that a higher version of a specific application exists in a restoring process S is explained with reference to as follows.

Referring to if a version of a specific application installed on a terminal in a restoring process is higher than that of a version to be restored the backup restoration application may perform the following procedure.

Referring to if necessary the backup restoration application may indicate that a version of a specific application currently installed on a terminal is more recent than that of a version to be restored via a display window .

In this case since the version currently installed on the terminal is a latest version the version of the application to be restored is not restored basically. Yet in case that the corresponding specific application is the application corresponding to a white list it may be handled in a different manner.

Referring to the display unit displays a white list . In this case as mentioned in the foregoing description the white list relates to the category of targets that should be backed up in the backup process and may include the targets that should be restored in the restoring process as well. In the drawing the B application may correspond to the white list.

Referring to regarding data or application categorized into the white list if a latest version is installed on the terminal it may be able to restore detailed application information on the corresponding application S . In particular since a version of the application itself is a higher version it may not be restored. Yet the detailed application information on the application may be restored only if it corresponds to the white list.

Meanwhile an application of which compatibility with a higher version of an application has been verified may be set to be registered on the white list.

In the following description the 3restoration error i.e. the case that an application of the same version is already installed in a restoring process S is described with reference to as follows.

In the corresponding restoring process if the same version of the same application is already installed on the terminal it may be unnecessary to perform a process for re installing the corresponding application. Hence in this case it may be requested to only determine whether to restore detailed application information on the corresponding application.

Referring to the backup restoration application may be able to indicate that the same application of the same version is already installed on the terminal via the display unit .

In this case the backup restoration application may be able to restore detailed application information on the corresponding application only and may be able to ask a user about this restoring process. Referring to a user is asked about whether to overwrite detailed application information. Only if the user selects yes the detailed application information can be restored in the terminal via the overwriting.

Finally the 4restoration error i.e. the case that an application not operating in a specific terminal exists S is described with reference to as follows.

First of all in case of perform backup and restoration on data of a terminal an application normally operating in the terminal before the backup may not operate in the terminal after the restoration. For instance despite the same terminal an application may not operate normally if there is a version change of an operating system or a version change of the application. Moreover if data of a specific terminal is attempted to be restored in a different terminal the corresponding application may not operate normally. For detailed example if an application is locked with application DRM digital rights management it may not operate in a different terminal.

Therefore according to an example embodiment of the present invention it may be able to manage an application which may not operate in a specific terminal using a blacklist. As mentioned in the foregoing description the blacklist may mean a list of applications or data supposed not to be backed up to a specific terminal in the course of a backup restoration process. Hence the backup restoration application does not regard applications corresponding to the blacklist as targets for backup or restoration.

Thus a list of applications belonging to a blacklist may be backed up by a backup restoration application whereas an application operating in a specific terminal only is managed via the blacklist. Therefore according to an example embodiment of the present invention an application may be directly received from an external server based on this list. In particular when applications belonging to a blacklist are exactly restored in the terminal they do not operate due to DRM and the like. Yet application versions usable for the corresponding terminal may be received from an external server e.g. market etc. based on a list of the applications belonging to the blacklist.

Referring to an F application a calendar app and a rich note app are displayed as applications managed via a blacklist by a backup restoration application.

Referring to a display window may be used to indicate that applications belonging to the blacklist are not backed up and that a summary list of the applications belonging to the blacklist is backed up.

Referring to it may be able to indicate that versions of the applications belonging to the blacklist which are suitable for the corresponding terminal are being received from an external server e.g. market etc. based on the summary list.

Through this process when an application is usable for a specific terminal only due to DRM and the like if an application suitable for a restored terminal exist in an external server e.g. market etc. restoration can be performed in a manner of receiving the corresponding application from the external server.

Meanwhile the above described methods can be implemented in a program recorded medium as processor readable codes. Processor readable media include ROM RAM CD ROM magnetic tapes floppy discs optical data storage devices and the like for example and also include carrier wave type implementations e.g. transmission via Internet .

The aforementioned example embodiments of the mobile terminal are achieved by combination of structural elements and features of the present invention in a predetermined type. Each of the structural elements or features should be considered selectively unless specified separately. Each of the structural elements or features may be carried out without being combined with other structural elements or features. Also some structural elements and or features may be combined with one another to constitute the embodiments of the present invention.

Accordingly various example embodiments of the present invention described herein may enable an access to detailed information on an application previously inaccessible thereby providing an optimal effect in backing up and restoring a terminal. Further the present invention according to the above described example embodiments may solve a problem of restoration error due to an environment or configuration difference between a restoration target terminal and a backup target terminal.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the example embodiments of the present invention described herein and exemplified in the drawings without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
