This application is a continuation of co pending of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 076 598 filed on Mar. 20 2008 titled Method and apparatus for providing feedback regarding digital content within a social network which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

This invention relates generally to sharing information within a social network and more particularly to methods and apparatus for providing feedback regarding digital content within a social network.

As more and more different forms of digital content have become available for enjoyment through a multitude of different devices it has become more difficult to manage such content. For example a user may now have videos on various dedicated devices cellular phones personal computers or other devices. Similarly music may be available on a number of different user devices.

Additionally individuals may have a sense of information overload due to the sheer volume of content that is potentially available for their enjoyment. It has become almost impossible to review every piece of digital content that is potentially available. Because of this consumers waste time reviewing content that they are unlikely to enjoy and miss opportunities to explore content that they may have enjoyed.

There remains a need for mechanisms that allow users to better organize their digital content and to be made aware of content that may be recommended for their enjoyment.

Additionally with the increasing distribution of content through computer networks in lieu of traditional forms content providers have sought to adjust their business models to adjust for the erosion of traditional sales based upon such traditional forms. There remains a need for content providers and retailers to seek new revenue streams in light of this trend.

The present invention provides methods and apparatus for providing feedback regarding digital content within a social network.

According to one embodiment maintaining a social network and providing corresponding access to digital content entails implementations wherein a social network having social groups that respectively engage in shared communications is organized. The social network includes at least one defined social group having a plurality of members. Identification of content items collectively corresponding to content resource devices of the plurality of members of the defined social group is provided and then feedback information for the content items is maintained based upon feedback respectively provided by members of the defined social group in relation to the content items. This feedback information is then provided to members of the defined social group.

In one embodiment the feedback may be in the form of quantitative ratings respectively associated with the plurality of content items. Alternatively the feedback comprises a recommendation that is received from at least one of the members in the given defined social group and the recommendation is forwarded to other members in the given defined social group. As another alternative the feedback comprises a determination of the amount of usage of respective ones of the plurality of content items by the members in the given defined social group.

The feedback may also be solicited pursuant to an audition mode wherein a member of the defined social group specifically requests the feedback from other members of the defined social group for a particular content item.

A variety of content such as video and music may be the content upon which feedback is maintained and provided. An interface may be provided through which members of the given defined social group make selections of the plurality of content items for downloading from one or more other members of the given defined social group. Alternatively an interface through which members of the given defined social group make selections of the plurality of content items for purchasing selected ones of the plurality of content items from an online resource may be provided.

The present invention can be embodied in various forms including business processes computer implemented methods computer program products computer systems and networks user interfaces application programming interfaces and the like.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous details are set forth such as flowcharts and system configurations in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.

The content feedback application accommodates a linking of the content available from various personal devices that users may have available within their home network or the like. Examples of such devices include DVR Digital Video Recorder PVR Personal Video Recorder DMP Digital Media Player DMS Digital Media Server PMS Personal Media Server PMP Personal Media Player or any device configurable to store and or play content including music and video content. Additionally some devices may implement Internet or other network resources for storage which means that the content may actually be stored in other locations.

In the example where the social network is provided through a website various examples can be used including but not limited to MySpace Facebook YahooGroups or others. Additionally a private arrangement involving shared web resources may allow a group of users to independently define a social network.

A user may interface with such a social network service using conventional Internet connections. Typically this may be done through a personal computer and conventional browsing. The content feedback application is illustrated resident on the server side as part of the services provided by the social network site . However it is noted that the functionality of linking the content on devices and allowing the group to provide feedback may be provided by server side software client side software or a combination thereof. To explain some local software may be used on the client side to link and organize the various content items of a given user and this local client side software may cooperate with server side software in order to carry out the sharing with other group members. Alternatively the functionality of linking and organizing the content may be primarily carried out with server side software with the various local devices connected to the network and independently reporting updates regarding available content to the server side software. In addition to the content stored on local devices content stored on the Internet or other resources may also be linked to the user and then the group .

Regardless of how this is performed the content from each member of a defined social group is collectively linked and organized. This allows the available content to be accessed previewed and potentially acquired by the various users in a defined social group. It also provides a platform through which feedback ratings usage metrics etc. is provided regarding the content that is collectively available from the group. The devices and corresponding content may be variously connected to interface with the content feedback application . For example a home computer may implement a conventional broadband connection to Internet resources and wireless or wired routing may be employed to make connections to devices that store the content within a home network.

By way of example a user may link to a social networking site having the content feedback application . As such their digital content devices such as DVR PMP and other devices are linked to the site. Based on user preferences their circle of friends selected or otherwise connected would be alerted to new music or video that the user just watched or listened to. A user may be part of several groups such as different groups based on content type or separate business and personal groups.

The linking of such content allows an alert regarding recent additions to the user s music video or audio libraries and offers the opportunity to buy rent or otherwise access the same content. This takes the concept of informing friends about new content books CDs movies etc. to the level of automatically alerting one or more defined social groups to which the user belongs. The scale of a social network and word of mouth advertising would grow accordingly each time a member viewed that content their circle is potentially alerted.

With these connections and the corresponding linking of content the content feedback application variously organizes and provides a feedback platform for the content. In one aspect maintaining a social network and providing corresponding access to digital content entails organizing a social network wherein a plurality of defined social groups respectively engage in shared communications. The application accesses the content resource devices that cumulatively correspond to members of defined social groups. Thus for example members in a given defined social group may respectively review content items that are collectively sourced by all of the content resource devices of the members in the given defined social group. Through the platform of the defined social group the application provides opportunities to review new content and provide feedback regarding content.

In this fashion the members of the social group are invited to access the content items of the group for enjoyment or to provide corresponding feedback. Various feedback may be provided. For example the feedback may comprise quantitative ratings respectively associated with the content items such as a numerical e.g. 1 5 rating or the like. This allows the feedback to be organized into a group rating reflective of the collective feedback of the members e.g. averaging etc. .

The feedback may also be provided in the form of a recommendation. As such a member may specifically recommend new content to other group members.

Still further the feedback may be provided depending upon usage. Usage may be reported by devices to the content feedback application. Listings may then be provided regarding which content has been viewed or listened to most frequently over a recent time period. This allows the members of the group to keep apprised regarding recently popular content.

Auditions may also be supported by the content feedback application . In this mode a member may solicit feedback regarding a particular piece of content. In this mode the content is identified and a message may be provided soliciting the feedback. The message may be active or passive. An example of an active message is an e mail or other communication specifically requesting the feedback. Alternatively the solicitation may be passively provided wherein the next time a group member logs on to the social network site they are invited to review and provide feedback. These mechanisms may also be used to keep the membership regularly aware of new content items even where this type of feedback is not solicited.

The actual access to the content may be from the member devices or through separate channels. For example while one member may have content on their DVR a preview or other access of the content may be through a separate online resource e.g. content provider or retailer . In this mode the content may be uniquely identified and reported to the content provider or retailer to further preview or purchase the material.

Alternatively the group members may actually access the content from the devices of the other group members. There the members may be pier to pier connected for a download or streamed access to the content items or the social network site may facilitate the same.

Some form of tracking and reporting may be provided regarding the distribution of the content if desired. This may allow the group members to take advantage of collective bargaining power in accessing content. For example the group members may collectively participate in a subscription model for accessing and or acquiring content at group rates that are lower than they would pay as individuals. The tracking and reporting model also allows content providers to better understand the market and corresponding content usage.

The content feedback application includes a social group definition module an available content module a content feedback module and a content acquisition module .

The social group definition module stores information defining one or more social groups. In the case of notable online social network services there may be many thousands of groups. In the case of software that separately organizes a private group as little as one group may be organized. The social group definition module may employ login credentials e.g. user name and password to register and authenticate access and may also implement cookie or related technology so as to automatically recognize access by a device corresponding to a member. Each member is preferably uniquely identified but there may also be corresponding group identifiers that allow members to be correlated to multiple different groups e.g. separate personal and business groups as noted .

The content playing devices of members may also be registered in association with individual members. These may be personal computer s corresponding home network devices cellular phones or other devices as described. Preferably interfaces are provided so that the user can manage the devices that are recognized by the content feedback application

Additionally the content corresponding to a member may be organized into a listing that is variously accessible for content management. For example the listing may be tabulated according to content type e.g. music movies photos with corresponding indication of which device s store or have access to the content and the ability to filter the display such as by artist title or other keywords.

The available content module organizes the content collectively corresponding to the defined social group s . For a given social group this entails an accumulation of the information corresponding to the individual member s content as described in connection with the social group definition module as described above.

The available content that is displayed in association with access by a particular member is also preferably filtered so that the member is not inundated with stale or duplicative content items. For example the cumulative listing may be only content items that have been used or recommended by a group member within a predetermined time frame e.g. the last month etc. . Additionally a given content item that is recommended or used by many different users is preferably not listed repeatedly. Rather a single listing may be employed with an indication of the extent of usage indicated in association with the listing. For example the listing may indicate 85 of 100 group members have used recommend this item etc.

The content feedback module is in operative communication with the available content module and organizes the solicitation and receipt of feedback regarding various content items. As described previously a variety of feedback may be obtained maintained and reported to the membership to assist in their evaluation and review of content items. The illustrated feedback functions include usage ratings and recommendation modules.

The usage of content items may be tracked and reported to members. When a content item that has been registered with the content feedback application is played e.g. a music item is listened to or a movie is watched a reporting mechanism may be employed so that the extent group usage may be evaluated. In this fashion a member may become quickly aware of content that is currently popular. The reporting mechanism may merely be a content identifier that is sent to the content feedback module .

This usage reporting may be rendered anonymously if desired. That is the overall usage of content items by the group may be displayed for review by individual members but the information may be filtered so that it is not evident which individual is using particular content.

The ratings function is based upon ratings that are actively provided by members of the defined social group. Preferably some form of standardized quantitative mechanism such as a numerical rating is applied for uniformity. The ratings function collects the ratings provided by members and offers corresponding reports regarding content items. The ratings information may also be provided in association with the usage information or may be provided separately. As with other criteria the available content module is provided with this information so that the available content may be filtered and displayed to the user member accordingly. That is if the member wants to review only content having a certain quantitative rating and with a certain level of usage corresponding displays of content items meeting the desired criteria are provided.

The recommendation function allows a member to particularly recommend a given content item. This allows the member to provide a level of notoriety outside the context of the ratings scheme for an item that is believed to merit special attention. The recommended content item may also be actively presented to the other members whereas general usage and ratings may more typically be presented based upon review of content as described. The message regarding the recommended content item may be variously conveyed such as by separate messages or by a notable display provided by a personalized web page through which the content feedback application interfaces with users.

The content acquisition module provides information that allows members to acquire access to content items following review of the available content. This may be in the form of determining which group member devices are currently accessible to obtain the content items. Alternatively separate providers e.g. an online content provider or online retailer may be employed to obtain the content. Content identifiers may be used in association with content items so that the availability of such content items may be explored with such alternative content providers. For certain media this may be accommodated by noting a digital fingerprint associated with the content. Alternatively a unique identifier may be associated with content independently of such identification. Still further keyword based searching or the like based upon title or authorship may be employed.

If desired the content acquisition module may enforce digital rights management DRM requirements in determining the propriety of access to content items.

For example the tracking and reporting of content may be performed in conjunction with content provider s that source the content to the members of the defined social groups with the described group identifiers being used to associate usage to the group members. Various models may be applied to the benefit of the group members in such an arrangement. For example the group may enjoy a monthly content access fee that is shared by the group to lower individual costs. Alternatively individual downloads of content may be made available at a discounted group rate.

The method relies upon an organization of a social network having one or more defined social groups as described. Through connections made to the content feedback application information is acquired regarding the content items found of devices of members of the defined social group s and information about the collective content items is conveyed to the group membership.

Interfaces are provided in order to review the available content items provide access to such content items and to collect feedback regarding the content items. As noted various forms of feedback may be provided including but not limited to quantitative ratings and the amount of usage of content items by the group members. Additionally specific recommendations for particular content items may be made.

The content feedback application updates and maintains the information about all forms of feedback and conveys such information to group members. This allows provision of filtered offerings to the users based upon the collective content items of the group members with indication of which content items are currently popular or highly rated.

Once a user member reviews content items they are also accommodated with the opportunity to acquire content items. This may be in the form of accessing the content item from the device of another member of the defined social group or alternatively resources such as online content providers or retailers may be employed. Reporting and tracking of information about content usage allows the group membership to participate in arrangements wherein the group acquires content potentially at discounted group rates or the like.

Thus embodiments of the present invention produce and provide methods and apparatus for providing feedback regarding digital content within a social network environment. Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof the invention may be variously embodied without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Therefore the following claims should not be limited to the description of the embodiments contained herein in any way.
