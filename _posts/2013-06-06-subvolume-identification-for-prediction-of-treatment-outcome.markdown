title: Subvolume identification for prediction of treatment outcome
abstract: Physiological imaging-defined subvolumes of tissues/disease are identified to yield spatially-defined prognostic and/or predictive indicators and/or focal therapy targets within such tissues, in particular tumors, for evaluation over time, for example, prior to and after a therapy treatment. Medical image data is analyzed to delineate subvolumes of tissue based upon multiple physiological, metabolic, and biological imaging properties, where those subvolumes are extracted and analyzed in a probabilistic manner to associate with one or more abnormal or disease phenotype conditions.

This application claims benefit to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 656 323 filed on Jun. 6 2012 and entitled SUBVOLUME IDENTIFICATION FOR PREDICTION OF TREATMENT OUTCOME the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

This invention was made with government support under Contract Nos. RO1 NS064973 R21 CA113699 and 3P01 CA59827 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates generally to a method to identify physiological metabolic molecular and or biological imaging defined abnormalities phenotypes of diseases for diagnosis prognosis or prediction of therapy response and or for intensified local treatment.

When treating tumors the effectiveness of a treatment is determined by analyzing tumor size comparing the size pre treatment and post treatment. Typically tumor size is measured through an analysis of magnetic resonance imaging MRI or other image data. Such techniques have been used for years and are relatively effective. However unfortunately a tumor size change often occurs late and therefore the patient loses the time window for optimal treatment.

In recent years physiological metabolic and molecular imaging has been developed and tested for early prediction of tumor treatment response and outcome with a promise that a biological change in the tumor could occur prior to its size change. Analysis of physiological metabolic and molecular imaging in the tumor is often done by averaging the values of the relevant physiological imaging parameter in the tumor and then comparing the mean values between pre and post therapy. This is a simple but not effective approach due to neglecting the heterogeneous distribution of the physiological parameter in the tumor particularly in large tumors. An average value of a physiological imaging parameter in the tumor can wash out the sensitivity of the parameter to a change in the tumor. Indeed this sensitivity problem is a direct result of the inability of existing techniques to effectively discriminate the information within a tumor image. Tumor image data may reflect numerous different phenotypes conditions within a tissue mass but without an ability to properly discriminate between these different phenotypes conditions from a medical image data effective analysis and diagnosis is limited.

A voxel by voxel analysis of a change in the physiological metabolic or molecular imaging parameter of the tumor pre and post therapy is an improvement but requires an accurate registration of a pair of images obtained pre and post therapy. When there is tumor growth and shrinkage from pre to post therapy the results of the voxel by voxel analysis of the physiological imaging are often incorrect or at a minimum misleading. The reasons for this are numerous but the primary culprit is mis registration of image data at the voxel level. As a tumor changes in size it is difficult to register with satisfactory certainty a first image of a tumor taken at one point e.g. pre treatment with the second image of that same tumor now changed taken at a second point e.g. post treatment. This image registration problem commonly requires complex image analysis to correct and still limits the effectiveness of practitioners to use physiological metabolic and molecular imaging for proper tumor treatment assessment.

To derive a physiological imaging parameter from dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging DCE MRI data or other dynamic PET SPECT data involves time consuming pharmacokinetic modeling. Trying to diagnose physiological conditions from that image parameter is prone to error poor reproducibility and lack of accuracy. For example in analyzing a physiological imaging parameter of a tumor for therapy response a parameter such as Gd DTPA gadopentetic acid transfer constant K derived from DCE MRI by a pharmacokinetic model is sensitive to noise in the DCE MRI and has a reproducibility of approximately 20 which reduces the minimum change that can be detected post therapy compared to pre therapy. Ultimately medical imaging is used in tumor treatment to determine which treatments are more effective and where to direct those treatments within the patient. For example intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRT seeks to deliver high precision nonuniform dose patterns through painting and sculpting doses in a radiation target volume in order to improve the therapeutic ratio and treatment outcome. The conventional IMRT attempts to optimize and deliver a treatment plan having a uniform dose distribution within a target volume delineated primarily based upon anatomic images of computed tomography CT and or MRI. Geometrically conforming high doses within the target volume by IMRT can reduce dose spread into normal tissue and organs at risk. However target volume delineation based upon anatomic information provided by CT images and MRI images is limited. Also considering spatially heterogeneous biological properties of a tumor a uniform dose distribution within a target volume might not lead to an optimal treatment outcome.

In any event voxel by voxel image analyses while effective to an extent are limiting. A more useful approach is desired.

The present techniques address the foregoing problems by providing techniques for assessing imaging defined abnormalities phenotypes of diseases in regions of interests through physiological metabolic biologic and or molecular imaging to identify abnormality probabilities of a tumor or other disease and more specifically multiple biological subvolumes that may be analyzed against any number of disease conditions. In this way not only are diagnostic determinations possible but prognostic or predictive determinations can be made for predicting a therapy response and outcome of treatment on an identified subvolume. From here the techniques may be used to provide a biological imaging defined target for intensive treatments e.g. for more effective painting and sculpting of radiation dosage treatments or any number of tumor treatment optimizations.

In some examples the present techniques are built upon the development of a functional image analysis framework to integrate physiological metabolic molecular and or biological information from a variety of functional imaging sources to delineate imaging defined phenotype subvolumes of a tumor and to relate them to treatment response and outcome.

The techniques are designed to delineate subvolumes of a tumor based upon its heterogeneous distributions of physiological metabolic and or biological imaging parameters. For example the techniques may assign each voxel a probabilistic membership function belonging to the physiological parameter classes defined in a sample of tumors and then calculates the related subvolumes in each tumor. In some examples the present techniques were used to delineate tumor subvolumes from regional cerebral blood volume rCBV and Gd DTPA gadopentetic acid transfer constant K from blood plasma to tissue in patients who have had brain metastases and who received whole brain radiation therapy WBRT . A subvolume analysis of the tumor and in particular in changes to the subvolume after starting therapy was used to assess and predict treatment response from pre treatment to post RT. Changes in the rCBV or K defined subvolumes of the tumors after starting RT were evaluated for differentiating responsive stable and non responsive tumors using from which performance metrics for predicting tumor response to WBRT was developed with suitable results from Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC analysis. The ROC analysis showed that this new metric was significantly better than the decrease in the gross tumor volume GTV observed during the same time interval for predicting post therapy response suggesting that physiological imaging adds discriminatory information compared to the volumetric change.

Other techniques herein include developing a diffusion abnormality index DAI to quantify the extent of abnormality of the tumor apparent diffusion coefficient ADC histogram compared to normal tissue. A normal tissue ADC histogram H ADC is obtained in a normal brain volume of 3 4 cc with the peak normalized to 1. The tumor ADC histogram that usually spreads beyond H ADC is divided by H ADC into 3 categories low high cellularity normal and high edema and necrosis ADC. An abnormal diffusion probability function DAProF of the tumor is then defined by 1 H ADC and band pass filtered to reduce noise influence at the two tails of the histogram. Given that changes in low and high ADCs could have different roles in response assessment a factor 0

The features functions and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments.

The present techniques provide image analysis of the heterogeneous distribution of one or more candidate physiological metabolic molecular and or biologic imaging parameters in the tumor to determine the abnormality probability map and a quantitative abnormality metric. The abnormality metric and a change during the course of therapy are designed for diagnosis prognosis and prediction of tumor response to treatment. When assessing a tumor response to treatment this technique does not require co registration of images acquired at two different points in time. Furthermore the techniques do not use hard thresholding to analyze the heterogeneous distribution of the physiological imaging parameters in the tumor. The techniques may be applied to physiological metabolic molecular and or biologic imaging parameters e.g. vascular parameters or features cellular parameters or features etc. as well as to the dynamic contrast agent tracer uptake images directly e.g. DCE MRI dynamic PET SPECT with or without pharmacokinetic modeling. And the techniques can be used to analyze multiple physiological metabolic molecular and or biologic parameters for testing discriminatory or redundant information and to combine them into a single metric.

The techniques herein differ from methods that generate parametric response maps PRMs . In the PRM method after co registration of a pair of images acquired at two different time points over therapy a difference of the image intensities before and after therapy at each voxel is analyzed and a response value is assigned to each voxel according to its change above or below a cutoff threshold. Although analyzing a voxel wise change in a tumor is an interesting approach mis registration of the image voxels particularly in the region where a tumor shrinks or grows during the time interval could compromise the result. The techniques also differ from using a hard threshold to segment the abnormal value of the heterogeneously distributed physiological imaging parameter. While using a threshold value to segment a tumor volume is simple the binary decision discards the parameter continuity at the threshold value. Furthermore finding an adequate threshold value is always a challenge and often done empirically and sometimes arbitrarily.

The present techniques overcome these challenges by using a smart algorithm e.g. fuzzy logic a genetic algorithm or Gaussian mixture models to analyze physiological metabolic molecular and or biologic imaging parameters or features of voxels from a sample of tumors. The algorithm may be globally initiated in a training state from a collective sample and provide localized assessment of individual tumors or regions in an analysis state. A probability density function or histogram of the imaging parameters or features from all the voxels of the sample of the tumors is created and analyzed by a fuzzy logic algorithm or other discrimination algorithm for determining the abnormality classifications and related probability functions. For a new tumor after measuring and deriving the imaging parameters or features the abnormality classifications determined from the sample of the tumors are applied in order to assign each voxel of the new tumor a probability function of belonging to those image defined abnormality classes. Then an abnormality probability map of the tumor can be created as an output for visualization and or a target for focal therapy e.g. radiation boost target. Finally a quantitative abnormality metric of the tumor is created according to its abnormality probability functions for diagnosis and prognosis of the tumor. A change in the abnormality metric during the course of therapy or post therapy reflecting a change in the physiological metabolic molecular or biologic imaging parameters in the tumor note such changes often occur before a volumetric change is achieved for prediction of tumor response to therapy. As mentioned before the present techniques do not depend upon voxel wise accuracy of registration of a pair of images acquired pre and during or post therapy or use any hard threshold to determine the abnormality level of the tumor.

The techniques of may be utilized on different properties of the subvolumes of a tumor such as the vascularity of subvolumes of the tumor the cellularity of subvolumes of the tumor etc. For example the method may utilize vascular properties such as blood flow blood volume etc. in predicting treatment outcome. On the other hand the method may also examine cellularity properties i.e. the water mobility in tissue to determine an abnormal diffusion coefficient in predicting treatment outcome. The prediction results from the both properties may be combined or added together to provide a more refined accurate overall prediction for treatment outcome.

The technique of subvolume analysis of a tumor as illustrated in is designed to delineate subvolumes of a tumor based upon its heterogeneous distributions of physiological imaging derived parameters or features. Furthermore this subvolume analysis method may accept one or more different imaging derived parameters as inputs. For instance one of type of physiological imaging derived parameter may include one or more parameters generated from a pharmacokinetics PK modeling technique. Using inputs from this PK modeling technique the subvolume analysis technique assigns each image voxel a probabilistic membership function belonging to the physiological parameter classes defined in a sample of tumors and then calculates the related subvolumes in each tumor. Furthermore this technique may define or model subvolumes of volume weighted physiological parameters using probabilistic classification of image voxels for features predictive of poor treatment outcome combined with clustering methods for example.

The subvolume analysis technique of may also use principal component PC features derived from a principal component analysis PCA as inputs as opposed to using the PK modeling inputs. This PCA is a pharmacokinetic model free framework that analyzes the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging DCE MRI data. This PCA technique further utilizes DCE MRI data from image voxels of a sample of brain tumors to construct a DCE matrix. PCA may then be applied to generate the PCs and subsequent projection coefficient maps. Next a modeling technique such as a pattern recognition based upon fuzzy c means clustering may be used to delineate the tumor subvolumes relating to the value of the projection coefficients. The relationship between changes in different tumor subvolumes and treatment response may be evaluated to differentiate responsive from stable and progressive tumors.

There is an understanding that high mean or rCBV or Kin the brain tumor prior to therapy is correlated with a high tumor grade and worse outcome. A reduction in the high rCBV and or Kin brain tumors during radiation therapy is associated with better outcome. All these suggest that high rCBV and or Kin the brain tumor as an imaging defined tumor phenotype and the related changes during therapy are important prognostic and predictive indictors. Based upon these observations in the brain tumors the techniques herein were evaluated to delineate the high rCBV abnormality probability map of the tumor and or the abnormality subvolumes defined by rCBV K or combinations of the two parameters in the brain metastases. As discussed above it was found that the early change in the high rCBV defined subvolume of the tumor is a better predictor for the post therapy tumor volumetric change and has the potential to be used for selecting the lesion and defining the target for intensified treatment. The results also indicated that K although a different physiological parameter in the tumor compared to rCBV does not add significant discriminatory information for assessment of brain metastases response to WBRT. However the techniques herein can be used to test whether including other physiological imaging parameters in analyses e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient or 11 C MET positron emission tomography PET fluorodeoxyglucose FDG uptake etc. can improve prediction for treatment response. This type of analysis can help determine whether multiple candidate physiological metabolic molecular and or biologic imaging parameters provide complementary or redundant information. Also the analysis can be adapted to specific tumor types and treatment modalities.

In an example implementation of the techniques described herein twenty patients 11 women and 9 men ages 41 76 years diagnosed with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective MRI study approved by the institutional review board Table 1 . The histology included melanoma 11 non small cell lung cancer 6 renal cell carcinoma 1 breast cancer 1 and head neck squamous cell carcinoma 1 . All patients received WBRT with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions 13 patients or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions 7 patients . In addition thirteen patients received Bortezomib during WBRT as a radiation sensitizer. If a patient had three brain metastatic lesions or less all lesions were included in this analysis. If a patient had more than three lesions only the three largest lesions were included. If a patient had more than three lesions larger than 1 cm the lesions greater than 1 cmwere also included. As a total 45 lesions with a median volume of 1.65 cmand a range of 0.1 17.6 cmwere analyzed.

All patients had MRI scans on a Philips 3T scanner prior to radiation therapy Pre RT where RT is radiation therapy 2 weeks after the start of RT 2 W and 1 month after the completion of treatment 1 M Post RT . MRI scans included pre and post Gd DTPA volumetric T1 weighted images multi slice 2D T2 weighted images and volumetric dynamic contrast enhanced DCE T1 weighted images. The DCE images were acquired in the sagittal plane with an image matrix of 128 128 80 a field of view of 240 240 160 mm a voxel size of 2 2 2 mm a flip angle of 20 and TE TR of 1.04 5.14 msec.

An image registration was used to align the DCE MRI with the anatomic MRI both of which were acquired at a same time point therefore there is no tumor growth or shrinkage. The physician created a tumor volume on the anatomic images which can be transferred to the DCE MRI that has a lower spatial resolution. The general Toft model was used to fit DCE MRI to obtain rCBV and Kmaps with an arterial input function AIF determined from a region of interest ROI in the carotid artery. Each lesion of interest was manually contoured by a physician on the post Gd T1 weighed images obtained pre RT 2 W and 1 M post RT. Then the tumor contours at each time point were transferred to the corresponding rCBV and Kmaps.

Probability Density Functions of Physiological Parameters to analyze rCBV distributions in the lesions and subsequent changes during treatment a PDF of rCBV of a lesion was generated by using a non parametric PDF estimator. The PDF includes 150 evenly spaced points to cover the range of the rCBV values for all the lesions of interest. A value of the PDF at a point x H rCBV x of a lesion was calculated as rCBV rCBV 1 where nwas the number of voxels within rCBV 

previous studies have suggested that the rCBV distribution of a brain tumor is abnormal compared to normal cerebral tissue. A renormalization of tumor vasculature such as decreasing the elevated rCBV and increasing the low one could be an indicator of a tumor response to treatment. The present techniques were used to determine a set of probability functions that are associated with high intermediate and low rCBV classes. Hence H rCBV is partitioned into three classes using fuzzy c means FCM clustering analysis by minimizing an objective function J rCBV rCBV 1 2 where cis a prototype vector of the jclass P rCBV is a probabilistic membership of an rCBV value belonging to the jth class and m is a fuzzy exponent and chosen as 2. The solutions of Eq. 2 are determined iteratively by 

a primary interest was to test if a change in a subvolume of the tumor defined by high intermediate or low rCBV values is related to tumor treatment response. The system defines a subvolume SV of a tumor with low intermediate or high rCBV using the probabilistic membership function P rCBV and calculated a percentage change in the SV from Pre RT to two weeks 2 W as follows 

A percentage change in the gross tumor volume GTV from pre RT to post RT was used as an endpoint for response assessment. Several patients did not have 3 or 6 months post treatment imaging follow ups. For the patients in whom 3 and 6 months post RT images were available there were good correlations in the GTV changes between 1 and 3 months post RT and between 3 and 6 months post RT data not shown . Also previous studies indicated that brain metastases exhibit little pseudo response and pseudo progression one month after RT. Therefore a percentage change was used in the GTV from Pre RT to 1 month post RT circumflex over GTV as a measure of tumor response to therapy. From Pre RT to 1 M Post RT 16 tumors had a decrease in the GTV at least 25 defined as responsive 11 tumors had an increase at least 25 defined as non responsive and the remaining 18 were defined as stable. It was noticed that there were heterogeneous responses of multiple lesions from a single patient. Thus each lesion was considered independently.

first as part of the technique it was tested if there were any significant differences in the changes of circumflex over SV between responsive stable and non responsive tumors using Mann Whitney U Test. To justify multiple comparisons e.g. 2 3 or 6 parameters being simultaneous evaluated a p value

Finally it was tested if combining the two physiological parameters of rCBV and Kcould improve prediction for tumor response. To do so first a joint histogram of the rCBV and Kof a lesion is computed e.g. H rCBV x K y . Then a joint probability function P rCBV K is defined as follows 

examples of maps of the abnormality probability functions belonging to the class of high rCBV high Kand combinations of the two of a responsive and a stable lesion at Pre RT and at two weeks 2 W are shown in . In particular as shown in the example maps include a T1 weighted top left rCBV top middle and Ktrans top right . The second row of includes maps at pre RT that illustrate the probabilities of voxels belonging to classes with high rCBV left high K middle and high for both rCBV and K right . The third row of includes maps at end of RT that illustrate the probabilities of voxels belonging to classes with high rCBV left high K middle and high for both rCBV and K right . Note that the spatial distribution of the probability function map of the high rCBV class of a lesion can be different from one of the high Kclass and both can change from Pre RT to 2 W. For the responsive lesion the voxel probability functions belonging to the high rCBV Kclass were reduced to almost zero from Pre RT to 2 W and for the stable lesion the reduction was in a much smaller extent.

it was found that the percentage decrease in the high rCBV subvolumes of the tumors from Pre RT to 2 W of the responsive group differed significantly from the non responsive group p

the predictive value of the decrease in the subvolumes of the tumors defined by the high rCBV Kfrom Pre RT to 2 W for predicting responsive tumors post RT was explored and compared the performance with the two conventional metrics. The ROC analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.80 0.07 SEM 0.70 0.08 0.67 0.08 and 0.56 0.09 for circumflex over SV rCBV circumflex over rCBV circumflex over GTVand circumflex over SV K respectively as shown in indicating the high rCBV defined subvolume of the tumor had the best performance among the tested variables for predicting responsive tumor. The subvolumes defined by the high rCBV and high Kclasses with the weighting factor 0.6 determined by empirical evaluation of the AUCs as shown in resulted in the largest AUC 0.85 0.06. The statistical analysis of the pair wise ROC curves revealed that circumflex over SV rCBV k 0.6 was a predictor slightly but not significantly better than

circumflex over SV rCBV p 0.18 or circumflex over rCBV p 0.0574 . However both circumflex over SV rCBV and circumflex over SV rCBV k 0.6 were predictors significantly better than circumflex over GTV p 0.022 and p 0.0102 respectively . Finally the predictive value of circumflex over was slightly but not significantly better than circumflex over GTV p 0.41 .

Thus the present techniques propose new approaches to delineating the abnormality subvolumes of a tumor defined from physiological metabolic and or biological imaging parameters and relating their early changes to treatment response in the patients who have had brain metastases treated by WBRT. The approaches analyze the heterogeneous distributions of physiological metabolic and or biological imaging parameters of the tumors then assigns each voxel of the tumor a probabilistic membership function belonging to the various physiological metabolic or biological classes defined in a sample of tumors and finally calculates the related subvolumes in each tumor.

The framework presented herein can be applied to other physiological metabolic or molecular images including but not limited to apparent diffusion coefficient and 11 C Methinion positron emission tomography PET to delineate a different physiological parameter defined subvolume of a tumor. A subvolume of the tumor defined in such way could be a candidate for a radiation boost target volume for example.

In another example implementation the present techniques were applied to dynamic contrast enhanced DCE MRI image data. The implementation used global initiated regularized local fuzzy clustering GRELFC similar to the techniques outlined above to identify abnormal subvolumes of head and neck cancers HNC from heterogeneous distributions of tumor blood volume BV and blood flow BF i.e. from functional image data for assessment of therapy response.

In operation BV and BF images derived from DCE MRI of 14 patients with advanced HNC were obtained before chemo radiation therapy chemo RT and 2 weeks after start of 7 week chemo RT. The delineated subvolumes of tumors with low BV or BF before and during treatment were evaluated for their associations with local failure. Receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis was used to assess performance of the method for prediction of local failure of HNC. As discussed further the results showed that the sizes of the subvolumes of primary tumors with low BV before and during treatment were significantly greater in the patients with local failure LF than with local control LC p 0.02 and 0.01 respectively . While the total tumor volume reductions during treatment were similar for the patients with LF and LC the reduction rate of the size of the subvolumes of the primary tumor with low BV in response to 2 weeks of chemo RT was significantly slower for the patients with LF than those with LC. The subvolumes of the tumor with low BV before and during treatment have greater specificity for prediction of local failure with a given sensitivity than the pre treatment total tumor volume the percentage change in the tumor volume during treatment or the change in the mean value of BV over the whole tumor during chemo RT.

Standard care for advanced head and neck cancers HNC includes aggressive concurrent chemo radiation therapy chemo RT . Intensifying this regimen has resulted in improved control rates as well as increased rates and severity of late toxicity. Despite improvements failure rates are 20 50 in patients who are negative for human papillomavirus and failures are predominantly local regional. The present techniques provide a means for prognostic or predictive valuation to facilitate identification of subvolumes of the tumors likely to be resistant to conventional radiation doses in the patients who are at high risk for local regional failure and who thus may benefit from intensifying local treatment. Recently functional imaging that assesses tumor hypoxia or perfusion prior to therapy in HNC has been described. In patients with HNC treated by RT low tumor perfusion prior to RT and T stage classification were identified as independent predictors for local failure suggesting that poorly perfused HN tumors respond poorly to RT and that pre RT tumor perfusion provides prognostic value for local control even when accounting for established clinical prognostic factors. Another recent study showed that high pre therapy tumor blood volume and perfusion were associated with large decreases in tumor volumes in response to induction chemotherapy. By characterizing tumor properties of blood volume BV and blood flow BF derived from DCE MRI images the present techniques showed that an increase of blood volume in the primary tumor volume during the early course of chemo RT was associated with local control which indicates that poorly perfused tumors may be resistant to conventional doses of radiation therapy.

In these previous studies the average BV and BF in the entire tumor volume were investigated for their association with treatment outcome. However many advanced head and neck cancers have quite inhomogeneous perfusion characteristics within the tumor volume particularly in large tumors. Thus averaging BV and BF values over the entire tumor may not result in optimal parameters for prediction of outcomes. A change in the total tumor volume during the course of chemo RT although the total tumor volume in HNC is a clinical prognostic factor has a poor predictive value for outcomes. The subvolume of the tumor that is resistant to chemo RT might provide better prediction for outcomes. Therefore it was hypothesized that the large poorly perfused subvolume of the head and neck tumor pre therapy and persisting during the early course of definitive chemo RT could be a better indicator for local regional treatment failure than the tumor size or the average perfusion parameters over the entire tumors.

the technique implemented in this example was designed to globally initiate training to identify fuzzy clusters of the physiological imaging parameters in the feature space and then classify each tumor volume with local regularization to subvolumes according to the global feature clusters. The technique is designed not only to identify the subvolumes of individual tumors based upon the heterogeneous distributions of physiological imaging parameters but also to be able to compare the classified subvolumes of the tumors across patients and over multiple time points. The fuzzy clustering method specifically fuzzy C means clustering FCM chosen in the GRELFC method aims to deal with 1 intrinsic variations of the physiological parameters in the tumors 2 partial volume effects due to the limited resolution of imaging sources and 3 uncertainty due to noise. FCM clustering is a method of unsupervised learning to assign a set of observations to belong to subsets clusters with probability memberships. To partition a set of observations x e.g. image voxels into c clusters an objective function with local spatial regularization 

In order to evaluate longitudinal changes in physiological imaging parameters of interest in the tumor a set of data was used as training data to determine definitions of clusters prototype vectors and relationships between fuzzy memberships and observations and then the remaining sets of data are partitioned according to the class definitions of training data. To avoid a bias from large tumors in training data each of the tumor volumes is up sampled or down sampled to have an equal number of voxels contributing to the training data while maintaining the initial distribution of the physiological imaging parameters from the original into the re sampled tumor. To do so a histogram of the physiological imaging parameters of each tumor is generated and re sampled to create a new tumor volume with the same size. The re created tumor volume while preserving the original distribution histogram of the imaging parameters cannot maintain the original spatial relationship between voxels which is not critical for training data to determine prototype vectors of global clusters. To partition individual tumors in the second data set fuzzy membership of each voxel of each tumor is classified using the prototype vectors found in analysis of the training data by Eq. 9 where spatial constraint is used to improve spatial continuity. Finally the highest probability of fuzzy membership of each voxel is used to assign the voxel to a discreet class. As a result the tumor is partitioned into spatial subvolumes based upon the similarity of the physiological parameters of interest. The temporal changes in partitioned subvolumes of the tumor are evaluated for their association with outcomes. To evaluate this method to identify significant subvolumes of the tumor related to outcomes the method to BV and BF images derived from DCE MRI of patients with advanced head and neck cancer was applied.

14 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas were enrolled in a prospective MRI study that was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Table 3 summarized the characteristics of the patients. All patients received definitive 7 week concurrent chemo RT with a total radiation dose of 70 Gy to the primary gross tumor volume GTV and involved nodes by intensity modulated radiation therapy 12 patients or three dimensional conformal radiation therapy 2 patients . For chemotherapy 8 patients received carboplatin 1 area under the curve and paclitaxel 30 mg m2 weekly 5 patients received cisplatin 100 mg m2 once every 3 weeks and 1 patient received cetuximab with a loading dose of 400 mg m2 followed by weekly dose of 250 mg m.

After receiving chemo RT all patients were followed for clinical evaluation. Follow up visits per protocol took place every 6 weeks for the first two years then every 3 months for the third year and every 6 months from the fourth year forward. Per protocol MRI scans took place 3 months after the completion of RT. FDG positron emission tomography PET CT other MRI scans or biopsy was elected as clinical indication. The median follow up time for living patients was 19.6 months range 14.1 to 36.4 months post treatment. At these evaluations 8 patients had local regional controlled diseases and without distant metastasis 3 had local failure 1 had local regional failure 1 had regional failure and 1 had local regional control but distant failure.

all MRI scans were acquired using a Philips 3T scanner Philips Healthcare . Scans were taken before radiation therapy pre RT and 2 weeks after start of therapy later referred as wk 2 or during RT . Each scan included the following series T1 weighted images T2 weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR images DCE T1 weighted images and post contrast T1 weighted images. Thirty two dynamic volumes of T1 weighted MRI were acquired by a 3D gradient echo pulse sequence in the sagittal plane during intravenous injection of 0.1 mL kg Gd DTPA with TR TE 5.1 1.1 ms flip angle 20 degrees temporal resolution 7.6 s and voxel size 2 2 2 mm3 to cover the whole head and neck including primary tumor and involved node.

Gross Tumor Volumes GTVs were delineated on the post contrast T1 weighted images acquired pre RT and during RT by a head and neck radiation oncologist. If available treatment planning CT and diagnostic PET scans were referenced. The primary and nodal GTVs were drawn separately due to the possibility that the two could respond to therapy differently. Heterogeneous BV and BF of the primary GTV for prediction of local control LC or local failure LF were investigated.

DCE images were fitted to the modified two compartment Tofts model. The model assumes the contrast agent concentration Ct t in the tissue at time t following the equation below 

BF images were derived by using the method described by Mullani et al. and Hermans et al. described by the following equation 

all image analyses were completed using an in house software package Functional Image Analysis Tool FIAT . For analysis of the single parameter of BV first training data were generated from the pre treatment BV values of the primary GTVs of all patients. Each of the pre RT primary GTVs was re sampled to create 10 000 voxels according to the distribution of BV values within the original GTV. This experience suggested that 10 000 voxels per tumor were sufficient to maintain the distribution of BV in the tumor. As a result the training data consisted of 100 100 14 voxels 14 is the number of patients and then was partitioned into 2 3 or 4 feature clusters using the above described clustering method. The resulting prototype vectors v were adopted to partition each individual GTV before and during therapy to obtain the fuzzy membership of each voxel belonging to the feature classes. The subvolumes of the primary GTVs defined by the clusters with low BV before and during RT were tested for their association with local failure using the Mann Whitney U test. A two tailed p value

To evaluate the discriminatory value of BF combined with BV x in Eq. 8 was formed to have two components BV and BF which were weighted equally for their contributions. The two component dataset x was analyzed similar to the single parameter. illustrates the process of classification of the whole GTV into subvolumes based upon their characteristic physiological features and the analysis in the two component feature space defined by the two parameter maps BV and BF. The white contour depicts the GTV and the two dimensional feature space is depicted with each voxel from the two parameter maps is projected based upon their values. As shown in the voxels are partitioned into three clusters e.g. triangles circles and squares using FCM clustering analysis which optimizes homogeneity of the parameters within the cluster and separation between the clusters.

Two representative examples of the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV pre RT and at week 2 are illustrated in . The BV maps are color coded and overlaid on post Gd T1 weighted images so that the white contours and blue color represent primary GTV and the subvolumes of the GTV with low BV respectively. depicts a local failure case that includes a whole GTV of 61.4 mL and a subvolume of the tumor with low BV of 28.6 mL at pre RT left portion of and 44.8 mL and 20.9 mL at week 2 right portion of respectively. depicts a local control case with a whole GTV of 97.5 mL and a subvolume of the tumor with low BV of 16.5 mL at pre RT left portion of and 52.3 mL and 17.4 mL at week 2 right portion of respectively.

to evaluate performance of the subvolumes of the tumors identified from BV BF or combination of BV and BF for prediction of local failure receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis was performed using software package ROCKIT. The fitted ROC curves and the areas under the curves Az of several representative metrics were generated and compared.

the subvolumes of the primary GTVs derived from clustering analysis of the heterogeneous distribution of BV were assessed and were related to local control LC and local failure LF . When the primary GTVs pre treatment were partitioned into two classes based upon the BV distribution the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV in the patients with LC ranging from 2.4 to 26.6 mL with a median of 9.9 mL were significantly smaller than those in the patients with LF p

The fractional reduction or reduction rate of the subvolumes in the primary GTVs with low BV during treatment vs. pre treatment was significantly greater in the patients with LC than those with LF 56 9 and 23 12 respectively p

it was assessed whether the subvolumes of the primary GTVs identified by the heterogeneous distribution of BF differentiated tumors with LF from LC either analysis of BF independently or combining BF with BV to test the discriminatory value of BF in comparison with BV. Analysis of BF alone yielded a similar trend as BV prior to chemo 285 RT the patients with LF had large subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BF range 17.1 to 67.9 mL median 35.5 mL while those with LC had small subvolumes with low BF range 5.2 to 32.1 mL median 13.0 mL . The difference between the two groups was not significant pre treatment p 0.07 . After 2 weeks of treatment the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BF decreased to 9.6 to 39.6 mL with a median of 20.8 mL in the patients with LF and to 0.9 to 21.2 mL with a median of 6.3 mL in the patients with LC the difference of which was marginally significant p 0.05 Table 4 . While analyzing BF with BV together there was no improvement in the differentiation of the LF from the LC tumors compared to analysis of BV alone Table 4 .

the predictive value of the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV pre and during treatment for local failure was explored using ROC analysis and its performance was compared with other conventional metrics such as the pre treatment tumor volume the percentage change in tumor volume during treatment and the change in a mean BV value over the whole tumor during treatment. The areas under the ROC curves Az a measure of overall performance of a metric for prediction of an event e.g. local failure indicate that all BV related function based metrics have better performance than the tumor volume metrics anatomy based . depicts a comparison of fitted ROC curves of five metrics for prediction of local failure. Specifically the areas under the ROC curves were 0.872 0.098 for the pre treatment tumor volume and 0.723 0.158 for the 305 percentage tumor volume change during treatment. However the change in the mean of tumor BV values during treatment a valuable functional parameter for prediction of local failure reported previously had an area under the ROC curve 0.903 0.084. When considering the subvolume of the primary GTV with low BV the areas under the ROC curves increased to 0.925 0.107 for pre treatment and 0.947 0.079 for during treatment. The ROC analysis indicates that 85 sensitivity in predicting local failure resulted in 87.5 and 91.0 specificity by the subvolumes of the GTVs with low BV before and during RT respectively compared with 83.0 specificity by the change in the mean BV values over the entire GTV during treatment and 75.5 specificity by the pre treatment GTV.

the subvolumes of the nodal GTVs with low BV were explored. There were two cases with regional failure. Prior to treatment the subvolumes of the nodal GTVs with low BV were 35.5 and 120.1 mL in the two patients with regional failure which were greater than those with regional control ranging from 4.0 to 29.5 mL with a median of 15.6 mL. After 2 weeks of chemo RT the subvolumes of the nodal GTVs with low BV changed to 11.6 and 132.5 mL in the patients with regional failure and to a median of 9.9 mL with a range from 3.3 to 24.5 mL in those with regional control. It is worthwhile to point out that the patient who had local regional failure had the largest subvolume of the nodal GTV with low BV 120 mL and the smallest subvolume of the primary GTV with low BV among the LF cases 15 mL as shown in and also the primary and nodal GTVs were anatomically adjacent or connected which might explain why this case deviated from other local failure cases as shown .

In this example a method was developed and investigated to identify subvolumes of the tumors by characterizing the heterogeneous tumor blood volume and blood flow before and during treatment using DCE MRI in patients who had advanced HNC and were treated with concurrent chemo RT. The subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV or BF were related to the outcomes. Also the predictive value of the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV was explored for local failure and compared these with other quantitative metrics derived from anatomic or functional imaging. It was discovered that the large subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low blood volume pre treatment and persisting during the early course of chemo RT are associated with high probability of local failure. For a given sensitivity for prediction of local failure the tumor subvolume with low blood volume has higher specificity compared to the change in the mean of blood volume values over the whole tumor during RT the percentage change of tumor volumes during RT or the pre RT GTV volume. The tumor subvolume with low blood volume might be a better biomarker for identifying the patients with advanced HNC at high risk for local failure and for defining a radiation boost target to intensify local treatment.

Many large tumors manifest intra tumor heterogeneity e.g. multiple phenotypes within a single tumor which is possibly responsible for heterogeneous treatment response within the tumor. It is plausible that a portion of the tumor is more aggressive or more resistant to treatment and thereby might ultimately determine the treatment outcome. However the mean value or the change in the mean value of a functional imaging parameter over a heterogeneous tumor has generally been used to correlate with treatment outcome in most previous imaging studies which could compromise the predictive power of the parameter. In this example in aiming to assess the tumor heterogeneous perfusion and blood volume and it was found the poorly perfused subvolumes prior to and during chemo RT have greater specificity for prediction of local failure for a given sensitivity than considering the tumor as a whole .

It is a challenge to characterize tumor heterogeneity and heterogeneous changes over a longitudinal study. One approach to address the problem is to analyze statistical differences at each voxel over time. This requires a reliable and accurate voxel to voxel alignment of images acquired at different time points. The volume shape and image intensity of the tumors may change over weeks and months. For head and neck cancers the patient position changes due to the neck flexibility over scans can result in additional difficulty for voxel level image alignment even with highly sophisticated deformable image registration tools. In addition voxel level analyses show large uncertainty and poor reproducibility which impact on the correlation with response and outcome. Therefore in this study a robust technique clustering analysis was developed to characterize heterogeneous vascular and perfusion parameters of head and neck tumors as well as their changes over time. This technique can map functional images from different time points into a feature space and then analyzes the intrinsic properties of the parameter of interest by statistically grouping and splitting the voxels into feature classes e.g. the voxels with low or high blood volume based upon their similarities and differences. This technique can be applied to imaging data from longitudinal studies without the requirement of voxel size accuracy of image registration. The technique can be generalized to other tumors and other imaging parameters. Also fuzzy clustering used in the method allows the system to manage the continuous distribution of the physiological imaging parameters in the tumor as well as noise in images. Through this work it was demonstrated that the potential value of the feature class the subvolume of the tumor with low blood volume delineated by this method for prediction of outcome and definition of potential radiation boost target volumes.

Several methods have been proposed to automatically segment tumor volumes binary segmentation as well as for identification of inhomogeneous tumor subvolumes multiple classes from metabolic PET images e.g. watershed and fuzzy local adapted Bayesian FLAB segmentation methods. These methods have focused on how to deal with the influence of object tumor size on radioactivity detected by PET due to limited spatial resolution by iterative segmentation using phantom scans for guidance. Recently FLAB segmentation has been extended to identify multiple classes in the inhomogeneous FDG distribution in the tumors. However this method needs to pre define the fuzzy level and becomes complicated when dealing with 3 or more classes and various object sizes especially for small objects 

The subvolume analysis method of may also use PC features derived from PCA as another input. The PCA may include a pharmacokinetic model free framework that analyzes the DCE MRI data. This PCA technique may also utilize DCE MRI data from image voxels of a sample of brain tumors to construct a DCE matrix. PCA is then applied to generate the PCs and subsequent projection coefficient maps. Next a modeling technique such as a pattern recognition based upon fuzzy c means clustering may be used to delineate the tumor subvolumes relating to the value of the projection coefficients. The relationship between changes in different tumor subvolumes and treatment response may be evaluated to differentiate responsive from stable and progressive tumors.

This PCA technique may use a general framework to derive a response predictor from DCE MRI data without using the PK modeling techniques and a general framework to include a semi automated or fully automated tool for response assessment and therapy guidance in radiation therapy of brain metastases. In this PCA technique the system may transfer the DCE curves into an N dimensional feature space using principle component analysis may identify the most response related features using a FCM based technique and may combine the features to define the tumor subvolumes.

In some examples this PCA technique contains two phases a development phase and a usage phase. In the development phase a sample of the DCE data from brain metastases is processed and analyzed to develop the model and the predictive metric. In the usage phase the PCA technique determines if the predictive metric could be extracted rapidly from the DCE data of a new patient scan.

the dynamic curve at each voxel represents the temporal changes in signal intensity after the contrast injection. The signal intensity change AS from pre baseline to post contrast is calculated as following 

An arterial input function can be determined from a region of interest ROI in a large artery e.g. carotid artery etc. manually semi automatically or automatically. In the current work a region of interest containing brain and neck is initially contoured. DCE curves within the contour are averaged to determine the peak enhancement Tmax in the tissue. Assuming that the arterial input function reaches the enhancement peak prior to tissue the first 20 voxels with the maximum enhancement in AS Tma At one time frame before Tniox within the contour are thresholded and then the corresponding DCE curves are averaged to be considered as an arterial input function.

the DCE curves in each scan may not be acquired with the exactly same temporal resolutions and time durations. Thus the DCE curves may be standardized in such a way that all curves have the same temporal resolution and length. The spline curve fitting method may be used to reconstruct each DCE curve and resample the curves to have a temporal resolution of 4 sec and a total length of 120 sec respectively.

the DCE curves from voxels within the tumor volumes of all patients may need to be temporally aligned for further processing. The arterial input function AIF obtained from each patient scan may be used to align the DCE curves of voxels in the tumor volumes. The Gamma variate function was fit to each AIF as follows 

the primary goal is to extract response predictive features rapidly and directly from the DCE curves. Thus the DCE curves were expanded using a set of basis functions by which the coefficients of the projection vectors for each DCE curve is a unique representation in a new space. In the development stage using DCE data from a sample of brain metastases e.g. pre therapy DCE data the matrix C N T was constructed in which each row represents a DCE curve from one voxel in the tumors. N is the total number of voxels in all tumors and T is the number of time points in each curve. Principal component analysis PCA was applied to C to obtain a complete set of a total of T orthonormal principal components PC . The Karhumen Loeve transformation of each DCE curve was performed S in each voxel of the tumor to PC 15 where ais the projection coefficient cPC corresponding to the ith principal component. Each DCE curve in a tumor volume is represented uniquely by in a T dimensional coefficient space. However Eq. 15 can be truncated at the first M principal components which contain 99 of energy of the original DCE curves.

Projection Coefficient Defined Tumor Subvolumes Probability Density Function of a Projection Coefficient in a Tumor 

each PC depicts a feature of the tumor DCE curve. Each voxel in a tumor has a unique projection coefficient on each PC. For each PC the projection coefficients of the voxels in a tumor which can be presented as a volumetric map of a lesion have a distinct role in predicting the treatment response and outcome. The distribution of the projection coefficients in a large tumor is heterogeneous similar to the physiological parameters. Similar to what has been done previously for the physiological parameters the distribution patterns of a projection coefficient a in the lesions were analyzed and subsequent changes during treatment. A PDF or histogram of aof a lesion is generated using a non parametric PDF estimator. The PDF consists of 150 evenly spaced points to cover the range of afor all the lesions of interest. A value of the PDF at a point x H a x of a lesion is calculated as 16 where nis the number of voxels within x 

Previous studies have suggested that the rCBV or K distribution in a brain tumor is abnormal compared to normal cerebral tissue as elevated rCBV in a subvolume of the tumor and low rCBV in another one. A renormalization of tumor vasculature such as decreasing the elevated rCBV and increasing the low one could be an indicator of a tumor response to treatment. The DCE derived physiological parameters e.g. rCBV and K and projection coefficients . . . are two representations of the DCE curves. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that in the brain metastases could also distribute abnormally in contrast to normal tissue and changes during treatment could predict tumor response to therapy. Hence similar to what has been done for rCBV previously the pooled distribution of H to three classes were classified as high intermediate and low classes using fuzzy c means FCM clustering analysis by minimizing the objective function J 1 17 where cis a prototype vector of the jth class P a is a probabilistic membership of a avalue belonging to the jth class and m is a fuzzy exponent and chosen as 2. The probabilistic membership function P a describes that a voxel having a projection coefficient ahas a probability P belonging to a class j which is a new representation of avalue of a tumor voxel mathematically transfers the data from the aspace into a new space .

Projection Coefficient Defined Tumor Subvolume the primary interest is to test if a change in a subvolume of the tumor defined by high intermediate or low values is related to tumor treatment response. The subvolume SV of a tumor was defined with low intermediate or high using the probabilistic membership function Pj and calculate a percentage change in the SV from pre therapy to after starting treatment eg 2 weeks as follows 

Tumor Subvolume Defined by Combined Projection Coefficients The overall aim of developing a prediction model for a clinical decision support system is to find a combination of factors that accurately anticipate an individual patient s outcome. Hence a technique may include combining different cPCs to improve prediction for tumor response compared to using one cPC. To do so first a joint histogram of a a. . . a of a lesion is computed e. g. H a x1 a x2 . . . a xM . Then a joint probability function P a is defined as follows 

The weighting factor is selected based upon the best prediction of response from a developmental dataset and evaluated by an independent data set.

Usage Phase for a new patient scan first pre processing of the DCE curves was performed and compute the projection coefficient maps of the first M or selected principal components. The histograms or a joint histogram of the selected coefficients were computed within the tumor. Then using the probability membership function obtained in the development step the cPC defined tumor subvolumes were calculated by Eqs. 19 or 20 . Finally a change of the subvolume from pre therapy to during or post therapy is determined.

Evaluation Endpoint a percentage change in the gross tumor volume GTV from pre to post RT was used as an endpoint for response assessment. Several patients did not have 3 or 6 months post treatment imaging follow ups. For the patients in whom 3 and 6 months post RT images were available there were good correlations in the GTV changes between 1 and 3 months post RT and between 3 and 6 months post RT. Also previous studies indicate that brain metastases exhibit little pseudo response and pseudo progression one month after RT. Therefore a percentage change in the GTV from Pre RT to 1 month post RT was used circumflex over GTV as a measure of tumor response to therapy. From Pre RT to 1 M Post RT 16 tumors had a decrease in the GTV at least 25 defined as responsive 11 tumors had an increase at least 25 defined as progressive and the remaining 18 were defined as stable. It was noticed that there were heterogeneous responses of multiple lesions from a single patient. Thus each lesion was considered independently.

Parameter Selection and Evaluation First the priority of the candidate parameters and subvolumes were ranked by testing if the changes in circumflex over SV significantly differentiated responsive tumors from combined stable and progressive ones using Mann Whitney U Test. Considering M principal components and two independent subvolumes only two of the three are independent for each component a p value

Results Principal Components PCA revealed that the first three principal components PCs comprised more than 99.99 of the energy of the DCE curves of brain metastases of which the first component contributed approximately 99.8 while the second and third components had 0.08 and 0.02 contributions respectively as shown in . Further investigation revealed that the first component is related to the area under each DCE curve while the second and third ones were associated with the enhancement rate of a DCE curve and its derivative respectively. Therefore the analysis described in the method section was applied to the histograms of the first three cPCs in a tumor to determine the subvolume of the tumor with a given class.

Association of the cPC Defined Tumor Subvolumes with Response associations of the changes in the first three cPC defined brain metastases subvolumes with high intermediate or low coefficients from pre RT to 2 W with the tumor response to treatment are given in Table 5. Since the first three components were only compared a p value

Predictive Values of the cPC Defined Tumor Subvolumes it was explored that the predictive value of the decrease in the subvolumes of the brain metastases defined by the cPCs from Pre RT to 2 W for predicting responsive tumors post RT and compared their performance with the decrease in subvolumes of the tumors defined by the high rCBV and high Ktrans and two conventional metrics. The ROC analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.83 0.06 SEM 0.77 0.07 0.80 0.07 0.70 0.08 0.67 0.08 and 0.56 0.09 for circumflex over SV circumflex over SV circumflex over SV rCBV circumflex over rCBV circumflex over GTVand circumflex over SV K respectively as shown in indicating the high a1 defined subvolume of the tumor had the best performance among the tested variables for predicting responsive tumor. The subvolumes defined by the high a1 and low a3 classes with the weighting factor 0.3 determined by empirical evaluation of the AUCs as shown in resulted in the largest AUC 0.88 00.5. The subvolumes defined by the high rCBV and high Ktrans classes with the weighting factor 0.6 resulted in the AUC of 0.86 0.06.

While the techniques discussed above i.e. the PK modeling techniques and the PCA techniques measure the vascular properties of the tumor other techniques that measure cellularity may be used in conjunction with the subvolume analysis of . Cellularity may be determined by obtaining imaging derived cellularity feature data that measures the water mobility in the tissue of the tumor via a diffusion weighted magnetic resonance DW MRI . Similar to vascularity subvolume analysis inputs i.e. the PK modeling technique and PCA technique as discussed above the cellularity features of subvolumes of tumors may be utilized to predict treatment outcome as well as shown in .

The DAI technique herein is similar to the subvolume analysis technique as discussed above in that it uses the imaging derived data to predict tumor response to therapy. However this DAI technique develops a DAI to quantify the extent of abnormality of the tumor ADC histogram compared to normal tissue. A normal tissue ADC histogram HNT ADC may be obtained in a normal brain volume of 3 4 cc with the peak normalized to 1. The tumor ADC histogram that usually spreads beyond HNT ADC is divided by HNT ADC into 3 categories low high cellularity normal and high edema and necrosis ADC. An abnormal diffusion probability function DAProF of the tumor may be then defined by 1 HNT ADC and band pass filtered to reduce noise influence at the two tails of the histogram. Given that changes in low and high ADCs could have different roles in response assessment a factor 0

In an example the DAI changes were evaluated to differentiate responsive stable and progressive lesions in 24 patients who had brain metastases and were treated by either whole brain radiation therapy WBRT 28 mostly radiosensitive lesions alone or combined with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer 39 radioresistant lesions . The performance of DAI for predicting the post treatment radiographic response was also evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis and compared with changes in gross tumor volume GTV observed during the same time interval. In lesions treated by WBRT alone the responsive tumors showed a greater decrease in DAI at week 2 after starting the radiation than stable and progressive lesions p

To determine cellularity the DW MRI is used and has been shown to be an imaging biomarker for assessing tumor aggressiveness and early response to therapy in various cancers. The DW MRI acquisition is rapid and noninvasive and uses neither exogenous contrast agent nor ionizing radiation. The apparent diffusion coefficient quantified from DW MRI measures water mobility in tissue and is sensitive to cellular density extracellular space tortuosity and intactness of cellular membranes. However quantification of an ADC change in the tumor is still a challenge and affects sensitivity and specificity of diffusion indices for early prediction of tumor response to therapy mainly because the ADCs in a tumor manifest a heterogeneous distribution pattern due to spatial variation in cellular density cell structure and water content. In a high cellular region mobility of water molecules is restricted and thus the ADC is low while in a region with necrosis or edema water molecules move more freely and hence the ADC is high. Animal studies have shown that the ADC in a tumor is inversely correlated with the tumor cellularity. When a tumor responds to treatment the ADC in the high cellular region could increase due to cell shrinkage followed by phagocytosis or necrosis. Also the ADC in the edema region could decrease due to drainage of water. Thus the direction of the change depends on the measurement location of the ADC and the original value of the ADC. Therefore the heterogeneity in the tumor ADCs and the complex changes that occur after treatment suggest that a change in the mean ADC of a tumor may be a poor indicator for therapy response.

Thus far several methodologies have been proposed to quantify the ADC changes in tumors beyond a change in the mean ADC of a tumor for response assessment. The functional diffusion map fDM probably the most common approach measures the voxel to voxel interval changes in a pair of the co registered ADC images acquired pre and post the start of therapy. The voxels with an ADC change above a threshold are considered as a measure of response. Despite the promising results of the fDM based approach and its modifications again the issue of voxel to voxel misregistration particularly in the region where a tumor volume shrinks or grows during the interval of measurements is problematic. Also since the decrease increase in regions of high cellularity or edema could have different interpretations it is important to consider the initial ADC values to interpret subsequent changes correctly. Alternatively analysis of the tumor ADC histogram has been proposed. A bi normal distribution mixture model has shown that the mean value of the low ADC distribution can predict therapy response in gliomas. Also changes in mean skewness and kurtosis of the ADC histogram or the minimum value of the ADC in tumors have been related to survival and the treatment outcome. However these methods have not considered changes in the whole ADC histogram including both regions with high cellularity and edema in each of which a change could reflect a part of the process of a tumor response to therapy and therefore may lead to losing information from the analyses. Thus it is highly desirable to develop a new methodology for quantifying the tumor ADCs to improve the performance of DW MRI for therapy assessment.

The techniques herein use the DAI to quantify the extent of diffusion abnormality of brain metastases for early prediction of tumor response to therapy. For instance brain metastases which are the most prevalent form of intracranial cancer exceed the number of primary brain tumors by at least ten times and occur in approximately 25 of all cancer patients. In a DAI based approach an abnormal diffusion probability was assigned to each voxel of the tumor based upon its ADC value relating to the normal tissue ADC distribution. Then a DAI of the tumor was obtained by summing all the abnormal probabilities within the lesion. It was tested whether an early change in the DAI could predict response of brain metastases in the patients who were treated by either whole brain radiation therapy alone or in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer.

Histogram of ADCs in a Tumor to analyze the ADC distribution in a tumor and a subsequent change during treatment a histogram of ADCs in a lesion measured at each time point was generated with 150 evenly spaced bins that cover the ADCs of all lesions of interest. The ADC histogram H ADC x of a lesion is calculated as ADC ADC 21 where nis the number of voxels within ADC x 

next a diffusion abnormality probability function DAProF was developed to characterize the whole tumor ADC histogram based upon the normal tissue ADC distribution of each patient. The HNT ADC divides the tumor ADC histogram into three segments with low normal and high ADCs . The first and latter are related to high cellular density and edema respectively. Therefore for each patient a DAProF can be defined as 1 HNT ADC and filtered by Kaiser band pass filter BPF centered at the peak of HNT ADC to reduce noise influence in the computation at two tails where the ADC approaches to positive or negative infinite or zero as DAProF BPF 1 ADC 22 

Eq. 22 denotes the tumor ADCs are abnormal except in the areas where the ADC values are in the range of normal tissue ones. In Eq. 22 90 of confidence interval of HNT ADC is used to define the band width of BPF. Because that changes in the low ADC high cellularity tumor region could be associated with therapy response differently a weighting factor 

to quantify the extent of diffusion abnormality in a tumor at a specific scan time DAI is defined as DAI GTV DAProF 24 where GTV and H x denote the gross tumor volume and the normalized tumor ADC histogram at time respectively. As a result the DAI is a summation of diffusion abnormality from all voxels of a tumor. It is worthwhile to note that the DAI is minimum for normal tissue. A low or high ADC abnormality index can also be obtained by replacing DAProF by DAProFor DAProFin Eq. 24 . Finally a change in the DAI from pre RT to 2 W is calculated as 

In response to therapy the ADCs in the region with high cellularity may increase due to cell shrinkage or necrosis and in the region of edema may decrease due drainage of water into tumor cells. However Eq. 25 combines the two contributions into a single metric for assessing tumor response to a specific therapy regimen.

twenty four patients who had brain metastases and were treated by WBRT were enrolled in an institutional review board IRB approved prospective MRI study 12 women and 12 men ages 40 76 years Table 6 . The histology included melanoma 14 non small cell lung cancer 6 renal cell carcinoma 1 breast cancer 2 and head neck squamous cell carcinoma 1 . All patients received WBRT with a total dose of 30 Gy 16 patients or 37.5 Gy 8 patients . Thirteen patients with radioresistant metastases also received Bortezomib during WBRT as a radiation sensitizer. Each lesion was analyzed individually due to intra patient heterogeneous lesion response to therapy. If a patient had three metastases or fewer all lesions were included. If a patient had more than three lesions only the three largest lesions were analyzed. If a patient had more than three lesions larger than 0.5 cm3 all lesions larger than 0.5 cm3 were included. As a result a total of 67 metastatic lesions were included in the dataset of which 28 were treated with radiation therapy alone and the remaining lesions were treated with radiation therapy in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer.

all patients had MRI scans on a Philips 3T scanner prior to radiation therapy Pre RT 2 weeks after the start of RT 2 W and 1 month after the completion of treatment 1 M Post RT . MRI scans included pre and post Gd DTPA volumetric T1 weighted images 2D T2 weighted images and diffusion sensitive images. The diffusion weighted images were acquired using a spin echo echo planar imaging sequence TR TE 2636 46 msec with b0 0 and diffusion weighting along three orthogonal directions and b1 1 000 sec mm2 to calculate the ADC images.

Using an in house software package all ADC images were co registered to pre RT post Gd T1 weighted images by rigid transformation and mutual information to have a voxel size of 0.94 0.94 3 mm3 . After each lesion of interest was contoured on the post Gd T1 weighed images obtained pre RT 2 W and 1 M post RT by a physician the tumor volumes were transferred onto the ADC maps obtained at the same time point. For each patient a volume of 3 4 cc of normal white matter or cerebellum tissue depending upon the location of the tumor of interest was contoured on the pre RT post Gd T1 weighed images and transferred onto the pre RT ADC map to obtain a distribution of normal ADCs.

given that previous studies indicate that brain metastases exhibit little pseudo response and pseudo progression one month after RT a percentage change in the gross tumor volume GTV from Pre RT to 1 month post RT circumflex over GTV was used as a measure of tumor response to therapy. Data was used to verify that there was little pseudo response or pseudo progression in brain metastases treated by either WBRT alone or WBRT with Bortezomib. From Pre RT to 1 M Post RT of the 27 lesions treated with radiation therapy alone 14 had a decrease in the GTV of at least 25 defined as responsive 7 had an increase of at least 25 defined as progressive and the remaining 6 were defined as stable. For the 39 lesions treated by radiation therapy in combination with Bortezomib 10 lesions were responsive 13 lesions were progressive and 17 lesions were stable.

the best separation of the group difference between the responsive and progressive tumors resulted in values of 0.7 and 0.2 for lesions treated with radiation therapy alone and in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer respectively suggesting that decreases in abnormality associated with high ADCs edema necrosis may have different roles in response assessment depending on the treatment regimen and tumor type.

For lesions treated with radiation therapy alone as anticipated the DAI showed a significantly greater decrease from Pre RT to 2 W in the responsive tumors than the progressive ones p

For the radiation resistant lesions treated with radiation therapy combined with Bortezomib the DAI change from Pre RT to 2 W was able to differentiate between the responsive and progressive lesions p

Table 7 illustrates the group differences between responsive stable and progressive tumors treated with radiation therapy. For each metric the absolute or percentage change from pre RT to week 2 were evaluated and the best performance is reported. The black rows show significant metrics.

Table 8 illustrates the group differences between responsive stable and progressive tumors treated with radiation therapy. For each metric the absolute or percentage change from pre RT to week 2 were evaluated and the best performance is reported. The black rows show significant metrics.

the performance of the significant or marginally significant metrics in Tables 7 and 8 was evaluated such as DAI GTV Skewness and Kurtosis for prediction of non responsive tumors post RT for both treatments. When lesions treated with radiation therapy alone the ROC analysis showed that the AUC was 0.96 0.04 SEM 0.91 0.06 0.64 0.1 and 0.71 0.1 for DAI GTV Skewness and Kurtosis respectively as shown in . A pair wise comparison of the ROC curves of the two metrics revealed that DAI0.7 is a better predictor but not significantly than GTV p

examples of maps of the ADC and the diffusion abnormality probability function DAProF for a responsive lesion treated with radiation therapy alone and a progressive one treated with radiation therapy in combination with Bortezomib at Pre RT and 2 W are shown in . In particular depicts T1 weighted images at Pre RT and 2 W top rows ADC maps at Pre RT and 2 W middle rows and maps of diffusion abnormality probability functions at Pre RT and 2 W bottom rows for a responsive and a progressive lesion.

This development of a DAI based upon diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging for early assessment of brain metastasis response to radiation therapy uses the physiology of abnormal ADCs in a tumor including both high cellularity and edema. The DAI weights the abnormal ADC contributions from high cellularity and edema differently for predication of therapy response. The performance of DAI in patients who had brain metastases were evaluated and were treated by either WBRT alone mostly radiation sensitive lesions or in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer radiation resistant lesions . Compared to other ADC metric published previously and conventional metrics the DAI performed better in predicting volumetric response of brain metastases to radiation therapy. Also the results indicate that the diffusion related physiological change in the tumor occurs earlier than the morphological change in response to radiation therapy. The DAI may be applied to other tumor types and treatment regimens after recalibration e.g. glioblastoma and head and neck cancers and anti angiogenesis therapy. The DAI may be used as a robust imaging biomarker for early assessment of tumor response and outcome.

In the development of the DAI the weighting factor was found to be different for different treatments and or tumor types. For instance when brain metastases were treated with WBRT alone the changes in abnormality associating with high ADCs contributed substantially to response assessment. In this case both a decrease in cellularity and a decrease in edema could indicate treatment response. However in the treatment of melanoma metastases to the brain it was realized that a decrease in abnormality associated with high ADCs is less important for response assessment. Also the performance of all tested ADC metrics including the DAI was found to be worse for patients with melanoma metastases than for the metastases that were not from melanoma. This could be due to the nature of melanoma high vascularity edema and hemorrhage or the effect of Bortezomib on the lesion. Because Bortezomib could alter vascular properties of the tumor a change in vascular characteristics of the tumor may be an important part of tumor response to therapy and hence a perfusion change could be added into the DAI to improve the response assessment. The findings also suggest that the DAI could be used to assess a specific treatment effect on a specific tumor. For an anti angiogenesis treatment to brain tumor e.g. glioblastoma a high ADC abnormality reduction indicates the treatment effect on the abnormal leaky vasculature but a low ADC abnormality decrease suggest the effect on the tumor.

The DAI may have several advantages in comparison with functional diffusion map the most common approach in study of the ADC map. The DAI need not rely on voxel to voxel image registration accuracy which the fDM based analysis solely depends upon. Hence anatomical alteration of a tumor after starting therapy e.g. a change in edema or surgical cavity and or tumor growth or shrinkage does not have an adverse effect on the DAI. In addition the tumor volume is incorporated into the DAI and thus a change in DAI represents both physiological and morphological changes in a tumor which may increase the sensitivity of the DAI for tumor response to therapy. Furthermore the fDM based analysis only considers an absolute change in the ADC regardless of the origin of the ADC whereas an increase or a decrease in the low or high ADC region has a very different underlying implication. Further an ADC increase in the region with abnormal low diffusion and a decrease in the region with abnormal high diffusion both are positive indications for a tumor response to therapy. Also it is important to point out that although a change in the DAI of a tumor does not depend upon voxel level accuracy of registration of images acquired pre and after the start of therapy spatial information of diffusion abnormality of a tumor is available at any given measurement as shown in which could be used for visualization or provide guidance for intensified treatment.

The DAI may offer several advantages in comparison with other histogram based approaches. In some of these techniques only the low ADC portion of the tumor histogram is used for therapy assessment yet a reduction in the abnormal high ADC in the edema region may be also an important indicator for response prediction. Thus combining the changes in both abnormal low and high ADC regions has the potential to produce a better predictor for assessing response to various treatments. The indices based upon the skewness and kurtosis of the tumor ADC histogram neglect diffusion physiology in a tumor and may not be able to capture the complex change patterns in a heterogeneous tumor for response assessment.

The DAI may be used as a biomarker for assessment of brain metastasis response to WBRT. Currently WBRT and stereotactic radio surgery SRS are two routine treatments for brain metastases and prolonging patient survival. However a recent study has shown that WBRT produces a decrease in neurocognitive status compared to SRS. Therefore more and more patients are receiving focal treatment for brain metastases. As WBRT is being done less more patients are developing new lesions after treatment of the initial lesions and thus are being treated to new lesions over time. Also the DAI could be extended to other tumor types e.g. glioblastoma for early assessment of tumor response to therapy.

The techniques disclosed herein may combine the different properties of the subvolumes of a tumor such as the vascularity of subvolumes of the tumor the cellularity of subvolumes of the tumor etc. to calculate a more precise prediction in treatment outcome. For example the method may utilize vascular properties such as blood flow blood volume etc. in predicting one treatment outcome and also may examine the cellularity properties i.e. the water mobility in tissue to determine an abnormal diffusion coefficient in predicting treatment outcome. The prediction results from the both properties may be combined together to provide a more refined accurate overall prediction for treatment outcome.
