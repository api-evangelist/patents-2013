The subject disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for communicating between communication devices.

Web Real Time Communications WebRTC is an application programming interface API definition being developed by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C and a companion RTCWEB Internet Engineering Task Force IETF group to enable runtime platform independent browser to browser applications supporting voice calling video chat and peer to peer P2P file sharing without the need for plugins.

The subject disclosure describes among other things illustrative embodiments of a service translation system to reduce the complexity of deploying a WebRTC gateway that interacts with legacy network resources of a communication system. Other embodiments are included in the subject disclosure.

One embodiment of the subject disclosure includes a method for receiving by a web real time communications gateway comprising a processor a first request from a mobile communication device identifying communication services requested from a network resource that does not utilize a web real time communications protocol used by the web real time communications gateway where the first request is compliant with the web real time communications protocol generating by the web real time communications gateway a second request comprising a markup language that differs from the web real time communications protocol where the markup language is used by a service translation gateway that interfaces the web real time communications gateway to a plurality of network resources that do not conform to the web real time communications protocol and where the plurality of network resources includes the network resource identified in the first request transmitting by the web real time communications gateway the second request to the service translation gateway to cause the service translation gateway to facilitate the communication services of the network resource identified in the first request receiving by the web real time communications gateway a first message from the mobile communication device where the first message is compliant with the web real time communications protocol used by the web real time communications gateway translating by the web real time communications gateway the first message to a first updated message conforming to the markup language used by the service translation gateway and transmitting by the web real time communications gateway the updated first message to the service translation gateway for delivery to the network resource facilitating the communication services identified in the first request.

One embodiment of the subject disclosure includes a machine readable storage medium having executable instructions. Execution of the instructions by a processor can cause the processor to perform operations including receiving a first request from a communication device requesting communication services from a network resource that does not utilize a web real time communications protocol where the first request is compliant with the web real time communications protocol generating a second request comprising a markup language that differs from the web real time communications protocol where the markup language is used by a service translation gateway that interfaces to a plurality of network resources that do not utilize the web real time communications protocol and where the plurality of network resources includes the network resource identified in the first request transmitting the second request to the service translation gateway to facilitate the communication services of the network resource identified in the first request receiving a first message from the communication device where the first message is compliant with the web real time communications protocol translating the first message to a first updated message conforming to the markup language used by the service translation gateway and transmitting the updated first message to the service translation gateway for delivery to the network resource facilitating the communication services identified in the first request.

One embodiment of the subject disclosure includes a service translation gateway having a memory to store executable instructions and a processor coupled to the memory. Execution of the instructions by the processor can cause the processor to perform operations including receiving from a web real time communications gateway a first request for communication services from a network resource where the communication services are requested by a communication device communicatively coupled to the web real time communications gateway where the network resource does not utilize a web real time communications protocol used by the web real time communications gateway and where the first request is compliant with a markup language that differs from the web real time communications protocol directing the network resource to provide the communication services identified in the first request receiving a first message from the web real time communications gateway where the first message is compliant with the markup language translating the first message to a first updated message conforming to a protocol used by the network resource where protocol differs from the markup language used for communicating with the web real time communications gateway and transmitting the updated first message to the network resource facilitating the communication services identified in the first request.

There are many legacy network resources of a communication system such as a cellular telephony system that are not WebRTC compliant. For example there are many short message service SMS servers and multimedia messaging service MMS servers deployed throughout cellular systems around the world that provide communication services to a large community of UEs which may not be WebRTC compliant. It is conceivable that legacy network resources such as SMS and MMS servers can be upgraded to support a WebRTC protocol. However it would be too costly to upgrade such systems especially if some of these systems were to be replaced or phased out over time. Similarly it is conceivable that a WebRTC gateway can be configured with all known proprietary interfaces of legacy network resources . However developing a universal interface that supports all proprietary interfaces would likely be commercially unviable and would likely delay the deployment of WebRTC services.

To overcome these challenges a service translation gateway can be used that provides a common interface to the WebRTC gateway utilizing a markup language that provides access to all legacy network resources . More than one service translation gateway can be used to support different clusters of legacy network resources . Accordingly it is not necessary for a single model of a service provider of service translation gateways to supports all proprietary interfaces. The only requirement for all models of the service translation gateways is to provide a common communications interface to the WebRTC gateway by way of a predefined markup language that enables the WebRTC to request services from any legacy non WebRTC compliant network resource without requiring the WebRTC gateway to directly communicate with the legacy network resources . The service translation gateway can thus eliminate the need for the WebRTC gateway to communicate over the proprietary interfaces or protocols of the network resources thereby simplifying the deployment of WebRTC gateways . As the demand for WebRTC compliant devices grows various models of service translation gateways can be deployed to support different legacy network resources .

The purpose of a Low Level Application Programming Interface LLAPI is to provide a plurality of WebRTC gateways and service translation gateways processing environment dependent structured programming interfaces which in concert with the HLLAPI and Meta API and the markup language used between the WebRTC gateways and service translation gateways accelerate and improve the computing platform performance and throughput of WebRTC gateways and service translation gateways across a plurality of heterogeneous distributed processing platforms and runtime environments.

The markup language can provide the WebRTC gateway and the service translation gateway a dataset and file markup language for structuring and presenting WebRTC content for use within a plurality of proprietary standalone network application environments and a plurality of heterogeneous distributed network application environments World Wide Web and Internet processing environments Intranet processing environments and Extranet processing environments.

At step the service translation gateway can inform the WebRTC gateway using the markup language described earlier that the network resource is ready. At step the WebRTC gateway can inform UE1 using the WebRTC protocol that that the network resource is ready. UE1 at step can initiate a message directed to UE2. The WebRTC gateway receives the message from UE1 at step using the WebRTC protocol and translates the message at step using the markup language and delivers it to the service translation gateway . The service translation gateway in turn extracts the UE1 message from the markup language and delivers the UE1 message to the network resource in the non WebRTC protocol of the network resource in step . At step the network resource delivers the UE1 message to UE2 utilizing the messaging protocol used by that system e.g. SMS or MMS protocols or other protocols of other messaging services .

The foregoing process can be applied also in the reverse. For example at step the user of UE2 can send a response message to the network resource in the messaging protocol used by the network resource . At step the network resource can provide the UE2 message to the service translation gateway over its proprietary interface. At step the service translation gateway can insert the UE2 message into the markup language and deliver it to the WebRTC gateway . The WebRTC gateway can in turn extract the UE2 message from the markup language and deliver the UE2 message at step to UE1 using the WebRTC protocol.

The foregoing embodiments substantially reduce the complexity and cost of deploying WebRTC gateways and related WebRTC applications by providing WebRTC gateways a common or unified communications interface to request services from legacy network resources by way of the service translation gateway which shields the WebRTC gateways from the many legacy network resource protocols and proprietary interfaces presently in use thereby enabling rapid deployment of WebRTC gateways and WebRTC compliant devices and applications.

The MGCF need not be used when a communication session involves IMS CD to IMS CD communications. A communication session involving at least one PSTN CD may utilize the MGCF .

IMS CDs can register with the IMS network by contacting a Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF which communicates with an interrogating CSCF I CSCF which in turn communicates with a Serving CSCF S CSCF to register the CDs with the HSS . To initiate a communication session between CDs an originating IMS CD can submit a Session Initiation Protocol SIP INVITE message to an originating P CSCF which communicates with a corresponding originating S CSCF . The originating S CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to one or more application servers ASs that can provide a variety of services to IMS subscribers.

For example the application servers can be used to perform originating call feature treatment functions on the calling party number received by the originating S CSCF in the SIP INVITE message. Originating treatment functions can include determining whether the calling party number has international calling services call ID blocking calling name blocking 7 digit dialing and or is requesting special telephony features e.g. 72 forward calls 73 cancel call forwarding 67 for caller ID blocking and so on . Based on initial filter criteria iFCs in a subscriber profile associated with a CD one or more application servers may be invoked to provide various call originating feature services.

Additionally the originating S CSCF can submit queries to the ENUM system to translate an E.164 telephone number in the SIP INVITE message to a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier URI if the terminating communication device is IMS compliant. The SIP URI can be used by an Interrogating CSCF I CSCF to submit a query to the HSS to identify a terminating S CSCF associated with a terminating IMS CD such as reference . Once identified the I CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to the terminating S CSCF . The terminating S CSCF can then identify a terminating P CSCF associated with the terminating CD . The P CSCF may then signal the CD to establish Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP communication services thereby enabling the calling and called parties to engage in voice and or data communications. Based on the iFCs in the subscriber profile one or more application servers may be invoked to provide various call terminating feature services such as call forwarding do not disturb music tones simultaneous ringing sequential ringing etc.
