Conventional communication systems allow the user of a device such as a personal computer or mobile device to conduct voice or video calls over a packet based computer network such as the Internet. Such communication systems include voice or video over internet protocol VoIP systems. These systems are beneficial to the user as they are often of significantly lower cost than conventional fixed line or mobile cellular networks. This may particularly be the case for long distance communication. To use a VoIP system the user installs and executes client software on their device. The client software sets up the VoIP connections as well as providing other functions such as registration and user authentication. In addition to voice communication the client may also set up connections for other communication media such as instant messaging IM SMS messaging file transfer and voicemail.

Recently internet capabilities and functionality has been integrated into user devices such as games consoles arranged to be connected to a television set of other e.g. large screen display means television sets themselves often referred to as a Smart TV set top boxes arranged to be connected to a television set etc. . . . This includes the integration of client software into a games console television set set top box or similar to enable communications over a packet based computer network such as the Internet. This integration of client software allows a large high resolution screen to be utilised for video calling by outputting video signals to a near end user received from a far end user. Furthermore significant processing power can be provided in user devices such as set top boxes TVs etc. particularly as the power requirements for a large mains electricity powered consumer electronics device are less stringent than for example mobile devices. This can enable a full range of features to be included in the embedded communication client such as high quality voice and video encoding of video data received from a camera connected to the user device or from other similar image input means.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

There is disclosed a user device comprising a network interface a video controller and a resource manager. The network interface is configured to transmit video of one or more users received from an image capture device to at least another user device via a network. The video controller is configured to select of one or more characteristics from a plurality of visual user characteristics and control the video based on detection of the selected characteristics to track the selected characteristics. The resource manager is configured to receive information about a communication channel between the user device and the other user device and or about one or more resources of the user device and or the other user device and based on the received information to control said selection by the video controller.

Also disclosed is a user device comprising a network interface for connecting to a network and one or more processors. The one or more processors are configured to transmit video of one or more users received from an image capture device to another user device via the network. The one or more processors are further configured to select characteristics from a plurality of visual user characteristics and to generate first and second sets of boundary data based on detection of the selected characteristics at first and second times respectively. The one or more processors are further configured to generate transition data based on the first and second sets of boundary data using a dynamic model and to control the video based on the transition data to track the selected characteristics.

Also disclosed are corresponding methods and respective computer program products comprising executable code configured to each of those methods.

Disclosed herein is a technique whereby during a video call 1 to 1 or multiparty a user s location in a room is detected using depth detection means a depth detector or similar and video of the call as transmitted to other user s is controlled to track the user based on that detection. More specifically respective visual characteristics of that user such as body parts of that user are so detected and the video is controlled to track selected ones but not necessarily all of those characteristics e.g. body parts . Whether or not a particular visual characteristic is tracked depends on communication channel conditions e.g. channel bandwidth and or near end and or far end device resources for example e.g. fewer characteristics e.g. body parts may be tracked for lower channel bandwidth and or smaller screen size of the far end device and more characteristics e.g. body parts may be tracked for higher channel bandwidth and or larger screen size of the far end device.

The user device executes an instance of a communication client provided by a software provider associated with the communication system . The communication client is a software program executed on a local processor in the user device . The client performs the processing required at the user device in order for the user device to transmit and receive data over the communication system .

The user device corresponds to the user device and executes on a local processor a communication client which corresponds to the communication client executed at the user device . The client at the user device performs the processing required to allow the user to communicate over the network in the same way that the client at the user device performs the processing required to allow the users and to communicate over the network . The user device corresponds to the user device and executes on a local processor a communication client which corresponds to the communication client executed at the user device . The client at the user device performs the processing required to allow the user to communicate over the network in the same way that the client at the user device performs the processing required to allow the users to communicate over the network . The user devices and are endpoints in the communication system . shows only four users and and three user devices and for clarity but many more users and user devices may be included in the communication system and may communicate over the communication system using respective communication clients executed on the respective user devices.

The projector and sensor constitute a depth detector for capturing non visible radiation data in three dimensions 3D . In this embodiment the projector projects a radiation pattern forward of the sensor which is detectable by the sensor sensor data from the sensor is used to build up the 3D image based on distortions in the detected radiation pattern as explained in more detail below with reference to . The depth detector and camera may be housed together in a single unit external to the user device possibly having a power supply separate to the user device connected to the processor via a suitable interface e.g. USB or USB based . An example of such a unit is the Microsoft Kinect Sensor .

With reference to there will now be described a method of transmitting video over a network. is a functional diagram of part of the user device .

As shown in the user device comprises an encoder e.g. an H264 encoder . This may be a hardware encoder to which video data is supplied by the processor for encoding prior to transmission over the network a software encoder implemented by software executed on e.g. processor or a combination of both. The user device further comprises controller implemented e.g. as part of the software of the client the camera the depth detector and a depth processor . The controller comprises a resource manager and a video signal processor . The camera captures images of a video of users labelled near end video in in a visible spectrum that is visible to a human eye and supplies those captured images to a first input of the video signal processor. The sensor captures images in a non visible spectrum that is not visible to a human eye and supplies those captured images to an input of the depth processor . The depth processor has an output coupled to a second input of the video signal processor. The projector projects non visible radiation forward of the sensor towards users which is detectable by the sensor . The controller encoder and sensor processor constitute a video processing system .

The resource manager has first second and third inputs and an output. The first of resource manager input is configured to receive information about one or more communication channels between the user device and one or more other user devices e.g. of the network . The second input of the resource manager is configured to receive information about resources of the user device and or one or more other user devices e.g. . The third input of the resource manager is coupled to an output the video signal processor .

The output of the resource manager is coupled to a third input of the video signal processor . The video signal processor has an output coupled to an input of the encoder . The encoder is configured to supply encoded video data which may be subject to further processing at the device e.g. packetization before being supplied to the network interface for transmission over the network to at least one of the second user device and the third user device .

The sensor processor is operable to process sensor data captured by and received from the sensor to detect a respective plurality of visual user characteristics for each user in a field of view of the sensor .

The video signal processor is configured to select characteristics from a plurality of visual user characteristics based information output from the resource manager and to control video supplied to the encoder for encoding based on detection of the selected characteristics by the sensor processor with the video being so controlled to track the selected characteristics i.e. such that the video tracks the selected characteristics over time eventually making the detected characteristics visible in the video.

This will now be described with reference to . show a user e.g. in the vicinity of the user device which is a shown as a games console in this embodiment . The user device is coupled to the display the camera the projector and the sensor all of which are external to the user device in this embodiment. In video of a first visible region limited to include upper portions e.g. head shoulders etc. of the user but not lower portions e.g. feet legs etc. of the user as captured by camera is supplied to the encoder for encoding and ultimately transmission to another user e.g. over the network . As shown in a version of the video of region is transmitted to the other user is optionally displayed on display as well overlaid on video received from that other user. In video of a second visible region which includes both the upper portions of the user and the lower portions of the user as captured by camera is supplied to the encoder for encoding and ultimately transmission the other user over the network . As shown in a version of the video of the second region is transmitted to the other user is optionally displayed on display as well overlaid on video received from that other user.

The first and second visible region have a respective size and location determined by the video control module based on data received from resource manager and data received from sensor processor as explained below.

This radiation pattern is projected forward of the sensor by the projector . The sensor captures images of the non visible radiation pattern as projected in its field of view. These images are processed by the sensor processor in order to calculate depths of users in the field of view of the sensor effectively building a three dimensional representation of the user thereby allowing the recognition of different users and different respective body parts thereof.

As illustrated in the user thus has a form which acts to distort the projected radiation pattern as detected by sensor with parts of the radiation pattern projected onto parts of the user further away from the projector being effectively stretched i.e. in this case such that dots of the radiation pattern are more separated relative to parts of the radiation projected onto parts of the user closer to the projector i.e. in this case such that dots of the radiation pattern are less separated with the amount of stretch scaling with separation from the projector and with parts of the radiation projected onto objects significantly backward of the user being effectively invisible to the sensor . Because the radiation pattern is systematically inhomogeneous the distortions thereof by the user s form can be used to discern that form e.g. to identify the user s head left hand right arm torso etc. by the sensor processor processing images of the distorted radiation pattern as captured by sensor . For instance separation of an area of the user from the sensor could be determined by measuring a separation of the dots of the detected radiation pattern within that area of the user.

Whilst in the radiation pattern is shown as visible to a human eye this is purely to aid in understanding and the radiation pattern as projected onto the user will not be visible to a human eye in reality.

As will now be described with reference to the images sensor data of the non visible radiation pattern captured by the sensor are processed by the sensor processor . This processing comprises skeletal detection processing. Skeletal detection processing is known in the art and is currently implemented for instance in the Microsoft Xbox 360 sometimes used in conjunction with the Microsoft Kinect Sensor the results of which are made available by way of an Application Programming Interface API for use by software developers.

The sensor detector receives sensor data from sensor and processes it to determine a number of users e.g. in the field of view of the sensor and to identify a respective plurality of skeletal points for each user using skeletal detection techniques which are known in the art. Each skeletal point represents an approximate location of the corresponding human joint in the video.

Specifically in this embodiment sensor detector detects twenty respective skeletal points for each user in the field of view of sensor . Each skeletal point corresponds to one of twenty recognized human joints with each varying in space and time as a user or users moves within the sensor s field of view. The location of these joints at any moment in time is calculated based on the user s or users respective three dimensional form as detected by sensor . A skeletal point also has a tracking state it can be tracked for a clearly visible joint inferred when a joint is not clearly visible but sensor processor is inferring its location or non tracked for example for a lower joint in seated mode tracking i.e. when it is detected that a user is seated and lower joints are not tracked by the sensor processor .

Each skeletal points may be provided with a respective confidence value indicate a likelihood of the corresponding joint having been correctly detects. Points with confidence values below a certain threshold may be excluded from processing by the video module .

The skeletal points and the video from camera are correlated such that the location of a skeletal point as reported by the sensor processor at a particular time corresponds to the location of the corresponding human joint within a frame image of the video at that time. The sensor detector supplies these detected skeletal points as skeletal point data to the video controller for use thereby. For each frame of video data the skeletal point data supplied by the sensor processor comprises locations of skeletal points within that frame e.g. expressed as Cartesian coordinates x y of a coordinate system bounded with respect to a video frame size.

The video controller receives the detected skeletal points for one or more users and is configured to determine therefrom a plurality of visual characteristics of that user or a respective plurality of visual characteristic of those users . In this embodiment visual user characteristics take the form of human body parts. Body parts are detected by the video controller each being detected by way of extrapolation from one or more skeletal points provided by the video processor and corresponding to a region within the corresponding video frame of video from camera that is defined as a region within the afore mentioned coordinate system . illustrates detected body parts which have been detected based on the skeletal points of .

It should be noted that these visual characteristic are visual in the sense that they represent features of a user s body which can in reality be seen and discerned however in this embodiment they are not seen by the video controller e.g. they are not detected in video data captured by camera rather the video controller extrapolates an approximate relative location shape and size of these features within a frame of the video from camera from the arrangement of the twenty skeletal points as provided by sensor processor and not based on e.g. processing of that frame for example by approximating each body part as a rectangle or similar having a location and size and optionally orientation calculated from detected arrangements of skeletal points germane to that body part.

A method of controlling video to be transmitted over a network based on detected user characteristics body parts in this embodiment will now be described with reference to . shows a flowchart of the method on the left and a corresponding visual representation of each method step on the right.

In this embodiment the method is implemented algorithmically as part of the software of client specifically by controller .

The method will be described in the context of a real time video call conducted using the first user near end device and the second user far end device between users thereof.

At the start of the video call the resource manager of client of the near end device determines a video resolution to be used for video transmitted to the far end device based the information received thereby. For instance this information may include information about one or more of 

The video resolution may be determined at least in part by way of negotiation with the far end device e.g. whereby the near end resource manager request information about resources of the far end device therefrom .

During the call the resource manager of the near end device monitors available resources e.g. the available bandwidth takes decisions to increase or decrease the resolution for the video being sent to the far end device and communicated those decisions to the video controller . The video resolution may thus vary dynamically thought the call e.g. due to fluctuation channel bandwidth arising say from one or both of the neared and far end devices being connected to the network via an unreliable wireless e.g. WiFi connection .

Selection of characterises comprises selecting more characteristics if the received information indicates better channel quality and or more device resources and selecting fewer characteristics if the received information indicates worse channel quality and or more fewer device resources. For instance for lower bandwidth and or smaller screen size a lower resolution is determined by the resource manager causing selection a region with fewer body parts for higher bandwidth and or larger screen size a higher resolution is determined by the resource manager causing selection a region with more body parts than is determined for said lower bandwidth and or said smaller screen size.

In this embodiment video is captured from camera at a fixed resolution of 1920 1080 pixels. However as described below the captured video may be cropped cropping being to the removal of the outer parts of images of the video prior to transmission. That is only selective parts of the captured videos data as captured from a selected visible region are supplied to encoder for encoding and subsequent transmission to the far end device. Supplying cropped video data thus means supplying less video data to the encoder as video data outside of the defined region is not supplied to the encoder.

The skeletal point data is received by the video controller from the sensor processor at step S. In the exemplary illustration on the right hand side of skeletal data for collocated users and both in the field of vision of sensor is shown. However the method can be applied to received skeletal data for any number of users one or more as will be apparent.

At step S the video controller selects respective body regions for each user in the field of view of sensor based on the determined resolution received from the resource manager . Depending on this video resolution the video controller selects body regions out of the possible plurality of body regions of table 2 as follows 

The selection of characterises comprises selecting more characteristics for higher resolutions better channel conditions and or greater device resources and selecting fewer characteristics for lower resolutions worse channel conditions and or lesser device resources .

For each user in the field of vision of sensor the selected region is detected that is respective body parts of the selected region are detected based on the received skeletal data. The video is then cropped as described below before being encoded and transmitted based on the detected body parts e.g. for region the video is cropped based on detection of user s head user s head user s shoulders and user s shoulders but not on any other body parts of those users as only the head and shoulders are included in region . Thus not all skeletal points necessarily contribute to the cropping as some of these may serve only to define body parts that are not part of the selected region . That is the control of the video may be based on a selection of skeletal points of the plurality of detected skeletal points but not others of the plurality of detected skeletal points.

For instance in the exemplary depiction on the right hand side of region head shoulders mid spine elbows has been selected and video control is thus based on detected region 2 characteristic for both user in and for user in .

As part of the video control which comprises selectively cropping the video in accordance with the determined resolution in this embodiment at step S the video controller generates boundary data based detection of the body parts of the selected region. The boundary data defines a rectangular boundary cropping rectangle . The cropping rectangle is formed from the union of the respective detected regions for all tracked users.

At step S video controller modifies the generated boundary data based on a predetermined aspect ratio e.g. an aspect ratio of a display of the far end device such as 4 3 16 9 etc. whereby the cropping rectangle is adjusted to the predetermined aspect ratio. The adjusted cropping rectangle bounding rectangle is shown as on the right hand side of and has an aspect ratio of 16 9 in this embodiment .

At step S the video is cropped based on the adjusted rectangle as explained in more detail below. The cropped video is then scaled to an output resolution e.g. matching that of the screen of the fared device to which it is being transmitted before being encoded by encoder .

The method is performed for each frame of the video data. Because the boundary rectangles track users characteristics which may move as a user moves about or separate as e.g. two users move apart between frames cropping rectangles move around.

However rather than simply cropping each frame of video data to the adjusted rectangle determined for that frame i.e. by supplying only video data from the portion of that frame defined by the adjusted rectangle transition data is generated based on respective adjusted rectangles calculated for one or more earlier frames and on the adjusted rectangle calculated for a current frame. The transition data is generated based on an elastic spring model.

The cropping rectangles move around according to the elastic spring model which smoothes transitions between frames and prevents jittery video. It also increases efficiency of encoding for the following reason. Because the elastic model effectively dampens movement of cropping rectangles it reduces differences between adjacent frames which as will be apparent results in more efficient differential encoding.

This will now be described with reference to . shows a flowchart of a method of controlling video to be transmitted to the far end user as time progresses and an exemplary pectoral representation of the method on the right hand side.

At step S for a current video frame in the sequence of video frames of the captured video the video controller generate a first set and one or more second sets of boundary data e.g. by calculating bounding rectangles having predetermined aspect ratios as described above based on detection of the selected visual user characteristics body parts in this embodiment at a first time and one or more second times respectively the first time being a time of the current frame and the second time s being time s of previous frames. The boundary data for earlier frames may be generated before the boundary data for later frames e.g. on a frame by frame basis . Therefore S may take place over a period spanning several video frames.

Two exemplary bounding rectangles at a respective first time t1 and second time t2 are shown on the right hand side of . The rectangle for t2 is shown larger than the rectangle for t1 which may be e.g. due to two users being tracked and those users moving further apart or due to a change in available resources e.g. increase in channel bandwidth causing the resource manager to increase the determined aspect ratio resulting in a region with more body parts being selected e.g. a switch from region to region and the bounding rectangle being automatically adjusted by the video controller accordingly.

At step S the video module generates transition data based on the first and second sets of boundary data using the dynamic model described above. The generated transition data effectively defines a transitional bounding rectangle shown in representing a transition to the bounding rectangle of the current frame from bounding rectangles of previous frames.

For example in accordance with the above elastic spring model bounding rectangles may be parameterized by one or more points at different locations one form of boundary data . A point may have a second position desiredPosition at time t2 being a parameter of rectangle and a first position currentPosition at time t1 being a parameter of rectangle . In this case the transition data may be generated by updating currentPosition as follows with the updated currentPosition being a parameter of the transitional bounding rectangle 

At step S the video controller control the video based on the transition data to track the selected characteristics. Here this involves cropping the video such that only image data of frame that is within bounding rectangle is supplied to the encoder for encoding and transmission to the far end user and not image data of frame that is outside of bounding rectangle .

The detector and sensor processor are configured such that users separated by more than approximately 1 meter from the detector are not tracked that is are outside of the field of vision of the sensor so they don t affect the cropping rectangle. Thus for instance if two users are initially being tracked and one moves out of the field of vision in accordance with the methods and cropping rectangles calculated thereafter will be based only on the remaining user s characteristics and will thus automatically zoom in on the remaining user with the elastic model ensuring a smooth transition for this zoom .

In embodiments the video controller may feed back into the resource manager such that if the resource manager considers there is enough bandwidth for 1920 1080 video but there is at least one body to be tracked the video send resolution is switched to 1280 720 to enable dynamic tracking as for video transmitted resolution equal to that at which it is captured there is no room for manoeuvre as for each frame the cropping rectangle effectively encompasses the entirety of that frame this is true e.g. where up scaling is not employed .

As indicated the sensor processor supplies not only information identifying each detected skeletal point but also identifying which of one or more users in the sensor s field of vision those skeletal points corresponds to. Thus the described method can be implemented with any number of users as long as the sensor detector remains capable of distinguishing there between and for each characteristic in the selected region will track those characterises for each region. Thus the method adapts automatically as multiple users walk in and out of frame with the bounding rectangles automatically transitioning in a smooth manner due to the elastic model to accommodate new users as they walk into frame by effectively zooming out to include any body parts of that user for the selected region in the video and to adjust as users walk out of frame by effectively zooming in to exclude any regions previously occupied by body parts of that user for the selected region such that only body parts for the selected region of the remaining users are retained in the video .

The methods implemented by the controller can be implemented during a multiparty call conducted over the network using e.g. user devices and between users and with individual bounding rectangles being determined by the near end user first device for each far end device second device and third device .

That is in addition to the above the resource manager may receive further information about at least one of a communication channel between the user device and the third user device and resources of the further user device in addition to receiving the information described above such as similar information for the second device . The resource manager then selects further characteristics selected from the plurality of visual user characteristics e.g. body parts based on the received further information for controlling video to be transmitted to the third user device in addition to selecting the aforementioned characteristics for controlling video to be transmitted to the second user device .

The video controller then controls the video to be transmitted to the third user device based on detection of the selected further characteristics selected for the third device in order to track the selected further characteristics in the third device video whilst controlling the video to be transmitted to the second user device based on detection of the characteristics selected for the second device .

The further selection of characteristics for the third user device may be independent and different from the selection of characterises for the second user device. Thus the further video transmitted to the second user device may be different form the video transmitted to the second user device with the further video transmitted to the third user device tracking more or fewer user characteristics than the video transmitted to the second user device.

The selection of the characteristics for the second user device video is independent from the selection of characteristic for the third user video. Whilst a condition such as the first user device being connected to the network via a slow connection may cause a similar cropping for both other conditions such as one of the second and third devices being connected to the network via a slow connection or one of those devices having limited resources may cause different cropping.

For example the third user device may have a small screen e.g. smartphone screen and or be connected to the network via a slow connection in contrast the second user device may have a large screen e.g. be connected to a TV screen and or be connected to the network via a fast connection. In this case video transmitted to the second user device may be subject to region 4 cropping see table 2 such that user receives video showing users and top to toe. In contrast video transmitted to user device may be subject to region cropping see table 2 such that user receives video showing only the respective heads and shoulders of users 

Whilst in the above the video to be transmitted over the network is controlled by way of video signal processing alternatively or additionally the video may be controlled by the video controller of controller by manipulating the camera itself based detection of the selected features e.g. the manipulation comprising manipulating mechanics of the camera to perform at least one of a pan operation a zoom operation and a tilt operation. For e.g. a multi party call optical zoom and digital zoom cropping may be used in conjunction e.g. with mechanical zoom being used to capture video showing the highest selected number of user characteristics e.g. mechanical zoom could be used to select a region to be shown to the second user device in the above example with cropping of that video being used to control video for users who are to be sent video with fewer user characteristics e.g. the third device in the above example .

Further whilst in the above an elastic model is employed as an alternative any dynamic model e.g. based on one or more differential equations in time could be used to generate the transition data.

Further whilst in the above selected visual characteristic legs arms etc. are detected based on sensor data supplied by a depth detector which projects a nonvisible radiation pattern forward of a sensor configured to detect that pattern alternative detections are envisages. For instance a depth detection could be a time of flight based detection in which radiation propagation times are used to measure depth. Alternatively an array of cameras having different inclinations such as a plenoptic camera used in conjunction with a 3D image recognition algorithm or similar could be used to build up a 3D image from multiple two dimensional images with the visual characteristic being detected form the 3D image.

Generally any of the functions described herein e.g. the functional modules shown in and the functional steps shown in can be implemented using software firmware hardware e.g. fixed logic circuitry or a combination of these implementations. The modules video processing system controller video signal processor resource manager encoder etc. shown separately in and the steps shown separately in may or may not be implemented as separate modules or steps. The terms module functionality component and logic as used herein generally represent software firmware hardware or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation the module functionality or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a processor e.g. CPU or CPUs . The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices. The features of the techniques described herein are platform independent meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors. For example the user devices may also include an entity e.g. software that causes hardware of the user devices to perform operations e.g. processors functional blocks and so on. For example the user devices may include a computer readable medium that may be configured to maintain instructions that cause the user devices and more particularly the operating system and associated hardware of the user devices to perform operations. For example some or all of the modules of may be implemented by software of a client application executed on one or more processors. Thus the instructions function to configure the operating system and associated hardware to perform the operations and in this way result in transformation of the operating system and associated hardware to perform functions. The instructions may be provided by the computer readable medium to the user devices through a variety of different configurations.

One such configuration of a computer readable medium is signal bearing medium and thus is configured to transmit the instructions e.g. as a carrier wave to the computing device such as via a network. The computer readable medium may also be configured as a computer readable storage medium and thus is not a signal bearing medium. Examples of a computer readable storage medium include a random access memory RAM read only memory ROM an optical disc flash memory hard disk memory and other memory devices that may us magnetic optical and other techniques to store instructions and other data.
