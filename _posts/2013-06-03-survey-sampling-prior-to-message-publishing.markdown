In accordance with some preferred embodiments the system of the present invention is dedicated for initial surveying and subsequent publishing of presence messages via the infrastructure of presence messaging systems known in the art. Presence protocols are standardized inter alia in OMA IMPS OMA PAG XMPP and or SIMPLE standards collections referred to supra as well as in proprietary protocols.

1. sender that is an individual or entity that send the presence message is referred to as presentity or publisher 

2. recipient that is an individual or entity that receives the presence message is referred to as watcher 

Presence messaging systems as oppose to Instant Messaging IM systems are typically characterized by a frequent publishing of one or more presence attributes by the presentity b usually a plurality of watchers whom are typically subscribed or associated with the presentity and c obtainment of the messages by watchers whom are not subscribed or associated with the presentity inter alia via fetching step whereas in IM the messages are typically delivered to the recipient via push step. There is a particular type of a presence attribute which is often colloquially referred to as status.

In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention reference is now made to showing surveying and publishing system . System embodies an exemplary surveying and publishing system for presence messages. System comprises a presentity module referred to as publisher . Publisher typically comprises a sending terminal which is a message user agent frequently referred at the colloquial language as client. Publisher is optionally a server based client integrated with presence notification server . Publisher is used for the composition of the presence messages and formatting thereof. Publisher is used for the composition and or formatting of presence messages subject to the surveying as well as optionally for the composition and or formatting of presence messages subject to the final publishing.

In some embodiments wherein a deterministic surveying publishing is implemented publisher composes a singular presence message intended for initial surveying and subsequent deterministic publishing. In the instance of deterministic surveying publisher defines a set of selection parameters for the participants in the survey and a set of threshold parameters for publishing of the message. Deterministic surveying publishing as referred to herein relates to a publishing method wherein a message is eventually published to a given watcher based on deterministically meeting a set threshold parameter.

In some embodiments wherein a comparative surveying publishing is implemented publisher composes a plurality of presence messages intended for initial surveying and subsequent comparative publishing. In the instance of comparative surveying publisher defines a set or optionally a plurality of sets of selection parameters for the participants in the comparative surveys and at least one comparative parameter for deciding on publishing of a given message. Comparative surveying publishing as referred to herein relates to a publishing method wherein a message is eventually published to a given watcher upon exceeding in the score of at least one parameter in at least one survey as compared to the score of the same parameter in at least one another survey. Accordingly at least two surveys have to be performed in order to exercise the comparative surveying publishing. Preferably more than two surveys are performed in order to exercise the comparative surveying publishing. The group and or sub group construction as well as comparing of parameters in comparative surveying publishing is achievable by implementing the statistic method of a b testing or bucket testing known in the art.

Upon completing the composition and or formatting of a presence message intended for initial surveying publisher transmits the message to surveying server in the direction indicated by arrow . The presence message transmitted as indicated by arrow alongside the body of the presence message presented to the watcher comprises metadata that specifies the selection parameters for the participants in the survey and at least one deterministic and or comparative parameter for subsequent publishing of a message.

In some embodiments publisher transmits the message directly to presence notification server in the direction indicated by arrow . The presence message transmitted as indicated by arrow alongside the body of the presence message presented to the watcher comprises metadata that specifies the selection parameters for the participants in the survey and at least one deterministic and or comparative parameter for subsequent publishing of a message. Presence notification server as referred to herein is a presence server furnished with capabilities of selectively publishing a message to at least one defined watcher. It is noted that the watcher does not have to actively subscribe to the presentity but rather could be implicitly subscribed by the surveying and publishing system and or by an external presence publish server.

Upon receiving a presence message intended for initial surveying together with the metadata specifying the selection parameters for the participants in the survey submitted by publisher in the direction indicated by arrow surveying server inquires presence notification server for a list of watchers the attributes of which currently meet the selection parameters for the participants for a given survey as indicated by arrow . Exemplary attributes for selection parameters include the intrinsic characteristics such as gender and age of the watcher transient characteristics such as geographical location of the watcher as resolved form the internet protocol address IP address and or geographical location resolved from GPS as well as commercial characteristics such as purchasing history consumer club membership etc.

Presence notification server inquired as indicated by arrow compiles a list of watchers the attributes of which currently attend the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey. Presence notification server thereafter screens the list of watchers the attributes of which currently attend the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey for watchers the presence message user agent of which comprises or accosted with a client feedback module as elaborated infra. Alternatively or additionally presence notification server screens the list of watchers which currently attend the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey for watchers from a predefined list watchers who are recorded as participants in surveys and or participants in previous automated surveys stored on presence notification server and or notification history database . The screened list of watchers which currently attend the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey as well as the presence message user agent of which comprises or accosted with a client feedback and or are from a predefined list watchers and or participants in previous automated surveys constitutes the list of the intended participants for the current survey hereinafter referred to as notification list. It is noted that in some embodiments no screening is performed and the notification list is a mere list of watchers which currently meet the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey.

The notification list for the current survey is transmitted to surveying server as indicated by arrow . In some embodiments presence notification server returns a mere list of watchers which currently attend the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey as indicated by arrow whereas surveying server applies screening for watchers the presence message user agent of which comprises or accosted with a client feedback and or are from a predefined list watchers and or participants in previous automated surveys and subsequently generates the notification list. Alternatively or additionally parameters for building notification list are obtained from external source and or from notification history database . It is noted that in some instances of comparative surveying publishing a plurality of notification lists is optionally generated based on difference in selection parameters of the watchers which represent different or heterogeneous survey groups whereas in other instances of comparative surveying publishing a plurality of notification lists are optionally generated based on identity and or similarity of the selection parameters which represent sub divisions or sub groups of an homogeneous survey group.

In some embodiments publisher transmits the message directly to presence notification server as indicated by arrow . The presence message is optionally forwarded to surveying server as indicated by arrow with the metadata thereof whereas the notification list or mere list of watchers which currently attend the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey is typically provided by presence notification server as indicated by arrow either upon injury by surveying server as indicated by arrow or automatically after or alongside forwarding the presence message to surveying server as indicated by arrow . It is noted that in some instances of comparative surveying publishing a plurality of notification lists are optionally generated based on difference or identity similarity of the selection parameters.

Upon receiving and or generating the notification list surveying server publishes the presence message of the given survey to presence notification server as indicated by arrow . Typically upon publishing to presence notification server surveying server stores a copy of the presence message respectively alongside the notification list therein and or at notification history database as indicated by arrow . Thereafter presence notification server performs notifying of the presence message to the watchers in notification list hereinafter referred to as the survey group via a push step as indicated by arrow and . Alternatively or additionally the presence message is fetched by the watchers in survey group via a pull step as indicated by arrow and .

The watchers in the survey group comprise respective receiving terminals which are presence messaging user agents PUA frequently referred to at the colloquial language as clients such as exemplary PUA and . The PUAs of watchers in the survey group such as exemplary PUAs and are typically either comprise a client feedback module as exemplary PUA integrated with client feedback module or are associated with a client feedback module as exemplary PUA connected to client feedback module .

Alternatively or additionally the PUAs of watchers in the survey group such as exemplary PUA become associated with a client feedback module for a first time as elaborated hereunder which is a characteristic embodiments wherein no screening is performed and the notification list is a mere list of watchers which currently meet the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey. The embodiments wherein the notification list is a mere list of watchers which currently meet the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey are useful for building up from scratch the aforementioned predefined lists of watchers who are recorded participants of surveys implementable for the aforesaid screening.

Upon receiving the message whether by fetching or notifying the watchers in the survey group interact with the message via the PUAs thereof such as exemplary PUAs and . The term interact or interaction with the message as referred to herein is to be construed as including any action whether active or passive exerted directly on the message or indirectly thereto which may pertain to a qualitative or quantitative value. Examples of passive interactions exerted directly with the message include ignoring the message and not opening the message in general or specifically not opening the message as a result of being in physical activity or condition such as cycling running driving sleeping busy eating watching a movie on a call. The system preferably to take into account various relative parameters such as the notification load that may result in a different behavior pattern. For example a person received notifications within the last hour and interacts with only a few of them. Another example is low battery state due to which the user might ignore the message.

Examples of active interactions exerted directly with the message as referred to herein in a non limiting manner include rejecting the message deleting the message opening the message scrolling through the message body opening hyperlinks embedded in the message open any files attached to the message replying to the message forwarding the message performing a copy operation to at least a portion of the message changing the appearance of the message changing font size sharing the message with others publishing the message saving the message ranking the message etc.

Examples of active interactions exerted indirectly to the message as referred to herein in a non limiting manner include deleting presentity blocking the publisher blacklisting the publisher opening hyperlinks embedded in the message opening up an application powering off the phone. Examples of active conditional interactions exerted indirectly to the message that pertain to a qualitative value include making an online purchase as a result of the message making a purchase at a physical store using a credit card and getting the related information from the credit card company examples of active conditional interactions exerted indirectly to the message that pertain to a quantitative value include arrival of the device within a predefined radius of a geographical location the coordinates of which are specified in the message.

Available data about the interaction history of a given message is collected by a client feedback module such as client feedback module integrated with exemplary PUA or individual client feedback module connected to exemplary PUA . A preferred instance of an interaction with the message recorded individual client feedback module by opening a hyperlink embedded in the message wherein upon opening hyperlink the user is initially directed as indicated by arrow to a proxy server such as proxy server comprising client feedback module . The latter example is particular useful for associating recipient PUAs with a client feedback module for a first time by using a mere list of watchers which currently meet the selection parameters for the participants for the given survey as the notification list. The latter example is beneficial for building up from scratch the aforementioned predefined lists of watchers who are recorded participants of surveys implementable for the aforesaid screening.

Data about the interaction history with a given message collected by a client feedback module such as client feedback module integrated with PUA or individual client feedback module are then reported to surveying server as indicated by arrows and upon accumulating a minimal preset quota of data and or exceeding a predetermined period of time. It is noticed that the reporting of data about the interaction history is optionally a push step performed by a client feedback module or a pull step performed by surveying server .

Upon receiving the reported data about interaction history from a minimal quorum of watchers in the survey group or a plurality of survey groups in a case of comparative surveying publishing surveying server exerts the logic for the decision of whether publishing the message to an indefinite number of end user watchers which do not have an integrated or associated client feedback module based on the survey type and or the values of the parameters reported data about.

The data about interaction history reported to surveying server as indicated by arrows and may include qualitative and or quantitative values. Instances of qualitative values reported to surveying server in the data about interaction history inter alia include indications of whether the message was opened read deleted scrolled through replied to an embedded hyperlink and or enclosed media file has been opened whereas instances of quantitative values reported to surveying server in the data about interaction history inter alia include indications of how long the message was opened for how further down it was scrolled and how many of the embedded hyperlinks or enclosed media files have been opened.

The qualitative and or quantitative values reported to surveying server in the data about interaction history are further utilized in the process of exerting the logic for the decision of whether to perform distribution publishing to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected watchers. Optionally watchers having integrated or associated client feedback module such as watchers with PUAs A to B are excluded from distribution publishing to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected watchers. In some preferred embodiments the notification list of the survey is retrieved from notification history database as indicated by arrow and the participants of the survey are excluded from the aforesaid distribution publishing to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected watchers to avoid publishing the message twice to the same watcher.

In the case of deterministic surveying publishing the qualitative and or quantitative values are compared to respective threshold parameters for publishing of the message as defined initially by publisher in the metadata of the message. If qualitative and or quantitative values meet the minimal required quota of respective threshold parameters the message is published by surveying server as indicated by arrow to presence notification server optionally alongside a distribution list which dictates at least one parameter for inclusion in and or exclusion from selective distribution publishing by presence notification server to a defined group of selected watchers. Presence notification server in turn publishes distributes the message as indicated by arrows to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected end user watchers. Typically surveying server excludes from the distribution publishing the watchers which have an integrated or associated client feedback module such as end user watchers with PUAs A to B. Optionally watchers that have an integrated or associated client feedback module but which have not participated in a given survey are nevertheless get notified as indicated by arrow .

In the case of comparative surveying publishing the qualitative and or quantitative values in first survey group or subgroup are compared to respective values in second survey group or subgroup. If the qualitative and or quantitative values in first survey group exceed the respective values in second survey group the message is published as indicated by arrow to presence notification server optionally alongside a distribution list which dictates at least one parameter for inclusion in and or exclusion from selective distribution publishing by presence notification server to a defined group of selected watchers. Presence notification server in turn publishes distributes the message as indicated by arrows to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected end user watchers. Typically surveying server excludes from the distribution publishing the watchers which have an integrated or associated client feedback module such as end user watchers with PUAs A to B. Optionally watchers that have an integrated or associated client feedback module but which have not participated in a given survey and or have not participated in a sub group of a survey are nevertheless notified as indicated by arrow .

It is explicitly noted that the comparative surveying publishing as referred to herein optionally includes comparing respective values among more than two groups of different surveys or among more than two subgroups of a survey.

Upon publishing the message to presence notification server as indicated by arrow publisher is preferably notified with confirmation of the distribution publishing of the message to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected end user watchers by surveying server as indicated by arrow . Upon reaching the decision not to distribute publish the message to presence notification server publisher is preferably notified by surveying server with a denial of the distribution publishing to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected end user watchers. Upon publishing the message to presence notification server and or reaching the decision not to publish the message publisher is preferably notified by surveying server with the results of the surveys. Upon publishing the message to presence notification server and or reaching the decision not to publish the message surveying server preferably stores a copy of the presence message respectively alongside the data of the results of the surveys therein and or at notification history database .

In some preferred embodiments prior to the distribution publishing of the presence message to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected end user watchers as indicated by arrow surveying server seeks permission from publisher as indicated by arrow and preferably notifying publisher with the results of the surveys.

In some preferred embodiments and optimally upon reaching the decision not to distribute publish the presence message to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of selected watchers surveying server notifies publisher as to at least one type of statistical analysis of the survey. Consequently publisher is provided with an option to redefine the selection parameters for watchers in distribution publishing to a defined group of selected watchers thereby shaping or reshaping the list of end user watchers.

In some embodiments wherein publisher transmits the message directly to presence notification server as indicated by arrow the seeking of permission from publisher notifying publisher with the results of the surveys notifying publisher with a denial or confirmation of the distribution publishing to an indefinite number of end user watchers or a defined group of users as indicated by arrow is performed by publisher directly to presence notification server as indicated by arrow .

It is stressed that in the sake of brevity not all actual combinations of modules agents and or various other constituents from different configurations and or embodiments are explicitly disclosed in the specification hereinabove. The emphasis instead has been made on the characteristics of such constituents and functional context thereof. Therefore numerous non disclosed combinations of modules agents and or various other constituents from different configurations and or embodiments are contemplated by the present disclosure.
