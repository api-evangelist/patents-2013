This invention was made at least in part with U.S. Government support under contract number N00019 08 G 0002XT23 awarded by the United States Navy. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present disclosure relates to fastening systems and in particular to a fastening system using a removable stud and a retaining plate.

Threaded studs are commonly used to attach a line replaceable unit LRU to a housing of an aircraft or other aircraft components. Typically a male portion of the stud is threaded into a mating female thread in a bore of the housing. To prevent the stud from unthreading from the bore of the housing e.g. during prolonged periods of vibration keys or other thread deforming mechanisms are often employed to mechanically lock the stud within the bore. However such thread deforming anti rotation mechanisms typically prevent the stud from being unthreaded from the bore even when it is desired to remove the stud from the housing such as when the stud becomes damaged. Accordingly removal and replacement of the stud can require removal of the entire housing from the aircraft to enable the stud to be removed from the bore using machining operations. Moreover the machining operations may permanently damage the housing of the aircraft component thereby possibly requiring replacement of a high cost component housing. As such removal and replacement of a keyed stud used to attach an LRU to a housing of an aircraft component may be costly and time consuming.

In one example a fastening system includes a removable stud and a retaining plate. The removable stud includes a threaded portion configured to be removably threaded into a threaded bore of a housing a shank portion arranged coaxially with the threaded portion and configured to be inserted through a bore of a housing of a line replaceable component and an anti rotation portion disposed between the threaded portion and the shank portion. The retaining plate is configured to be mounted between the housing and the line replaceable component. The retaining plate includes a mating hole configured to mate with the anti rotation portion of the removable stud.

In another example a removable stud includes a threaded portion a shank portion and an anti rotation portion. The threaded portion is configured to be removably threaded into a threaded bore of a housing. The shank portion is arranged coaxially with the threaded portion and configured to be inserted through a bore of a line replaceable component. The anti rotation portion is disposed between the threaded portion and the shank portion. The anti rotation portion is configured to mate with a mating hole of a retaining plate.

In another example a fastening system includes a plurality of removable studs and a retaining plate. Each removable stud of the plurality of removable studs includes a threaded portion a shank portion and an anti rotation portion. The threaded portion is configured to be removably threaded into a respective one of a plurality of threaded bores of a housing. The shank portion is arranged coaxially with the threaded portion and is configured to be inserted through a respective one of a plurality of bores of a housing of a line replaceable component. The anti rotation portion is disposed between the threaded portion and the shank portion. The retaining plate is configured to be mounted between the housing and the line replaceable component. The retaining plate includes a plurality of mating holes. Each of the mating holes is configured to mate with an anti rotation portion of a respective one of the plurality of removable studs.

A fastening system according to the present disclosure includes a removable stud and a retaining plate that can be used to attach a line replaceable component to a housing such as a housing of an aircraft component. The disclosed fastening system utilizes an anti rotation mechanism that prevents rotation of a removable stud used to attach the line replaceable component to the housing. Rather than use a thread deforming anti rotation mechanism e.g. a keying mechanism that physically deforms the threads of the stud to mechanically lock the stud to the housing a fastening system described herein utilizes a retaining plate that includes at least one mating hole configured to mate with an anti rotation portion of the removable stud. In this way the disclosed fastening system can prevent unthreading of the removable stud from the housing while the removable stud is mated with the retaining plate without deforming the threads of the stud. Accordingly the fastening system of the present disclosure can enable on wing stud replacement without requiring removal of the entire component housing from the aircraft to replace a stud e.g. when the stud becomes damaged thereby decreasing the time and cost associated with replacing such studs.

Removable stud A includes shank portion A anti rotation portion A and a threaded portion illustrated in . Shank portion A extends axially from the threaded portion of removable stud A. Anti rotation portion A is disposed between the threaded portion and shank portion A. The threaded portion of removable stud A is configured to be removably threaded into a threaded bore of housing described below in detail with respect to . For instance the threaded portion of removable stud A can include male threads that are configured to be threadably mated into complementary female threads of the threaded bore of housing such as by rotating removable stud A in a first direction e.g. clockwise to thread the threaded portion into the threaded bore and rotating removable stud A in a second direction e.g. counterclockwise to unthread the threaded portion from the threaded bore of housing . illustrates an example in which the threaded portion of removable stud A is threaded into a threaded bore of housing .

Shank portion A of removable stud A includes unthreaded shank portion A proximate anti rotation portion A.

For example one or more of protrusions A can be non symmetrical such as by having a right triangle shape or other non symmetrical shape. In addition in certain examples protrusions A may not be symmetrically arranged around the circumference of anti rotation portion A. For instance protrusions A may be arranged around the circumference of anti rotation portion A such that a distance between a first one of protrusions A and a second one of protrusions A is different than a distance between the second one of protrusions A and a third one of protrusions A. In some examples anti rotation portion A may include more or fewer than twelve protrusions A such as one protrusion two protrusions six protrusions twenty protrusions or other numbers of protrusions.

As described above mating hole A can include one or more voids A circumferentially arranged around mating hole A and configured to receive at least one of the plurality of protrusions A of anti rotation portion A in a respective one of voids A.

In operation the example fastening system of is assembled to attach line replaceable component to housing by first threading each of removable studs A D collectively referred to herein as removable studs into a corresponding threaded bore of housing . Mating plate is mounted to abut housing by mating the anti rotation portions of each of removable studs i.e. anti rotation portions A D with a respective one of mating holes A D collectively referred to herein as mating holes . That is mating plate is mounted to abut housing by mating anti rotation portion A of removable stud A with mating hole A. Similarly anti rotation portion B of removable stud B is mated with mating hole B anti rotation portion C of removable stud C is mated with mating hole C and anti rotation portion D of removable stud D is mated with mating hole D. In certain examples retaining plate can be secured to housing by threading counter sunk screw through retaining plate into corresponding threaded hole within housing that is configured to threadably mate with counter sunk screw .

Housing of line replaceable component is mounted to abut retaining plate by inserting each of the shank portions A D collectively referred to herein as shank portions of removable studs through a corresponding one of bores A D collectively referred to herein as bores of housing of line replaceable component . That is shank portion A of removable stud A is inserted through bore A shank portion B of removable stud B is inserted through bore B shank portion C of removable stud C is inserted through bore C and shank portion D of removable stud D is inserted through bore D. In some examples fastening system can include one or more washers and nuts configured to secure housing to removable studs . For example fastening system can include washer and nut . In the example of washer e.g. a self locking washer is configured to be mounted between housing and nut e.g. a self locking nut .
