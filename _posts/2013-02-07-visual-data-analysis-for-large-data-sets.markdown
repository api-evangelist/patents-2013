title: Visual data analysis for large data sets
abstract: A system and method for illustrating enterprise data. An example method includes accessing data from an enterprise application, wherein the data is organized into one or more objects; categorizing the one or more objects based on a grouping criterion, resulting in one or more groups of one or more categorized objects in response thereto; displaying representations of the one or more categorized objects as nodes of a visualization such that each node is positioned in a section of the visualization according to a group associated with the node, resulting in one or more sections of nodes corresponding to the one or more groups; and adjusting a luminance of each node based on a node-appearance criterion. The visualization may be automatically sectioned based on a select combination of user-specified data attributes or criteria, where the selected combination yields a visualization with the most dark nodes in a given section.

This application is related to the following application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 726 084 entitled VIEWS FOR VISUALIZING LARGE NUMBERS OF NODES filed on Dec. 22 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in full in this specification 

The present application relates to software and more specifically to user interface designs and methods for employing visualizations to graphically display and interact with data and or concepts.

Visualizations are employed in various demanding application including enterprise resource planning scientific research digital libraries data mining financial data analysis market studies manufacturing production control drug discovery and so on.

Such applications often involve large datasets of which a portion or all of the data may be incorporated into a visualization. The data may include patterns and other characteristics that may be illustrated via a visualization. Such applications often demand particularly illustrative visualizations that can reveal patterns and information in the data and facilitate comparisons between data sets.

Illustrative visualizations for visualizing large data sets are particularly important in enterprise applications e.g. Business Intelligence Human Capital Management and so on where multiple attributes patterns and phenomena may exist in granular data to be illustrated via a visualization.

Conventional visualizations such as pie charts line graphs bar graphs and so on are typically limited to displaying summarized or aggregated data. More granular data is typically summarized and represented by a portion of a visualization such as a bar of a bar chart. Unfortunately patterns potentially existing in underlying granular data are often hidden by the visualizations.

To view underlying data some visualizations incorporate drill down functionality enabling a user to expand or zoom in on a particular portion of a visualization such as a node to reveal additional detail. However performing multiple zooming or drilling operations on individual portions of a visualization may be time consuming and may not provide broader views of granular data between different nodes of a given visualization. Accordingly important patterns and information among visualization components may remain obscured.

An example method for illustrating enterprise data includes accessing data from an enterprise application wherein the data is organized into one or more objects categorizing the one or more objects based on a grouping criterion resulting in one or more groups of one or more categorized objects in response thereto displaying representations of the one or more categorized objects as nodes of a visualization such that each node is positioned in a section of the visualization according to a group associated with the node resulting in one or more sections of nodes corresponding to the one or more groups and adjusting a luminance or brightness of each node based on a node appearance criterion.

In a more specific embodiment the step of categorizing further includes providing a user option to specify plural criteria for affecting the visualization and automatically grouping the one or more objects in accordance with a combination of criteria chosen from among the plural criteria to result in display of a set of visualization sections characterized by a section meeting a predetermined constraint or matching a predetermined characteristic. The predetermined constraint may include for example a maximum number of least luminous nodes in a section as compared to other sections that would result from different combinations of chosen criteria a maximum density of least luminous nodes in a section and so on.

In an illustrative embodiment the method further includes providing a first user option to adjust the grouping criterion in accordance with a first data attribute. The first data attribute is then visually encoded in the visualization by re categorizing the one or more categorized objects based on the first data attribute and re sectioning the visualization in response thereto. This results in display of new sections with sizes and shapes based on numbers of nodes of each category and based on the first attribute as specified via the user adjusted grouping criterion. The first attribute may include a combination of data attributes or sub attributes such as a combination of job code and compensation level.

The method may further include providing a second user option to adjust the node appearance criterion in accordance with a second data attribute and then visually encoding the second data attribute by adjusting a luminosity of each node based on the second data attribute.

The method may further include sorting each node in each of the one or more sections according to a third criterion. A user option to adjust the third criterion in accordance with a third data attribute may facilitate visually encoding the third data attribute by a node sort order in response thereto. The node sort order may for example be based on a performance evaluation metric associated with persons represented by nodes and so on. Alternatively the node sort order may be alphabetical based on names of persons represented nodes may be a predetermined default sort order and so on.

The step of adjusting a luminance also called luminosity herein of each node may include adjusting a translucence or transparency of each node based on an attribute specified via the node appearance criterion. In this case the second attribute is said to be visually encoded in accordance with variations in transparency of each node. The transparency or translucence of each node may be proportional to a value characterizing the second attribute for each node.

The step of adjusting a luminance of each node may include adjusting a luminance of each node relative to a maximum and minimum luminance value of displayed nodes. This may be equivalent to adjusting node contrast in accordance with the node appearance criterion.

The step of adjusting a luminance of each node may alternatively include generating an oscillation in luminance of each node when a value of a node as specified via the node appearance criterion surpasses a threshold. This effectively results in node flickering when a value of an attribute of the node as specified via the node appearance criterion surpasses a threshold value. The threshold value may be a default value or may be user specified.

The method may further include adjusting dimensions of each section such that each section is rectangular and then arranging different sections so that total white space between adjacent sections is minimized and so that the different sections fit within a fixed width assigned to the visualization. A vertical scroll bar may facilitate viewing visualization sections that do not initially fit within a display area of a computer display.

User adjustment to the grouping criterion may trigger re sectioning of nodes in accordance with one or more data attributes specified via the grouping criterion. The grouping criterion may include a specification of plural data attributes.

Various additional user options may be provided such as a user option to select one or more rectangular visualization sections to facilitate triggering an action based on a selected visualization section. Example actions include drilling down rolling up triggering generation and display of a cross tabular report for data contained in the selected visualization section and so on.

Hence certain embodiments discussed herein provide efficient and illustrative ways to visualize large data sets characterized by potentially thousands of data elements to thereby facilitate uncovering patterns without having to aggregate data into summary nodes. Very granular enterprise data can be efficiently illustrated via many nodes which need not represent summarized data from plural data objects. This is facilitated in part by enabling representing data elements as single pixel nodes and then varying node luminosity or translucence as a function of e.g. in proportion to a data attribute associated with a node to thereby visually encode the data attribute. Any inherent data patterns may be accentuated by enabling further grouping of nodes based on another attribute.

A further understanding of the nature and the advantages of particular embodiments disclosed herein may be realized by reference of the remaining portions of the specification and the attached drawings.

For the purposes of the present discussion information visualization may be any process involving graphically representing data according to a method or scheme. A graphical representation of data resulting from an information visualization technique is called a visualization. Example visualizations include pie charts treemaps bar charts line graphs and so on.

An object such as a data object may be any grouping of or encapsulation of data and or functionality. Examples of objects include classes or structures implemented via object oriented programming languages tables rows columns fields or records of a database and so on. An object may include a single item or instance of data such as a number or other descriptor or attribute or the object may include plural instances of data and or functionality e.g. software methods such as functions or function calls and may further include sub objects.

A representation of an object i.e. a displayed object may be displayed via graphical depiction such as a node of a visualization a menu item dialog box personnel icon and so on. The graphical depiction of an object may also be called an object a displayed object or a node.

Generally a node may be any graphical representation of an object in a visualization. Note that certain nodes may include sub nodes just as an object may include or represent additional objects i.e. sub objects. In certain embodiments discussed herein nodes may be as small as a single pixel of a display screen.

For the purposes of the present discussion a data attribute also simply called attribute herein may be any value or property characterizing data. Accordingly an attribute of a visualization node or associated data may refer to any characteristic of data used to generate a visualization where the characteristic may be employed to group or otherwise organize or visually distinguish the data by adjusting features or characteristics of the visualization. Examples of attributes include data dimensions or layers such as specified by row or column headers of tables used to store the data used for a visualization.

For the purposes of the present discussion visual encoding also simply called encoding or coding herein of a data attribute may be any process involving representing the data attribute graphically. For example if a hierarchical position of a node in an enterprise organizational chart is used to adjust a size shape color or position etc. of the node in a visualization the hierarchical position is said to be visually encoded via the node size shape color or position respectively.

In various embodiments discussed herein to facilitate conveying information visual properties of a node can be varied in accordance with a data attribute also simply called attribute herein characterizing the underlying object i.e. data thereby visually encoding the attribute. For example if each node of a visualization is characterized by a performance value the luminosity or brightness of each node may be scaled as a function e.g. a linear function of the performance value associated with the node.

Similarly a visualization may be sectioned such that each section contains nodes fitting specified criteria. The criteria may be specified via one or more attributes such that nodes sharing similar specified attributes or combinations of attributes are grouped into a given section. Note however that methods for categorizing nodes for grouping and or visualization sectioning purposes are not limited to grouping of nodes based solely on whether nodes are characterized by similar attributes or combinations thereof. For example node grouping or sectioning criteria may include specified ranges for different attributes represented by values such that nodes characterized by attributes within a similar range are grouped together.

For the purposes of the present discussion an enterprise may be any organization of persons such as a business university government military and so on. The terms organization and enterprise are employed interchangeably herein. Personnel of an organization i.e. enterprise personnel may include any persons associated with the organization such as employees contractors board members customer contacts and so on.

ERP software may be any set of computer code that is used by an enterprise or organization. Examples of enterprise software classifications include HCM Human Capital Management software CRM Customer Relationship Management software BI Business Intelligence software and so on. Examples of ERP software applications include Financials Assets Procurement Projects Supply Chain and so on. The terms ERP software and ERP application may be employed interchangeably herein.

Enterprise software applications such as Customer Relationship Management CRM Business Intelligence BI Enterprise Resource Planning ERP and project management software often include databases with various database objects also called data objects or entities. An enterprise application that includes or communicates with a database is called an enterprise database application herein.

Enterprise data may be any information pertaining to an organization or business including information about projects tasks resources orders enterprise personnel and so on. Examples of enterprise data include descriptions of work orders asset descriptions photographs contact information calendar information enterprise hierarchy information e.g. corporate organizational chart information and so on.

For clarity certain well known components such as hard drives processors operating systems power supplies routers Internet Service Providers ISPs and so on have been omitted from the figures. However those skilled in the art with access to the present teachings will know which components to implement and how to implement them to meet the needs of a given implementation.

For the purposes of the present discussion an enterprise computing environment may be any computing environment used for a business or organization. A computing environment may be any collection of computing resources used to perform one or more tasks involving computer processing. An example enterprise computing environment includes various computing resources distributed across a network and may further include private and shared content on Intranet Web servers databases files on local hard discs or file servers email systems document management systems portals and so on.

The example system includes a mobile computing device in communication with an Enterprise Resource Planning ERP server system via a network such as the Internet. The ERP system includes various databases which store database objects .

Server side software such as web services Application Programming Interfaces APIs and so on may communicate with the database objects to selectively employ data thereby such as to facilitate implementation of various software applications which may include server side and client side software applications. Generally server side implementations involve running applications on the ERP server in response to a request from a client such as the mobile computing device . The server side application may then send data and or instructions back to the client device . In client side implementations software may be downloaded to the mobile computing device and executed locally on the device .

The example ERP server system includes an administrator user interface which may include hardware and software functionality for enabling an administrator to make changes to various components of the ERP server system such a settings installed software and so on.

The mobile computing device represents an example client device that communicates with server side visualization software . Note that client devices other than mobile computing devices may be employed without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

The mobile computing device employs a relatively small touch screen also simply called a display herein in communication with Graphical User Interface GUI software which is adapted to facilitate displaying one or more visualizations via the touch screen . The GUI software may be any software application or component such as a spread sheet program graphing software and so on that is adapted to facilitate displaying graphical user interface features and or data such as graphs menu items dialog boxes and so on.

The example GUI software includes a controller in communication with a visualization generator a visualization actions module and a visualization operations module . The controller includes computer code for coordinating inputs and outputs to and from the modules and interfacing the GUI software and accompanying modules with the server side visualization software .

In an example operative scenario a user employs the mobile computing device to browse to a website hosted by the ERP server system which provides access to the server side visualization software and accompanying database objects . The controller may facilitate downloading database objects from the ERP server system and server side visualization software for use in constructing a visualization to be displayed via the touch screen .

In the present example operative scenario the GUI software selectively downloads database objects from the ERP server system . The visualization generator then employs client side visualization generating software to construct one or more visualizations in accordance with instructions included in the controller and input from the touch screen .

Initial or default methods and algorithms for organizing nodes into sections based on a grouping criteria packing nodes into individual sections sorting nodes within a section determining node luminosity translucence and or other visual characteristics and generally for encoding any data attributes e.g. attributes of the database objects via node characteristics e.g. node size color shape and so on may be initially determined by the GUI software . Much or all of this processing may be performed server side e.g. via the server side visualization software . The client side software may be substantially used for UI rendering and user interaction management. Furthermore actions such as setting luminosity packing sections and so on may be substantially performed server side e.g. via the server side visualization software .

The controller may facilitate implementing GUI components and user interface controls to provide user options to adjust attribute encoding as discussed more fully below. Alternatively or in addition attributes i.e. attributes of data used to generate a visualization are automatically encoded such as in accordance with space constraints inherent in a display numbers of nodes to be illustrated and so on.

Key functionality for adjusting displayed characteristics of a visualization may be included in various functions e.g. a SetLuminosity and PackSections function of the server side visualization software API . The example functions may be called remotely via the generator and controller as needed in response to certain user input or automatically in accordance with instructions included in the controller . Alternatively the functions may be downloaded to the mobile computing device and run client side.

Note that the server side visualization software may include additional functionality other than that represented by the example functions . For example functions for facilitating sorting nodes in a section for sectioning a visualization based on user defined or automatically determined attributes or combinations of attributes as specified by grouping criteria and so on as discussed more fully below. Those skilled in the art with access to the present teachings may readily develop software to implement functionality discussed herein to meet the needs of a given implementation without undue experimentation.

The example PackSections function of the server side software may employ a 2 dimensional packing algorithm with code for packing sections squares rectangles within the larger rectangular display area which includes the entire visualization . Additional code may be employed to pack nodes of a given group or category into rectangles with sufficient dimensions to fit all of the nodes of the given group within boundaries of a rectangle leaving no whitespace within the rectangle. Note that for the purposes of the present discussion a rectangle may be any quadrilateral shape characterize by four right angles. Hence a square is considered to be a type of rectangle herein.

The PackSections function may further include computer code for sorting nodes in each section of a visualization. When packing nodes in a section the nodes may initially be arranged in a default sorting order e.g. alphabetical by last name of persons represented by or corresponding to nodes. In certain implementations nodes are not specifically sorted based on data attributes but instead are randomly or pseudo randomly distributed within a section. User options for adjusting node sort order visualization sectioning criteria node appearance criteria and so on may be provided via the GUI software and or the server side visualization software as discussed more fully below.

Note that while the example GUI software is shown included in the mobile computing device implementations are not limited thereto. For example the GUI software may be incorporated into the server side visualization software and run on the server as a server side application. The server side application may be run server side and viewed client side via browser software running on the mobile computing device .

In the present example embodiment various GUI modules include computer code for implementing functionality for adjusting how a visualization is displayed via the touch screen . Example operations which may be implemented in part via the operations module include adjusting attribute encoding performing filtering operations adjusting node transparency luminosity contrast and so on.

For the purposes of the present discussion a software action also simply called action herein may be any process or collection of processes implemented via software. Example processes implemented via the visualization actions module include triggering display of additional details of a data object represented via a node of the visualization i.e. implementing drill down operations in response to certain user input such as a tap gesture applied to a displayed section or node drilling down to cause display of additional detail associated with a section of a visualization zooming in on a particular portion of a visualization triggering generation and display of a cross tabular report illustrating data underlying a particular section of a visualization updating or editing data in a database changing types of or characteristics of displayed visualizations launching another ERP software application and so on.

For the purposes of the present discussion a user interface control may be any displayed element or component of a user interface display screen which is adapted to enable a user to provide input view data and or otherwise interact with a user interface. Additional examples of user interface controls include buttons drop down menus menu items tap and hold functionality and so on. Similarly a user interface control signal may be any signal that is provided as input for software wherein the input affects a user interface display screen and or accompanying software application associated with the software.

The user interface display screen includes a node criteria section with an analysis entity drop down menu and an analysis attribute drop down menu . The analysis entity drop down menu provides user options for selecting an analysis entity which may be employed by underlying software to select an applicable data source from which to retrieve data used to construct the visualization . In the present example embodiment a user has selected Employee Compensation as the analysis entity.

The analysis attribute drop down menu provides user options for selecting an analysis attribute associated with employee compensation data specified via the analysis entity drop down menu . Note that when a user selects an analysis entity from the analysis entity drop down menu available options in the analysis attribute drop down menu may change in accordance with available attributes employable to characterize employee compensation data.

In the present example embodiment a user has employed the analysis attribute drop down menu to select Industry Compensation Ratio as the analysis attribute. The industry compensation ratio for a given data object used to represent a visualization node may be defined in underlying software to represent a ratio between a compensation amount of a given employee working in a given industry divided by an average industry compensation value for employees with the same similar job role.

User selections made via the analysis entity drop down menu and the analysis attribute drop down menu represent specifications of node criteria since the selections determine what data objects are represented by individual nodes of the visualization and further determine what values e.g. industry compensation ratios are to be visually encoded in the visualization . In the present specific embodiment luminosity values of various nodes of the visualization are adjusted in proportion to associated industry compensation ratios.

For the purposes of the present discussion node luminosity also called node luminance herein may be any measure of an amount of optical energy emitted per unit area per unit time of a region on the display. Accordingly a dark spot on a screen which emits little or no light is characterized by a lower luminosity than a white spot which emits white light.

Luminosity of a pixel or set of pixels representing a node may be adjusted by making adjustments to pixel brightness. The term brightness may refer to perceived luminosity as opposed to actual luminosity. However perceived luminosity may scale according to actual luminosity. Accordingly brightness and luminosity are employed interchangeably herein.

Relative luminosity between different regions or pixels may be adjusted by making adjustments to contrast. Contrast may be any measure of a difference in luminance and or color that makes an object or its representation in an image or display e.g. a node distinguishable from other features or components of a visualization. Contrast may be determined by the difference in the color and brightness between displayed nodes.

The example user interface display screen further includes a filtering criteria section which includes a division drop down menu and a geography drop down menu . In the present example embodiment a user has selected Research and Development R D from the division drop down menu resulting in limiting displayed nodes to only nodes representing or corresponding to employees working in an R D department.

Similarly a user has selected North America from the geography drop down menu thereby further limiting displayed nodes to only nodes characterized by a geography attribute indicating that the associated employee works in North America. Hence in the present example embodiment user specification of filtering criteria involves user specification of attributes associated with nodes.

The example user interface display screen further includes a visualization section grouping criteria section which includes various user interface controls for specifying attributes used to group nodes of the visualization . A first attribute drop down menu a second attribute drop down menu and a third attribute drop down menu enable users to select combinations of attributes for categorizing and grouping nodes. For example if three different attributes are selected from the attribute drop down menus then nodes sharing all three attributes will be grouped into a similar section nodes sharing only the first attribute will be grouped into another similar section nodes sharing only the first two attributes will be grouped into another similar section and so on. Accordingly the visualization will be sectioned such that nodes in a given section share a similar combination of shared attributes.

The section grouping criteria section further includes an automatic grouping checkbox and accompanying radio button options. During automatic grouping underlying software automatically selects combinations of attributes from available attributes to yield visualization sections such that one or more of the visualization sections will meet certain criteria or conditions. For example a combination of attributes may be automatically selected such that the resulting sectioned visualization will exhibit a section with the maximum relative to other attribute combinations number or density of co located dark nodes in a given section.

A user may employ radio buttons accompanying the automatic grouping checkbox to specify whether automatic selection of grouping attributes is determined based upon a maximum number or density of co located dark nodes or a maximum number of co located dark nodes. Alternatively the underlying software automatically determines whether to select attributes based on density or number of co located dark nodes i.e. least luminous nodes. The term least luminous may mean all nodes characterized by luminosity transparency or brightness values below a given threshold where the threshold may be automatically set to a default value or user specified.

A user may specify criteria for determining whether a particular node is considered dark or not by selecting a set darkness threshold button . User selection of the set darkness threshold button may trigger display of an additional user interface display screen dialog box or menu with user interface controls for enabling a user to specify a range of luminosity values or translucence values which are considered dark. Alternatively the set darkness threshold button may be replaced with a slider bar that may be adjusted to thereby adjust the threshold s .

In an example operative scenario when a user selects the automatic grouping checkbox the attribute drop down menus may be updated to show the automatically selected combination of attributes.

A node sorting criteria section includes a first sorting attribute drop down menu which provides user options for specifying how individual nodes should be sorted within a given visualization section. If a user has not specified a sorting criterion via the first sorting attribute drop down menu the underlying software may choose a default sorting attribute i.e. criterion.

After user selections are made via the various user interface controls user selection of a draw button may result in updating of the visualization based on the selections.

In the present example embodiment the resulting visualization includes one section since no grouping attributes were selected representing employee nodes of a research and development department in North America. Node luminosity is varied in proportion to industry compensation ratio associated with each node thereby resulting in dark nodes characterized by the lowest industry compensation ratios and light i.e. luminous or bright nodes characterized by the highest industry compensation ratios.

Node contrast may be adjusted via contrast slider bar user interface control . For the purposes of the present discussion a slider user interface control may be any user interface control with a graphic that can be positioned or moved to change values or factors corresponding to positions of the graphic. A slider bar may be any movable graphic of a slider user interface control.

Note that while industry compensation ratio is visually encoded via node luminosity in the present example embodiment embodiments are not limited thereto. For example nodes other than employee compensation nodes may be shown and attributes other than industry compensation ratios may be visually encoded via mechanisms other than luminosity variations. For example variations in node translucence i.e. transparency may be employed to visually encode information pertaining to individual nodes without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

For the purposes of the present discussion the term translucence refers to the transparency of a pixel to monitor backlight or back illumination i.e. how much computer display backlight or individual pixel light can pass through the pixel and reach a user s eyes. Accordingly translucence may effectively be a measure of brightness or luminosity.

However note that image transparency as established e.g. via alpha compositing may represent a different type of transparency i.e. may represent perceived transparency of a first image relative to a second image that appears to be positioned behind the second image. Nevertheless either or both types of transparency values may be varied to encode information in visualizations discussed herein without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

Underlying software e.g. the GUI software of has then sectioned the visualization into various sections including an upper leftmost section . The upper leftmost section is characterized by a higher number and density of darks spots than other sections of the visualization.

Each section represents a collection of nodes sharing similar combinations of job code and location attributes. Furthermore nodes in each section including section are sorted by performance evaluation scores or metrics associated with employees represented by each node. The performance evaluation score sorting criteria i.e. attribute has been user selected via the first sorting attribute drop down menu .

The sections are packed in a limited display area via a packing algorithm that minimizes white space between sections . Different sections may have different dimensions depending upon the number of nodes in each section and depending upon a packing algorithm or function used to pack the nodes in a section. In certain implementations additional sections which do not fit within the horizontal display dimension allocated for the visualization may be viewed by actuating a vertical scroll bar .

In the present example embodiment each displayed node of the visualization represents an employee. The visualization which includes approximately 6400 four by four pixel nodes with sixteen pixels per node illustrates data pertaining to approximately 6400 employees. Note that each node may be represented by single pixel nodes or other numbers or dimensions of nodes without departing from the scope of the present teachings

Accordingly the visualization illustrates very granular data via methods that facilitate ascertaining patterns in the data. For the purposes of the present discussion granular data may represent a data element that is not representative of a summarization or a total of values derived from other data objects or other data elements. A data element may be any portion of data that is a most discrete unit of data contained in or associated with a given data object.

In an example operative scenario a user is interested in ratio of employee compensation to industry average for that employee s job code. The higher the ratio the more translucent and or brighter the point. The user might attempt to group or section nodes by various individual attributes or combinations of attributes available for the displayed nodes. Other example grouping attributes which may be available via the grouping attribute drop down menus include department cost center and so on.

When a user specifies a grouping attribute or combination of grouping attributes as criteria for sectioning the visualization underlying software may perform various steps including collecting all data objects for each visualization section i.e. each group of nodes to be included in each section based on the selected grouping attributes for each grouped set of data objects creating a square or rectangle closest to a square to accommodate nodes corresponding to the data object being grouped and drawing all of the squares and rectangles representing visualization sections on the display screen .

The underlying software will then pack the squares and rectangles i.e. sections in the allocated screen area with minimum whitespace. In implementations that exhibit whitespace in the visualization the screen area used for the sectioned visualization may be larger than that used for the un sectioned visualization e.g. the visualization of . Accordingly the underlying software may stretch the effective screen area vertically e.g. by providing the scroll bar while keeping the width constant allowing the user to scroll vertically to view all plotted data.

After sectioning of the visualization the visualization will illustrate grouped data represented via the visualization sections . A user may view the sections to ascertain data patterns or other phenomena of interest. For example the upper leftmost section illustrates a potential area of interest due to the visually distinguished distribution of dark nodes therein.

The first section may correspond to for example job code 001 for location San Francisco. In this case the visualization may draw the user s attention to San Francisco employees with job code 001. The distribution of dark nodes and light nodes in the upper leftmost section may imply that some employees are highly compensated and others much lower within the same job code. Furthermore the distribution anomaly is evident for a group of approximately 100 employees out of several thousands of employees. Such an anomaly could be very difficult to discern using any currently widely available enterprise data visualization software or methods which typically employ visualizations with nodes representing summarized or aggregated data.

Specifying further grouping criteria applicable to the section of interest may yield additional patterns and insight. For example in certain implementations as discussed more fully below user options may be provided to enable user selection of a visualization section and subsequent drill down zooming and or focusing operations. For example a new visualization may be created that only shows nodes pertaining to the section of interest . Additional grouping criteria node criteria and sorting criteria could be added to the resulting visualization to further facilitate revealing additional patterns anomalies characteristics and insight.

For example after converting the section of interest in a new visualization a user may further group or section the section by years of service in the enterprise. Doing so may reveal for example that the newly hired employees were able to command higher salaries initially but those with longer tenures have compensations that lag behind within the specified job code and location. This could be valuable insight that was otherwise not possible to obtain.

In addition the underlying software may include computer code enabling users to select one or more sections of the visualization and perform additional actions such as triggering generation of a tabular report for nodes in the selected section.

User options may also be provided for removing noise from underlying data by filtering out for example employees that received poor performance ratings or scores or for removing employees who rank below industry norms based on certain performance evaluation metrics and so on.

Actuation of the node slider control such as by dragging the accompanying slider bar to the left may reduce node sizes thereby enabling more sections to fit within the available area for the visualization . The underlying software may then redraw and repack sections of the visualization . If all sections can then fit within the available viewing area the slider bar control may be omitted. Alternatively scrolling is implemented via a touch gesture such as via a single finger upward or downward swipe on a region of the display screen coinciding with the visualization .

For the purposes of the present discussion touch input may be any input such as input via a gesture provided to a computing device via a touch sensitive display. A gesture may be any movement that involves motion to trigger a signal to control or otherwise affect a user interface display screen.

In the present example embodiment a user has employed a tap and hold touch gesture to activate a menu with various user options. The user options include a filtering option a node attribute encoding section a group attribute encoding section a zoom option a drill down option a create new section option a generate section report option and a select source data option.

The node attribute encoding section includes user options for specifying node luminosity criteria sparkle criteria color criteria and node size criteria. The group attribute encoding section includes user options for adding and or removing criteria e.g. by specifying or de specifying grouping attributes and a user option to trigger automatic grouping criteria selection and visualization sectioning.

Selection of a user option from the drop down menu may trigger display of an additional user interface display screen with additional user interface controls and input fields to enable users to set criteria choose additional options and so on. For example if a user selects a user option to activate a sparkle effect an additional user interface display screen may appear with options to specify ranges of industry compensation ratios e.g. by setting upper and or lower thresholds that should exhibit a sparkle effect.

A sparkle effect may be implemented by varying the luminosity color transparency or other characteristic of a node. The rate at which the luminosity or other visual characteristic of a node oscillates may also be user specified via a user interface display screen that appears in response to selection of the sparkle criteria user option of the drop down menu .

Hence node sparkle may refer to an oscillation in luminance of each node when a value of a node as specified via a node appearance criterion surpasses a threshold falls below a threshold or falls between specified thresholds. Generating oscillations in node luminance when a node appearance criterion e.g. node attribute surpasses a given threshold effectively results in node flickering when the value of an attribute of the node as specified via the node appearance criterion surpasses a threshold value. The threshold value may be a default value or may be user specified.

A subsequent attribute checking step includes determining whether node grouping attributes representing visualization sectioning criteria have been user specified. If a user has not specified node grouping attributes then control is passed to a data collecting step .

The data collecting step includes collecting a set of data i.e. dataset from a predetermined data source based on user specified filtering criteria and ordering data objects of the dataset based on a user specified node sorting order.

Subsequently a translucence calculating step includes calculating or otherwise determining a translucence or luminance value for each data object corresponding to a node based on one or more user specified key attribute values for the node and the lowest and highest values in the dataset.

Calculation of translucence values may be based on each data point s specified attribute value and the range of all values to be plotted. For the present employee compensation example the key attribute is ratio of employee compensation to industry average i.e. industry compensation ratio for that employee s job code. The translucence value may be between 0.00 and 1.00 where a translucence value of 1.00 represents a fully transparent node bright white point and 0.00 represents a completely opaque node black point .

For a specific employee with employee compensation ratio E the representative node also called data point herein the resulting translucence value may be defined as E L H L where L represents the lowest value for the industry compensation ratio among all displayed nodes and H represents the highest value industry compensation ratio among all displayed nodes .

Subsequently a node plotting step includes plotting nodes in a region of a display screen allocated for a visualization using the determined translucence or luminance value for each node. Subsequently control is passed to a subset checking step .

The subset checking step includes determining whether or not a user has selected a subset of data displayed via a visualization e.g. by selecting a section of a sectioned visualization or by specifying additional node attributes or criteria and whether or not a user has changed grouping criteria or attributes. If a user has selected a data subset or changed grouping attributes then control is passed back to the attribute checking step .

If the attribute checking step determines that a user has specified grouping attributes or criteria then control is passed to a second data collecting step .

The second data collecting step includes collecting a dataset based on user specified filtering criteria and then grouping the dataset into smaller grouped datasets corresponding to visualization sections based on a user specified combination of grouping attribute s . Subsequently control is passed to a second calculating step .

The second translucence calculating step is similar to the first translucence calculating step . Subsequently a visualization sectioning step is performed.

The visualization sectioning step includes for each grouped dataset constructing a rectangle visualization section that is closest to a square with data points nodes within the rectangle ordered in the user specified sorting order.

A subsequent packing step includes packing the rectangles for all grouped datasets into the rectangular display area screen keeping the width of the enclosing rectangle fixed the height variable and minimizing whitespace between rectangles.

Next a second plotting step includes plotting data points nodes within each rectangle visualization section using the determined translucence or luminance values for each node. Subsequently control is passed back to the subset checking step .

A second step includes categorizing the one or more objects based on a first criterion resulting in one or more groups of one or more categorized objects in response thereto.

A third step includes displaying representations of the one or more categorized objects as nodes of a visualization such that each node is positioned in a section of the visualization according to a group associated with the node resulting in one or more sections of nodes corresponding to the one or more groups.
