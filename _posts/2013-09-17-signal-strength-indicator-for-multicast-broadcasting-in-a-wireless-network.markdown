In an increasingly networked world more and more traffic such as data voice and video is transmitted over public and proprietary networks. Wireless networks in particular are becoming increasingly popular as networks through which subscribers obtain both voice services e.g. telephone calls and data services e.g. email and web surfing .

One class of mobile wireless devices such as smart phones and tablet e.g. pad computing devices may include mobile communication devices that are designed to provide additional functionality such as the ability to execute a variety of general purpose computing applications. Video related services in particular may be provided through these devices.

When providing content such as video content over a wireless network it may be important to intelligently deliver the content to the mobile devices to limit strain on the wireless network. One known technique of delivering content is known as multicast broadcasts in which a single channel may be used to broadcast content to multiple mobile devices. In contrast with a unicast transmission content transmitted to multiple mobile devices may require multiple channels that are each dedicated to a single mobile device.

With unicast the signal strength of the radio interface between the mobile device and the base station to which the mobile device is attached may be directly measured by the mobile device and the base station. Mobile devices may provide a visual indication e.g. an icon that displays a number of bars that indicates the signal strength. A user may use the visual indication to quickly determine the current quality of the radio connection of the mobile device.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

Techniques described herein may generate a signal quality metric that measures the quality of a multicast broadcast that is being received by a mobile device. The signal quality metric may be visually displayed by the mobile device such as through an icon that provides an indication of the signal strength of the multicast broadcast. For example the icon may provide a binary indication of whether the multicast signal strength is adequate or not adequate or provide a more fine grained indication of the signal strength e.g. an icon that indicates the signal strength of the multicast broadcast on a scale from zero to five .

The signal quality metric described herein may include a metric for a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service MBMS or an enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service eMBMS . The signal quality metric may be referred to as a Broadcast Signal Strength Indicator BSSI . In some implementations the BSSI for a mobile device may be determined based on a difference between a measured signal strength corresponding to the multicast broadcast as well as on a minimum signal strength threshold level. The minimum signal strength threshold level may be calculated by the mobile device based on a number of factors such as a multicast area associated with the mobile device a coding scheme that is being used to transmit the multicast transmission and other factors.

Network may provide for communications via a multicast broadcast. In a multicast broadcast a radio signal may be simultaneously transmitted by multiple base stations associated with network e.g. over multiple cells in a cellular wireless network . A number of mobile devices may receive the radio signal. In this manner content such as streaming video content may be simultaneously broadcast to multiple mobile devices over a single radio channel. Accordingly multicasting content can be a relatively efficient technique for using the radio spectrum associated with radio interface . From the point of view of mobile device an incoming multicast stream may be a one way stream where the mobile device may passively receive the stream but may not have an opportunity to provide feedback relating to the quality of the stream. In contrast in a unicast transmission between a single mobile device and network the mobile device and network may adjust aspects of the radio signal to maximize reception at the mobile device e.g. the signal power and or the encoding scheme may be adjusted to compensate for factors affecting the quality of the radio signal that are unique to the mobile device .

In assume that mobile device and potentially other mobile devices receives a multicast broadcast MC Broadcast from network . In this example the multicast broadcast may be a video stream of sports highlights. Mobile device may provide graphical interface which presents the video stream to the user of mobile device . Graphical interface may include icon that indicates the quality of the received radio signal that is associated with the multicast broadcast. In this example icon includes a textual icon MC which may be based on the BSSI that is calculated by mobile device . For example when the received radio signal is strong enough to receive the video stream with high certainty the strong BSSI may be represented as icon which may be shown as green text. However when the received radio signal is too weak to provide a quality video stream the weak BSSI may be represented as icon which may be shown as red text. In other implementations other visual indications may be provided to convey the quality of the multicast signal.

In some implementations the BSSI may be determined based on the strength of the multicast signal Measured MC Signal Strength as measured by mobile device . The measured multicast signal strength may be based on a signal to noise ratio SNR that is calculated by mobile device . Mobile device may modify the measured multicast signal strength value based on a number of other factors to obtain the final BSSI value. For example mobile device may determine a theoretical minimum signal strength value based on factors such as the geographical area of mobile device and factors relating to the encoding scheme that is being used for the multicast broadcast. The final BSSI calculated BSSI may be further based on a difference between the measured multicast signal strength and the theoretical minimum signal strength value. In some implementations the determined difference may be further modified by an offset value to obtain the final BSSI.

Using techniques described herein the BSSI as determined by mobile device may correspond to the user s perceived quality of the content that is received via the multicast broadcast. For example in the situation in which icon provides a binary indication of the quality of the multicast broadcast e.g. green for good quality and red for poor quality whether a multicast video stream can be received and presented may generally correspond to the representation of icon . In this example when icon is red the video stream may be of poor quality and or may be unwatchable. When icon is green however the video stream may be of good quality.

One or more additional networks such as a public packet network may connect to core wireless network . Content provider may include one or more devices such as content servers that deliver content e.g. streaming audio or video to mobile devices . The content from content provider may be delivered over RAN as multicast content.

Mobile devices may include portable computing and communication devices such as a personal digital assistant PDA a smart phone a cellular phone a laptop computer with connectivity to a cellular wireless network a tablet computer etc. Mobile devices may also include non portable computing devices such as desktop computers consumer or business appliances set top devices STDs or other devices that have the ability to connect to RAN . Mobile devices may connect through a radio link to RAN . Through the radio link mobile devices may obtain data and or voice services such as content delivery services via which content e.g. streaming video streaming audio or other content may be delivered to mobile devices .

RAN may include one or more devices that include radio interfaces to provide wireless connections to mobile devices . RAN may provide wireless connectivity for wireless network . RAN may include for example one or more base stations . Each base station may provide one or more radio interfaces over which the base station may communicate with mobile devices . The radio interfaces may include for example orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM and or single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA based radio interfaces. In the context of a network such as a long term evolution LTE network base stations may be referred to as evolved Node Bs eNodeBs .

Core wireless network may implement a network that provides routing control and data transmission services for mobile devices . Core wireless network may connect to one or more other networks such as to packet network to provide network services to mobile devices . Core wireless network may include one or more network devices used to implement control logic physical links and routing switching functions that may be performed by core wireless network . In one implementation core wireless network may implement an LTE network.

Packet network may include one or more packet networks such as an Internet Protocol IP based packet network. Public packet network may include a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN and or combinations of WANs and LANs. Mobile devices may access packet network to obtain computation and or data services from computing devices such as from content provider .

Content provider may include one or more server devices that provide content such as on demand video content to mobile devices . A content provider may for example be an entity that has the rights to provide television content other video content radio content etc. Content provider may provide content destined for mobile devices via packet network and wireless network . As mentioned above some of the content provided by content provider may be multicast to multiple user devices .

As shown in an eMBMS service may be implemented using broadcast multicast service center BMSC MBMS Gateway MBMS GW Mobility Management Entity device MME and Multi cell multicast Coordination Entity MCE . The eMBMS service may be provided to a number of wireless cells labeled as Cell A Cell B and Cell C. Each cell may be associated with a corresponding eNodeB .

BMSC may include one or more computation or communication devices that provide for the coordination of multicast using eMBMS. BMSC may perform functions relating to authorization charging and assignment of communication channels. For example BMSC may assign a particular number of multicast data channels for various multicast content streams. BMSC may also receive content such as from content provider . BMSC may forward the received content as part of a multicast transmission.

MBMS GW may include one or more computation or communication devices that provide for the coordination of the sending of multicast data e.g. IP multicast packets to base stations . MBMS GW may receive the content that is to be broadcast from BMSC . As illustrated MBMS GW may transmit eMBMS data plane traffic IP Multicast Data to eNodeBs .

MME may include one or more computation and communication devices that gather process search store and or provide information in a manner described herein. For example MME may perform operations relating to registering mobile devices with the LTE network the hand off mobile devices from to another network and to policing operations on traffic destined for and or received from mobile devices .

MCE may include one or more computation or communication devices that may perform admission control allocation of radio resources throughout a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service Single Frequency Network MBSFN area MBMS session control signaling and make decisions on radio configurations. As illustrated MCE may transmit eMBMS control plane traffic Control Plane to eNodeBs .

In eMBMS cells associated with eNodeBs may be grouped to obtain MBSFN areas. Multicast data channels in a MBSFN area may be synchronized so that identical multicast radio signals may be generated at the same time for multiple cells. For example MBSFN areas may be defined that cover the area associated with multiple ones of the illustrated cells. For example a first MBSFN area may correspond to the area covered by Cell A and Cell B. A multicast data channel transmitted in the first MBSFN area may include radio signals that are synchronized in Cell A and Cell B. A second MBSFN area may correspond to the area covered by Cell B and Cell C.

Although illustrate example components of environment in other implementations environment may contain fewer components different components differently arranged components or additional components than those depicted. Alternatively or additionally one or more components of environment may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of environment .

As illustrated in for a multicast broadcast a minimum threshold signal quality may be necessary to receive the multicast broadcast. When the signal quality falls below the threshold the broadcast content may no longer be receivable. As previously mentioned for a multicast broadcast receiving mobile devices may operate in a passive receiving mode in which feedback is not provided from mobile devices . In contrast to a unicast transmission for a multicast broadcast an eNodeB may transmit the data using a fixed modulation coding scheme MCS .

Consistent with aspects described herein the BSSI value which may correspond to an amount by which the corresponding signal strength is greater than the minimum threshold signal quality value illustrated in may be determined based on a number of factors. The determination of the BSSI will be described in more detail below.

Process may include determining a measured signal strength of the radio signal corresponding to a multicast broadcast block . The measured signal strength may be referred to herein as BSSI. For example mobile device may determine the SNR of the radio signal corresponding to each of the multicast broadcasts that are being received by mobile device . In one implementation mobile device may measure based on the received radio signal the SNR for each MBSFN that is available in the cell to which mobile device is attached. In other implementations different metrics or techniques can be used to measure the signal strength of the radio signal corresponding to the multicast broadcast.

Process may further include determining a minimum required signal strength block . The minimum required signal strength may be referred to herein as BSSI. BSSImay correspond to a minimum SNR value required to successfully receive and decode a multicast broadcast within a MBSFN area. In BSSImay generally correspond to the minimum threshold signal quality. In one implementation BSSImay be determined based on factors such as the particular MCS being used for the multicast broadcasts the symbol rate a parameter relating to how much information per unit of time is being transmitted with the MCS of the MCS being used and or the particular MBSFN. For example BSSImay be determined via query operation into a table or other data structure stored by mobile device . In another possible implementation BSSImay be determined based on a theoretical calculation performed based on the symbol rate and or the MCS being used.

Process may further include determining BSSI based on BSSIand based on the BSSI block . In one implementation BSSI may be obtained based on a comparison of BSSIand BSSI. For example when BSSIis above the measured BSSI value BSSI may be assigned a value that indicates that the multicast broadcast signal is not strong enough to receive multicast content. However when BSSIis below BSSI BSSI may be assigned a value that indicates that the multicast broadcast signal is strong enough to receive multicast content. As another example BSSI may be calculated as a continuous value that is based on the difference between BSSIand BSSI.

In some implementations other factors may additionally be used other than BSSI when determining BSSI. For example an offset value e.g. based on particular geographic features of the MBSFN of the mobile device may be applied to BSSIvalue to obtain a real world BSSI. The real world BSSIand BSSImay then be used to determine BSSI.

Process may further include providing BSSI as a visual indication block . As previously mentioned an icon may provide a binary indication of whether the multicast signal strength is adequate or not adequate or provide a more fine grained indication of the signal strength e.g. an icon that indicates the signal strength of the multicast broadcast on a scale from zero to five . In the situation in which the icon includes more than two visual states e.g. the non binary implementation the magnitude of the difference between BSSIand BSSImay be used to determine the strength of the multicast broadcast e.g. one bar may be shown when the difference is just above zero two bars when the difference is at least a certain amount above zero etc. .

As illustrated in mobile device may include application layer middleware layer and modem layer . Application layer may represent components of mobile device relating to the operation of user level applications for mobile device . For example a user may install a number of applications App1 and App2 on mobile device . The applications may provide video content that is received as a multicast broadcast. For example one of the applications e.g. App1 may be provided by a content provider associated with a professional sports league. This application may display streaming content transmitted as a multicast broadcast of live sporting events. Another one of the applications e.g. App2 may be provided by a news provider. This application may display streaming content transmitted as a multicast broadcast of current news stories. Each of the applications may potentially display an icon that indicates the quality of the multicast broadcast that is being provided by the application. In one implementation the icon may be based on a value of the BSSI for the video stream being received by the application. The application may receive the BSSI by for example querying an application programming interface provided by middleware layer . The application may then visually present the BSSI to the user such as via icon which displays a number of bars e.g. out of five to indicate signal quality or via another visual representation. In an alternative possible implementation instead of presenting a BSSI indicator to the user by applications associated with mobile device a BSSI indicator or indicators may be provided by an operating system of mobile device e.g. by middleware layer providing an indication of BSSI value s in a notification area of a graphical interface .

Middleware layer may include processes executed by mobile device at a level below application layer . For example middleware layer may include an operating system associated with mobile device . Middleware layer may provide an application programming interface to applications associated with application layer by which the applications can obtain BSSI value s associated with the multicast broadcasts to which mobile device participates. Through the API middleware layer may provide the BSSI value s to application layer BSSI formatted for Apps in a format suitable for the applications e.g. on a scale of one to five bars a binary indication of whether a multicast broadcast is strong enough to acceptably receive multicast broadcasts etc. .

Modem layer may include logic to manage the radio interface such as the radio interface used to connect to wireless network . For example modem layer may control the circuitry that implements the radio connection to wireless network .

Middleware layer and modem layer may include one or more components that may collectively determine the BSSI or the BSSI formatted for applications . As illustrated these components may include offset BSSItable BSSI conversion component summing component BSSItable and summing component .

In operation modem layer may measure or control the measuring of the signal strength of the radio signal corresponding to the multicast broadcast BSSI . As previously mentioned BSSImay correspond to the SNR of the radio signal of the multicast broadcast. Modem layer may additionally determine the minimum required signal strength BSSI. In one implementation and as illustrated BSSImay be obtained by looking up a value in BSSItable . BSSItable may include a multi dimensional table indexed by one or more of the MCS being used by the multicast broadcast the symbol rate being used by the multicast broadcast and or an identification of the MBSFN area associated with the multicast broadcast. The MCS and the symbol rate may be obtained for example from network such as over a control plane corresponding to the multicast broadcast.

In one implementation BSSItable may be implemented as a number of two dimensional tables relating the MCS and the symbol rate in which each of the two dimensional tables corresponds to a particular MBSFN. BSSItable may be stored at mobile device during manufacture provided to mobile device after provisioning of mobile device such as during a software upgrade or dynamically provided during operation of mobile device e.g. based on information in multicast overhead messages . In some implementations the values stored in BSSItable may be dynamically calculated by mobile device .

Referring back to the BSSIvalue obtained from BSSItable may be subtracted from BSSI by summing component to obtain BSSI Delta. BSSI Delta may be combined with the output of offset BSSItable by summing component .

In some situations real world issues such as fading and multi path interference may result in BSSInot adequately or optimally reflecting a theoretical minimum signal strength value that is required to obtain satisfactory multicast broadcast quality. The output of offset BSSItable may be an offset value used to effectively change BSSIto a more accurate value. In one implementation the offset value may vary in different services areas and the offset values may be determined through real world experimentation. In various implementations the offset values may be positive or negative numbers. Offset BSSItable may be stored at mobile device during manufacture provided to mobile device after provisioning of mobile device such as during a software upgrade or dynamically provided during operation of mobile device e.g. based on information in multicast overhead messages .

Referring back to the offset value obtained from offset BSSItable may be subtracted from BSSI Delta by summing component . The output of summing component may represent the value of the BSSI. In some implementations the BSSI may be converted by BSSI conversion component to a value that may more directly correspond to a visual presentation of the BSSI. For example as previously discussed the BSSI may be converted to an integer value between zero and five bars. Alternatively or additionally the BSSI may be converted to another format such as a binary value indicating that the multicast signal strength is adequate or not adequate.

One example of a conversion operation that may be performed by BSSI conversion component is illustrated in Table I. Table I includes example thresholds for performing quantization of a continuous BSSI value into discrete states e.g. zero through five bars . For example as shown in Table I a BSSI value corresponding to a SNR greater than or equal to 17 dB may be converted to a value of five bars. Another example of a conversion operation that may be performed by BSSI conversion component is illustrated in Table II. Table II includes example thresholds for performing quantization of a continuous BSSI value into binary states e.g. strong enough signal strength or not strong enough . For example as shown in Table II a BSSI value corresponding to a SNR greater than or equal to 2 dB may be converted to a value of multicast broadcast is available. 

As described above a signal strength metric BSSI may be determined for a multicast broadcast. The BSSI may provide an indication of the strength of the received multicast broadcast with respect to a minimum acceptable threshold level. The minimum acceptable threshold level may be determined based on both a theoretical determination of a minimum value and based on real world observations.
