This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 355 459 filed on Jan. 16 2009 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

This specification refers to the commonly owned U.S. Patent applications entitled ADDING NEW INSTANCES TO A STRUCTURED PRESENTATION U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 355 554 ADDING NEW ATTRIBUTES TO A STRUCTURED PRESENTATION U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 13 355 228 and EMBEDDING A CONCEALED SEARCH INTERFACE IN A STRUCTURED PRESENTATION U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 355 103 the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This specification relates to the population of a structured presentation with new values by retrieving and displaying information from an unstructured electronic document collection.

An electronic document is a collection of machine readable data. Electronic documents are generally individual files and are formatted in accordance with a defined format e.g. PDF TIFF HTML ASCII MS Word PCL PostScript or the like . Electronic documents can be electronically stored and disseminated. In some cases electronic documents include audio content visual content and other information as well as text and links to other electronic documents.

Electronic document can be collected into electronic document collections. Electronic document collections can either be unstructured or structured. The formatting of the documents in an unstructured electronic document collection is not constrained to conform with a predetermined structure and can evolve in often unforeseen ways. In other words the formatting of individual documents in an unstructured electronic document collection is neither restrictive nor permanent across the entire document collection. Further in an unstructured electronic document collection there are no mechanisms for ensuring that new documents adhere to a format or that changes to a format are applied to previously existing documents. Thus the documents in an unstructured electronic document collection cannot be expected to share a common structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. Examples of unstructured electronic document collections include the documents available on the Internet collections of resumes collections of journal articles and collections of news articles. Documents in some unstructured electronic document collections are not prohibited from including links to other documents inside and outside of the collection.

In contrast the documents in structured electronic document collections generally conform with formats that can be both restrictive and permanent. The formats imposed on documents in structured electronic document collections can be restrictive in that common formats are applied to all of the documents in the collections even when the applied formats are not completely appropriate. The formats can be permanent in that an upfront commitment to a particular format by the party who assembles the structured electronic document collection is generally required. Further users of the collections in particular programs that use the documents in the collection rely on the documents having the expected format. As a result format changes can be difficult to implement. Structured electronic document collections are best suited to applications where the information content lends itself to simple and stable categorizations. Thus the documents in a structured electronic document collection generally share a common structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. Examples of structured electronic document collections include databases that are organized and viewed through a database management system DBMS in accordance with hierarchical and relational data models as well as a collections of electronic documents that are created by a single entity for presenting information consistently. For example a collection of web pages that are provided by an online bookseller to present information about individual books can form a structured electronic document collection. As another example a collection of web pages that is created by server side scripts and viewed through an application server can form a structured electronic document collection. Thus one or more structured electronic document collections can each be a subset of an unstructured electronic document collection.

This specification describes technologies relating to retrieval and display of information from an unstructured electronic document collection for example the electronic documents available on the Internet. Although an electronic document collection may be unstructured the information content of the unstructured electronic document collection can be displayed in a structured presentation. In particular the information content of an unstructured electronic document collection can be used not only to determine the values of attributes but also to identify select and name attributes and instances in a structured presentation. Such structured presentations can present information in a coherent manner to a user despite the diversity in sources. Examples of structured presentations include tables and other collections of records.

In general one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in machine implemented methods that include the actions of receiving description data describing a preexisting structured presentation comparing characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with content of electronic documents in an unstructured collection of electronic documents to locate electronic documents that identify a new value that is relevant to the preexisting structured presentation adding the new value to the preexisting structured presentation to form a new structured presentation and outputting instructions for visually presenting the new structured presentation. A visual presentation of the preexisting structured presentation visually presenting information in an systematic arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in a visual presentation of the structured presentation.

This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. An identifier of a first instance that appears in the structured presentation in a first electronic document can be located and the new value can be extracted from the first electronic document. The adding of the new value can include identifying a collection of values of a first attribute of a first instance and establishing a subset of one or more of the identified values as suitably characterizing the first attribute of the first instance. Establishing the subset of values as suitable can include one or more of the following grouping the values in the collection into groups selecting the subset based at least in part on a count of values in the subset selecting the subset based at least in part on values in the subset meeting a user specified constraint selecting the subset based at least in part on a value in the subset being drawn from a high quality document selecting the subset based at least in part on a value in the subset being drawn from a document relevant to another instance in the preexisting structured presentation and selecting the subset based at least in part on a value in the subset being drawn from a document relevant to another attribute in the preexisting structured presentation.

The collection of electronic documents can be the Internet and the electronic documents can be web pages. The preexisting structured presentation can include a table or a collection of cards. The method can include visually presenting the new structured presentation on a display screen including physically transforming one or more elements of the display screen.

Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems apparatus and computer program products.

Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in an apparatus comprising one or more machine readable data storage media storing instructions operable to cause one or more data processing machines to perform operations. The operations can include receiving description data describing a first instance a second instance and a first attribute extracting a first collection of values of the first attribute of the first instance from two or more documents of an unstructured electronic document collection extracting a second collection of values of the first attribute of the second instance from two or more documents of the unstructured electronic document collection establishing a first subset of the first collection of values as suitably characterizing the first attribute of the first instance establishing a second subset of the second collection of values as suitably characterizing the first attribute of the second instance and generating machine readable instructions for displaying a structured presentation including a first value of the first subset and a second value of the second subset. The structured presentation denotes associations between instances and values that characterize attributes of the instanced by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values.

This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The first subset of values can be established as suitable by grouping the values in the first collection into groups wherein each group includes a subset of the first collection of values. The first subset of values can be established as suitable by selecting the first subset based at least in part on a count of values in the first subset. The first subset of values can be established as suitable by comparing the values in the first subset with a user specified constraint on the values.

The first subset of values can be established as suitable by determining that a value in the first subset is drawn from a high quality document. The first subset of values can be established as suitable by determining that a value in the first subset is drawn from a document relevant to the second instance. The first subset of values can be established as suitable by determining that a value in the first subset is drawn from a document relevant to another attribute that characterizes both the first instance and the second instance.

The description of the first instance can include an identifier of the first instance that appears in a preexisting structured presentation. The description of the second instance can include an identifier of the second instance that appears in the preexisting structured presentation. The description of the first attribute can include a description of a new attribute that is to be added to a preexisting structured presentation. The apparatus of claim wherein the unstructured electronic document collection can include electronic documents available on the Internet.

The structured presentation can be a table or a collection of cards. The structured presentation can be visually presented on a display screen including physically transforming one or more elements of the display screen.

Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes a device and one or more computers programmed to interact with the device and to perform operations. The operations include receiving description data describing a preexisting structured presentation comparing characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with content of electronic documents in an unstructured collection of electronic documents to locate electronic documents that identify a new value that is relevant to the preexisting structured presentation adding the new value to the preexisting structured presentation to form a new structured presentation and outputting instructions for visually presenting the new structured presentation to the device. A visual presentation of the preexisting structured presentation visually presents information in an systematic arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in a visual presentation of the structured presentation.

Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer program products apparatus and methods.

Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer program products apparatus and methods.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Electronic document collection is unstructured in that the organization of information within individual documents in electronic document collection need not conform with a predetermined structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. For example consider three electronic documents in electronic document collection namely electronic documents . Documents were added to collection by three different users who organize the content of their respective electronic documents differently. The users need not collaborate to ensure that information within documents is in a particular format. Moreover if one user wishes to change the format of document the user can do so without regard for the format of the documents added by the other users. There is no need for the user to inform the other users of the change. Indeed in some cases documents can be added to collection by entities who not only fail to collaborate but who are also competitors who are adverse to one another such as three different car manufacturers or three different sellers of digital cameras. Regardless of the particular alignment of the entities who add documents to collection no mechanism e.g. formatting software component or filtering software is associated with collection that ensures that the information in documents is similarly organized within the documents. Further no mechanism is associated with collection that ensures that the organization of information in each of each document in collection remains unchanged.

In contrast structured presentation is structured and presents information drawn from documents in collection in an organized systematic arrangement. Thus the grouping segmentation and arrangement of information in structured presentation conforms with a structured design even when the information in the presentation is drawn from different contexts in a diverse set of documents in collection . Further changes to any aspect of the design of structured presentation can be propagated throughout structured presentation .

Examples of structured presentations include spreadsheet tables collections of structured cards or other records and other structured presentation formats. Such structured presentations can also conform with rules that specify the spatial arrangement of information in the displays the positioning and identification of various organizational and informational aspects e.g. column headers row headers unit identifiers and the like of the structured presentations the graphical representation of values and other characteristics.

The structuring of information in structured presentations generally facilitates the understanding of the information by a viewer. For example a viewer can discern the nature of the information contained within the structured presentation by reading headers. A viewer of can easily identify and compare values presented in the structured presentation based on the arrangement and positioning of those values in the display. For example a user can easily ascertain that certain values in a structured presentation all relate to attributes i.e. characteristics of different cars and can easily compare those values.

System is not limited to merely populating structured presentation with values drawn from documents in collection . Instead in many implementations system can determine entities i.e. instances that are to be described in structured presentation values that characterize the attributes of those instances as well as an appropriate structuring of structured presentation . Such determinations can be based on information drawn from different documents in collection that are not restricted to having a specific format a permanent format or both. For example the attributes that appear in structured presentation can be based on the attributes used in documents in collection to characterize certain instances as discussed further below. As another example the units of the values e.g. meters feet inches miles that appear in structured presentation can be based on the units of the values that appear in documents in collection . As another example the instances that appear in structured presentation can be determined based on instances that appear in documents in collection .

Further in many implementations such information can be drawn from previously unspecified documents in collection . For example a search query can be used to identify documents in collection and the information can be drawn from these documents. There need not be preexisting limits on the identity or type of documents from which information can be drawn. For example the identified documents need not be limited to being associated with the account of a particular individual or originating from a particular retailer. Instead the information can be drawn from previously unspecified documents.

System can thus exploit the diverse information content of documents in collection in a variety of different ways to present a structured presentation to a user. In cases where electronic document collection includes a large number of documents the amount of information that can be exploited can be very large. Moreover in many cases this can be done automatically or with a relatively small amount of human interaction as discussed further below.

Search engine can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at one or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine readable instructions for searching unstructured electronic document collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of search engine .

Crawler can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at more or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine readable instructions for crawling unstructured electronic document collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of crawler .

Compressing indexing and ranking modules can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at more or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine readable instructions for compressing indexing and ranking documents in collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of compressing indexing and ranking modules . The data center stores information characterizing electronic documents in electronic document collection . The information characterizing such electronic documents can be stored in the form of an indexed database that includes indexed keywords and the locations of documents in collection where the keywords can be found. The indexed database can be formed e.g. by crawler .

In some implementations the information stored in data center can itself be organized to facilitate presentation of structured presentation to a user. For example information can be organized by crawler and compressing indexing and ranking modules in anticipation of the need to present structured presentations that are relevant to certain topics. The structure of information in data center can facilitate the grouping segmentation and arrangement of information in structured presentations . This organization can be based on a variety of different factors. For example an ontology can be used to organize information stored in data center . As another example a historical record of previous structured presentations can be used to organize information stored in data center . As another example the data tables described in this specification can be used to organize information stored in data center .

As shown system includes multiple display screens that can present structured presentations in accordance with machine readable instructions. Display screens can include e.g. cathode ray tubes CRT s light emitting diode LED screens liquid crystal displays LCD s gas plasma displays and the like. Display screens can be an integral part of a self contained data processing system such as a personal data assistant PDA a desktop computer or a mobile telephone. In general instructions for presenting structured presentations are modified to the particularities of a display screen after receipt by such a self contained data processing system. However this is not always the case. For example dDisplay screens can also be part of more disperse systems where the processing of instructions for presenting a structured presentation is completed before the instructions are received at display screen . For example display screens can be incorporated into dumb devices such as television sets or computer monitors that receive instructions for presenting structured presentation display instructions from a local or remote source.

In operation system can transform the unstructured information in collection into structured presentation which can be presented to a viewer. Such transformations can be performed in the context of web search in which a search engine receives and responds to information requests based on information extracted from the electronic documents in collection .

For example personal digital assistant PDA or desktop computer can interact with a user and thereby receive a search query e.g. by way of a web browser application. A description of the query can be transmitted over a wireless data link and or a wired data link to search engine . In response search engine can use query description to identify information in data center that can be used in presenting structured presentation on display screen . The identified information can be drawn from two or more unspecified electronic documents in unstructured electronic document collection . In some instances query description can include search terms that are used by search engine to retrieve information for presenting a structured presentation to a user. For example search terms in query description can be used to identify in data center a collection of related instances attributes that characterize such instances value that characterize the individual instances and or other aspects of structured presentation .

The search engine can also generate a response to query description . The response can be used to present structured presentation for a user. In general response includes machine readable instructions that can be interpreted by a data processing device in systems to present structured presentation . For example response can be coded in HTML to specify the characteristics and content of structured presentation . In other implementations response can include text snippets or other information from data center that is used in presenting structured presentation . For example response can include a collection of values the name of a new attribute or an estimate of the likelihood that a value to be displayed in structured presentation is correct as discussed further below.

In many cases system uses the information stored in data center to identify the location of one or more documents that are relevant to the query described in query description . For example search engine can compare the keywords in query description to an index of keywords stored in data center . The comparison can be used to identify documents in collection that are relevant to query description . The locations of such identified documents can be included in responses e.g. as a hyperlink to the documents that are that are responsive to the described query.

In some implementations the system can store attributes and or their respective values in a manner that facilitates the grouping segmentation and arrangement of information in structured presentations . For example collections of instances their attributes and their values can be stored in data center as structured presentations are amended and changed by users interacting with client systems such as systems . For example instances attributes and values in one structured presentation presented to a first viewer can be stored in the data center and used in providing subsequent structured presentations to other viewers.

The attributes of an instance can be characterized by values. The values of a particular attribute of a particular instance thus characterize that particular instance. For example the name of an individual can have the value Tom the population of a city can have the value 4 million and the model name of a product can have the value Wrangler. In some implementations structured presentations such as table can also include identifiers of attributes as well as identifiers of the units in which values are expressed.

The grouping segmentation and arrangement of information in table can be selected to facilitate understanding of the information by a user. In this regard table includes a collection of rows . Each row includes an instance identifier and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values and instance identifiers in rows thus graphically represents the associations between them. For example a user can discern the association between attribute values and the instance identifier that is found in the same row .

Table also includes a collection of columns . Each column includes an attribute identifier and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values and attribute identifier in columns thus graphically represent the associations between them. For example a user can discern the association between attribute values and the attribute identifier that is found in the same column based on their alignment.

Each row is a structured record in that each row associates a single instance identifier with a collection of associated attribute values . Further the arrangement and positioning used to denote these associations in one structured record is reproduced in other structured records i.e. in other rows . Indeed in many cases all of the structured records in a structured presentation are restricted to having the same arrangement and positioning of information. For example values of the attribute ATTR2 are restricted to appearing in the same column in all rows . As another example attribute identifiers all bear the same spatial relationship to the values appearing in the same column . Moreover changes to the arrangement and positioning of information in one structured record are generally propagated to other structured record in the structured presentation . For example if a new attribute value that characterizes a new attribute e.g. ATTR2 is added to one structured record then a new column is added to structured presentation so that the values of attribute ATTR2 of all instances can be added to structured presentation .

In some implementations values in table can be presented in certain units of measure. Examples of units of measure include feet yards inches miles seconds gallons liters degrees Celsius and the like. In some instances the units of measure in which values are presented are indicated by unit identifiers . Unit identifiers can appear e.g. beside values and or beside relevant attribute identifiers . The association between unit identifiers and the values whose units of measure are indicated is indicated to a viewer by such positioning. In many cases all of the values associated with a single attribute e.g. all of the values in a single column are restricted to being presented in the same unit of measure.

The information extracted from electronic document collection by systems can impact the presentation of table to a user in a variety of different ways. For example the information extracted from electronic document collection can be used to determine values for populating table . As another example the information extracted from electronic document collection can be used to suggest new attributes and or new instances for addition to table .

In some implementations instance identifiers can be selected based on one or more search strings. For example if the search string hybrid vehicles is received from a user by search engine systems such as system can generate and populate table based on information extracted from electronic document collection using the search string. For example system can access data center identify instance identifiers in the electronic documents that are relevant to the search string determine a set of common attributes for the identified instances as well as identifiers of those attributes and values for those attributes. In effect system can determine instance identifiers attribute identifiers as well as the associated values based on the received search string.

In some implementations one or more attribute identifiers instance identifiers and or values can be received from a user for whom table is to be displayed. As discussed further below systems such as system can generate and populate table based on information extracted from electronic document collection using one or more received attribute identifiers instance identifiers and or values . In effect system can formulate new instance identifiers attribute identifiers as well as the associated values based on the received attribute identifiers instance identifiers and or values .

Instance selection widgets are user interface components that allow a user to select structured records in table . For example instance selection widgets can be a collection of one or more clickable checkboxes that are associated with a particular structured record by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . Instance selection widgets are clickable in that a user can interact with widgets using a mouse e.g. hovering over the component and clicking a particular mouse button a stylus e.g. pressing a user interface component displayed on a touch screen with the stylus a keyboard or other input device to invoke the functionality provided by that component.

Action triggers are user interface components that allow a user to trigger the performance of an action on one or more structured records in table selected using instance selection widgets . For example action triggers can be clickable text phrases each of which can be used by a user to trigger an action described in the phrase. For example a keep and remove others action trigger triggers the removal of structured records that are not selected using instance selection widgets from the display of table . As another example a remove selected action trigger triggers the removal of structured records that are selected using instance selection widgets from the display of table . As yet another example a show on map action trigger triggers display of the position of structured records that are selected using instance selection widgets on a geographic map. For example if a selected instance is a car locations of car dealerships that sell the selected car can be displayed on a map. As another example if the selected instances are vacation destinations these destinations can be displayed on a map.

Column action trigger widgets are user interface components that allow a user to apply an action to all of the cells within a single column . When a user interacts with the clickable sign a further user interface component is displayed which offers to the user a set of possible actions to be performed. The actions in this set can include e.g. removing the entire column from the structured presentation or searching to find values for all the cells in column which are currently blank.

Notes column is a user interface component that allows a user to associate information with an instance identifier . In particular notes column includes one or more notes that are each associated with a structured record by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . The information content of notes is unrestricted in that unlike columns notes are not required to be values of any particular attribute. Instead the information in notes can characterize unrelated aspects of the instance identified in structured record .

In some implementations table can include additional information other than values of any particular attribute. For example table can include a collection of images that are associated with the instance identified in a structured record by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . As another example table can include a collection of text snippets extracted from electronic documents in collection . The sources of the snippets can be highly ranked results in searches conducted using instance identifiers as a search string. Text snippets are associated with the instance identified in a structured record by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record .

As another example table can include one or more hypertext links to individual electronic documents in collection . For example the linked documents can be highly ranked results in searches conducted using instance identifiers as a search string. As another example the linked documents can be source of a value that was extracted to populate table . In some instances interaction with hypertext link can trigger navigation to the source electronic document based on information embedded in hypertext link e.g. a web site address .

The grouping segmentation and arrangement of information in card collection can be selected to facilitate an understanding of the information by a user. In this regard card collection includes a collection of cards . Each card includes an instance identifier and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values and instance identifiers in cards thus graphically represents the associations between them. For example a user can discern the association between attribute values and the instance identifier that is found on the same card .

In the illustrated implementation cards in card collection also include a collection of attribute identifiers . Attribute identifiers are organized in a column and attribute values are organized in a column . Columns are positioned adjacent one another and aligned so that individual attribute identifiers are positioned next to the attribute value that characterizes that identified attribute. This positioning and arrangement allows a viewer to discern the association between attribute identifiers and the attribute values that characterize those attributes.

Each card is a structured record in that each card associates a single instance identifier with a collection of associated attribute values . Further the arrangement and positioning used to denote these associations in one card is reproduced in other cards . Indeed in many cases all of the cards are restricted to having the same arrangement and positioning of information. For example the value that characterizes the attribute ATTR1 is restricted to bearing the same spatial relationship to instance identifiers in all cards . As another example the order and positioning of attribute identifiers in all of the cards is the same.

Moreover changes to the arrangement and positioning of information in one card are generally propagated to other cards in card collection . For example if a new attribute value that characterizes a new attribute e.g. ATTR1 is inserted between the attribute values value11 and value21 in one card then the positioning of the corresponding attribute values in other cards is likewise changed.

In some implementations cards in card collection can include other features. For example cards can include interactive elements for interacting with a user such as instance selection widgets action triggers attribute selection widgets a notes entry and the like. As another example cards in card collection can include additional information other than values of any particular attribute such as images and or text snippets that are associated with an identified instance. As another example cards in card collection can include one or more hypertext links to individual electronic documents in collection . Such features can be associated with particular instances by virtue of appearing on a card that includes an instance identifier that identifies that instance.

During operation a viewer can interact with the system presenting card collection to change the display of one or more cards . For example a viewer can trigger the side by side display of two or more of the cards so that a comparison of the particular instances identified on those cards is facilitated. As another example a viewer can trigger a reordering of card an end to the display of a particular card or the like. As another example a viewer can trigger the selection change addition and or deletion of attributes and or instances displayed in cards . As yet another example a viewer can trigger a sorting of cards into multiple piles according to e.g. the values of an attribute values in the cards.

In some implementations cards will be displayed with two sides. For example a first side can include a graphic representation of the instance identified by instance identifier while a second side can include instance identifier and values . This can be useful for example if the user is searching for a particular card in the collection of cards allowing the user to identify the particular card with a cursory review of the graphical representations on the first side of the cards .

The system performing process can identify two or more responsive electronic documents in the electronic document collection step . The responsive documents can be identified in a number of different ways. In some instances documents are identified based on new information such as e.g. a new search query received from viewer. For example the system can compare a newly received search query with the content of the electronic documents in the electronic document collection using string comparisons. As another example the system can access a data center such as data center and compare the terms in a search query with an index of keywords to identify the location of responsive electronic documents.

In some instances documents are identified based on old information that is already found in a structured presentation. Among the information found in a structured presentation are the identities of instances attributes values and the units in which the values are represented. The system performing process can use this old information to identify responsive electronic documents in the electronic document collection. For example documents that include instances already found in a structured presentation can be identified as responsive. As another example documents that characterize instances using attributes already found in a structured presentation can be identified as responsive. Additional examples of such identifications are discussed further below.

The system performing process can also gather information from the identified electronic documents step . The gathered information can regard one or more instances attributes and or values. The system performing process can gather this information directly from the documents in an electronic document collection or from previously assembled collections of information that characterize the electronic documents in an electronic document collection. For example in the context of system the system performing process can locate documents in collection access the located documents and extract the information directly from the original documents in collection . As another example in the context of system the system performing process can access a collection of information in data center and gather the information from e.g. a database that includes an index of keywords and the location of documents that include those keywords an ontology and or a historical record of previous structured presentations that were presented using information extracted from documents in collection .

The system performing process can use the gathered information to provide instructions for presenting structured presentations based on the gathered information step . For example the system performing process can generate machine readable instructions for presenting a structured presentation such as tables or collection of cards .

The system performing process receives a search query step . For example the system can receive one or more search strings e.g. hybrid vehicles from a user. As another example the system can receive a search string from another process or system. In some implementations the search string is received through an application programming interface API a common gateway interface CGI script or other programming interfaces. In other implementations the search string is received through a web portal a web page or web site or the like.

In response the system performing process identifies two or more documents that contain instances attributes and or values that are responsive to the search query step . The documents can be identified by classifying the role that terms in the search query are to play in a structured presentation. For example the terms in a search query can be classified as a categorization of the instances that are to appear in a structured presentation based on e.g. the particular terms in the search query an express indication by the user as to how search query terms are to be classified and or the context of the search. By way of example the terms in a search query cities in California can be classified as a categorization of instances such as San Diego Los Angeles and Bakersfield due to the plural term cities being characterized by an attribute namely being in California. As another example the terms in a search query Ivy League schools can be classified as categorization of instances such as Cornell Columbia and Brown due to the plural term schools being characterized by an attribute Ivy League. 

In some cases additional information must be used to classify the terms in a search query. For example the search query Ivy League can reasonably be taken as a categorization of school instances or as an example instance of the category athletic conferences which includes instances such as Atlantic Coast Conference and PAC 10. In such cases the terms can be classified e.g. based on an express indication by the user as to how they are to be classified or based on the context of the terms in a search session. For example if a user had previously entered the phrases Atlantic Coast Conference and PAC 10 as search queries the search query Ivy League can be taken as an example instance that is to appear in a structured presentation alongside those other instances.

The documents can be identified either directly in electronic document collection or indirectly based on information in electronic data center . Such identifying information can include e.g. the URL where the document was found the last time it was crawled.

The system performing process receives a description of existing content of a structured presentation step . In particular the system can receive a description of the instances the attributes the values and or the units in which values are presented in an existing structured presentation. The description can include e.g. identifiers of the instances and the attributes and or ranges of the values of the attributes. The description can also include a categorization of the instances and or attributes. Such a categorization can be determined e.g. using an ontology or based on a categorization assigned by a viewer to a structured presentation. For example if a user entitles a structured presentation Ivy League Schools then this title can be taken as a categorization of the instances in that structured presentation.

In response the system performing process can identify one or more documents that contain instances attributes and or values that are relevant to the existing content step . For example the system can compare the identifiers of instances and or attributes to indexed keywords to determine if particular documents contain one or more of the instances and or attributes that already appear in the existing content of a structured presentation. As another example the system can identify new instances their attributes and the values of such attributes from such documents compare these values to values that already appear in the existing content of a structured presentation and determine whether the new instances are potentially relevant to the to the existing content of the structured presentation.

The documents can be identified either directly in electronic document collection or using identifying information in electronic data center . Such identifying information can include e.g. the memory location where the document was found the last time it was crawled.

System can populate all or only a fraction of structured presentation with attribute values. There are many circumstances in which only a fraction of a structured presentation may be populated with attribute values. For example the population may be part of the addition of new instances and hence new structured records to structured presentation . As another example the population may be part of the addition of new attributes to structured presentation . As yet another example the population may be part of the refinement of a fraction of the existing attribute values in structured presentation . For example some fraction of the original attribute values can be checked for accuracy or to ensure that the characterized instances haven t changed.

Structured data is a structured collection of information. The information in structured data can be organized in accordance with a defined data model. For example structured data can be organized in accordance with a hierarchical or a relational data model and stored in a data storage device. In some instances all or a portion of structured data can be presented to a user in a structured presentation. For example in some implementations structured data can be a pre existing structured presentation that is presented to a user on the same display screen on which the structured presentation that is populated with new attribute values drawn collection is to be presented.

Merge module is a collection of one or more sets of machine readable instructions deployed on one or more data processing devices. Merge module can include functionality for identifying new attribute values as well as their disposition within the structured presentation that is to be populated therewith. The operations performed by merge module are described in further detail below.

Attribute value instance collection is a collection of information that associates instances with their attributes as well as the values of those attributes. The information in collection can be extracted from electronic documents in collection either in response to receipt of a trigger such as a search query or in anticipation of receipt of a trigger e.g. as part of a process of indexing electronic document collection .

The association between instances attributes and their values can be established in collection by structuring the information storage within collection . For example is a schematic representation of a table that can associate attributes values and instances in collection . Table includes a collection of records each of which associates an identifier of an instance with descriptions of a document location and the attributes and values that characterize the identified instances. The information in records can be organized in a collection of columns . In particular column can include instance identifiers. Column can include a description of the location of an electronic document that includes the instance identified in column . Columns can include descriptions of attributes that both characterize the instances identified in column and that are themselves characterized by a value in the document whose location is described in column . Columns can include descriptions of the values that characterize the attributes described in columns of the instances identified in column in the documents whose location is described in column .

As shown different electronic documents can include different categories and amounts of information characterizing the same instance. For example the document whose location is identified in column of record includes information characterizing three attributes of an instance INSTANCE1 whereas the document whose location is identified in column of record includes information characterizing two attributes of an instance INSTANCE1. Moreover the attributes characterized in record i.e. attribute ATTR5 attribute ATTR6 attribute ATTR7 differ from the attributes characterized in record i.e. attribute ATTR3 attribute ATTR4. 

Further the values used to characterize even the same attribute of the same entity can differ in different electronic documents. For example the document whose location is identified in column of record includes a value VALUE3A characterizing the attribute ATTR3 of instance INSTANCE1 whereas the document whose location is identified in column of record includes a value VALUE3B characterizing the same attribute ATTR3 of the same instance INSTANCE1. 

There are a number of different potential sources of such discrepancies between the values that characterize the same attribute of the same entity in different documents. For example a document can include false information that mischaracterizes the attributes of an entity. In addition to inadvertent errors the values of an attribute may change over time. Examples of this include e.g. the value of the height attribute of a high school basketball player instance the value of a list price attribute of a house instance or the value of the mayor attribute of a city instance. Some documents may be updated with the correct value whereas other documents may retain the original but now incorrect value.

Moreover even completely accurate documents can characterize the same attribute of the same entity in different ways. For example different documents can use different units to express the same value. As another example different documents can express the same value with different precision e.g. about a two hour drive to Phoenix versus a 130 minute drive to Phoenix at the posted speed limits .

Such discrepancies are especially endemic in the context of an unstructured electronic document collection such as document collection . In this regard as discussed above different documents can be added to collection by different users who present information differently. The users who add the documents do not collaborate to ensure that information is presented in a consistent manner nor is there a formal mechanism for ensuring that the presentation of information in different documents remains unchanged.

Data collections that associate attributes values and instances e.g. table can be formed in a number of different ways. For example documents that include internal structured components can be identified. Examples of such internal structured components include tables and lists that appear in HTML documents and the like. The relationships between attributes values and instances in these internal structured components can be copied to form data collections .

As another example once a first document has been identified as including attributes values and or instances the template of that document can be used to extract attributes values and instances from other documents that include the same template. For example if a stereo retailer uses the same document template to describe different stereos that are offered for sale the arrangement of information in a first electronic document regarding a first stereo can be used to extract information from other electronic documents that regard other stereos.

As still another example the template of a single document can be used to extract attributes values and or instances from that document. For example the template can specify an arrangement of several attribute and values that characterize those attributes relative to an identifier of an instance. If some of those attributes and or values are known then the arrangement of those known attributes and or values can be identified and used to identify other attributes and or values.

For example the template of a single webpage may specify the arrangement of the attribute value pairs Director Orson Welles Writer Orson Welles Herman J. Mankiewicz and Release Date May 1 1941 relative to an identifier of the movie instance Citizen Kane. If the attributes and values Director Orson Welles and Release Date May 1 1941 were already known the arrangement of those attributes and values relative to the movie instance identifier Citizen Kane can be used to extrapolate the attribute value pair Writer Orson Welles Herman J. Mankiewicz. 

In some implementations techniques such as natural language parsing can be used to identify instances attributes and their values. For example electronic documents can be parsed to identify phrases such as Instance has a an attribute of value in electronic documents.

The system performing process can receive an instance identifier and an attribute identifier step . The system performing process can receive the instance identifier and the attribute identifier directly from a user e.g. in the form of a search query or indirectly e.g. as part of a structured data collection .

The system performing process can identify electronic documents relevant to the received instance that include values of the attribute step . For example the system can access an attribute value instance collection in a data center to identify the relevant electronic documents. As another example a search engine such as search engine can perform keyword searches using the instance and attribute identifier to identify relevant documents. In some cases such keyword searches can be supplemented with language parsing or other techniques that facilitate the identification of values.

The system performing process can establish a subset of the values for the identified attribute of the identified instance for presentation in a structured presentation step . The subset of the values can include one or more values that are thought to be appropriate or likely to be appropriate for populating the structured presentation. In particular the subset of the values s can be considered to characterize the identified attribute of identified instance both accurately and consistently with the desires of the viewer of the structured presentation. As discussed further below the desires of the viewer of the structured presentation can be ascertained e.g. based on a selection of a value received from the viewer or based on the characterization of the same or other attributes of the same or other instances in a preexisting structured collection of information such as e.g. structured data .

The system performing process can provide instructions for displaying structured presentation populated by the subset of values step . Thus a structured presentation can be presented based on information gathered from a collection of electronic documents i.e. the subset of values gathered from an electronic document collection step .

In some implementations process can be performed a number of times e.g. for a number of instance identifiers and or attribute identifiers.

The system performing process can group values of an attribute from two or more documents in an electronic document collection into two or more groups step . The grouped values can be drawn directly from the electronic documents or drawn from a description of the content of the electronic documents such as an association of attributes values and instances like table .

The system can group values using one or more different standards for determining when values are to be grouped. For example one standard can require that grouped values be identical. For example two values 4 can be grouped. Another standard can require that numerical values be within a certain range of being identical. For example the values 3.14 and 3.14159 can be grouped. Another standard can require that term values be identical or have an identical meaning. For example the terms czar czar and tsar can all be grouped. Another standard can require that term values express the same concept in an ontology of concepts. For example the terms pink and mauve can be grouped. Another standard allows values written in different formats to be grouped. For example the dates Jul. 25 1982 and Jul. 25 1982 can be grouped. Another standard allows values written in different units to be grouped. For example the units of measure 1 m and 100 cm can be grouped. Another standard allows values written in different formats to be grouped. For example the dates Jul. 25 1982 and Jul. 25 1982 can be grouped. Another standard allows values written in written in different but approximately equal units to be grouped. For example the units of measure 1 m and 39 inches can be grouped.

Using the grouping s the system performing process can perform one or more of the following subprocesses in any order to select one group and hence select a subset of the values from a collection of attribute values.

In a first subprocess the system performing process can select the group with the highest value for presentation in a structured presentation step . In some implementation the value of a group is reflects the count of values in that group. In statistical terminology the system performing process can select values with high frequencies in the electronic document collection. In effect this approach allows the documents in an electronic document collection to vote on the values of an attribute of an instance.

In other implementations the value of a group not only reflects the count of values but also weights or scores individual counts by parameters that reflect a characteristic of the document from which the values are drawn. For example a count can be weighted based on e.g. a page rank of the document from which the values are drawn a weighting factor for that document provided by a user the number of other values that have been drawn from that document or the age of the document. For example documents that have been created more recently can be considered to more accurately characterize the attributes of certain instances.

The approach of this subprocess is effective at eliminating inadvertent mischaracterizations of attributes e.g. when the value on one electronic document is a typographic error. However in isolation this approach can under certain circumstances select inappropriate values. For example even though a large number of documents characterizes a volume attribute in liters the viewer may be interested in having that attribute characterized in gallons in a structured presentation.

In a second subprocess the system performing process can receive a user specification of a constraint on e.g. a range of an acceptable value or a unit of an acceptable value step . For example the system can provide a GUI component at a display screen such as display that allows the user to select a range of values or a unit of measurement constraint. The constraint can be open ended e.g. a value 1 or closed e.g. a value between 1 and 10. .

After receiving the constraint the system performing process can select the group meeting the received constraint for presentation in a structured presentation step . For example if the user selects meters as the appropriate unit of measurement the system performing can select one or more groups of values that are expressed in meters.

The approach of this subprocess is effective at ensuring that the values presented in a structured presentation are presented in an organized systematic arrangement. For example the units of measure of the value used to characterize e.g. Michael Jordan s height can be constrained to be identical to the units of measure of the value used to characterize Magic Johnson s height. Such an organized systematic arrangement allows a user to compare values of the same attribute of different instances easily without concern as to units in which the values are presented.

In a third subprocess the system performing process can determine a quality of the documents from which the attribute values in each group were drawn step . The quality of a document can reflect the likelihood that the information in the document is accurate and does not mischaracterize a value of an attribute. For example commercial suppliers of goods generally provide accurate information regarding those goods. Hence the quality of information provided by a commercial supplier can be considered higher than the quality of information provided by an individual. As another example bias can be considered in determining the quality of the documents from which the information is drawn. For example information drawn from an allegedly independent source such as e.g. the Congressional Budget Office can be considered to be higher quality than information drawn from a political party.

As another example the quality of a document can be based on a specification of the quality of a source of the document or the document itself by a user. For example a user can indicate that automobile reliability information drawn from the Consumer Union the makers of Consumer Reports is high quality but that automobile reliability information drawn from Road and Track magazine is not. The system performing process can also select the group that includes values drawn from the highest quality document s step .

The approach of this subprocess is particularly effective in circumstances where the value of an attribute is the subject of debate. For example there are disagreements over a variety of values such as the true height of a collegiate point guard the best cheesesteak in Philadelphia and the number of stars awarded to a particular hotel. By allowing a viewer to specify the preferred high quality providers of values that characterize such attributes a structured presentation can be tailored to the expectations of the viewer.

As discussed above combinations of these and other activities can be performed in order to select one or more values for presentation in a structured presentation. For example all the groups of values that represent some percentage e.g. 10 of the total number of values can be selected in a first screening step and these groups can subsequently be further winnowed based on a unit specification step . The remaining groups can further be winnowed based on the quality of the documents from which the attribute values in each group were drawn step . Thus in some implementations process can provide one or more values from a remaining group that are free from mischaracterizations with consistent units of measurement and drawn from sources that the viewer prefers.

The system performing process can group values of an attribute extracted from two or more documents in an electronic document collection into two or more groups step . The system performing process can present descriptions of the groups of values to the user step . For example the system can display the most common value in each group or a list of the some of the values in each group to the user at a display such as at display screen . In some implementations the descriptions of the groups of values can include additional information that characterizes the groups. For example a number count of the number of values in each group can be displayed a percentage that reflects the percent of the extracted values that are found in each group can be displayed and or a description of the units of measure in the group can be displayed. As another example an estimate of the quality of the electronic documents from which the values in each group were extracted can be displayed. As yet another example the identity location and or snippets or other excerpts of documents from which the values in each group were extracted can be displayed.

In some implementations the descriptions of the groups of values are sorted in a confidence based ordering. That is the descriptions of the groups of values are ordered according to how confident the system performing process is as to the accuracy of the value s in each group. The confidence in the accuracy of the value s in each group can be determined based on e.g. the number of values in each group the quality of the documents from which the values were extracted and the like.

The system performing process can receive user selection of a desired group of values step . For example the system can receive user interaction that identifies a selection of a desired value group.

In some implementations the system performing process can also change other aspects of the structured presentation based on the user selection step . For example if a user selects a group of values with a unit of measurement in meters and there are other values that characterize the same attribute of other instances but that are presented with units of measurement in feet such values can be converted in the structured presentation to be presented in meters.

The system performing process can identify electronic documents in the electronic document collection that are relevant to the instances and other attributes in a structured data collection such as structured data collection step . As discussed above structured data collection can be a version of a structured presentation .

Documents that are relevant to the instances and other attributes in a structured data collection can be identified in a variety of ways. For example the system performing process can access a data collection that associates instances their attributes and values characterizing those attributes such as attribute value instance collection . Documents that include information relevant to the instances and other attributes in a structured data collection can be identified therein e.g. by comparing the identifiers of the instances and the attributes in both data collections. As another example the system performing process can use the identifiers of the instances and the attributes as search terms in one or more search queries. Such search queries alone or in conjunction with other extraction techniques such as language parsing and string comparisons can be used to identify relevant documents in an electronic document collection.

The system performing process can also select one or more values for presentation in a structured presentation from the identified documents step .

In the illustrated example the initial structured presentation has been modified to associate values of a new attribute i.e. the attribute AIRPORT with instances identified in the structured presentation. In particular a new column has been added to the initial structured presentation. Column is headed by an attribute identifier that identifies the new attribute using the term AIRPORT. The addition of values of a new attribute to the structured presentation can be triggered e.g. based on interaction with a user or automatically as discussed further in the disclosure entitled RETRIEVING AND DISPLAYING INFORMATION FROM AN UNSTRUCTURED ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT COLLECTION U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 355 228 .

A system such as search engine can access a data collection that associates attributes values and instances drawn from electronic documents in electronic document collection such as table . Using such a data collection the system can select one or more values that characterize the new attribute of one or more of the instances in the initial structured presentation. For example in the illustrated circumstance value i.e. the value value ai characterizes the attribute AIRPORT of the instance NEW YORK in the document DOC3. If necessary the system can select one or more values of the new attribute for display e.g. using one or more of processes .

After a value that characterizes the new attribute of one or more of the instances in the initial structured presentation has been selected a final structured presentation can be presented to a viewer. The final structured presentation can include the selected values that characterize the new attribute of one or more of the instances in the structured presentations. For example as shown value can be presented in final structured presentation to a viewer.

In process an initial structured data collection can include an preexisting structured presentation . The preexisting structured presentation can characterize instances using one or more attribute values e.g. such as the attribute values in column . New attributes that characterize the instances in preexisting structured presentation can be formulated based on the content of electronic documents in electronic document collection as described in the disclosure entitled ADDING NEW ATTRIBUTES TO A STRUCTURED PRESENTATION U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 355 607 . The new attributes can be added at step to preexisting structured presentation and appear as part of a structured presentation . New values of such attributes can be formulated based on the content of electronic documents in electronic document collection as described herein. The new values can be added at step to preexisting structured presentation and appear as part of a structured presentation . In particular in the illustrated example a new column can include an new attribute identifier namely attribute identifier that identifies the new attribute and a new collection of attribute values namely attribute values that characterize the new attribute. In effect the contents of preexisting structured presentation have been merged with content drawn from electronic document collection .
