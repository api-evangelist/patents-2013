The subject disclosure generally relates to a load protection bar and more specifically to a method and apparatus that facilitates a rigid positioning of such a bar between walls.

By way of background concerning conventional methods for stabilizing a load on a vehicle it is first noted that such loads are often heavy. If not properly stabilized these loads may thus undesirably slide behind a vehicle during transit and cause substantial damage to both the load and the vehicle. To this end although conventional load protection bars may adequately stabilize light loads such bars often lack the strength to stabilize heavier loads. Namely because conventional load protection bars lack a mechanism for rigidly positioning themselves against walls with enough strength to stabilize heavier loads such bars will simply slide off or break when a heavier load is pushed against it.

Accordingly it would be desirable to provide a methodology for stabilizing a load which overcomes these limitations. To this end it should be noted that the above described deficiencies are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.

A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended however as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.

In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure various non limiting aspects are described in connection with a rigid positioning of a load bearing bar between walls. In one such aspect load bearing bar apparatus is disclosed. Within such embodiment the load bearing bar apparatus comprises control shaft that includes a crank coupled to a gear assembly. The load bearing bar apparatus further comprises an extension screw coupled to the gear assembly such that the extension screw is configured to extend away from the control shaft when the crank is rotated in a first direction and toward the control shaft when the crank is rotated in a second direction counter to the first direction. The load bearing bar apparatus also comprise an extension shaft coupled to the control shaft via the extension screw such that the extension shaft is configured to extend away from the control shaft when the crank is rotated in the first direction and toward the control shaft when the crank is rotated in the second direction.

In another aspect a method to facilitate using a load bearing bar is provided which includes positioning a load bearing bar between a first surface and a second surface parallel to the first surface. For this particular embodiment a first end of the load bearing bar is oriented towards the first surface and a second end of the load bearing bar is oriented towards the second surface. The method also comprises rotating a crank portion of the load bearing bar to facilitate a first contact between the first end and the first surface and a second contact between the second end and the second surface. Here the rotating facilitates extending an extension shaft portion of the load bearing bar away from a control shaft portion of the load bearing bar when the crank portion is rotated in a first direction whereas the rotating facilitates inserting the extension shaft portion of the load bearing bar into the control shaft portion of the load bearing bar when the crank portion is rotated in a second direction counter to the first direction.

In a further aspect a load protection bar apparatus is disclosed. Within such embodiment the load protection bar apparatus includes a control shaft comprising a crank configured to rotate a gear assembly and an extension shaft coupled to the control shaft via an extension screw. Here the extension shaft is configured to extend away from the control shaft when the gear assembly is rotated in a first direction whereas the extension shaft is configured to retract toward the control shaft when the gear assembly is rotated in a second direction opposite to the first direction.

Other embodiments and various non limiting examples scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.

As discussed in the background conventional methods for stabilizing a load on a vehicle lack a mechanism for rigidly positioning themselves against walls with enough strength to stabilize heavier loads. The embodiments disclosed herein are directed towards overcoming such limitations via a heavy duty load bearing bar configured to expand against opposite facing walls with substantially more force than conventional bars. Namely a heavy duty load bearing bar is disclosed which utilizes a gear assembly to facilitate achieving such force via a crank configured to rotate the gear assembly.

Various exemplary non limiting embodiments directed towards a heavy duty load bearing bar are now disclosed. To this end it is noted that the embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive and that one of ordinary skill will appreciate that various undisclosed embodiments also fall within the scope and spirit of the instant invention.

Referring first to an exemplary load bearing bar is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated load bar may be configured to include a plurality of shafts such as base shaft control shaft and extendable shaft . Here although base shaft is included embodiments that exclude such component are also contemplated See e.g. . For this particular example however base shaft is further configured to include base end as shown wherein base end includes rigid layer sensor layer and pad layer . Similarly extendable shaft may be configured to include extendable end wherein extendable end includes rigid layer sensor layer and pad layer .

During use extendable shaft is configured to extend out from control shaft when crank is rotated. Namely as crank is rotated extendable shaft is extended so that extendable end approaches wall . Upon extendable end making contact with wall crank can then be further rotated to more rigidly affix load bar between wall and wall . Moreover as crank is further rotated the extension of extendable shaft causes extendable end to apply an increasing amount of pressure on wall wherein an increasing amount of pressure is similarly applied on wall via base end as well.

In order to accommodate for the forces applied to wall and wall each of extendable end and base end can be configured to include any of various specialized layers as shown. For instance rigid layer and or rigid layer can be made from a strong rigid material e.g. heavy duty steel capable of preserving the structural integrity of load bar as increased force is applied to wall and wall . A softer layer however might be desired for making contact with wall and wall such as pad layer and pad layer . Indeed so as to avoid damaging wall and wall pad layer and pad layer can be made from a soft sponge like material.

In another aspect it is noted that knowing the actual pressure force applied onto wall and wall may be desirable for various reasons. For instance it would be desirable to know whether a minimum threshold force has been reached e.g. to ensure that a load of a particular weight can be stabilized as well as whether a maximum threshold force has been reached e.g. to avoid excessive cranking which might damage a wall . In a particular embodiment it is thus contemplated that each of extendable end and base end can be further configured to include sensor layer and sensor layer as shown. Within such embodiment sensor layer and sensor layer are configured to respectively sense the pressure force applied onto wall and wall .

It should be appreciated that sensor layer and sensor layer may be configured to sense and or communicate such pressure force in any of a plurality of ways. For instance sensor layer and or sensor layer can be configured to include a computing device programmed to issue an alert when either of the aforementioned minimum maximum thresholds have been reached. Within such embodiment the computing device may be coupled to a pressure sensor configured to gauge pressure wherein qualitative and or quantitative data can be communicated. Qualitative communications may for example include configuring the computing device to emit a beeping sound when a minimum maximum threshold is reached. Alternatively the computing device may be configured to relay the alert to an auxiliary device e.g. a smartphone tablet etc. via a communication network e.g. via blue tooth short messaging service etc. . Quantitative communications may then for example include displaying actual pressure data by coupling the pressure sensor to a display device e.g. a liquid crystal display on load bar or relaying the quantitative data to an auxiliary device e.g. a smartphone tablet etc. via a communication network e.g. via blue tooth short messaging service etc. .

In another aspect it is noted loads stabilized by load bar may sometimes be fragile. Accordingly in order to mitigate potential damages any of base shaft control shaft and or extendable shaft can be configured to include an exterior padding layer. Contact between a load and any of base shaft control shaft and or extendable shaft will thus be cushioned by the exterior padding which could be particularly useful for fragile loads that might slide in the back of a vehicle during transit for example.

Referring next to an internal schematic of an exemplary unassembled load bearing bar is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated load bar may include a plurality of shafts such as base shaft control shaft and extendable shaft . Load bar may further comprise crank gear assembly and extension screw as shown wherein extension screw may further comprise insert . Here although gear assembly only shows two gears it should be appreciated that a gear assembly having any number of gears can be utilized as well as gears of various sizes.

In an internal schematic of an exemplary assembled load bearing bar is now provided according to an embodiment. To this end it should be noted that load bar illustrated in is substantially similar to load bar illustrated in . For instance load bar may again include a plurality of shafts such as base shaft control shaft and extendable shaft . As assembled crank is coupled to gear assembly as shown wherein rotating crank causes the gears in gear assembly to rotate. Namely for this particular embodiment while crank turns a first gear of gear assembly a second gear of gear assembly rotates extension screw . The rotation of extension screw then causes extendable shaft to extend as desired.

In another aspect it is contemplated that a load bar s dimensions may be customized to accommodate any of various applications. For instance on occasion it may be desirable utilize a load bearing bar having a circular shaped cross section as illustrated in . Indeed a load bearing bar with such dimensions may desirably serve as an impromptu garment rack between any two walls wherein the circular shaped cross section facilitates a hanging of conventional clothes hangers. For this particular embodiment each of control shaft and extendable shaft of load bar have a circular shaped cross section as shown. As mentioned previously although a base shaft may be included in some configurations embodiments which exclude such component are also contemplated. Load bar for instance excludes a base shaft wherein control shaft is coupled to base end on one end and coupled to extendable shaft on another end. Similar to the aforementioned embodiments however rotating crank causes extendable shaft to extend out from control shaft until extendable end and base end are securely affixed between two desired walls.

In yet another aspect it is contemplated that a load bearing bar having a square shaped cross section as illustrated in may also be desirable. For instance when storing transporting multiple load bearing bars such dimensions may desirably facilitate a horizontal stacking of bars on top of each other. For this particular embodiment each of control shaft and extendable shaft of load bar have a square shaped cross section as shown. Similar to load bar rotating crank causes extendable shaft to extend out from control shaft until extendable end and base end are securely affixed between two desired walls.

Referring next to exemplary uses of load bearing bars are provided in accordance with corresponding embodiments. In for example a vertical usage of a load bearing bar is illustrated whereas illustrates an exemplary horizontal usage. Namely in load bar is configured vertically to stabilize load behind vehicle whereas illustrates a horizontal configuration of load bar to stabilize load behind vehicle . To this end it should be noted that choosing between a vertical or horizontal usage may depend on any of various factors e.g. load configuration wall dimensions etc. .

The simultaneous use of multiple load bearing bars is also contemplated as illustrated in . In for example a vertical usage of multiple load bearing bars is illustrated whereas illustrates an exemplary horizontal usage of multiple bars. Specifically in load bar and load bar are configured vertically to stabilize load in a corner behind vehicle whereas illustrates a horizontal configuration of load bar and load bar to respectively stabilize load and load behind vehicle .

Referring next to a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method to facilitate utilizing a load bearing bar according to an embodiment is provided. As illustrated process includes a series of acts that may be performed according to an aspect of the subject specification. Process begins at act with the arrangement of a load. Here although such arrangement has been described with reference to vehicles it should be noted that the aspects disclosed herein may be utilized anywhere in which load stabilization is desired. It should be further noted that the arrangement performed at act may include any of various arrangements including for example the arrangement of a single load item e.g. the cornering of load illustrated in as well as the arrangement of multiple items e.g. the stacking of load and load illustrated in .

Once the load is properly arranged process then continues at act where the particularly desired configuration of the load bearing bar s is ascertained. Here it is again noted that such configuration may include a vertical and or horizontal configuration of a single load bearing bar or multiple load bearing bars. After deciding on a particular configuration the load bearing bar s is are perpendicularly positioned relative to the desired walls at act . Process then concludes at act with a cranking of the load bearing bar s until the load bearing bar s is are firmly affixed between the desired walls.
