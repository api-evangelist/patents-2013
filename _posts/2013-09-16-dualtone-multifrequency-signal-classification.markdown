title: Dual-tone multi-frequency signal classification
abstract: Various embodiments associated with signal classification are described. A repeating signal can be partially corrupted and therefore a receiver can obtain an incomplete signal. In one example, the incomplete signal can have discontinuous unobstructed segments. In order for the receiver to understand the contents of the signal, the receiver can identify repeated information in the discontinuous unobstructed segments. This repeated information can be processed to determine content of the signal. In one embodiment, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal. The receiver can process the content of the DTMF, such as by employing a set of high and low band pass filters, and can identify a high and low frequency of the DTMF. With the high and low frequencies identified, the receiver can access a look-up table and identify a character indicated by the high and low frequency. The receiver can then use or send out the identified character.

A transmitter can send out a communication signal. A receiver that receives the communication signal whether the receiver is a receiver intended by the transmitter or not can attempt to process the communication signal. However if at least some information about the communication signal is not known to the receiver then processing the communication signal can be difficult and ultimately it can be difficult to use the content of the communication signal.

A system is disclosed comprising a high frequency identification component configured to identify a high frequency of a dual tone multi frequency signal. The system also comprises a low frequency identification component configured to identify a low frequency of the dual tone multi frequency signal. The system further comprises a classification component configured to determine a classification of the dual tone multi frequency signal based at least in part on the high frequency and a low frequency. In addition the system comprises a non transitory computer readable medium configured to retain an information set that pertains to operation of the high frequency identification component the low frequency identification component the classification component or a combination thereof.

A system is disclosed comprising a high frequency identification component configured to identify and rank by likelihood potential high frequency values of a dual tone multi frequency signal. The system also comprises a low frequency identification component configured to identify and rank by likelihood potential low frequency values of the dual tone multi frequency signal. In addition the system comprises a classification component configured to produce a classification scheme of the dual tone multi frequency signal based at least in part on ranks of the potential high frequency values and based at least in part on ranks of the potential low frequency values. Further the system comprises a processor configured to execute at least one instruction that pertains to operation of the high frequency identification component the low frequency identification component the classification component or a combination thereof.

A system comprising a processor and a non transitory computer readable medium configured to store processor executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method is described. The method comprises identifying unobstructed segments of a dual tone multi frequency signal where the unobstructed segments are discontinuous from one another. In addition the method comprises identifying a high frequency of the dual tone multi frequency signal through use of the unobstructed segments. Also the method comprises identifying a low frequency of the dual tone multi frequency signal through use of the unobstructed segments. The method additionally comprises determining a classification of the dual tone multi frequency signal based at least in part on the high frequency and a low frequency.

A repeating signal can be partially corrupted and therefore a receiver that comprises hardware can obtain an incomplete signal. In one example the incomplete signal can have discontinuous unobstructed segments. In order for the receiver to understand the type of the signal the receiver can identify repeated information in the discontinuous unobstructed segments. This repeated information can be processed to determine the type of the signal.

In one embodiment the signal is a dual tone multi frequency DTMF signal. The receiver can process the content of the DTMF such as by employing a set of high and low band pass filters and can identify a high and low frequency of the DTMF. With the high and low frequencies identified the receiver can access a look up table and identify a character indicated by the high and low frequency. The receiver can then use or send out the identified character.

Aspects disclosed herein can be used in decoding the DTMF signal. A DTMF signal can be used in telephone signaling over a telephone line or other medium in a voice frequency band to a call switching center for signaling internal to a telephone network for cable television broadcasters to indicate start and stop times of local commercial insertion points during station breaks for the benefit of cable companies and other applications.

A DTMF signal can be decoded by a Goertzel algorithm and some DTMF receivers can reliably detect DTMF as short as 45 milliseconds for continuous signal. However when the signal transmitted in a strong fading or interfering environment the signal propagation is subjected to periodic obstructions. As a result only a few discontinuous segments of the signal each of a length such as and spaced seconds apart are usable at the receiver. When the time interval of the signal segment is much shorter than 45 milliseconds the DTMF tones may not be able to be decoded through use of the Goertzel algorithm and therefore other aspects can be practiced to recover the DTMF from the non continuous signal segments.

A DTMF signal x t can be described as cos 2 cos 2 1 where u is the low frequency chosen from 697 Hz 770 Hz 852 Hz and 941 Hz and v is the high frequency chosen from 1209 Hz 1336 Hz 1477 Hz and 1633 Hz a and b are amplitudes and and are initial phases.

In one embodiment the DTMF signal comprises a higher bandwidth and a lower bandwidth. The high frequency identification component can comprises a band pass filter at the higher bandwidth. Likewise the low frequency identification component can comprise a band pass filter at the lower bandwidth. The band pass filter can be software filters that employ mathematical equations to operate and or can be hardware filters that employ hardware parts to operate.

In one embodiment the DTMF has two frequencies the high frequency and the low frequency. The classification can be determined from these frequencies and the classification can correspond to a character of a keypad. In one example the classification component can employ a look up table to determine the classification.

In one example sixteen potential characters exist for the DTMF 0 9 A D and . Individual potential characters can correspond to different high and low frequencies and these frequencies can be identified by the following example look up table 

In one example of use of this example look up table the classification component can take the high frequency and low frequency and find the key where the key can be the classification. For example the low frequency identification component can identify the low frequency as 697 Hz while the high frequency identification component can identify the high frequency as 1633 Hz. Based on these two frequencies the classification component can determine that the DTMF signal is signifying a character of A and send an output that the character is A. 

In one example the low frequency and high frequency do not match up directly with values of the example look up table. In one example the low frequency can be 772 Hz and the high frequency can be 1625 Hz. Since these two frequencies are relatively close to 770 Hz and 1633 Hz the classification component can determine that the DTMF signal is signifying a character of B. 

In one example the low frequency and high frequency do not match up directly with values of the example look up table and are less close to actual values. For example the low frequency can be 900 Hz and the high frequency can be 1631 Hz. The classification component can determine that the classification is two potential classifications C since 900 Hz is relatively close to 852 Hz and D since 900 Hz is relatively close to 941 Hz yet neither 852 Hz nor 941 Hz are particularly close to 900 Hz. With this situation the classification can comprise two outcomes C and D. As part of the classification the classification component can include likelihood percentages on how likely C and D are to being correct such as C having a higher percentage than D since 941 Hz is closer to 900 Hz then 852 Hz is to 900 Hz. These likelihood percentages can be outputted as part of the classification. While this example shows that the low frequency is not particularly close to an actual value one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the high frequency can also not be particularly close independent of closeness of the low frequency e.g. just the high frequency is not particularly close or both the high and low frequencies are not particularly close .

The DTMF signal received by the reception component can have an obstructed portion and an unobstructed portion. The unobstructed portion can comprise a first signal segment and a second signal segment that are discontinuous. The content of the second signal segment can be coherent to content of the first signal segment.

Due to various factors such as interference and the quality of unobstructed segments of the DTMF signal the classification may be difficult to determine. Thus the confidence of the classification may also be relatively low. When the confidence is relatively low a device that uses the classification could potentially function with incorrect information. Therefore the system can function such that the classification is outputted e.g. made available to the device sent to the device etc. when the threshold is met e.g. threshold reached threshold exceeded etc. . When the threshold is not met an error message can be emitted e.g. a request sent to a transmitter to resend the DTMF signal a notice to the device that the classification is unknown etc. .

Returning to the example above with the discussion of the look up table can be used to identify content of the DTMF signal. As discussed the high frequency and or the low frequency can fall in between two frequencies of the look up table. The identification component can rank the likelihood of low candidate frequencies of the look up table 697 Hz 770 Hz 852 Hz and 941 Hz and high candidate frequencies of the look up table 1209 Hz 1336 Hz 1477 Hz and 1633 Hz . Based on these ranks the classification scheme can be determined and outputted.

In one example the low frequency can be 940 Hz and the high frequency can be 1420 Hz. The identification component can evaluate the low frequency and the high frequency against the look up table. Based on this the identification component can rank e.g. place in order assign likelihood percentages etc. the low frequency and the high frequency. In this example since the low frequency is almost equal to 941 Hz the identification component can order 940 Hz first with a high likelihood and 852 Hz 770 Hz and 697 Hz can be ranked as second third and fourth respectively with the low likelihoods. Since the high frequency is closer to 1477 Hz than 1336 Hz then 1477 Hz can be ranked first with 1336 Hz being ranked second 1209 Hz third and 1633 Hz fourth. However since the high frequency is not extremely close to 1336 Hz or 1477 Hz likelihood percentages of x and y can be assigned to 1336 Hz and 1477 Hz respectively. These likelihood percentages are numbers less than about 100 but greater than 0 . The reason y is greater than x is because 1420 Hz is closer to 1477 Hz than 1336 Hz. The classification component can access this information and determine the classification scheme from this information. In one example the classification scheme can be such that is a most likely character since the greatest percentages are for 941 Hz and 1477 Hz and that 0 is also a likely character since 941 Hz and 1336 Hz have high percentages. These characters can also be given percentages of likelihood e.g. y and x since they share the same low frequency . The classification scheme can include the most likely character characters that have likelihoods that meet a threshold a set number of characters characters with a likelihood greater than about 0 etc. The classification component can output the classification scheme to the device.

Returning to the example where the low frequency can be 940 Hz and the high frequency can be 1420 Hz. The selection component can select 941 Hz for the low frequency and 1477 Hz and 1336 Hz for the high frequencies. From what the selection component selects the classification component can produce the classification scheme that comprises with x and 0 with y and as such the classification scheme comprises likelihoods.

In one embodiment the unobstructed portion comprises a first signal segment and a second signal segment. In one embodiment the first signal segment and the second signal segment are discontinuous. In one embodiment content of the second signal segment is at least partially repetitive of content of the first signal segment.

In one embodiment the DTMF signal includes a higher bandwidth and a lower bandwidth. The high frequency identification component that is part of the identification component can comprise at least four high frequency filters corresponding to at least four potential high frequencies. In one example the high frequency filters can be a 1209 Hz filter a 1336 Hz filter a 1477 Hz filter and a 1633 Hz filter. The low frequency identification component comprises at least four low frequency filters corresponding to at least four potential low frequencies. In one example the low frequency can be a 697 Hz filter a 770 Hz filter a 852 Hz filter and a 941 Hz filter. The identification component can employ these eight filters in identifying frequencies of the DTMF signal.

In one embodiment the unobstructed segments comprise a first signal segment and a second signal segment. Content of the second signal segment can be coherent to the content of the first signal segment. The classification can correspond to a character of a keypad and the output indicative of the classification can comprise an indicator of the character of the keypad to which the classification corresponds.

When tis relatively small it may be difficult to observe the multiple frequencies of the signal from the isignal segment so that the DTMF signal may have difficulty being decoded. With this situation when length of x t is sufficiently long such that the frequency feature repeats in a late good segment due to the periodic property of the DTMF signal aspects disclosed herein can be used to decode identify at least some content the DTMF signal. To decode x t the obstructed segments can be replaced with zero amplitudes e.g. by the normalization component of and band pass filtering can be applied to x t such as by the identification component of and convolutions can be computed as follows 

With lower frequency estimation the signal x t is band pass filtered at at the lower frequency bandwidth and proceeded for convolution calculations with four lower frequency waveforms at . The maximum convolution value yand the second maximum convolution values yare calculated at . The lower frequency waveform corresponding to the maximum convolution value is chosen to be the estimated lower frequency of the DTMF signal at . The confidence of the lower frequency estimation is defined to be proportional to the difference of yand yas shown below 6 where kis the scale factor chosen by designer. At this confidence level is calculated.

With higher frequency estimation the signal x t is band pass filtered at at the higher frequency bandwidth and processed for convolution calculations with four higher frequency waveforms at . The maximum convolution value yand the second maximum convolution values yare calculated at . The higher frequency waveform corresponding to the maximum convolution value is chosen at to be the estimated higher frequency of the DTMF signal. The confidence of the higher frequency estimation is defined to be proportional to the difference between yand yas shown below 7 where kis the scale factor chosen by the designer. At this confidence level is calculated.

The smaller value of the lower frequency estimation confidence and higher frequency estimation confidence is reported at . That is the confidence c can be obtained by min 8 

A threshold denoted by d can be used to define the success or failure of the frequency estimation that is checked at . If c d the estimation of the lower frequency is declared to be successful and both the estimated lower frequency and the estimated higher frequency can be reported at . Otherwise a failure status is reported at . The value d can be determined by a designer e.g. person intelligent computer system etc. based on the application requirements.

In one example application of the method of the convolution functions in EQ.2 and EQ.3 are chosen with 0.15 second. Aspects can be practiced with or without band pass filters. In this example band pass filters are not used. The lower frequency convolution result set is illustrated in and shows that the maximum convolution value is corresponding to 697 Hz and the higher frequency convolution result set is illustrated at and shows that the maximum convolution value is corresponding to 1477 Hz. Therefore 697 Hz is chosen as the lower frequency 1477 Hz is chosen as the higher frequency and the DTMF key 3 is decoded e.g. through comparison with a look up table . This example demonstrates that discontinued small segments can be utilized in recovering the missing information for detecting the frequencies and decoding the DTMF signal.

Aspects disclosed herein can be practiced in various applications. Example applications include detecting signals that are usually transmitted in a number of short disjoint bursts radar signals extracting signaling information in cordless phones non message oriented signaling of public switched telephone networks and so on.
