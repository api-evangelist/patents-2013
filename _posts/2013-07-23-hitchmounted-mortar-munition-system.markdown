The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to mortar munition systems and in particular to vehicle mounted mortar munition systems.

Mortar munition systems have long been known in warfare. In general a mortar system includes four basic components the ammunition or projectile a barrel or tube a bipod that supports the tube and a base plate that disperses the recoil force. The projectile is usually loaded into the muzzle of the tube. Firing the mortar includes using chemical combustion to propel the projectile out of the tube. Some mortars use a projectile with the propelling charge incorporated in the projectile. Other mortars use a propelling charge that is placed in the tube prior to inserting the projectile in the tube.

Recoil force is generated when a round such as a projectile is fired from the mortar tube. The base plate receives the recoil force from the tube and disperses the recoil force over an area. Dispersing the recoil force decreases the force per unit area. Recoil force dispersion is important for both mounted and dismounted mortar systems. If the base plate did not disperse the recoil force an undesirable point loading would result. In a mounted system point loading may destroy the vehicle to which the mortar is mounted or may pierce or otherwise damage the vehicle. In a mounted system if the recoil force is not dispersed the recoil energy must be absorbed by a recoil system. In a dismounted system point loading may eventually bury the mortar underground.

Mortar munition systems provide a range of capabilities including providing light at night providing smoke screens for defense and launching high explosive projectiles for offense. Mortar tubes are often shorter than artillery tubes. Advancements in technology have enabled mortar weapons to become more easily transportable thereby allowing infantry to use less artillery. In some cases a mortar for example a 60 mm mortar may be fired from a multi use land vehicle having a cargo bed. The multi use land vehicle may not be a dedicated mortar firing platform because it is used for purposes other than firing mortars. Thus a permanently mounted mortar system is not desirable on such a vehicle. Examples of multi use land vehicles are the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle HMMWV jeeps and pickup trucks.

To fire a mortar from a multi use land vehicle s cargo bed a standard mortar base plate has been used along with sandbags or tires to help absorb the recoil force and minimize damage to the land vehicle s cargo bed. Problems with the use of sandbags and tires include among others their availability and weight and the lack of a stable firing platform. The lack of a stable firing platform is unsafe and greatly decreases the accuracy of the mortar projectiles.

A need exists for a mortar mount for a multi use land vehicle that is easily installed or retrofitted is stable and does not interfere with other uses of the land vehicle.

One aspect of the invention is a mortar mount adapter configured to fit in one of a trailer hitch receiver a gooseneck hitch socket and a king pin opening in a fifth wheel hitch. The adapter has a central longitudinal axis and a socket for a ball and socket joint in one end. A shank extends from the socket. The socket and the shank are symmetrical about the longitudinal axis. The socket is configured to receive a ball on a breech end of a mortar tube.

The shank may include at least one transverse through hole normal to the longitudinal axis. A longitudinal through hole may extend from a bottom of the socket to an end of the shank. The longitudinal through hole is centered around the longitudinal axis. The shank may include a reduced thickness portion that forms an exterior slot.

An end of the shank may include an opening formed therein. A spring and or a damper may be disposed in the opening in series or in parallel.

A portion of the socket may be cut away to form a lateral opening for rotating a mortar tube to a horizontal position.

The socket end of the adapter may include a flange centered on the longitudinal axis. In one embodiment the socket includes a counter bore and a spherical surface. In another embodiment the socket includes a conical surface and a spherical surface.

Another aspect of the invention is a method that includes providing a mortar mount adapter and inserting the adapter into one of a trailer hitch receiver a gooseneck hitch socket and a king pin opening in a fifth wheel hitch.

The method may include inserting a ball of a breech of a mortar tube into the socket in the adapter. A round may be fired from the mortar tube.

A portion of the socket joint of the adapter may be cut away to form a lateral opening therein and the method may include firing a round from a mortar tube in a direct fire manner.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Novel apparatuses and methods for firing mortars from a land vehicle use known towing hitch systems. Towing hitch systems distribute the load of a towed vehicle over some or all of the towing vehicle. In the case of firing a mortar the towing hitch system distributes the recoil force of the mortar over some or all of the land vehicle. A towing hitch system uses a towing hitch support that is rigidly fixed to the main frame of the towing vehicle. The main frame of the towing vehicle may include longitudinal and transverse members. Towing hitch systems are rigidly fixed in a known manner to the main frame of the vehicle using for example threaded fasteners clamps welding brackets etc.

In one embodiment of the invention the towing hitch system is a trailer hitch receiver also known as a bumper pull hitch. The trailer hitch receiver may be fixed to the front or rear of the vehicle frame. Class III V trailer hitch receivers may be used.

In another embodiment of the invention the towing hitch system is a gooseneck towing hitch system. Gooseneck towing hitch systems may be used with vehicles having a cargo bed or other suitable mounting means.

In another embodiment of the invention the towing hitch system is a fifth wheel towing hitch system. Fifth wheel towing systems may be used with vehicles having a cargo bed or other suitable mounting means.

Trailer hitch receivers gooseneck towing hitch systems and fifth wheel towing hitch systems are all readily commercially available. For example see www.etrailer.com for a list of manufacturers. These towing hitch systems may be retrofitted on land vehicles.

Gooseneck towing hitch and towing ball may be used with vehicle to tow trailers in a known manner. When not towing towing ball may be removed and inserted in an upside down configuration in socket to provide a smooth surface in cargo bed . When firing a mortar from vehicle towing ball is removed from gooseneck socket and a removable mortar mount adapter is inserted in gooseneck socket .

Socket may be used with a quick release retaining system that enables mortar tube to be quickly disconnected from socket . One example of a quick release retaining system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 277 141 issued on Oct. 2 2012 to Labar et al. and entitled Ball and Socket Joint for Indirect Fire Weapon. 

Adapter includes a shank centered on axis A. Depending on the shape of gooseneck socket the exterior surface of shank may be for example cylindrical or prismatic. Shank may include a friction reducing coating such as TEFLON or grease may be applied to shank . Shank may include a transverse through hole with a central axis that is normal to longitudinal axis A.
