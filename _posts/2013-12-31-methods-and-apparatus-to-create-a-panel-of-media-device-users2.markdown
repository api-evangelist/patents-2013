This patent claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 815 597 which was filed on Apr. 24 2013 and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to audience measurement and more particularly to methods and apparatus to create a panel of media device users.

In recent years consumer devices have been provided with Internet connectivity and the ability to retrieve media from the Internet. As such media exposure has shifted away from sole reliance on traditional methods of media access such as broadcast television towards accessing media via consumer devices accessing the Internet.

Media providers and or other entities such as for example advertising companies broadcast networks etc. are often interested in the viewing listening and or media behavior of audience members and or the public in general. To monitor these behaviors an audience measurement company may enlist panelists e.g. persons agreeing to be monitored to cooperate in an audience measurement study. The media usage and or exposure habits of these panelists as well as demographic data about the panelists is collected and used to statistically determine the size and demographics of a larger audience of interest.

The figures are not to scale. Wherever appropriate the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawing s and accompanying written description to refer to the same or like parts.

Monitoring companies desire knowledge on how users interact with media devices such as smartphones tablets laptops smart televisions etc. In particular media monitoring companies want to monitor media presentations made at the media devices to among other things monitor exposure to advertisements determine advertisement effectiveness determine user behavior identify purchasing behavior associated with various demographics etc.

As used herein the term media includes any type of content and or advertisement delivered via any type of distribution medium. Thus media includes television programming or advertisements radio programming or advertisements movies web sites streaming media etc. Example methods apparatus and articles of manufacture disclosed herein monitor media presentations at media devices. Such media devices may include for example Internet enabled televisions personal computers Internet enabled mobile handsets e.g. a smartphone video game consoles e.g. Xbox PlayStation tablet computers e.g. an iPad digital media players e.g. a Roku media player a Slingbox etc. etc. In some examples media monitoring information is aggregated to determine ownership and or usage statistics of media devices relative rankings of usage and or ownership of media devices types of uses of media devices e.g. whether a device is used for browsing the Internet streaming media from the Internet etc. and or other types of media device information. In examples disclosed herein monitoring information includes but is not limited to media identifying information e.g. media identifying metadata codes signatures watermarks and or other information that may be used to identify presented media application usage information e.g. an identifier of an application a time and or duration of use of the application a rating of the application etc. and or user identifying information e.g. demographic information a user identifier a panelist identifier a username etc. .

Media devices such as tablet computers e.g. an Apple iPad an Asus Transformer etc. present media using applications sometimes referred to as apps that access retrieve request and or present media e.g. Internet media . Combining portability and ease of use with high speed Internet capabilities and large screen sizes tablets are good devices for watching media e.g. video . Apple iPads have some of the highest penetration in the tablet market and a large and growing number of apps have been developed for the Apple iPad . Many U.S. households own one or more Apple iPads . By 2015 it is expected that over one third of US Internet users will own an Apple iPad and be able to stream video on it. Tablet ownership is not only growing in numbers but also in demographic coverage narrowing the age gap in media consumption. By some estimates 36 of people aged 35 54 and 44 of people aged 55 64 use their tablets while watching TV. Tablets have also become loyal babysitters playmates teachers and toys. Children in tablet owning households use media devices such as an iPad to watch TV shows and movies. Many different Apps exist and can be downloaded by users through app stores such as for example Apple iTunes Google Play etc. Hundreds if not thousands of apps are available in the app stores that enable presentation of media. Examples of such applications include but are not limited to Hulu Netflix HBO Go etc.

Operating systems used on media devices are often closed platforms. That is the operating systems provide a limited set of functions that applications executed by the media device can access via for example an Application Programming Interface API . In some operating systems only a single application is executed at one time. When the media device executes the app the app is typically run in a sand box. That is the app is not allowed to communicate with other apps executed by the media device. In some examples apps have access to a limited set of functionality for sharing data with other apps. For example applications executed on the iOS operating system have access to a pasteboard that allows applications to share information.

Because communicating with applications to identify and or monitor media presentation events on devices using a sandbox approach is difficult in examples disclosed herein monitoring is enabled by adding monitoring capability to applications. In examples disclosed herein a software development kit SDK is provided to application developers from for example an audience measurement entity. The SDK facilitates instrumenting and or otherwise enabling applications e.g. media applications such as streaming video applications news applications browser applications image applications social media applications games etc. with monitoring functionalities which are able to collect and transmit monitoring information to a monitoring entity. In particular the application developers create apps that include media monitoring functionality using the SDK. Accordingly rather than relying on a dedicated monitoring application installed on a panelist computer e.g. a tablet a laptop a smartphone etc. instrumented applications disclosed herein are instrumented with instructions such that the instrumented applications effectively monitor themselves and or user interaction s with the instrumented applications. In some examples the instrumented application is referred to as a monitoring enabled application. Because the instrumented applications monitor themselves the instrumented applications and or the monitoring functionality provided by the SDK enables the instrumented application to for example request instructions on whether monitoring functionality should be enabled request instructions on whether a user should be asked if they would like to join a panel notify the audience measurement entity when an app and or media associated with the app is presented notify the audience measurement entity what media and or app s is presented notify the audience measurement entity how the apps and or media is being presented e.g. via a tablet display via a television etc. notify the audience measurement entity of a duration of exposure of an app and or media associated with the app etc.

Consider for example a media application instrumented with monitoring functionality. Assume the instrumented application has been downloaded to a media device e.g. via purchase in an app store . During operation of the instrumented application the instrumented application identifies whether monitoring functionality should be enabled e.g. based on a monitoring instruction received from an audience measurement entity based on the user s consent to be monitored etc. . In examples disclosed herein the instrumented application contacts the monitoring entity to determine whether monitoring should be enabled. In some examples the instrumented application checks the shared memory location on the client device to determine whether monitoring should be enabled. When the instrumented application determines monitoring should be enabled the instrumented application also retrieves a unique identifier if present associated with the media device. The unique identifier is used to associate the media activity of the media device with the user for audience measurement purposes.

Tablet applications enable new behaviors e.g. the ability to watch streaming videos and or television in different locations and provide the ability to measure these behaviors. However constructing a representative sample e.g. a panel to capture device driven behaviors using cost effective recruitment techniques is a challenge given the scarcity of demographic data on this population as well as the lack of prior research on recruitment from it.

Example sample constructions and recruitment approaches for building a panel of tablet users that view media via an instrumented application e.g. an app are disclosed herein. Monitoring components embedded in the instrumented application enable creation of a panel obtaining their demographic characteristics and electronically monitoring the panelists media usage behavior.

Example instrumented applications disclosed herein provide recruitment tools for targeting users of instrumented applications and are also flexible enough to yield a representative sample. In some such examples a master frame of devices with one or more instrumented application s installed is created. From the master frame a probability panel is created and systematically broken into a number of test cells. As used herein a master frame is defined as a list of users and or devices that have used and or executed at least one instrumented application. In examples disclosed herein the master frame includes ten thousand users and or devices. However any number of users and or devices may be included in the master frame. As used herein a probability panel is defined to be a subset of the master frame. The probability panel corresponds to users and or devices who have been selected to be recruited to become panelists. In examples disclosed herein the probability panel includes four thousand and two hundred users and or devices. However any number of users and or devices may be included in the probability panel.

The probability panel is broken down into a plurality of test cells. In some examples disclosed herein there are six test cells each including seven hundred users and or devices. However there may be any number of test cells including any number of users and or devices. In some examples each of the test cells is assigned a different recruitment procedure and or recruitment interface. For example a first user in a first test cell may be presented with a first prompt while a second user in a second test cell may be presented with a second prompt different from the first prompt. The different prompts may request different levels of detailed panelist information e.g. demographic information educational information financial information etc. . Ultimately different test cells may result in different success levels of the recruitment procedure. For example a first prompt associated with a first test cell may request very detailed financial information while a second prompt associated with a second test cell may not request any financial information. The first prompt may result in fewer users who complete the registration process than the second prompt because for example users may be opposed to providing detailed financial information. Using multiple test cells enables identification of how much detail should be requested from potential panelists during a registration process.

Recruitment within the probability panel is implemented using an interface e.g. a pop up generated by the instrumented application. The interface directs interested users to a registration interface e.g. a website which collects information that can be used for extrapolating the panel of users to a larger viewing audience. In some examples demographic information collection is attempted even for users who have not been selected to become panelists. Such collection may facilitate extrapolation of monitoring information collected in association with panelists to a larger population. The monitoring components recruiting interface and registration interface interact in a multi phased process. For example the monitoring components are not enabled until after the registration interface has been completed.

Example recruitment systems disclosed herein yield a panel large enough to not only measure new behavior watching Television and or streaming video on tablets but also to enable identification of attributes of a population incentive preferences of a population etc. As disclosed herein by reaching users directly in the environment where their behavior will be measured e.g. via an instrumented application the versatility of mobile technology in enabling cross platform research e.g. television programs watched on tablets via streaming technology and in efficiently reaching and measuring previously unidentified populations is leveraged to improve audience measurements.

In examples disclosed herein a monitoring entity e.g. a neutral third party not involved in media delivery such as The Nielsen Company Inc. cooperates with providers of media apps to obtain permission to install and or otherwise incorporate monitoring components into an application e.g. an instrumented application prior to placement in the app store e.g. Apple iTunes Google Play etc. . The first time a metered app is downloaded and launched by the media device the metering components contact a central facility e.g. a server operated by the monitoring entity and the media device e.g. an iPad is assigned a unique identifier ID that in some examples remains fixed for the life of the media device. In some examples the unique identifier may be reset and or removed from the media device. For example the unique identifier may be removed from the collection facility if the instrumented application has not been used in more than a threshold period of time e.g. one year six months etc. . In the illustrated example the unique identifier is a serial number that is stored in a shared memory e.g. a pasteboard a cache a registry etc. of the media device. However the unique identifier may be formatted and or stored in any other manner. For example the unique identifier may be text data e.g. a string of characters binary data etc. Unlike an ID that might be assigned by the manufacturer this unique identifier may be assigned regardless of manufacturer or operating system version and cannot be changed by the user. In some examples the unique identifier may be removed from the device by for example a factory reset. The monitoring components also capture some limited non personally identifiable information such as device type iPad iPhone etc. operating system e.g. iOS android etc. version the instrumented application name version of the instrumented application the initial launch date etc. Lastly the monitoring components execute an instruction directing it to contact the central facility on the first launch of the instrumented application after a number of days have passed. However the instruction may be based on any other duration and or condition. For example the monitoring components may be instructed to contact the central facility after the instrumented application has been launched three or more times etc. With each occurrence of an instrumented application being launched for the first time on a device the instrumented application name and version is captured and transmitted to the central facility.

Example monitoring components disclosed herein enable the monitoring entity to assemble a master frame including all media devices that have launched at least one instrumented application and to understand which instrumented application s are on each media device. In some examples in order to meet privacy requirements the instrumented application when installed provides a notice indicating that the monitoring components are present in the instrumented application. This notice is present in the instrumented application s Terms of Service or End User License Agreement EULA in the App Store in the description associated with the individual app including a link to a Frequently Asked Questions website describing the monitoring components and their activities and or in the Device settings or App settings.

The example media provider of the illustrated example of includes one or more servers providing Internet media e.g. web pages audio video images etc. . The example media provider of may be implemented by any provider s of media such as a digital media broadcaster multicaster or unicaster e.g. a cable television service a fiber optic television service an IPTV provider etc. and or an on demand digital media provider e.g. an Internet streaming video and or audio services such as Netflix YouTube Hulu Pandora Last.fm etc. a web page and or any other provider of media. Additionally or alternatively the example media provider may not be an Internet provider. For example the media providers may be on a private a virtual private and or semi private network e.g. a LAN . Example media providers frequently provide applications that are specific to media that is presented in association with that media provider. For example a media provider such as Netflix may provide a Netflix application to be used on the media device . In the illustrated example the media provider provides media to an application executed by a media device such as the media device . In examples disclosed herein the media provider and or an application developer instruments the media application with monitoring instructions provided as part of an SDK from the central facility of the monitoring entity.

The example app store of the illustrated example of is the Apple iTunes app store. In the illustrated example the app store provides applications e.g. apps to users for use on the media device e.g. an iPad . While in the illustrated example the example app store is the Apple iTunes app store any other app store and or repository of applications apps may additionally or alternatively be used such as for example Google Play the Windows Phone app store the Ubuntu Software Center etc.

The example network of the illustrated example of is a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. However in some examples local networks may additionally or alternatively be used. For example multiple networks e.g. a cellular network an Ethernet network etc. may be utilized to implement the example network of .

The example media device of the illustrated example shown in is a device that retrieves media from the media provider . In some examples the media device is capable of directly presenting media e.g. via a display while in other examples the media device presents the media on separate media presentation equipment e.g. speakers a display etc. . Thus as used herein media devices may or may not be able to present media without assistance from a second device. Media devices are typically consumer electronics. For example the media device of the illustrated example is a tablet such as an Apple iPad and thus is capable of directly presenting media e.g. via an integrated display and speakers . While in the illustrated example a tablet is shown any other type s and or number s of media device s may additionally or alternatively be used. For example Internet enabled mobile handsets e.g. a smartphone an iPod etc. video game consoles e.g. Xbox PlayStation 3 etc. tablet computers e.g. an iPad a Motorola Xoom etc. digital media players e.g. a Roku media player a Slingbox a Tivo etc. smart televisions etc. may additionally or alternatively be used.

The instrumented application of the illustrated example of is software downloadable via the Internet. As such it is implemented as computer readable instructions executing on a hardware logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor of the media device . In the illustrated example the instrumented application is provided by the media provider . However the instrumented application may be provided by any other entity. In some examples the instrumented application is installed on the media device by the user by downloading the instrumented application from the app store e.g. Apple iTunes Google play etc. . The application e.g. an app presents media retrieved from the media provider and or from any other Internet location. In examples disclosed herein the instrumented application is implemented to include monitoring functionality provided by the monitoring entity via for example a software development kit SDK . The monitoring functionality when enabled transmits monitoring information to the central facility .

The example data store of the illustrated example of may be any device for storing data such as for example flash memory magnetic media optical media etc. In the illustrated example the data store is implemented by random access memory of the media device . Furthermore the data stored in the data store may be in any data format such as for example binary data comma delimited data tab delimited data structured query language SQL structures etc. While in the illustrated example the data store is illustrated as a single database the data store may be implemented by multiple databases and or be stored in multiple memory locations of the media device.

In the illustrated example of a software development kit SDK is provided from the central facility of for example an audience measurement entity to a media provider e.g. an application developer . The provision of this SDK may be via an electronic communication over the network . The media provider employs the SDK to generate an instrumented app . The media provider then posts the instrumented app to the app store as shown by the electronic message of . In some examples the instrumented app must first be approved by a third party e.g. Apple before it is made available in the app store .

Once the instrumented app is made available at the app store members of the general public some of which are panelists of the audience measurement entity may download the app to their respective media device s via an electronic message as shown in . When executed the instrumented application contacts the central facility to determine whether the user of the device on which the instrumented application is executing should be asked if they would like to become a panelist. If so the instrumented application may then display a prompt to the user ask for demographic information transmit monitoring information to the central facility etc.

When an instrumented application is executed on a mobile device the instrumented application accesses a shared memory location on the media device e.g. to check a state of a flag to determine whether monitoring functionality of the instrumented application should be enabled. If so the monitoring functionality of the instrumented application is executed to collect monitoring information and upload the same to the central facility via electronic message s . If the monitoring functionality of the instrumented application should not be enabled e.g. the shared memory location contains a flag indicating the user has opted out of monitoring the monitoring instructions are disabled and the instrumented application is executed without collecting monitoring information and without uploading monitoring information to the central facility .

The central facility of the illustrated example is a facility of an audience measurement entity e.g. the Nielsen Company US LLC and includes an interface to receive reported metering information e.g. metadata from the media device via the network . The example central facility of the illustrated example of includes an HTTP interface a registration data controller a data store a monitoring data receiver a timestamper a panel creator an application ID assignor a unique ID generator a software development kit SDK provider and a reporter .

In the illustrated example the central facility includes an HTTP interface to receive HTTP requests that include media monitoring information demographic information etc. The HTTP requests are sent with the media monitoring information in their payload. The media monitoring information may include media identifying information e.g. media identifying metadata codes signatures watermarks and or other information that may be used to identify presented media application usage information e.g. an identifier of an application a time and or duration of use of the application a rating of the application etc. user identifying information e.g. demographic information a unique identifier a user identifier a panelist identifier a username etc. etc. The requests may not be intended to actually retrieve media but are instead used as a vehicle to convey the metering information. Thus the HTTP requests may be referred to as dummy requests . The central facility is provided with software e.g. a daemon to extract the metering information from the payload of the dummy request s . Additionally or alternatively any other method s to transfer the metering information may be used such as for example an HTTP Secure protocol HTTPS a file transfer protocol FTP a secure file transfer protocol SFTP an HTTP and or HTTPS GET request an HTTP and or HTTPS POST request etc.

The example data store of the illustrated example of may be any device for storing data such as for example flash memory magnetic media optical media etc. The data store of the illustrated example of stores monitoring information received at the registration data controller e.g. demographic information transmitted by the instrumented application and or received at the monitoring data receiver e.g. media identifying information application usage information etc. . However the data store may additionally or alternatively store any other information. Furthermore the data stored in the data store may be in any data format such as for example binary data comma delimited data tab delimited data structured query language SQL structures etc. While in the illustrated example the data store is illustrated as a single database the data store may be implemented by multiple databases and or be stored in multiple memory locations of the media device.

The example registration data controller of the illustrated example of is implemented by a logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor executing instructions but it could additionally or alternatively be implemented by an application specific integrated circuit s ASIC s programmable logic device s PLD s and or field programmable logic device s FPLD s an analog circuit and or other circuitry. The example registration data controller receives demographic information from the instrumented application in association with a unique identifier. As described below the unique identifier is created by the unique ID generator . The received registration demographic information is stored in the data store in association with the unique ID. The received demographic information may later be used to correlate media exposure and or application usage to a particular panelist and or demographic.

The example monitoring data receiver of the illustrated example of is implemented by a logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor executing instructions but it could additionally or alternatively be implemented by an ASIC a PLD an FPLD an analog circuit and or other circuitry. The example monitoring data receiver receives media monitoring information from the instrumented application . As disclosed herein media monitoring information may include media identifying information e.g. media identifying metadata codes signatures watermarks and or other information that may be used to identify presented media application usage information e.g. an identifier of an application a time and or duration of use of the application a rating of the application etc. user identifying information e.g. demographic information a unique identifier a panelist identifier a username etc. etc. The monitoring data receiver stores the received monitoring information in the data store in association with a unique ID.

In the illustrated example the example monitoring data receiver stores and analyzes the monitoring information received from the instrumented application s from different media devices. For example the example monitoring data receiver may sort and or group metering information by media provider e.g. by grouping all metering data associated with a particular media provider and or associated with a particular instrumented application . Any other processing of media monitoring information may additionally or alternatively be performed. In some examples the monitoring data receiver adds a timestamp to the media monitoring information upon receipt. Timestamping e.g. recording a time and or a date that an event occurred enables accurate identification and or correlation of media that was presented and or the time that it was presented with the demographics of the user s of the media device s .

The example panel creator of the illustrated example of is implemented by a logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor executing instructions but it could additionally or alternatively be implemented by an ASIC a PLD an FPLD an analog circuit and or other circuitry. The example panel creator identifies the master frame and statistically selects users and or devices within the master frame to be recruited to become panelists. The users and or devices selected to be recruited are referred to as a probability panel. In some examples the example panel creator separates the probability panel into a plurality of test cells. Each test cell may be associated with different recruitment information e.g. different prompts different demographic information requested etc. .

The example unique ID generator of the illustrated example of is implemented by a logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor executing instructions but it could additionally or alternatively be implemented by an ASIC a PLD an FPLD an analog circuit and or other circuitry. The example unique ID generator generates a unique identifier in response to a request for a unique identifier from an instrumented application . In the illustrated example the unique identifier is a serial number that is uniquely assigned to each user and or media device . However any other way of generating a unique identifier may additionally or alternatively be used such as for example a username an email address a hardware identifier of the media device etc.

The example SDK provider of the illustrated example of is implemented by a logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor executing instructions but it could additionally or alternatively be implemented by an ASIC a PLD an FPLD an analog circuit and or other circuitry. The example SDK provider provides instructions to application developers to facilitate creation of the instrumented application . In some examples the SDK is provided such that the application developer s can integrate the SDK into existing applications. While in the illustrated example an SDK is provided the monitoring components instrumented by the SDK and or monitoring instructions provided via the SDK may be provided in any other fashion. For example the monitoring components may be provided as an application programming interface API a plugin an add on etc. In some examples the example SDK provider provides the application developer with an application identifier that is unique to the application that will be instrumented. Unique application identifiers enable accurate correlation of instrumented applications and the users and or devices on which such instrumented applications are executed. Moreover unique application identifiers enable the panel creator to select users and or devices based on applications with which they are associated.

The example reporter of the illustrated example of is implemented by a logic circuit such as a semiconductor based processor executing instructions but it could additionally or alternatively be implemented by an ASIC a PLD an FPLD an analog circuit and or other circuitry. The example reporter generates reports indicative of media exposure metrics and or application usage metrics based on one or more different types of client devices e.g. personal computers portable devices mobile phones tablets etc. . For example the reporter compiles media exposure metrics based on the correlation of the media identifying information the application usage information and the user identifying information. A report is then generated to indicate media exposure and or application usage statistics. In some examples the exposure measurements provide ratings information for different media e.g. a particular television show a particular website a particular movie etc. In some examples the exposure measurements indicate ratings information and or usage statistics for different instrumented applications. In some examples the reporter reports metrics about user acceptance of registration prompts across various test cells.

Additionally or alternatively popularities of different types of media across different device types may be reported. Such different types of media may be for example news movies television programming on demand media Internet based media games streaming games advertisements etc. Such comparisons may be made across any type s and or numbers of devices including for example cell phones smart phones dedicated portable multimedia playback devices iPod devices tablet computing devices e.g. an iPad standard definition SD televisions high definition HD televisions three dimensional 3D televisions stationary computers portable computers Internet radios etc. Any other type s and or number of media and or devices may be analyzed. The report may also associate the media exposure metrics with demographic segments e.g. age groups genders ethnicities etc. corresponding to the user s of the media device s . Additionally or alternatively the report may associate the media exposure metrics with metric indicators of the popularity of the artist genre song title etc. across one or more user characteristics selected from one or more demographic segment s one or more age group s one or more gender s and or any other user characteristic s .

In some examples the media exposure metrics are used to determine demographic reach of streaming media ratings for streaming media engagement indices for streaming media user affinities associated with streaming media broadcast media and or any other audience measure metric associated with streaming media and or locally stored media. While in the illustrated example the media exposure metrics are used to provide information for streaming media the media exposure metrics may be used to provide information for any other type of media such as for example websites non streaming media etc. In some examples the media exposure metrics are audience share metrics indicative of percentages of audiences for different applications and or types of applications that accessed the same media. For example a first percentage of an audience may be exposed to news media via a browser application while a second percentage of the audience may be exposed to the same news media via a news reader application.

Although for simplicity the above discussion focuses on a single media device a single instrumented app a single media provider a single app store and a single central facility any number of any of these components may be present. For example in a typical implementation it is expected that multiple media providers will offer multiple different instrumented apps to the public at large. Thus it is expected that there will be many media devices accessing such apps and that a significant portion of the users will agree to be recruited and or eventually become panelists. Thus it is expected that there will be many instances of the above processes conducted across many devices at overlapping and or distinct times. Thus for example there may be many instantiations of the machine readable instructions disclosed in the below flowcharts operating at the same or different time. Some of these instances may be implemented as parallel threads operating on a same device.

The example media presenter of is implemented by computer executable instructions. In the illustrated example the media presenter interacts with a QuickTime application programming interface API to display media via the media device . While in the illustrated example the QuickTime API is used any other media presenting framework may additionally or alternatively be employed. For example the media presenter of the illustrated example may interact with an Adobe Flash media presentation framework.

The example media monitor of the illustrated example of is implemented by computer executable instructions. The media monitor of is downloaded with the instrumented app and is initiated when the instrumented application determines that the monitoring functionality should be enabled. The media monitor of the illustrated example extracts metering data e.g. signatures watermarks etc. from the media presented by the media presenter . For example the media monitor can implement functionality provided by a software development kit SDK to extract one or more audio watermarks one or more video e.g. image watermarks etc. embedded in the audio and or video of the media presented by the media presenter . For example the media may include pulse code modulation PCM audio data or other types of audio data uncompressed video image data etc. 

Audio watermarking is a technique used to identify media such as television broadcasts radio broadcasts advertisements television and or radio downloaded media streaming media prepackaged media etc. Existing audio watermarking techniques identify media by embedding one or more audio codes e.g. one or more watermarks such as media identifying information and or an identifier that may be mapped to media identifying information into an audio and or video component. In some examples the audio or video component is selected to have a signal characteristic sufficient to hide the watermark. As used herein the terms code or watermark are used interchangeably and are defined to mean any identification information e.g. an identifier that may be inserted or embedded in the audio or video of media e.g. a program or advertisement for the purpose of identifying the media or for another purpose such as tuning e.g. a packet identifying header . As used herein media refers to audio and or visual still or moving content and or advertisements. To identify watermarked media the watermark s are extracted and used to access a table of reference watermarks that are mapped to media identifying information.

Unlike media monitoring techniques based on codes and or watermarks included with and or embedded in the monitored media fingerprint or signature based media monitoring techniques generally use one or more inherent characteristics of the monitored media during a monitoring time interval to generate a substantially unique proxy for the media. Such a proxy is referred to as a signature or fingerprint and can take any form e.g. a series of digital values a waveform etc. representative of any aspect s of the media signal s e.g. the audio and or video signals forming the media presentation being monitored . A good signature is one that is repeatable when processing the same media presentation but that is unique relative to other e.g. different presentations of other e.g. different media. Accordingly the term fingerprint and signature are used interchangeably herein and are defined herein to mean a proxy for identifying media that is generated from one or more inherent characteristics of the media.

Signature based media monitoring generally involves determining e.g. generating and or collecting signature s representative of a media signal e.g. an audio signal and or a video signal output by a monitored media device and comparing the monitored signature s to one or more references signatures corresponding to known e.g. reference media sources. Various comparison criteria such as a cross correlation value a Hamming distance etc. can be evaluated to determine whether a monitored signature matches a particular reference signature. When a match between the monitored signature and one of the reference signatures is found the monitored media can be identified as corresponding to the particular reference media represented by the reference signature that matched the monitored signature. Because attributes such as an identifier of the media a presentation time a broadcast channel etc. are collected for the reference signature these attributes may then be associated with the monitored media whose monitored signature matched the reference signature. Example systems for identifying media based on codes and or signatures are long known and were first disclosed in Thomas U.S. Pat. No. 5 481 294 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some examples the code watermark is transmitted with and or in association with the media as media identifying metadata. The media identifying metadata may be formatted in a text or binary format such as for example an ID3 tag. In some examples the media identifying metadata includes the data from the code watermark etc. However in some other examples the media identifying metadata is derived from and or representative of the code watermark and or a signature etc. Example methods and apparatus to transcode watermarks into ID3 tags are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 341 646 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 341 661 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 443 596 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 455 961 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 472 170 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 793 991 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 793 974 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 793 983 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.

In the illustrated example of the example media monitor determines e.g. extracts transforms derives decodes converts etc. the media identifying metadata e.g. such as media identifying information source identifying information watermarks codes etc. associated with and or transmitted with the media e.g. in an ID3 tag in a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Live Streaming HLS manifest in an Moving Pictures Experts Group version 2 MPEG2 transport stream in a timed text track in an encryption key associated with the media etc. . The media identifying metadata may be a code in for example a text or binary format located in an ID3 tag associated with the media. In some examples the media monitor converts the metering data into a text and or binary format for transmission to the central facility .

In some examples the media monitor monitors events other than media presentation events. For example the media monitor may monitor application interaction events such as for example when a link in an application is selected when an application is launched when an application is closed etc.

The example monitoring data controller of the illustrated example of is implemented by computer executable instructions. In the illustrated example the monitoring data controller manages records stored in the data store . For example the data controller controls transmission of stored records deletion of aged records determining if a storage threshold of the data store is exceeded etc.

The example unique ID determiner of the illustrated example of is implemented by computer executable instructions. In the illustrated example the unique ID determiner determines whether a unique identifier is present on e.g. stored on a shared memory of the media device . The unique identifier may be present on the media device by virtue of another instrumented application having been installed and or the unique ID determiner previously having determined and stored the unique identifier. In the illustrated example when the unique identifier is not present on the media device the unique ID determiner requests the unique identifier from the central facility . However in some examples the unique ID determiner may determine the unique identifier without contacting the central facility . In such examples the unique identifier may be based on for example a username a hardware address of the media device e.g. a media access control MAC address an electronic serial number ESN etc. etc.

The example recruitment controller of the illustrated example of is implemented by computer executable instructions. In the illustrated example the recruitment controller controls whether a recruitment interface e.g. the example recruitment interface of is displayed to the user. In some examples the recruitment controller displays a demographic information collection interface e.g. the example demographic information collection interface of . When displaying the demographic information collection interface the example recruitment controller collects demographic information from the user and transmits the collected information to the central facility .

In the illustrated example of the example recruitment interface includes a logo a prompt a yes button a no button an ask me later button and a close button .

In examples disclosed herein many different methodologies may be employed when designing the recruitment interface . To ensure that sampled users excludes trial users e.g. users who are using an instrumented application in a trial mode users who have only recently installed the application and have not yet established a pattern of usage etc. and to avoid the possibility of introducing confusion on the first or second launch of the instrumented application the instrumented application displays the recruitment screen at the third launch of the instrumented application . However in some examples the instrumented application may display the recruitment screen at a different time based on other criteria such as for example upon a fifth launch of the instrumented application one week after the instrumented application was first installed etc.

It is important to keep in mind some of the reasons why recruitment starts from the instrumented application to ensure that the users sampled are actually exposed to media via the instrumented application. When contacted for recruitment users could actually be watching media an activity where interruptions are unwelcome. Thus in examples disclosed herein the timing of the display of the recruitment interface is implemented so that it does not coincide with any video streaming. Specifically in some examples the recruitment interface e.g. a pop up displays only after the video ends or is stopped e.g. while the user is searching for another episode to watch or for more information about the program .

Users have developed resistance and even animosity to mobile ads which appear in apps and websites and often diminish user experience and hinder the attainment of the goal that led the user to that app or website e.g. entertainment escape search for specific information . In some examples because of operating system e.g. iOS limitations the recruitment interface does not include any special fonts that would immediately draw the users attention e.g. highlighting italics etc. . Lastly in examples disclosed herein users are not taken out of the instrumented application environment for the recruitment process. Rather communication with the users takes place within the instrumented application they were initially using so as not to affect their behavior and or affect their use of the instrumented application .

The example recruitment interface includes the example logo . In the illustrated example the logo represents the monitoring entity and thereby informs the user that the recruitment interface is associated with the monitoring entity. Including the logo of the monitoring entity lends research legitimacy to the inquiry. In the illustrated example the logo is displayed at the top of the recruitment interface . However the example logo may be displayed in any location.

The example recruitment interface includes an example prompt . The example prompt includes text that in some examples informs the user that the recruitment is taking place. In the illustrated example the prompt is enlarged to fill the size of the recruitment interface. Moreover all of the text of the example prompt is displayed at once resulting in an interface that does not require the user to scroll through the text to read the entire prompt . As described above different text may be used in the prompt based on which test cell the user has been assigned. Using different text within the prompt enables the monitoring entity to test different wordings formats etc. in an effort to create the most effective recruitment interface.

Although the recruitment interface appears in a plain text pop up within the instrumented application the recruitment interface is structured to not look like an advertisement or a legal disclaimer common pop ups that users have learned to ignore or avoid . In some examples the users may be provided with a snapshot of the research to enable the user to understand the purpose and or results of the monitoring effort by glancing at the screen for a few seconds e.g. the time it would take someone to close a pop up . Keeping the structure in line with other alerts common on the operating system e.g. Apple iOS Google Android etc. with which users are familiar facilitates seamlessness of the transition between the operating system environment and the recruitment environment.

Media devices such as tablets smartphones etc. are often shared among several household members who may have different reactions to the study and or different reasons for accepting or declining the recruitment invitation. To give undecided or additional household members the time necessary to make a decision the recruitment interface offers the option to defer recruitment Ask Me Later via the ask me later button . If the ask me later button is selected the recruitment invitation appears again at the next launch of the instrumented application . In the illustrated example users can defer a maximum of two times. However any other deferment limit may be used e.g. five times ten times etc. or a maximum number of deferments may not be used. If the deferral option has been chosen a number of times greater than or equal to the deferment limit the ask me later button is not displayed as part of the recruitment interface . After the maximum deferment limit is reached it is likely that the user would already have made a decision about participating in the study. Instead users may accept the recruitment interface by selecting the yes button or may decline the recruitment interface by selecting the no button . In some examples the recruitment interface includes a close button . The close button may be included so that the recruitment interface stylistically appears in line with other alerts common on the operating system. In the illustrated example the close button has the same functionality as the ask me later button . While in the illustrated example the yes button the no button the ask me later button and the close button are described as buttons any other type of interface element may additionally or alternatively be used such as for example a drop down menu radio selection buttons checkboxes etc.

A concern both from a cooperation perspective and a legal perspective is the high likelihood that a child will be using the media device at the time the recruitment interface is displayed. Depending on reading and comprehension skills children could willingly or unwillingly accept or reject recruitment. On one hand if the child accepts the monitoring entity cannot use monitoring data received from that media device per the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA . An adult s consent is needed at the registration stage for the monitoring entity to keep data from minors. On the other hand if a child rejects recruitment e.g. because he she has not yet learned to read the monitoring entity risks losing much valuable monitoring data e.g. data associated with an adult user .

Several measures are taken to ensure that minors recruitment accounts for both sample building goals and legal provisions. At the initial recruitment stage if children defer recruitment e.g. by selecting the ask me later button the invitation appears again allowing for the opportunity of an adult to receive and or review it. If the user rejects e.g. by selecting the no button a confirmation window appears to ensure that the no button has not been selected at random or by mistake. In some examples the user may be thanked for their time and informed that such information will or will not be requested from them at a later time. If the user accepts e.g. by selecting the yes button they will need to indicate that they are an adult e.g. by entering their birthdate etc. before providing any detailed demographic information. In some examples the user may be thanked for selecting the yes button .

In the illustrated example the demographic information collection interface asks for a few basic pieces of demographic information about the respondent e.g. a zip code an email address and about each household member month year of birth gender etc. . The user is also asked to identify himself herself among these household members in order to assess whether he she is eighteen years or older e.g. based on the birth date provided . Respondents under the age of eighteen are automatically disqualified and cannot proceed with recruitment. In such an example disqualification acts as a deferral with the initial recruitment invitation reappearing at the next app launch to allow for an adult to respond.

Once in the web environment of the demographic information interface transitioning from one screen to the next is smooth quick and logical. After providing the basic demographic information used for enumeration on the first screen respondents can choose to join the research panel or not . If they refuse to join they are directed to a screen confirming rejection just as with the initial recruitment invitation of the recruitment interface . This screen provides an opportunity to return to recruitment in case the rejection was accidental. If users agree to join the panel they must first pass two eligibility screens besides the age requirement they must not be a media employee e.g. an employee of the monitoring entity an employee of a media distributor an employee of a television network etc. and they must not participate in any other panels operated by the monitoring entity to avoid cross panel cannibalization and to screen out respondents with a vested interest in the study results . If respondents do not fall in either of these categories they are included in the panel and receive a confirmation email at the address they provided on the first website screen.

Since an example goal of such studies is to estimate the universe of tablet instrumented application users it is necessary to collect data required for measuring and weighting the demographic categories within this universe. However given the lack of data on the level of cooperation and response rates expected from within app recruitment some respondents may be willing to provide more information than what is requested. To test the extent to which respondents are willing to share personal information in this context a subset of respondents e.g. one or more test cells are randomly selected to provide additional information to be used for weighting. This data may include education race income and ethnicity and is required in an additional and final screen between the eligibility screen and the panel membership confirmation screen. The subset of randomly selected users and or devices within the probability panel is referred to as a test cell.

In the illustrated example the demographic information collection interface includes a message . The example message of the illustrated example of thanks the user for agreeing to participate in the study. However any other message may be used. In the illustrated example the example message used is based on the test cell to which the user and or device has been assigned. In some examples the message offers an incentive for providing demographic information and or participating in the study. Different levels of incentives may be offered for participation in different test cells. For example users selected to provide very detailed demographic information may be given more incentives than users selected to provide basic demographic information.

In examples disclosed herein six test cells are used. However any number of test cells may additionally or alternatively be used. These cells combine various incentive amounts given for providing the initial enumeration data and for joining the panel delivered as either an electronic gift card or as a monthly sweepstakes. In examples disclosed herein to ascertain a statistically observable difference among test cells seven hundred users are assigned to each of six test cells for a total sample size e.g. the probability panel of four thousand and two hundred. Response rates associated with each of the test cells may then be used to determine which questions are asked of respondents and or what types of incentives are offered to respondents.

In examples disclosed herein the involvement of the monitoring entity is disclosed at all times. In some examples a reference to the study and or monitoring efforts appear on the device in a place that is both visible and non intrusive when users watch video. Accordingly the instrumented application includes an icon associated with the monitoring entity embedded discreetly yet visibly in the video viewing apps. This icon also serves as the go to place for users to learn more about the study and to opt out if they wish links to the study info and opt out pages are also provided in the confirmation emails delivered after joining the panel .

The application identifier column stores an application identifier. In the illustrated example the application identifier is specific to the instrumented application . In the illustrated example the application identifier is a name of the application such as for example ESPN HBO Go Hulu etc. In some examples the application identifier includes version information of the instrumented application such as for example version 1.1.0 etc. In some examples the application identifier is a serial number associated with the instrumented application. In the illustrated example the application identifier is assigned by the media provider and or the application developer of the instrumented application . However in some examples the SDK provider of the central facility when providing the SDK to the media provider may assign an application identifier to be used with the instrumented application .

The timestamp column represents a time when the instrumented application reported that the user and or device identified in the unique identifier column first launched the application identified in the application identifier column . In the illustrated example only one row is stored per user device and application pair. Such row is associated with the first launch of the instrumented application . However the timestamp column may be updated to reflect the most recent launch of the instrumented application multiple rows may be recorded for each user device and application pair representing each time that the instrumented application was launched etc.

The example table of the illustrated example of includes a first row a second row and a third row . However any number of rows may additionally or alternatively be included in the example table . The first example row identifies that a first user and or device launched an ESPN application at a first time. The second example row identifies that the first user and or device then launched an HBO Go application at a second time. The third example row identifies that a second user and or device launched a Hulu application at a third time. While in the illustrated example two users are represented executing three applications any other number of users and or applications may additionally or alternatively be used.

The example table of the illustrated example of includes a first row a second row a third row and a fourth row . The first example row corresponds to the first user and or device e.g. the user 001 associated with row and row of . The first example row identifies that the recruitment offer has been presented to the first user that the first user has accepted the recruitment offer and that demographic information has been collected from the first user. Once the first user has provided demographic information monitoring functionality may be enabled for instrumented applications associated with the first user and or device.

The second example row corresponds to the second user and or device e.g. the user 002 associated with row of . The second example row identifies that the recruitment offer has been presented to the second user but that the second user has refused the recruitment offer. Accordingly the second example row represents the demographic information associated with the second user and or device is not applicable because the second user refused the recruitment offer.

The third example row corresponds to a third user and or device. The third example row identifies that the third user has not yet been presented with a recruitment offer. This may be because for example the instrumented application associated with the third user and or device has not yet been launched the requisite number of times before the recruitment interface would be presented. Accordingly information regarding whether the third user and or device has accepted the recruitment offer or has provided any demographic information is not applicable.

The fourth example row corresponds to a fourth user and or device. The fourth example row represents that the fourth user and or device has not been selected to be provided with a recruitment offer. Because users who become panelist are often provided with incentives for their participation in the study maintaining and operating too large of a panel may become cost prohibitive. As such not all users may be selected to be recruited. The fourth example user and or device may be selected for recruitment at a later time.

The example recruitment interface data column includes information about the recruitment interface that is presented to the user via the instrumented application . In some examples different recruitment interfaces may result in different levels of user agreement to participate in the study. For example a recruitment interface that is very detailed about how the study is performed may contain too much text and or legal disclaimers and discourage users from agreeing to participate in the study. Conversely a recruitment interface that is not detailed about how the study is performed may have a similar effect of dissuading users from agreeing to participate in study. Using different test cells enables the monitoring entity to understand the effect of different recruitment interfaces on acceptance and or refusal rates.

The example request ethnicity column identifies whether ethnicity information will be requested as part of the demographic information for users assigned to a particular test cell. The example request age column identifies whether age information will be requested as part of the demographic information for users and or devices assigned to a particular test cell. In some examples age information is limited to whether the user is an adult e.g. over the age of eighteen . However in some other examples age information may be more detailed and may for example request the user provide their date of birth. The example request financial information column identifies whether financial information will be requested as part of the demographic information for users assigned to the particular test cell. In the illustrated example the requested financial information may include for example a household income per annum associated with the user a credit score of the user. Understanding financial information such as household income may enable the monitoring entity to better tailor incentives offered to users of different demographic populations.

The example table of the illustrated example of includes a first example row and a second example row . The first example row identifies information associated with a first test cell. The second example row identifies information associated with a second test cell. In the illustrated example the first test cell uses a first recruitment interface while the second test cell uses a second recruitment interface different from the first recruitment interface. In the illustrated example ethnicity information is not requested in association with the first test cell but is requested in association with the second test cell. In the illustrated example age information is requested for both the first test cell and the second test cell. In the illustrated example financial information is not requested for either of the first test cell or the second test cell. However any combination of demographic data requested for a given test cell may additionally or alternatively be used.

While an example manner of implementing the example central facility and or the example instrumented application is illustrated in one or more of the elements processes and or devices illustrated in may be combined divided re arranged omitted eliminated and or implemented in any other way.

Further still the example central facility of and or the example instrumented application of may include one or more elements processes and or devices in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated elements processes and devices.

Flowcharts representative of example machine readable instructions for implementing the example central facility of and or the example instrumented application of are shown in and or . In this example the machine readable instructions comprise a program for execution by a processor such as the processor shown in the example processor platform discussed below in connection with . The program may be embodied in software stored on a tangible computer readable storage medium such as a CD ROM a floppy disk a hard drive a digital versatile disk DVD a Blu ray disk or a memory associated with the processor but the entire program and or parts thereof could alternatively be executed by a device other than the processor and or embodied in firmware or dedicated hardware. Further although the example program s is are described with reference to the flowchart s illustrated in and or many other methods of implementing the example central facility of and or the example instrumented application of may alternatively be used. For example the order of execution of the blocks may be changed and or some of the blocks described may be changed eliminated or combined.

As mentioned above the example processes of and or may be implemented using coded instructions e.g. computer and or machine readable instructions stored on a tangible computer readable storage medium such as a hard disk drive a flash memory a read only memory ROM a compact disk CD a digital versatile disk DVD a cache a random access memory RAM and or any other storage device or storage disk in which information is stored for any duration e.g. for extended time periods permanently for brief instances for temporarily buffering and or for caching of the information . As used herein the term tangible computer readable storage medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable storage device and or storage disk and to exclude propagating signals and transmission media. As used herein tangible computer readable storage medium and tangible machine readable storage medium are used interchangeably.

As used herein the term non transitory computer readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer readable storage device and or storage disk and to exclude propagating signals and transmission media. As used herein when the phrase at least is used as the transition term in a preamble of a claim it is open ended in the same manner as the term comprising is open ended.

Once the instrumented application is launched the monitoring data controller determines an application identifier of the instrumented application block . In the illustrated example the instrumented application includes an application identifier e.g. an application name that uniquely identifies the instrumented application . In some examples the application identifier is created by the media provider and or application developer. However in some examples the application identifier is provided to the media provider and or application developer by the SDK provider of the central facility when the SDK is provided.

The unique identifier determiner then determines whether a unique identifier is present on the media device block . The unique identifier is shared among one or more instrumented applications via the data store . If the unique identifier is not present on the media device the unique identifier determiner requests a unique identifier from the central facility . The unique identifier generator of the central facility may then respond with the unique identifier. The unique identifier determiner then stores the unique identifier on the media device . In some examples the unique identifier determiner does not request the unique identifier from the central facility but instead may generate the unique identifier independent of the central facility . For example the unique identifier may be based on a hardware address of the media device a username etc.

Once the unique identifier determiner has ensured that there is a unique identifier present on the media device the monitoring data controller determines whether the unique identifier and application identifier pair has been sent to the central facility block . Transmitting the unique identifier and application identifier pair enables the central facility to create the example table described in connection with . If the unique identifier and the application identifier have not previously been sent the monitoring data controller transmits the unique identifier and application identifier to the central facility block . In some examples the monitoring data controller may not determine whether the unique identifier and application identifier have previously been sent and may instead transmit the unique identifier and application identifier pair upon every launch of the instrumented application .

Once the monitoring data controller has ensured that the central facility is aware of the panelist identifier and application identifier pair the recruitment controller determines whether recruitment instructions should be presented block . In the illustrated example the recruitment controller contacts the central facility to determine whether the user and or device should be recruited. The example registration data controller of the central facility may consult the example table of to determine whether a recruitment offer should be presented to the user.

If a recruitment offer is not to be presented control terminates. The instrumented application then goes on to perform a function unrelated to audience measurement e.g. a game function a media presentation function a news presentation function etc. . In some examples the recruitment interface is not presented until the application has been launched a threshold number of times. For example the recruitment interface may be presented upon the third launch of the instrumented application . If recruitment instructions are to be presented block the recruitment controller determines the recruitment interface to be presented block . In the illustrated example the example recruitment controller determines the recruitment interface to be presented by consulting the registration data controller of the example central facility . For example the recruitment interface data column of may be queried by the registration data controller and or the recruitment controller to determine the recruitment interface data to be used when presenting the recruitment interface e.g. the example recruitment interface of . The recruitment controller then displays the recruitment interface to the user block . The recruitment controller then determines whether the user has accepted the recruitment offer presented in the recruitment interface block .

If the user has refused the offer presented in the recruiting interface e.g. by clicking the no button the recruitment controller notifies the central facility of the refusal of the recruitment interface block . Control then terminates. Similarly if the user has deferred acceptance of the offer presented in the recruitment interface control terminates. If however the user has accepted the offer presented in the recruitment interface the recruitment controller proceeds to collect demographic information associated with the user block . In the illustrated example the recruitment controller consults the registration data controller to determine what information should be requested from the user. Once the demographic information is collected the recruitment controller transmits the demographic information to the example registration data controller of the central facility . The user is then considered a panelist and monitoring is enabled. In the illustrated example the registration data controller of the central facility verifies that the demographic information is complete and stores an indication that monitoring should be enabled for the user block . In some examples the recruitment coordinator stores a monitoring instruction in the data store indicating that monitoring is enabled. Control then terminates and the example instrumented application continues to perform a function unrelated to audience measurement.

If monitoring is not enabled block the process terminates as the user is not a panelist and or has not given their consent to be monitored. If monitoring is enabled block the media monitor waits until a media event is detected. Media events may be triggered when for example the media presenter begins playing a video the media presenter displays an image e.g. an advertisement the instrumented application is restarted etc. If a media event is not detected block the media monitor continues to wait for a media event.

While in the illustrated example monitoring does not occur unless permission and or consent is given in some examples monitoring may occur regardless of whether permission and or consent is given. However the collected monitoring information is not transmitted to the central facility . That is the monitoring functionality of the instrumented application may operate but not transmit collected monitoring data unless consent is received and or not transmit collected monitoring data until the user has agreed to become a panelist. Once consent is received e.g. by detection of a monitoring instruction the monitoring data controller may transmit the previously collected monitoring information to the central facility as well as future monitoring information . In other words the monitoring instruction may be retroactive in that it authorizes previous monitoring activity.

If a media event is detected block the media monitor determines a media identifier associated with media presented by the instrumented application block . In the illustrated example the media monitor extracts media identifying metadata from an ID3 tag transmitted in association with the presented media see for example U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 341 646 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 341 661 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 443 596 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 455 961 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 472 170 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 793 991 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 793 974 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 793 983 . In some examples the media monitor determines the media identifier by extracting decoding etc. a code a signature and or a watermark embedded in the presented media.

The monitoring data controller of the illustrated example retrieves the unique identifier from the data store block . In the illustrated example the unique identifier is an encrypted panelist identifier. Encrypting the unique identifier ensures that the application does not have access to sensitive user information.

The media monitor then creates a timestamp block . Timestamping e.g. recording a time that an event occurred enables accurate identification and or correlation of media that was presented and or the time that it was presented with the user s using the media device at that time.

The monitoring data controller of the illustrated example then creates a record including the media identifier e.g. the media identifier obtained at block the unique identifier of block and the timestamp of block . In the illustrated example the record is formatted as a comma separated value CSV record. However any other type s and or format s of record may additionally or alternatively be used. For example the record may be formatted as an extensible markup language XML record.

The example monitoring data controller of the illustrated example determines whether the record should be transmitted to the example monitoring data receiver of the central facility block . In some examples records are streamed to the central facility as they are identified and or created. If the example monitoring data controller is to transmit the record to the central facility block the monitoring data controller transmits the record to the example monitoring data receiver of the example central facility block . In some examples records are stored in the data store so that they may be transmitted in a single transmission e.g. a single HTTP request a single file transfer protocol FTP command etc. . If the example monitoring data controller is not to transmit the record to the central facility block the record is stored in the data store by the monitoring data controller block .

The monitoring data controller of the illustrated example determines whether a storage threshold of the data store has been met or exceeded block . In the illustrated example the threshold represents an amount of time that records may be stored in the data store before being transmitted to the central facility . Records may be stored for for example one hour one day one week one month etc. However any other type of threshold may additionally or alternatively be used such as for example a storage limit e.g. 1 kB 64 kB 1 MB etc. . If the storage threshold is exceeded the monitoring data controller transmits the stored records to the central facility block . The media monitor then continues to wait for media events from the media presenter block . If the storage threshold is not exceeded the media monitor continues to wait for media events from the media presenter block .

While in the illustrated example a storage threshold is used to determine when to transmit monitoring information any other way of making such a determination may additionally or alternatively be used. For example monitoring information may be transmitted to the central facility at a fixed interval e.g. 30 minutes 3 hours 1 day 1 week etc. monitoring information may be transmitted in response to an external event e.g. user pushes a synchronize button the central facility requests updated monitoring information the instrumented application is started the instrumented application is exited etc. .

Next the example panel creator determines the earliest application registration date for each user and or device included in the master frame block . The example panel creator then determines a number of applications associated with each user and or device included in the master frame block . The example panel creator then determines an application associated with the earliest registration for each user and or device included in the master frame block . The example panel creator then assigns a random value to each user and or device included in the master frame block . The earliest application registration date the number of applications associated with the user and or device the application associated with the earliest registration and the random value are used by the panel creator to sort the master frame to form a sorted master frame block .

The panel creator then determines a skip rate S to be used when selecting users and or devices of the sorted master frame block . In the illustrated example the skip rate is equal to the number of users and or devices in the master frame divided by the number of users and or devices to be included in the probability panel. In some examples the skip rate is rounded down to the nearest hundredth. Accordingly when the example master frame includes ten thousand users and or devices and the desired probability panel size is four thousand and two hundred users and or devices the following skip rate may be determined 

Next the panel creator applies a selection algorithm using the skip rate to users and or devices within the master frame to be included in the probability panel. In the illustrated example the selection algorithm includes generating a random number RN between zero and the skip rate. The random number is rounded down to the nearest hundredth and then is sequentially incremented by the skip rate a total of n 1 times accounting for each user to be selected. In selecting the users and or devices the following formula may be used Integer RN 1 0.01 1

Based on the above equation the panel creator selects each user and or device i to be included in the probability panel from the sorted master frame. If for example the example master frame includes ten thousand users and or devices the desired probability panel size is four thousand and two hundred users and or devices and the random number is determined to be 2.03 the following selection would result Integer 2.03 0.01 1 3 Integer 2.03 2.38 1 0.01 1 5 Integer 2.03 2.38 2 0.01 1 7 Integer 2.03 2.38 3 0.01 1 10 Integer 2.03 2.38 4 0.01 1 12 . . . Integer 2.03 2.38 4199 0.01 1 9996

Accordingly the first selected user and or device of the probability panel is the third user and or device in the sorted master frame the second selected user and or device of the probability panel is the fifth user and or device in the sorted master frame etc. As such there is an even distribution of users and or devices selected to be in the probability panel throughout the master frame. While in the illustrated example the probability panel is created by sorting the master frame based on a number of features any other way of selecting users and or devices e.g. the probability panel from a list of users and or devices e.g. the master frame may additionally or alternatively be used. For example instead of rounding calculated values down and adding one calculated values may be rounded up to the nearest integer. Moreover the master frame may be filtered to include only users and or devices who have used a particular instrumented application may be filtered to include only users and or devices who have a particular type of device e.g. an Apple iPad may be filtered to include only users and or devices who are located in a particular geographic area etc.

The example panel creator then determines whether test cells are to be used block . Test cells enable multiple recruitment interfaces to be presented to users and or devices within the probability panel thereby enabling the monitoring entity to identify effectiveness of various recruitment interfaces. However in some examples test cells may not be used because for example the most effective recruitment interface has already been identified. If test cells are to be used the example panel creator assigns each of the users and or devices in the probability panel to one of a plurality of test cells. To assign each user and or device to a test cell a random value is generated equal to an integer from one to the number of test cells. Using the selection order from the selection algorithm the panel creator assigns the first selected user and or device to the test cell associated with the random value. The random value is incremented by one and applied to the next selected user and or device. This process is repeated until all selected users and or devices of the probability panel have been assigned to a test cell. The example panel creator stores the assignment in the data store in a format similar to for example the example table of .

Finally the panel creator updates the user registration information to enable recruitment of the selected users and or devices block . Accordingly when the recruitment coordinator of the instrumented application determines whether to display the recruitment interface the appropriate action can be taken.
