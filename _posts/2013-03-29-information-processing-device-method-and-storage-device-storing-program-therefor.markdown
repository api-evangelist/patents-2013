This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 081046 filed on Mar. 30 2012. The entire subject matter of the application is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to an information processing device having a user interface configured to display various setting items and receive setting input a method and a computer readable storage device therefor.

In information processing devices such as a personal computer and peripheral devices such as a printer and a scanner a user interface to be used by a user to set various setting items for executing respective functions is provided. It is common that such a user interface is configured to receive user operations e.g. selection of enabling disabling respective setting items selection of setting values using a keyboard and or mouse are received with displaying a setting screen for receiving user input of respective setting items.

When a plurality of setting items are set some setting items may have exclusive relationship. That is some setting items may not be set simultaneously e.g. setting of one setting item may restrict setting of another setting item . For example if the number of colors for scanning an image is set to 256 colors a resolution of the image is limited to 600 dpi or lower. In such a case the number of colors and the resolution for scanning have exclusive relationship and it is impossible to set the number of colors to 256 colors and the resolution to more than 600 dpi at the same time.

When such an exclusive relationship exists the setting items are displayed as gray out items or removed from a selection item list so that the items having the exclusive relationship cannot be selected simultaneously.

In such a user interface however a user may be confused since he she may not understand why such items are not selectable and or how he she can select such gray out items. Depending on a device configuration when the user selects a particular setting item which causes a conflicting problem between the selected setting item and another setting item a set value of the other setting item may be automatically changed in order to avoid the conflicting condition between the setting items. As a result the user may be confused since a result different from the user s intent may be output since the user does not realize such an automatic change of the setting value.

For such a problem there has been known a user interface which is configured to judge whether a conflicting condition occurs mutually among setting items and prompt a user to reset the settings by displaying a list of the conflicting items and an error message.

The above described conventional technique only displays a dialogue indicating the list of the conflicting setting items and an error message when the conflicting condition occurs. Therefore the user can recognize that there occurs a conflicting condition mutually among a plurality of setting items. However in order to resolve the conflicting condition the user needs to close the dialogue open a setting window for the corresponding setting items and make necessary change. Such a configuration is not convenient to the user.

The aspects of the present invention is intended to provide in consideration of the above problem an improved user interface with which the user can resolve the problem of conflicting setting items when the conflicting condition occurs.

In consideration of the above background the present invention is advantageous in that there is provided an information processing device having a display device and a control device. The control device is configured to execute instructions to provide a setting value receiving unit configured to display a selection window allowing a user to setting value for each of a plurality of setting items and to receive each by the user on the display unit a selection completion operation receiving unit configured to receive the user operation indicating completion of selection of the setting value for each of the plurality of setting items a conflicting condition judging unit configured to judge when the selection completion operation receiving unit receives the user operation indicating the completion of the selection whether a conflicting condition in which the user attempts to set a plurality of setting values that are not allowed to be set simultaneously occurs a first resetting unit configured to display a first resetting window showing one or a plurality of first effective setting values respectively corresponding to one of the conflicting setting values or a plurality of simultaneously selectable values and allowing the user to select the one or the plurality of the first effective setting values if the conflicting condition occurs and a conflict resolving unit configured to resolve the conflicting condition by receiving user operation of selecting a setting value from the one or the plurality of first effective setting values if the conflicting condition occurs.

According to aspects of the invention there is also provided an information processing device a display device and a control device. The control device is configured to execute processes of displaying a selection window allowing a user to select setting value for each of a plurality of setting items receiving each selection of setting value by the user on the display device receiving the user operation indicating completion of selection of the setting value for each of the plurality of setting items judging when the user operation indicating the completion of the selection is received whether a conflicting condition in which the user attempts to set a plurality of setting values that are not allowed to be set simultaneously occurs displaying a first resetting window showing one or a plurality of first effective setting values respectively corresponding to one of the conflicting setting values or a plurality of simultaneously selectable values receiving user selection of the one or the plurality of the first effective setting values when the conflicting condition occurs and resolving the conflicting condition by receiving a setting value selected from the one or the plurality of first effective setting values when the conflicting condition occurs.

Configured as above the information processing device judges whether conflicting condition occurs after the setting values have been set. when the conflicting condition occurs the first resetting window is displayed to allow the user to select one of a conflicting setting values which is validated. With such a configuration when the conflicting condition occurs among a plurality of setting items a user interface which enables resolution of the conflicting condition easily.

It is noted that the each unit provided to the information processing device according to the embodiment can be realized by a computer and a program that causes the computer to function as respective units.

Hereinafter a preferred embodiment according to the invention will be described referring to the accompanying drawings.

As shown in an information processing system according to the embodiment includes a personal computer PC and an MFP multi function peripheral which are mutually communicably connected through a network . The MFP is a multi function device having functions of scanner for scanning an image on an original printer for printing images on print medium such as print sheets OHP sheets and the like.

The PC which serves as the information processing device and has a well known configuration includes a CPU central processing unit a ROM read only memory a RAM random access memory a hard disk drive HDD an input unit a display unit a USB universal serial bus interface a LAN local area network interface and the like. The display unit includes a display device such as a liquid crystal display.

In the HDD various kinds of software programs are installed. Among them software with which the PC communicates with the MFP and controls the scanning function of the MFP to scan an image receives image data generated by the MFP from the MFP is included hereinafter such software will be referred to as scan compliant software .

The scan compliant software is configured such that the user can set various setting items e.g. the number of colors resolution the size of an original etc. used for scanning with the MFP . Thus when the user of the PC uses the scan compliant software to send an instruction to start scanning from the PC and or when a scan even designating the PC is received from the MFP and the scan compliant software is started setting values of the various setting items which have been set for the scan compliant software are transmitted to the MFP . Then the MFP executes the scanning using the thus received i.e. transmitted from the PC setting values.

The MFP is provided with a CPU a ROM a RAM an operation display unit a LAN interface a USB interface a scanner unit and a printer unit .

The CPU is configured to control respective units of the MFP and executes various operations in accordance with various programs and data stored in the ROM . The RAM is used as a main memory which is directly accessed by the CPU . The operation display unit has a touch panel and various operation buttons not shown to receive user s operation. The scanner unit has an image sensor and scans an image on an original and generates image data representing the scanned image. The printer unit is configured to print images on the print medium.

Next concrete user s operations in which the user can set setting values of each of the setting items for scanning with the scan compliant software and respective setting procedures will be described in detail. In order for the user of the PC to set respective setting items the user firstly starts the scan compliant software in the PC . When a predetermined operation to call up a scan setting window when the scan compliant software is running the scan setting window A initial window shown in is displayed on the display unit .

When the user performs certain operation to set select desired settings on the scan setting window A the user can set desired setting values to the respective setting items. The example of the setting window A shown in is configured such that the user can set the setting items of resolution the number of colors original size both side scanning brightness contrast and carrier sheet mode. When the user clicks an EXTENDED SETTING button shown in the setting window A an extended setting window B initial window as shown in is displayed. In the exemplary extended setting window B shown in the user can set the setting items of inclination compensation removal of blank sheet automatic orientation recognition and double feed detection.

Among the setting items ones of both side scanning carrier sheet mode inclination compensation blank sheet removal automatic orientation recognition and double feed detection are so called true false setting items and the user selects whether each functions is used or not i.e. whether each function is effective when the scanning is executed . For example when the user checks a check box for the both side scanning in the scan setting window A the function of both side scanning is effective and the MFP scans a double sided original automatically.

In contrast the setting items of resolution the number of colors original size brightness and contrast are so called multiple choice setting items in which a selected one of a plurality of predetermined setting values selectable for each setting item is set. For example when the user intends to set the resolution for scanning to 600 dpi dots per inch the user simply selects 600 dpi in a drop down list for the setting item of the resolution in the scan setting window W. The the 600 dpi is set as the resolution when scanning is executed.

When the scan compliant software is started and the scan setting window is firstly displayed a default setting value is set to each setting item. The exemplary windows shown in are the initially displayed windows in which each setting item is set to the default setting value. The default values are predetermined for respective setting items. Regarding the true false setting items each check box is shown in an unchecked state i.e. the function is not effective . It should be noted that the setting values initially set need not be limited to the default values and previously set setting values may be retained and displayed as the initial setting values.

Incidentally the setting items shown in the scan setting window A include the carrier sheet mode while the setting items shown in the extended setting items include the inclination compensation and the double feed detection. Due to a specification of the MFP according to the exemplary embodiment the carrier sheet mode and the inclination compensation or the double feed detection have an exclusive relationship. That is the carrier sheet mode and the inclination compensation cannot be set i.e. made effective simultaneously. Similarly the carrier sheet mode and the double feed detection cannot be set i.e. made effective simultaneously.

According to the specification of the conventional scan compliant software if the user puts a check to the carrier sheet mode in the scan setting window i.e. the carrier sheet mode is made effective and then the user opens the extended setting window the setting items of the inclination compensation and the double feed detection are displayed in a gray out manner i.e. displayed as items which cannot be set . In such a case the user may be confused since he she may not understand why the setting items are indicated as gray out items with what operation the gray out setting items turn to be selectable. Similarly if the user firstly puts checks to the inclination compensation and or the double feed detection in the extended setting window and then returns to the scan setting window the carrier sheet mode is displayed as a gray out setting item which is not selectable. In such a case the user is also confused.

The above example of the exclusive relationship i.e. conflicting relationship is a relationship between the true false setting items. It is noted that according to the exemplary embodiment the conflicting relationship also exists between the true false setting item and the multiple choice setting item and between the multiple choice setting items.

For example the both side scanning and the original size of longer than an A4 size sheet cannot be selected simultaneously since they mutually conflict with each other. In the conventional art if the user puts a check to the both side scanning in the scan setting window and then displays a drop list of the original size sizes longer than the A4 size are not displayed in the drop list. Then the user may be confused since he she does not know why the original sizes longer than the A4 size are not selectable or how to select the longer sizes. Alternatively if the user selects the original size e.g. A3 size longer than the A4 size and then puts a check to the both side scanning the original size is automatically changed to the A4 size according to the conventional specification. In such a case the user may be confused since he she does not understand the reason why the original size is automatically changed to the A4 size.

For example the resolution and the number of colors have the conflicting relationship. That is normally the user can select one of the resolutions which are values determined stepwise within a range from 100 dpi to 19200 dpi. The number of colors can be selected from black and white gray 256 step gray scale 256 colors thousand colors and the like.

However if the user has selected the 256 colors as the number of colors the resolution that can be set is limited to 600 dpi or lower. Thus the 256 colors and the resolution greater than 600 dpi conflict with each other and cannot be set at the same time. In the conventional art for example if the user has selected the resolution of 1200 dpi and views the drop down list for the number of colors 256 colors is not included in the list which causes the user to be confused.

In contrast according to the exemplary embodiment the user can select any setting item in each of the scan setting window and the extended setting window without being hindered in selecting the setting values.

That is according to the exemplary embodiment even if the user puts a check for the carrier sheet mode in the scan setting window the user is allowed to select any setting items including the conflicting setting items of the inclination compensation and the double feed detection or vice versa. In other words at a stage where the user is selecting determining the setting values the user is allowed to select determine respective setting values without being bothered by the restriction due to the conflicting relationship. Thus at the stage of setting selecting as shown in i.e. the scan setting window A and i.e. the extended setting window B the user can set the setting values freely even if the setting items values have the conflicting relationship.

After the user s setting selection has completed and an operation to confirm the user s intention is made in the scan setting window i.e. the OK button is clicked whether there are setting values having the conflicting relationship is judged.

Judgment as to whether there are conflicting setting values is made with referring to the conflicting group list shown in . The conflicting group list is a pre stored data structure which is stored in the HDD of the PC . The conflicting group list shows a combination of mutually conflicting setting values for each setting item as a conflicting group i.e. exclusive setting group data and a plurality of pieces of the exclusive setting group data are listed. Specifically in the example shown in three pieces of exclusive group data and are listed in this order. A first piece of exclusive setting group data indicates a combination of mutually conflicting three items the carrier sheet mode the inclination compensation and the double feed detection.

Within one exclusive setting group data a basic exclusive setting item is arranged at a top of the group data followed by the exclusive setting item which is a setting item conflicting with the basic exclusive setting item.

Regarding the first exclusive setting group data the carrier sheet mode is the basic exclusive setting item and the inclination compensation and the double feed detection are arranged as exclusive setting items subsequently. The basic exclusive setting item which is arranged at the top of the exclusive setting group data is referred to firstly when the conflicting is checked. Specifically the basic exclusive setting item includes basic exclusive setting item information representing a name of the setting item basic exclusive setting value information representing a basic exclusive setting value which is a setting value causing the setting item to conflict with the conflicting setting item basic exclusive setting value type information representing a type of the basic exclusive setting value and a re setting process object count.

The basic exclusive setting value type information may represent at least two types same value and restrict value. The same value means that there is a possibility that the conflicting condition occurs if the same setting values as the basic exclusive setting value set to the basic exclusive setting value information is selected. The restrict value means that there is a possibility that the conflicting condition occurs if a setting value exceeding a threshold value which is the basic exclusive setting value set to the basic exclusive setting value information is selected. Incidentally a value true in the basic exclusive setting value information is a value set to the true false setting item and means that the setting item is currently valid.

For example the basic exclusive setting item of the first exclusive setting group data indicates that there is a possibility that the setting item conflict with another setting item value if the setting value selected for the carrier sheet mode is the same as the basic exclusive setting value i.e. true that is the carrier sheet mode is currently available. For another example the basic exclusive setting item in the third exclusive setting group represents that there is a possibility that the setting item conflicts with another setting item value if a setting value selected as the number of colors is the same as the basic exclusive setting value i.e. 256 colors that is if the 256 colors is selected. It is noted that the count of resetting process object has an initial value of zero and incremented by one every time when another setting value conflicting with the present basic exclusive setting item is found in a process of conflicting check.

In each of the pieces of exclusive setting group data and the exclusive setting items which are arranged next to the basic exclusive setting item at the top are subsequently referred to when the setting value identical to the basic exclusive setting item. Specifically the exclusive setting items include exclusive setting item information exclusive setting value information exclusive setting value type information and re setting process object flag.

Among them the exclusive setting item information the exclusive setting value information and the exclusive setting value type information correspond to the basic exclusive setting item information basic exclusive setting value information and basic exclusive value information respectively. Meaning and relationship among the exclusive setting item information the exclusive setting value information and the exclusive setting value type information are the same as those among the basic exclusive setting item information basic exclusive setting value information and basic exclusive value information.

For example if the complete check is performed when the carrier sheet mode and the double feed detection are selected and the inclination compensation is not selected firstly a check based on the first exclusive setting group data is executed. It is judged whether a value identical to the value set as the basic exclusive setting item i.e. the carrier sheet mode in this example is selected. Since in this example the carrier sheet mode is selected it is judged that regarding at least the basic exclusive setting items the same setting value is selected and judgment regarding the next setting item i.e. inclination compensation is done. In this example since the inclination compensation is not selected the resetting process object flag of the inclination compensation is remained to be the initial value of non objective and the count of resetting process object of the basic exclusive setting item is also remained to be the initial value of zero. Further the next exclusive setting item i.e. double feed detection is examined to judge whether the contained value is identical to the set value i.e. double feed detection being selected . In this example since the double feed detection is selected the resetting process object flag of the double feed detection is set to object and the count of the resetting process object of the basic exclusive setting item is incremented by one i.e. set to 1 .

For another example if the complete check is performed when the both side scan is selected and A4 size is selected as the original size firstly a check based on the first exclusive setting group data is executed. In this example since the double side scan does not match the carrier sheet mode that is set to the basic exclusive setting item upon judging the same judgment based on the first exclusive setting group data is terminated and judgment based on the second exclusive setting data group will be performed. Initially it is judged whether a setting value identical to the value set to the basic exclusive setting item i.e. both side scan is selected. In this example since the both side scan is selected at least regarding the basic exclusive setting item it is judged that the same value is selected. Then judgment regarding the next exclusive setting item will be performed. Regarding the next exclusive setting item i.e. original size since the exclusive setting value type is restrict it is judged whether the selected original size is larger than the set value A4 size which has been set to the exclusive setting value. Since the A4 size is selected as the original size in this example the resetting process object flag regarding the original size is remained to be the initial value of non objective and the count of the resetting process object of the basic exclusive setting item is remained to have the initial value of zero.

Description on setting and resetting of the setting items will be continued. In the scan setting window see when the OK button is clicked the examination of the competition or the conflicting check based on the conflicting group lists is executed. As a result of the examination of competition or conflicting check if it is judged that there are setting values which has a conflicting relationship a message indicating the conflicting condition and a resetting window are displayed to urge the user to perform re selection i.e. re set .

For example if both the carrier sheet mode and the double feed detection are checked and the setting operation is completed i.e. the OK button is clicked the conflicting condition between the two settings in the conflicting check and a resetting window A as shown in is displayed.

In the resetting window A a message indicating that items which cannot be set selected at the same time are currently set selected and such items are displayed as a selection list. On left side of each setting items on the list a radio button with which the user select one of the items is provided. On this window the user can reselect one of the carrier sheet mode and the double feed detection . When the user makes a reselection the reselected item is made valid while unselected items are made invalid and the conflicting condition is resolved. For example if the carrier sheet mode is reselected and made valid the double feed detection is invalid. In the resetting window A the user is urged to select only one item. However since all the conflicting items are displayed in the same window the user can examine and select the important one of the listed items. If all the carrier sheet mode double feed check and inclination compensation are checked the resetting window A as shown in may be displayed. In this case if the user selects the carrier sheet mode it is made valid while the double feed detection and the inclination compensation are made invalid.

If there are a plurality of conflicting combinations it is possible to display all the conflicting combinations in one window or it is also possible to display one conflicting combination in one window. In the latter case simply by showing a NEXT button to be clicked by the user on the resetting window other windows respectively showing other conflicting combinations can be displayed subsequently.

If at least one of the conflicting setting items is the multiple choice item the resetting window shows the fact that a plurality of setting items which cannot be set at the same time and the conflicting setting items one of which is to be selected are displayed for the multiple choice setting items currently selected setting values are displayed . Further for the multiple choice setting item if there are one or more selectable values explanation of such selectable values e.g. a selectable value range is also displayed. For example when the 256 colors is selected as the number of colors and the 1200 dpi is selected as the resolution since these setting items conflict with each other the resetting window B as shown in is displayed.

In the resetting window B as shown in each setting items values 256 colors and 1200 dpi is displayed and a message that the items cannot be selected simultaneously and one of the items the user wishes to prioritize should be selected is indicated. Further on the right side of the item of the number of colors an indication notifying that the user only can select the resolution of 600 dpi or less if the user selects i.e. prioritize the number of colors i.e. if the number of colors is 600 dpi or less both setting items can be selected . In addition on the right side of the item of the resolution an indication notifying that the user only can select the number of colors is changed to the number other than 256 colors if the user selects i.e. prioritize the resolution of 1200 dpi. As shown in a radio button is arranged on the left side of each setting item which allows the user to select one of the 256 colors and the 1200 dpi resolution. When the user re selects the setting item the selected setting item value becomes effective.

If the setting item which is not selected in the resetting window B shown in is the multiple choice setting item another window i.e. a multiple choice resetting window as shown in is displayed. The example shown in is a window when the two multiple choice setting items conflict with each other. If the 256 colors is selected in the resetting window B in the multiple choice resetting window shown indicates a list of settable values i.e. non conflicting setting values when the 256 colors is selected. With this configuration the user can re select the resolution within a range which does not conflict with the 256 colors .

Meanwhile if the user selects the resolution of 1200 dpi in the resetting window B that is if the user intends to prioritize the resolution and clicks the NEXT button a list of the numbers of colors which can be set without conflicting with the resolution of 1200 dpi is displayed in the multiple choice resetting window. In this case therefore the user can select the number of colors within a limited range which does not conflict with the selected resolution.

As described above in the multiple choice resetting window a list of non conflicting setting values for the setting item s which is are not selected by the user in the resetting window B is are displayed. The user can select any one of the listed setting values within a limited range without causing the conflicting condition.

As well known if the user clicks the RETURN button in the multiple choice resetting window control returns to the resetting window B and the user can select the setting item to be prioritized again. In the multiple choice resetting window if the number of selectable values are too many the list may be displayed using a well known drop down list.

Next a setting window display process which is executed when a predetermined operation is performed to display the scan setting window after the scan compliant software is started in the PC referring to flowcharts shown in .

When the setting window display process is started the CPU of the PC generates a dialogue of the scan setting window S retrieves current setting values from the setting data stored in the HDD S and sets controls on the dialogue. The setting values set at this stage may be predetermined initial values i.e. default values or previously set values which were used when the setting window process was previously executed. The CPU generates the dialogue in an area on the RAM . Based on the thus generated dialogue the CPU displays the scan setting window i.e. the initial window shown in in S.

Next the CPU judges whether a mouse is operated S . If the mouse is operated S YES the CPU judges whether the OK button is clicked S . If the OK button is not

clicked S NO the CPU executes a process corresponding to an operated control S and returns to S. Thus in S settings selections of various setting items performed by the user on the scan setting window and extended setting window are received. If the OK button is clicked S YES the CPU proceeds to S where a conflicting values checking process for exclusive setting items is called.

The conflicting values checking process is shown in . The CPU initialize a return variable to NOT CONFLICTING S and judges whether there is exclusive setting group data in the conflicting group list in S. If there is no exclusive setting group data in the conflicting group list S NO the conflicting values checking process is terminated. If there is the exclusive setting group data S YES the CPU set the exclusive setting group data at the top of the conflicting group list e.g. in the example of the first exclusive setting group data as the data subject to the process S and the CPU proceeds to S.

In S the CPU initializes the count of object of resetting process of the exclusive setting group data i.e. sets to zero and retrieves the current setting value i.e. the setting value actually selected in the scan setting window of an object to be processed which is indicated by the basic exclusive setting item information. For example when the first exclusive setting group data is the object to be processed the CPU retrieves the setting value of the carrier sheet mode i.e. whether the carrier sheet mode is selected or not in S. Then in S the CPU retrieves the basic exclusive setting value type information and the basic exclusive setting value information and the CPU judges whether the basic exclusive setting value type is the SAME VALUE or not.

If the basic exclusive setting value type is the SAME VALUE S YES the CPU judges whether the current setting value is equal to the basic exclusive setting value S . If the current setting value is not equal to the basic exclusive setting value S NO the CPU proceeds to S. If the current setting value is equal to the basic exclusive setting value S YES the CPU proceeds to S as the same value is selected for at least the basic exclusive setting item. In other words if the carrier sheet mode is selected in the above example the CPU proceeds to S.

If the basic exclusive setting value type is not the SAME VALUE i.e. the type is the RESTRICT the CPU judges whether the current setting value exceeds the basic exclusive setting value S . If the current setting value does not exceed the basic exclusive setting value S NO the CPU proceeds to S. If the current setting value exceeds the basic exclusive setting value S YES which means that the selected setting value of at least the currently examined basic exclusive setting item may cause the conflicting condition and the CPU proceeds to S.

In S onwards the CPU judges whether conflicting exclusive setting items are actually selected. Specifically the CPU sets top exclusive setting item information in each exclusive setting item in the exclusive setting group data subject to the process in S. Then the CPU initializes the resetting process object flag to NON OBJECTIVE in S. In S the CPU retrieves the current setting value of the object designated by the exclusive setting item information i.e. the setting value actually selected in the scan setting window . For example if the inclination compensation in the first exclusive setting group data is the current object the CPU retrieves the setting value i.e. whether it is selected or not of the inclination compensation. Then in S the CPU retrieves the exclusive setting value type information and exclusive setting information and judges whether the exclusive setting value type is the SAME VALUE or not in S.

If the exclusive setting value type is the SAME VALUE S YES the CPU judges whether the current setting value is equal to the exclusive setting value in S. If the current setting value is not equal to the exclusive setting value S NO the CPU proceeds to S. If the current setting value is equal to the exclusive setting value S YES the CPU proceeds to S as the same setting value is selected at least regarding the currently processed exclusive setting item. That is in the above example if the inclination compensation is selected the CPU proceeds to S.

If the exclusive setting value type is not the SAME VALUE i.e. the value type is RESTRICT the CPU judges whether the current setting value exceeds the exclusive setting value S . If the current setting value does not exceed the exclusive setting value S NO the CPU proceeds to S. If the current setting value exceeds the exclusive setting value S YES the CPU proceeds to S as the setting value regarding the currently processed exclusive setting item causes the conflicting condition.

In S the CPU increments the count of the resetting process object of the exclusive setting group data subject to process by one and sets the resetting process object flag of the exclusive setting item of the processed object to OBJECTIVE S . In S the CPU sets the return variable to CONFLICTING . In S the CPU judges whether there is next exclusive setting item information in the processed exclusive setting group data.

If the there is no next exclusive setting item information S NO the CPU judges whether there is next exclusive setting group data in the conflicting group list S . If there is the next exclusive setting item information S YES the CPU makes the next exclusive setting group data as the process object S and returns to S. If there is no next exclusive setting group data S NO that is the third exclusive group data which is at the last of the list has been processed in the example shown in the CPU terminates the exclusive setting item conflicting values checking process.

When the conflicting values checking process shown in is completed the CPU proceeds to S and judges whether there are conflicting values in the various setting values. Specifically the judgment is made based on whether the return variable is set to CONFLICTING or not. If the return variable is set to CONFLICTING S YES the CPU judges that the conflicting condition is occurring and proceeds to the exclusive setting item resetting process S . If the return variable is not set to COMPEING S NO the CPU judges that there is no conflicting condition and proceeds to S. In S the CPU stores the setting values selected modified by the user as the finally set values in the setting data stored in the HDD . Thus when the scan is performed the stored setting values are transmitted to the MFP for use.

The exclusive setting item resetting process S is shown in . In S the CPU set the exclusive setting group data at the top of the conflicting group list as the process object. Then in S the CPU retrieves the count of the resetting process object. In S the CPU judges whether the retrieved count value is greater than zero or not. If the count value is not greater than zero S NO the CPU proceeds to S otherwise S YES the CPU proceeds to the resetting window process S .

Thereafter the CPU initializes a character string variable by setting a null string therein S sets the process object to next exclusive setting item information in the currently processed exclusive setting group data S and obtains the flag value of the resetting process object flag. In S the CPU judges whether the obtained flag value is OBJECTIVE or not.

If the flag value is NON OBJECTIVE S NO the CPU proceeds to S. If the flag value is OBJECT S YES the CPU obtains the text of the setting item name designated by the exclusive setting item information and add the same to the character string variable S . With this process the text and radio button which are displayed in the resetting window. Specifically the text and radio button on the second line in the item name list in the resetting window are generated.

In S the CPU judges whether there is next exclusive setting item information. If there exists the next exclusive setting item information S YES the CPU returns to S and executes the above described process from S with setting the next exclusive setting item information to the next process object If there is not next exclusive setting item information S NO the CPU proceeds to S. In S the CPU retrieves the text from the character string variable and arranges the text and the radio button in the dialogue. With this process the text indicative of the exclusive setting item and the radio button are arranged as shown on the second line of the list shown in . Then in S the dialogue is actually displayed as the resetting window on the display unit . Thereafter in S the CPU executes a process in response to the user s operation of the dialogue on the resetting window. That is a process in response to the user s operation in the resetting window as shown in B or C. Then the CPU judges whether the resetting has completed S . If the resetting has completed S YES the resetting window process is terminated and the CPU proceeds to S see .

In S the CPU obtains the exclusive setting value type of the setting item which was not selected in the resetting window in the resetting window process S and judges whether the obtained value type is the RESTRCT or not S . If the type value is not RESTRCT S NO the CPU proceeds to S. If the value type is RESTRICT S YES the process proceeds to the multiple choice resetting window S .

The multiple choice resetting window which is called at S see the above is shown in . In S the CPU generates a dialogue for the multiple choice resetting window cf. obtains the text for explanation corresponding to the setting items which were not selected in the resetting window S and arrange the same in the dialogue. For example if the 256 colors was selected and 1200 dpi was not selected in the resetting window of the text would be as shown in . Further in S the CPU obtains a text of one of the names of multiple choices within a selectable range from among the multiple choices which were not selected in the resetting window and arranges the same in the dialogue together with the radio button.

In S the CPU judges whether there is a next selectable choice. As far as there is a selectable choice the CPU returns to S and repeats the same process. By repeating steps S S the radio buttons corresponding to the selectable choices are arranged on the dialogue as shown in . In S if the CPU judges that there is no selectable choice S NO the CPU displays the multiple choice resetting window on the display unit S . Thereafter the CPU executes a process in response to the user s re selecting operation on the multiple choice resetting window S . Then the CPU judges whether resetting has completed. S . If the resetting has completed S YES the CPU terminates the multiple choice resetting process and proceeds to S .

In S the CPU updates the conflicting setting values in accordance with the reset reselect values by S. Then in S the CPU judges whether there is next exclusive setting group data. If the next exclusive setting group exists S YES the CPU sets the next exclusive setting group data to the process object S and returns to S. If no exclusive setting group exists S NO the CPU displays a resetting completion window notifying that the resetting has completed S terminates the exclusive setting item resetting process and proceeds to S .

In S the setting values selected set in the above steps are stored in the setting value data which is stored in the HDD and the setting window display process is terminated.

According to the above described information processing system according to the exemplary embodiment the user can set select the setting items and values freely in the scan setting window and the extended setting window without being bothered by the conflicting condition. After the setting has completed the user can recognize details of the conflicting condition if it occurs in the resetting window and the user can easily modify the setting selection to resolve the conflicting condition. Therefore operability in resolving the conflicting condition is improved.

If the setting item which is not selected in the resetting window is the multi choice setting item the multi choice resetting window is displayed and setting items which do not conflict with the other setting item value are displayed in a list. Therefore the user can recognize the selectable choice clearly and resetting reselecting the multi choice setting items although within a limited range for choice easily.

According to the exemplary embodiment the conflicting group list see is preliminarily prepared to judge occurrence of the conflicting condition. Therefore whether the conflicting condition occurs or not can be judges simply and definitely.

If there are three or more conflicting setting values within single exclusive setting group data and one of such values conflict with a plurality of other setting values e.g. carrier sheet mode in the setting value is set as the basic exclusive setting item in the conflicting group list. Using such a data structure the conflicting group list can be configured efficiently.

It should be noted that the present invention should not be limited to the above described exemplary embodiment but can be modified in various ways without departing the scope of the invention.

For example the conflicting group list shown in is only an example of such a list. Further judging of the conflicting condition can be made in various ways. That is using the conflicting group list is only an example of concrete methods of judging the conflicting condition.

Further the windows shown in A D are only examples and different setting windows can be employed depending on scanning functions of the MFP and or functions of the scan compliant software of the PC .
