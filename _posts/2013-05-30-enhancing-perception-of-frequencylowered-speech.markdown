This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 653 599 filed May 31 2012 the entire disclosure of which including its appendix is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DC010601 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Some embodiments of this invention pertain to a hearing aid device or device system that performs negative rank ordering of frequency of an input audio signal which among other things improves recognition of sibilant fricatives over conventional techniques.

A variety of conventional techniques for assisting those with high frequency hearing loss involve lowering high frequency speech information into lower frequency regions. Common to all these techniques is a positive rank scaling of frequency such that the ordering from lowest to highest of frequency components in the higher frequency region of the input that is to be moved to the lower frequency region is maintained in the output after lowering into the lower frequency region .

For example illustrates some of these conventional techniques involving positive rank scaling. In particular illustrates an example frequency range of sound a high frequency region which is illustrated as inaudible to a theoretical hearing impaired person and a low frequency region which is illustrated as audible to the theoretical hearing impaired person.

To elaborate illustrates a conventional linear frequency compression technique . This technique searches for sound within the high frequency inaudible region . If sound is detected within the high frequency inaudible region such as during time period the entire frequency range is linearly compressed so that it fits within the lower frequency audible region . This linear compression is illustrated in with the uniform zigzag line which has consistent internal angles. Such linear compression exhibits positive rank scaling by maintaining in the post compression output the ordering of the frequencies present in the input sound pre compression. When the hearing aid device does not detect sound within the high frequency inaudible region no compression of the input sound occurs such as during time periods and

The above discussed memory device systems and computer readable mediums are one or more non transitory computer readable memories or mediums according to at least some embodiments of the present invention.

In addition to the embodiments described above further embodiments will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by study of the following detailed description.

It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.

The inventor notes that a shortcoming of the conventional techniques of and other conventional techniques involving positive rank scaling in shifted frequencies is an increase in confusion between the sibilant fricatives s and or sh . In particular frequency lowered s is more often perceived as which naturally has a lower spectral peak. Data gathered under the direction of the inventor has revealed an unexpected relationship between the frequency lowered spectral peak and perception a nonmonotonic relationship exists such that perception of s returns when spectral peaks are very low in frequency. See e.g. which illustrates a relationship between spectral peak frequency and perception of s .

Some embodiments of the present invention utilize this relationship by generating an output audio signal at least by transposing e.g. by lowering in frequency and causing a negative rank ordering or scaling of at least a portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal. In some embodiments this negative rank ordering or scaling is implemented as a reciprocal function of frequency at least in a frequency band of interest where at least the frequency band is inverted so that what is very high in frequency at the input becomes very low in frequency at the output and what is toward the middle of the spectrum on the input stays toward the middle of the spectrum at the output e.g. closer to its natural place of origin . See e.g. which illustrates an example frequency I O relationship that preserves s and discrimination after lowering the input frequency with negative rank ordering or scaling according to some embodiments of the present invention.

With respect to the natural productions of s across talkers and articulatory contexts have peak energy between 4 and 10 kHz e.g. the input region denoted by reference numerals and and natural productions of have peak energy between 2 and 5 kHz e.g. the input regions denoted by reference numerals and as well as some overlap not shown in with regions and between 4 and 5 kHz on the input side . At higher output frequencies e.g. 500 Hz represented by regions and peak energy will more likely be perceived as . In this regard reference numeral represents a region where a frequency lowered e.g. by way of negative rank ordering or scaling of frequency s would likely be perceived as . At the lowest output frequencies e.g.

The example embodiments of illustrate non linear compression with the non uniform zigzag line having differing internal angles. The compression applied may vary based on a human listener s personal characteristics and further details and examples of such compression with respect to some embodiments of the present invention are provided with respect to discussed below. In some embodiments the compression may be provided by sine wave oscillators that synthesize frequencies lowered by a negative rank ordering process according to an embodiment of the present invention following signal analysis via Fast Fourier Transform.

The formation of the output audio signal by way of a negative rank scaling of frequency according to at least one embodiment of the present invention has been demonstrated to improve recognition of not only of s and but also for other phonemes including t k z d j t ch and j y as compared to conventional positive rank scaling techniques.

The sound receiving device system may include one or more microphones and any associated circuitry e.g. an analog to digital ADC converter configured to generate the input audio signal from the received sound.

Alternatively the filtering conditioning circuitry may be considered at least part of the sound receiving device system as circuitry associated with one or more microphones and configured to generate the input audio signal.

Although not shown in one or more internal power sources for the hearing aid device are included to provide power to each of the hardware components and . Similarly with respect to one or more power sources are included to provide power to each of the hardware components and although such one or more power sources are not shown in .

At a fundamental level according to some embodiments the method includes the data processing device system receiving an input audio signal e.g. according to program instructions associated with block and generating at least in some cases or at some point in time an output audio signal e.g. according to program instructions associated with block or at least by transposing and causing a negative rank ordering or scaling of frequency e.g. according to program instructions associated with block of at least a portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal. In some embodiments for example the output audio signal is generated at least by transposing and causing a negative rank ordering or scaling of a high frequency portion of the input audio signal the high frequency portion of the input audio signal becoming a low frequency portion of the output audio signal. In this regard the low frequency portion of the output audio signal may represent an inverted ordering of frequencies present in the high frequency portion of the input audio signal.

In some embodiments the input audio signal received according to program instructions associated with block may be the input audio signal output directly from the sound receiving device system in or in embodiments where the filtering conditioning circuitry exists may be the input audio signal as filtered or conditioned by the filtering conditioning circuitry .

In embodiments employing the method the input audio signal may be analyzed according to program instructions associated with block to determine if high frequency speech is present in the input audio signal. In some embodiments block employs a frication detector to detect high frequency aperiodic noise associated with the fricative affricative and stop consonant sound classes. However the invention is not limited to any particular high frequency speech detection and any other high frequency speech detection technique known in the art may be used for block . For example a spectral balance detector or a more complicated analysis of modulation frequency and depth or a combination of parameters or any other technique known in the art may be implemented for block . In addition it should be noted that the processing associated with block need not be implemented by the processing device s in and instead may be implemented by the filtering conditioning circuitry according to some embodiments of the present invention.

If a viable high frequency speech pattern e.g. frication is identified in the input audio signal at block processing may proceed at least to block where negative rank ordering or scaling of frequency is performed on at least a portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal. However if a viable high frequency speech pattern e.g. frication is not identified in the input audio signal at block the input audio signal is passed through to the next stage of processing e.g. the input audio signal may be merely passed through as the output audio signal to the sound producing device system and at block and no negative rank ordering or scaling of the input audio signal is performed according to some embodiments.

In this regard the determination associated with block may be considered a selector that continually analyzes the input audio signal and determines whether or not negative rank ordering or scaling of frequency is applied to various portions e.g. frequency ranges time segments or both of the input audio signal. For example assume that the input audio signal is considered an input audio signal stream that is continually analyzed by the negative rank ordering or scaling selector of block and the output audio signal generated by the data processing device system based upon the input audio signal stream is an output audio signal stream. In this case if the negative rank ordering or scaling selector of block identifies a high frequency speech pattern present in a first portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal stream the data processing device system may generate in response to the high frequency speech pattern being identified as present in the first portion of the input audio signal stream a first portion of the output audio signal stream e.g. time period of and associated frequency range where reference represents an example output audio signal stream at least by inverting the frequency ordering of at least part of the first portion of the input audio signal stream according to negative rank ordering or scaling performed at block . On the other hand if the negative rank ordering or scaling selector of block does not identify a viable high frequency speech pattern present in a subsequent second portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal stream the data processing device system may generate in response to identifying that the speech pattern is not present in the second portion of the input audio signal stream a subsequent second portion of the output audio signal stream e.g. time period and associated frequency range of without inverting the frequency ordering of at least part of or any part of the second portion of the input audio signal stream according to the negative rank ordering or scaling of block .

In one specific example embodiment the detector of block is a spectral balance detector configured to compare the energy above 2500 Hz to the energy below 2500 Hz in the input audio signal. In this regard negative rank ordering or scaling e.g. block occurs when the former is greater than the latter i.e. the input is high frequency dominated which works well for speech in quiet. Analysis was carried out over successive windows e.g. input audio signal stream time periods or segments that were 5.8 ms in duration i.e. 128 points at a 22 050 Hz sampling frequency . To prevent the switch of block from being overly active yet sensitive to rapid changes in high frequency energy there was a hysteresis to the switching behavior in this embodiment. In particular spectral balance was computed from a weighted history of four successive windows with the most recent window given the greatest weight i.e. 0.4 and the most distant window given the least weight i.e. 0.1 . The reasoning is that if an intense brief high frequency sound e.g. the burst of energy associated with the release of air following the silent interval for stop consonants was to pass through in the input audio signal the switch of block would trigger and that window and the one or two windows immediately following would be lowered depending on the input. If a brief high frequency noise sporadically occurred during a low frequency dominated vowel it might not be enough to trigger the switch at block thereby normal processing e.g. through to block would be maintained. It should be noted however that the invention is not limited to the details of this embodiment which is referred to for purposes of illustration only. Further one or more aspects of this embodiment may be incorporated into other embodiments of the present invention.

In some embodiments if the data processing device system determines that there is useful high frequency speech present in the input audio signal according to the instructions associated with block the data processing device system performs negative rank ordering or scaling of frequency according to any one of the various embodiments of the present invention to at least a portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal according to the instructions associated with block .

In some embodiments negative rank scaling associated with block involves computing an instantaneous frequency F over the analysis band e.g. the frequency range of the input audio signal where high frequency speech is to be analyzed e.g. the frequency range analyzed according to the instructions of block by comparing the phase shift across successive fast Fourier transform FFT segments. Preserving phase these components are reproduced at lower frequencies F using sine wave resynthesis in these embodiments in which output frequency is a reciprocal of input frequency as specified by the following formulae 

In other words in some embodiments the data processing device system is configured according to the program instructions associated with block at least to generate the output audio signal at least by frequency inverting and compressing at least a portion e.g. one or more frequency ranges one or more time segments or both of the input audio signal. In this regard the negative rank scaling includes an inversion of an ordering of frequencies present in the at least the portion of the input audio signal.

In some embodiments of the above discussed negative rank scaling of block the parameters used for such negative rank scaling were chosen following several small scale pilot studies using normal hearing listeners who each discriminated s and across almost 1200 trials. In these embodiments the analysis band was intentionally limited to frequencies where the majority of frication energy is produced. At the low end of the range minFwas set to 2756 Hz a value that respects the FFT bin spacing . After some experimentation with higher values the value chosen for maxFwas 7924 Hz. This experimentation was done in conjunction with setting the value for minF which was ultimately chosen to be 200 Hz. maxFis a variable parameter that is set to equal the maximum frequency for which aided audibility can be provided for the individual patient. Likewise the compression exponent p is intended to be a parameter that is chosen for the individual patient. It is expected that values of p ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 should be sufficient for most patients which will also depend on maxF. For example during pilot studies in which maxFwas 1500 Hz p 1.75 yielded the best performance not only for identification of s and but also for other consonants. It should be noted however that the invention is not limited to the details of the embodiments including the above discussed parameters described above with respect to block which are referred to for purposes of illustration only. Further one or more aspects of these embodiments may be incorporated into other embodiments of the present invention. 

According to some embodiments of the present invention the negative rank ordering or scaling of block involves an inversion of an ordering of frequency segments or ranges from input to output and not necessarily an inversion of an ordering of the individual frequencies within each segment. For a simple example assume that a high frequency region of the input audio signal includes from lowest to highest frequency frequency sub ranges or frequency sub segments A and B. Frequency segment A may include from lowest to highest frequency individual frequencies A and A and frequency segment B may include from lowest to highest frequency individual frequencies B and B. Upon negative rank ordering or scaling of such an input audio signal the low frequency region of the output audio signal output from block may include according to some embodiments of the present invention from lowest to highest frequency the frequency segments B and A or more specifically may include the following sequence of individual frequencies from lowest frequency to highest frequency B B A and A.

According to some embodiments of the present invention an additional speech feature detector e.g. in addition to the speech feature detector of block may be implemented as part of the method . In some embodiments this additional speech feature detector takes the form of block which further classifies s high frequency from mid frequency for example.

Accordingly when s is detected e.g. block it may be beneficial to provide the user with an additional cue e.g. block to further distinguish s from . This additional cue according to some embodiments is the providing of a differential gain e.g. block to help further segregate the two signals of origin on the basis of loudness. In other words an additional perceptual cue may be provided e.g. block in the form of loudness e.g. a differential gain based on a phonemic classification of the speech e.g. block . Such a differential gain may be applied after a gain has been applied to the input audio signal by the filtering conditioning circuitry to amplify regions of frequency where the user is experiencing hearing loss. However such a gain to frequency ranges where the user is experiencing hearing loss need not be separately applied and may be applied in conjunction with the differential gain of block according to some embodiments.

In some embodiments the speech feature detector of block may include the data processing device system determining whether the spectral balance of a portion or time segment of the input audio signal includes a high frequency tilt e.g. exhibits higher energy at a high frequency range as compared to a mid frequency range the portion time segment having been identified according to the instructions associated with block to include useful high frequency speech. The high frequency tilt detected according to the program instructions associated with block facilitates the detection of s . However it should be noted that any other type of speech feature detector may be executed at block .

According to some embodiments in response to determining that the input audio signal exhibits the high frequency tilt e.g. exhibits the higher energy at the high frequency range the data processing device system according to the instructions associated with block attenuates a low frequency range of the output audio signal which was output from the negative rank ordering or scaling e.g. output from block . The attenuation of the low frequency range of the output audio signal may in some embodiments be relative to another frequency range or another time segment of the output audio signal. The attenuated low frequency range of the output audio signal may correspond to the high frequency range of the input audio signal that is negative rank ordered or scaled e.g. inverted according to the instructions associated with block . Stated differently the attenuated low frequency range of the output audio signal may correspond to the segment of the input audio signal that is frequency lowered or transposed by the negative rank ordering or scaling performed according to the instructions of block . In other words in some embodiments the attenuated low frequency range of the output audio signal includes the low frequency in and corresponds to the segment of the input audio signal including the high frequency in . This attenuating of the low frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. output from block may be to a greater extent than any attenuating of the output audio signal e.g. output from block at a frequency range other than the low frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. output from block . For example while the low frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. including low frequency in is attenuated the other frequencies of the output audio signal e.g. including higher frequency in may not be attenuated or at least may be attenuated to a lesser extent. In other words the attenuation occurring according to the program instructions associated with block may be a relative attenuation of the low frequency range of the output audio signal as compared to another frequency range of the output audio signal. However in some embodiments the attenuation applied according to the program instructions of block is an attenuation of the entire high frequency range of the input audio signal that becomes frequency lowered by the negative rank ordering or scaling of block . In this regard although s and have a peak energy at different frequencies they are broadband and so have energy at overlapping frequencies in the input audio signal therefore in the output audio signal output from block also . See e.g. and which are discussed in more detail below. In and it can be noticed how the spectral content after lowering e.g. block overlaps as it does before lowering but how the overall energy in the region of greatest overlap is less for s than for . In this regard in some embodiments the program instructions associated with block add an addition perceptual cue to help the user or listener to distinguish s from .

While the above discussion of block pertains to attenuation of the output audio signal it should be noted that the present invention also includes applying a gain or less of a gain in some embodiments to at least a portion or frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. output from block at block for example instead of or in addition to attenuating a portion or frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. output from block . For example in some embodiments the attenuation of block is instead a differential gain such that program instructions associated with block cause or configure the data processing device system to apply a gain to the low frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. including frequency in that is to a different extent than a gain applied to another or any other frequency range of the output audio signal e.g. including frequency in . For instance the data processing device system may apply less of a gain to the low frequency range of the output audio signal than that applied to the other frequencies of the output audio signal. Alternatively the data processing device system may apply no gain or an attenuation to the low frequency range of the output audio signal according to the instructions of block while applying a gain to the other frequencies of the output audio signal. In this regard it can be seen that the present invention is not limited to any particular combination of gains attenuations or one or more gains and one or more attenuations applied according to the program instructions associated with block .

In this regard in some embodiments the data processing device system may be configured by program instructions associated with block to cause by way of at least a gain an attenuation or both a gain and an attenuation and in response to determining that the input audio signal exhibits the higher energy at the high frequency range at block a low frequency range of the output audio signal to be relatively de emphasized or emphasized as compared to another frequency range or another time segment of the output audio signal in order to provide a user or listener with an additional perceptual cue to distinguish similar sounds. The low frequency range of the output audio signal may correspond prior to the negative rank ordering or scaling of block which may be a frequency inversion according to some embodiments of the input audio signal to the high frequency range of the input audio signal.

Further although attenuation gain or both has been discussed as being applied according to the instructions associated with block to the audio signal output from block it should be appreciated that such attenuation gain or both may instead be applied to the input audio signal e.g. just upstream of block prior to performing negative rank ordering or scaling according to the instructions associated with block . For example blocks and could selectively de emphasize emphasize the high frequency range e.g. including the frequency in of the input audio signal e.g. at a point exiting block in such that the high frequency de emphasized or emphasized input audio signal is passed to block for negative rank ordering or scaling. In this regard it may be said that in response to determining that the input audio signal contains a particular sound e.g. exhibits higher energy at the high frequency range e.g. pursuant to block such as s an output audio signal is generated to include a perceptual cue e.g. pursuant to block to distinguish the particular sound from a similar sound e.g. having overlapping frequencies with the particular sound such as s and at least by applying a differential gain a differential attenuation gain an attenuation or a combination of one or more gains and attenuations to at least a portion or frequency range of the input audio signal in order to relatively de emphasize or emphasize the high frequency range of the input audio signal. If a differential gain or a differential attenuation is applied to the input audio signal in this regard the gain or attenuation applied to the high frequency range of the input audio signal e.g. including the frequency in is to a different extent than any gain or attenuation applied to the input audio signal at a frequency range or all other frequencies e.g. including frequency in other than the high frequency range of the input audio signal.

In consideration of the selective nature of the de emphasizing emphasizing process of blocks and it should be noted that if the input audio signal is considered an input audio signal stream block may add the perceptual cue only when the speech feature detector of block detects its target sound or phoneme e.g. s .

In some embodiments where the speech feature detector of block detects high frequency tilt in order to detect a target sound or phoneme in response to the data processing device system identifying according to the program instructions associated with block that a first time segment of the input audio signal stream exhibits higher energy at a high frequency range as compared to a mid frequency range e.g. the target sound or phoneme has been detected the data processing device system may cause by way of at least a gain an attenuation or both a gain and an attenuation according to program instructions associated with block a low frequency range of a first portion or time segment of the output audio signal stream to be emphasized or de emphasized as compared to another frequency range of the first portion or time segment of the output audio signal stream or as compared to another time segment of the output audio signal stream. In some embodiments the low frequency range of the first portion or time segment of the output audio signal stream corresponds prior to the negative rank ordering or scaling of block which may be an inverting of the first portion of time segment of the input audio signal stream to the high frequency range of the first portion or time segment of the input audio signal stream. Such emphasizing or de emphasizing may add a perceptual cue to further distinguish the detected target sound or phoneme e.g. block from a sound that is similar e.g. shares similar frequency characteristics so as to be typically confused by a listener to the detected sound.

On the other hand in some embodiments if the data processing device system identifies according to the program instructions associated with block that a different time segment of the input audio signal stream exhibits higher energy at the mid frequency range as compared to the high frequency range e.g. the target sound or phoneme has not been detected the data processing device system does not cause emphasizing or de emphasizing according to block of the high frequency range of the input audio signal present in the low frequency range of the output audio signal. Consequently in this case the data processing device system does not apply according to some embodiments of the program instructions associated with block a differential gain a differential attenuation a gain an attenuation or a combination of one or more gains and attenuations to at least a portion or frequency range of the different time segment of the input audio signal or a portion or time segment of the output audio signal corresponding to the different time segment in order to relatively emphasize or de emphasize the high frequency range of the input audio signal according to some embodiments. In other words the perceptual cue of block is not added in this case when the target sound or phoneme is not detected. In this regard according to some embodiments in response to determining that the input audio signal does not contain a target sound or phoneme e.g. does not exhibit the high frequency tilt at block the data processing device system does not perform the cue adding e.g. differential gain of block of the low frequency range of the output of the negative rank ordering or scaling block . See e.g. block .

The sound detection and cue adding processes of blocks and provide an additional cue to the user for distinguishing between signals that are lowered and exist within similar frequency regions. Consequently the sound detection and cue adding processes of blocks and may be active at all times e.g. constantly analyzing the input audio signal to determine whether a target sound or phoneme exists and whether the cue adding of block should be applied . In some embodiments such cue adding of block is to be distinguished from applications of differential gain that merely make sounds in the regions of greater hearing loss louder than the rest of the signal such a differential gain may be applied by the filtering conditioning circuitry . In contrast to such a differential gain the differential gain of block adds a perceptual cue to distinguish similar sounds and may be applied after the differential gain that makes sounds in the regions of greater hearing loss louder than the rest of the signal. In this regard the differential gain of block that adds the perceptual cue is being applied independently or regardless of frequency regions where hearing loss is occurring for the user. Further in this regard although the above discussion of blocks and focused on facilitating distinguishing the phonemes s and it should be noted that blocks and may also be adapted to facilitate distinguishing other similar phonemes according to some embodiments of the present invention.

Although the determination of whether a target sound or phoneme exists according to the instructions associated with block has been described as applying to the input audio signal from blocks the present invention is not limited to this arrangement. In some embodiments block operates on the output audio signal output from block . In at least some of these embodiments the program instructions associated with block are instead configured to determine whether a target sound or phoneme e.g. by way of a low frequency tilt exists in the output audio signal output from block . If so the low frequency portion or range of the output audio signal may be emphasized or de emphasized according to the instructions associated with block as previously discussed. If not the emphasizing or de emphasizing performed according to the instructions associated with block is not executed as illustrated by block .

As to some of the reasoning associated with performing the differential gain which may include an attenuation according to the instructions associated with block it is noted that the relative level of the entire frequency lowered segment according to the negative rank ordering or scaling of block depends on the spectral balance of the input audio signal. An intent is to enhance the perceptual dissimilarity of speech sounds with frication that is produced toward the front of the mouth which creates a peak of energy in the high frequencies e.g. s from speech sounds with frication that is produced further back in mouth which creates a peak of energy in the mid frequencies e.g. . An empirical examination of s and recordings in three vowel consonant vowel contexts a i and u from three adult male and three adult female talkers was used to optimize according to some embodiments the analysis at block by the data processing device system based on spectral balance. In this regard in some embodiments the data processing device system is configured to compare the band pass filtered energy of the input audio signal segment from 2500 4500 Hz to the high pass filtered energy above 4500 Hz.

In some of these embodiments if the energy of the input audio signal segment at block from 2500 4500 Hz is greater than the energy above 4500 Hz at least the frequency lowered segment of the output audio signal from block is passed through to the next stage of processing e.g. at block to the sound producing device system in without differential gain e.g. attenuation of the frequency lowered segment according to block .

On the other hand according to some embodiments if the energy of the input segment above 4500 Hz is greater than the energy from 2500 4500 Hz the frequency lowered segment is subject to differential gain e.g. attenuated at block before being passed through to the next stage of processing e.g. to the sound producing device system in . In some embodiments block may involve an attenuation of 4 9 dB. In this regard it should be noted that a small group of pilot studies with a larger difference 10 dB and smaller difference 3 dB did not yield comparable outcomes as a 6 dB difference. It should also be noted that although the above discussion refers to the particular range of 2500 4500 Hz for block and 4 9 dB of attenuation for block in some embodiments the present invention is not limited to these particular ranges and different applications may be better suited for other ranges. The ranges provided herein are merely for purposes of illustration and to provide examples that may be suitable for some particular applications of many applications to which the present invention may be applied.

In this regard it is noted that in some embodiments at least four parameters implemented in the method may be adjustable to accommodate differences between individuals 

The upper frequency limit of the output maxF parameter 1 above in some embodiments is set equal to the maximum audible frequency based on the individual s hearing loss. That is the bandwidth of the output may be set equal to the bandwidth of the audible spectrum while this seems logical it is not typically a consideration of many other methods . shows how maxFmay be set according to some embodiments for hearing losses in which audibility drops off at 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 Hz. As can be seen in increasing maxFshifts the overall function vertically toward the perceptual space for but will expand it since the acoustic differences between the output for s and will be greater. How this shift will affect perception will depend on the individual. Therefore to maximize the discriminability of s and the compression exponent p parameter 2 above may be variable to accommodate differences in perception between individuals. An assumption is that improvement in discrimination for this sound contrast will also improve discrimination of other sound contrasts.

In general a higher value i.e. more compression should increase the perception of s while a lower value i.e. less compression should increase the perception of . shows the I O functions for p 0.5 to p 2.5. While the functions in appear to be very compressive when plotted on a linear Hertz scale one must consider that filtering in the inner ear is logarithmic. plots the same functions on a psychophysical scale the ERB equivalent rectangular bandwidth in which the numbers correspond to independent auditory filter bands See e.g. Glasberg B. R. and Moore B. C. J. 1990 Derivation of auditory filter shapes from notched noise data Hear Res 47 103 138 . When plotted this way the functions are only moderately nonlinear and in fact are expansive slope 

Other adjustable parameters of the method are the overall level of the frequency lowered segments relative to the un lowered segments parameter 3 above and the relative level difference of the added intensity cue parameter 4 above . The overall level may simply be adjusted to balance perceptual salience i.e. the ability to perceive the cue and distractibility i.e. complaints of the cue being too noisy or too unnatural . The purpose of including relative level difference as an adjustable parameter is to account for the fact that hearing aids will usually compress output level to fit the wide dynamic range of input level into the narrower dynamic range of the hearing loss so that lower level sounds receive greater gain than higher level sounds. The relative intensity cue might be adjusted automatically to account for this reduction in dynamic range i.e. the size of the level cue or might be adjusted based on a brief perceptual testing that attempts to find the parameters that maximize s discrimination.

In some embodiments regarding parameter 3 above the output of block was attenuated relative to the output of block by 2 to 4 dB from its original bandpass input level whereas the output of block was another 8 to 10 dB lower. That is both the output of block and the output of block was attenuated in these embodiments relative to their original bandpass level present in the input audio signal . However in these embodiments the output of block was attenuated more than the output of block . Subsequent to this attenuation hearing aid gain was then applied to both outputs to accommodate individual hearing loss according to these embodiments. The perceptual reason for this is that even for normal hearing listeners a low frequency sound will be perceived as louder than a high frequency sound of the exact same intensity. So if the overall intensity of the lowered s and and other high frequency speech sounds are kept the same they will sound loud relative to how a listener is used to hearing them. To help keep the perceptual balance these embodiments simply turn the volume of the lowered speech down. This phenomenon will vary between listeners especially those who have never heard these high frequency sounds before and who have no basis for judging how loud they should sound. In this regard listeners might want them louder so that they are better able to perceive them.

A basis of comparison for evaluating the performance of the method in are a series experiments reported by Shames and Alexander Shames Y. A. and Alexander J. M. 2011 Novel dynamic frequency lowering techniques for precipitous hearing loss American Auditory Society Abstract in which a variety of positive rank scaling methods of frequency lowering including a 1500 Hz low pass filtered condition were tested on 20 normal hearing listeners each who identified 240 VCVs 20 consonants spoken by four talkers in three vowel contexts and 144 nonsense syllables differing only in the medial vowel 12 vowels spoken by 12 talkers . Frequency lowering for all conditions was dependent on the spectral balance of the input using the method of block . The frequency I O functions for the methods reported on are shown in . Each was tested with and without an added level cue 5 dB from block . In general overall performance was better with the added level cue block regardless of frequency lowering method so these are the only results reported. The LFC line in is the frequency mapping representing the linear frequency compression technique LFC . The NFC line represents nonlinear frequency compression NFC using the equation described by Simpson et al. Simpson A. Hersbach A. A. McDermott H. J. 2005 Improvements in speech perception with an experimental nonlinear frequency compression hearing device Int J Aud 44 281 92 . The TFC truncated frequency compression line represents the same except with an analysis band that was truncated to 2756 7924 Hz which the same range as shown in for one embodiment of negative rank ordering or scaling of frequency. Finally the EFC expanded frequency compression line represents an alternative mapping in which high frequency inputs were assigned a relatively expanded frequency space in the output. Results for each are shown in .

The top part of each of shows the stimulus response matrix where the rows represent the consonant stimuli that were presented and where the columns represent the responses aggregated over 20 listeners. Thus numbers along the diagonal are correct responses and numbers along the off diagonal are incorrect responses. As can be seen from Table 1 in severely band limited speech results in a high number of confusions of for s . Other notable confusions within the context of the current set of experiments are t for t and t for k . The bottom part of each of shows the d prime d for each consonant overall and for each pair of confusions. The advantage of d is that it takes into account false alarms as well as hits Macmillan N. A. and Creelman C. D. 2005 Detection theory A user s guide 2nd Ed. Erlbaum N.J. . For example if stimulus A is always perceived correctly but stimulus B is also always perceived as stimulus A then the listener is not sensitive to the contrast d 0 despite being 100 correct for stimulus A. Thus d 0.2 for the s contrast in Table 1 of reflects the high number of confusions of for s .

Table 2 of shows the results for a simulation of linear frequency compression. Interestingly while there was a doubling in the number correct responses for this came at the expense of a tripling in the number of confusions of for s hence there was no improvement for d for this contrast. Similarly while the number of confusions of t for k was reduced so was the number of correct responses for t thus there was no improvement in d . Finally there was an overall in increase in the number of confusions of t for both s and .

Table 3 of shows the results for nonlinear frequency compression which fared a little better than linear frequency compression. This was especially true for the number of correct s and responses which increased without much of an increase in the number of s confusions. Also relative to linear frequency compression there was a modest increase in the number of correct t and k responses with a similar number of confusions between the two methods. Finally unlike linear frequency compression there were a low number of confusions of t for s and .

Table 4 of shows the results for truncated nonlinear frequency compression. Relative to the other frequency lowering methods the most notable pattern is the significant increase in the number of responses for both s and stimuli.

Table 5 of shows the results for expanded nonlinear frequency compression. While perception of s and was more balanced than the previous experiments overall percent correct with this method was lowest of all. In addition compared to the other frequency lowering methods there were a significant number of t confusions for t and only to the number of correct t responses.

Table 6 of shows the results for the method of also referred to as inverse frequency compression IFC according to some embodiments. The first aspect to note is that overall percent correct is the highest of all other methods tested. In addition d for the s t k and t contrasts were the highest of all tested methods among others. For the s contrast the number of correct responses are balanced i.e. unbiased with a relatively modest number of confusions between the two and with a minimal number of confusions with t . If the overall d for IFC for each of the consonants is compared to LFC not only is there improvement here defined as a d difference 0.2 for s and but also for other phonemes including t k z d t and j . Compared to low pass filtering improvements with IFC are seen for half of the consonants k s v j t r w and y .

Finally because each of the tested methods implemented frequency lowering only when there was a dominance of high frequency energy and because vowels have a dominance of low frequency energy none of the conditions tested differed significantly in overall vowel identification.

It is to be understood that the above described embodiments are merely illustrative of the present invention and that many variations of the above described embodiments can be devised by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. It is therefore intended that all such variations be included within the invention and the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.
