Social networking platforms may store data about or otherwise related to users of the social networking platforms. These social networking platforms often allow users of the platforms to share information with one another and perform various actions. The volume of data generated that corresponds to the actions of others and the sharing of information with other users of such social networking platforms may be relatively large. Consequently an individual user of a social networking platform may have difficulty managing this large amount of available data. As a result the user may miss gloss over or otherwise fail to appreciate information of some level of significance that was shared with or otherwise available to the user within the social networking platform.

One aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer implemented method that include the actions of receiving a request for information indicative of venues that are located within a geographic region of interest accessing user data for one or more users of a social networking platform with the accessed user data being associated with venues located within the geographic region of interest for each particular venue among multiple venues located within the geographic region of interest identifying in the accessed user data data indicative of one or more affirmative actions that are performed for the particular venue by at least one of the one or more users and generating based on the data indicative of the one or more affirmative actions associated with the particular venue a popularity score for the particular venue with the popularity score being indicative of an affinity of the one or more users for the particular venue determining based on the popularity scores for the multiple venues located within the geographic region of interest one or more popular venues with a popular venue being associated with an increased popularity score relative to popularity scores of other of the multiple venues located with the geographic region of interest and for a determined popular venue generating data indicative of a type of user of the social networking platform who performs one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue.

In some implementations the method further includes analyzing data indicative of characteristics of users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular business wherein generating the data indicative of the type of user includes the actions of generating based on analyzing the data indicative of the type of user of the social networking platform who performs the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. The data can be indicative of the type of user comprises one or more of anonymous demographic data about one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue and anonymous psychographic data about the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. The anonymous demographic data can include one or more of data indicative of a gender of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue data indicative of an age of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue data indicative of an ethnicity of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue data indicative of knowledge of languages of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue data indicative of home ownership of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue data indicative of an employment status of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue and data indicative of a relationship status of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue and the anonymous psychographic data can include one or more of data indicative of one or more interests of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue and data indicative of a lifestyle of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. The accessed user data can includes demographic data and psychographic data for a particular user on the social networking platform and demographic data and psychographic data for one or more other users of the social networking platform with the one or more other users having one or more social connections to the particular user in the social networking platform. The actions can further include determining one or more privacy settings that have been set by the particular user and determining one or more privacy settings that have been set by respective ones of the one or more other users wherein the accessed user data is based on the one or more privacy settings for the particular user and the privacy settings for the respective ones of the one or more other users. In some examples an affirmative action can include one or more of an action of endorsing content available on the social networking platform an action of checking into a location wherein an entity associated with the location also has content on the social networking platform that corresponds to the location an action of posting content on the social networking platform and an action of adding a tag to content posted on the social networking platform. The actions can further include receiving a selection of a filtering criteria and filtering the one or more popular venues based on the received filtering criteria. The filtering criteria can correspond to a type of location and for a particular venue among the multiple venues located within the geographic region of interest determining when the particular venue satisfies the filtering criteria identifying in the accessed user data and based on determining when the particular venue satisfies the filtering criteria data indicative of one or more affirmative actions that are performed for the particular venue by at least one of the one or more users and generating based on the data indicative of the one or more affirmative actions associated with the particular venue a popularity score for the particular venue with the popularity score being indicative of an affinity of the one or more users for the particular venue. The filtering criteria can correspond to one of a predefined crowd type and generating the data indicative of the type of user further includes determining when a type of user satisfies the filtering criteria and generating data indicative of a type of user of the social networking platform who satisfies the filtering criteria and who performs one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. The actions can further include receiving a selection of information indicative of one or more demographic and psychographic criteria generating a custom crowd type from the received criteria and using the generated custom crowd type as the received filtering criteria. The actions can further include transmitting to a client device information indicative of a geographic area that includes representations of the one or more popular venues receiving information indicative of a selection of at least one of the representations included in the geographic area and transmitting to the client device anonymous demographic data and anonymous psychographic data about one or more users who performed affirmative actions with a venue represented by the selected at least one of the representations. The actions can further include receiving information indicative of one or more user attributes that define a particular crowd type and determining a portion of the accessed user data that is associated with users of the social networking platform who possess attributes corresponding to at least one of the one or more user attributes that define the particular crowd type wherein generating the popularity score can include generating based on the determined portion of the accessed user data that is associated with users of the social networking platform who possess attributes corresponding to at least one of the one or user attributes that define the particular crowd type a popularity score that is indicative of an affinity of the particular venue with the particular crowd type relative to an affinity of the particular venue with users of the social networking platform.

Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes one or more processing devices and one or more machine readable media configured to store instructions that are executable by the one or more processing devices to perform operations that include receiving a request for information indicative of venues that are located within a geographic region of interest accessing user data for one or more users of a social networking platform with the accessed user data being associated with venues located within the geographic region of interest for each particular venue among multiple venues located within the geographic region of interest identifying in the accessed user data data indicative of one or more affirmative actions that are performed for the particular venue by at least one of the one or more users and generating based on the data indicative of the one or more affirmative actions associated with the particular venue a popularity score for the particular venue with the popularity score being indicative of an affinity of the one or more users for the particular venue determining based on the popularity scores for the multiple venues located within the geographic region of interest one or more popular venues with a popular venue being associated with an increased popularity score relative to popularity scores of other of the multiple venues located with the geographic region of interest and for a determined popular venue generating data indicative of a type of user of the social networking platform who performs one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue.

In some implementations the data indicative of the type of user can include one or more of anonymous demographic data about one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue and anonymous psychographic data about the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. The operations can further include receiving a selection of a filtering criteria and filtering the one or more popular venues based on the received filtering criteria. The filtering criteria can correspond to a type of location and for each particular venue among multiple venues located within the geographic region of interest determining when the particular venue satisfies the filtering criteria identifying in the accessed user data and based on determining when the particular venue satisfies the filtering criteria data indicative of one or more affirmative actions that are performed for the particular venue by at least one of the one or more users and generating based on the data indicative of the one or more affirmative actions associated with the particular venue a popularity score for the particular venue with the popularity score being indicative of an affinity of the one or more users for the particular venue. The filtering criteria can correspond to one of a predefined crowd type and generating data indicative of a type of user further includes determining when a type of user satisfies the filtering criteria and generating data indicative of a type of user of the social networking platform that satisfies the filtering criteria and who performs one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. The operations can further include receiving a selection of information indicative of one or more demographic and psychographic criteria generating a custom crowd type from the received criteria and using the generated custom crowd type as the received filtering criteria.

Yet another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer implemented method including receiving an indication of a crowd type receiving a request for information indicative of venues that are located within a geographic region of interest accessing user data for one or more users of a social networking platform with the accessed user data being associated with the venues located within the geographic region of interest for a particular venue located within the geographic region of interest determining based on the accessed user data a number of check ins that are performed at the particular venue by one or more users that belong to the indicated crowd type and generating based on the number of check ins at the particular venue a popularity score for the particular venue identifying based on popularity scores for the venues located within the geographic region of interest popular venues for the indicated crowd type with a popular venue being associated with an increased popularity score relative to popularity scores of other of the venues located with the geographic region of interest and transmitting to a device that sent the request aggregated data indicative of types of users of the social networking platform who check into the popular venues.

Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification may be implemented to realize none or one or more of the following features. Popular venues located in a geographic region of interest can be identified. These popular venues may also have associated demographic data and psychographic data about the types of people that frequent these particular locations. The demographic data and the psychographic data may be presented at various levels of granularity allowing a user to get an initial sense of the type of people that frequent a venue but also allowing a user to obtain additional demographic data or psychographic data about the types of people that frequent a venue if the user so desires. Users can also make more informed decisions about whether to visit a particular venue based at least in part on the demographic data the psychographic data and or the calculated popularity for a particular venue.

All or part of the foregoing can be implemented as a computer program product including instructions that are stored on one or more non transitory machine readable storage media and that are executable on one or more processing devices. All or part of the foregoing can be implemented as an apparatus method or electronic system that can include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

A system consistent with this disclosure presents information to one or more users of an application about one or more venues in proximity to a geographic region of interest. In a particular example the geographic region of interest is near a particular user s location e.g. based on geo locating the particular user s mobile device that is executing the application . In general the presented information can be provided in such a way that the particular user of the application can identify whether any of the popular venues are likely to be of interest to the particular user. In general the information can include data indicative of types of users that frequent particular ones of the one or more venues or indicative of the type of venue to help a particular user decide whether the location is a place that the particular user would like to visit. In an example a particular venue may be popular with single women. As another example a particular venue may be popular with people that are sports lovers. As yet another example a particular venue may be popular with people that are food lovers. As a result users that may associate themselves with one or more types of users may be more likely to frequent a venue that is frequented by like minded people or any other people that the user may want to meet. In other words the presented information allows a user to locate a venue based at least on part on a combination of one or more characteristics of people that frequent a particular venue or characteristics about the particular venue.

In an example the system can generate the data indicative of a type of user that frequents particular ones of the one or more venues by accessing user data e.g. one or more user profiles associated with user identities e.g. users who have registered with a social networking platform or who have been assigned a unique or otherwise identifying identifier by the social networking platform that are maintained by a social networking platform. In a particular example demographic data and psychographic data can be generated from the accessed user data. The demographic data and psychographic data for one or more users that frequent a particular venue can be associated with that particular venue. Then for example in response to a request for information the demographic data and psychographic data associated with the particular venue can be presented to the particular user on the application executing on the mobile device. To help the user of the application more easily identify a possible venue of interest the application can filter the venues based on different types of venues e.g. bars nightlife restaurants coffee shops and other venues or types of crowds that frequents the venues e.g. movie lovers sports lovers single men single women combinations of these and other types of crowds or both e.g. in response to receiving a selection of a filtering criteria provided by the particular user.

In this example the venues can also be presented or otherwise arranged in a graphical user interface of the application based on a popularity of each of the venues relative to other venues within the geographic region of interest. That is in general a predefined number of venues may be displayed based on a determined popularity relative to the other venues. In a particular example only the twenty most popular venues are presented to the user and other venues deemed to be less popular than the twentieth venue are not shown.

In an example the popularity of each venue can be determined by identifying in the accessed user data data indicative of one or more affirmative actions performed on the social networking platform that are associated with the particular venue. In general an affirmative action is any action that a user takes or is associated with that indicates an interaction with a particular venue. For example if a user of the social networking platform likes or otherwise takes an action to endorse content associated with a venue available on the social networking platform this action can be used to gauge the popularity of the venue relative to other venues in the geographic region. As another example a user may check into a particular venue. In this particular example an entity associated with a venue may generate content on the social networking platform that allows users of the social networking platform to indicate whether particular users have visited the venue. When a user indicates that the user has visited the venue that user has checked into the venue. Checking into a location is described in more detail below. In an example a user may dislike a particular venue. In an example a second user may be tagged by a first user that is associated with a particular venue. In this particular example the second user being included in a tag associated with the particular venue may be interpreted as an affirmative action. Other actions are also possible and may affect a popularity determination of a particular venue accordingly. In this example the system can weigh the identified affirmative actions based on one or more groups to which a particular user that performed one or more affirmative actions belongs. In some situations a particular venue may have more than one particular location in a geographic region of interest. In a particular example there may be many coffee shops owned and operated by the same venue within a geographic region of interest. In such situations these separate locations may be treated as separate venues for the purposes of determining a popularity of each venue.

Referring now to an example of a system that can be used to provide information to a user about one or more venues is shown. In general the system allows a user of an application executing on a mobile device to search for and display information indicative of one or more popular venues in a geographic region of interest. For convenience the system is depicted as including a single social networking platform although the system may be configured to communicate with a plurality of social networking platforms operated by different social networking service providers. In general the information indicative of popular venues can also be presented with data indicative of a type of person that frequents particular ones of the one or more popular venues. As a result of being shown this information the user may be better informed with respect to which venues may be of interest to the user.

The system includes a social networking platform a server system and one or more computing devices . The server system the social networking platform and the one or more mobile computing devices may electronically communicate with each other using a network . As will be described in more detail below one or more electronic communications from the one or more computing devices can be sent to the social networking platform and used by the server system in determining a popularity for one or more venues.

There are many different examples of social networking platforms . Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google MySpace Yelp and Orkut are just a few examples. But there are many others and it is reasonable to expect many more may emerge in the future. The techniques described herein for handling data available within a social networking platform are widely applicable and may be applied to data available within any relevant social networking platform.

A social networking platform such as social networking platform frequently enables individual user identities to establish social connections with other user identities. The social connections formed between individual users within a social networking platform may be represented in the form of a graph where users are represented by nodes and social connections between users are represented by edges connecting the nodes. These social connections between user identities may reflect relationships between the underlying human users who correspond to the user identities. For example a social connection between two user identities within the social networking platform may reflect a social friendship e.g. developed through physical interaction in the real world and or through on line interaction in the cyber world or a professional relationship between the underlying human users who correspond to the user identities.

In an example a user identity may be able to unilaterally form a social connection with another user identity. In this example a social networking platform such as social networking platform may enable a first user identity to form a connection to a second user identity simply by specifying a desire to form a social connection to the second user identity and without requiring approval of the connection by the second user identity. In another example the formation of social connections between two user identities may be a bilateral process. In this example when a first user identity specifies a desire to form a connection to a second user identity the social networking platform may establish the connection only after the second user identity approves the formation of the connection between the first user identity and the second user identity.

A user identity of the social networking platform may form a social network within the social networking platform by forming social connections to other user identities of the social networking platform. In some cases the social network of a particular user identity of a social networking platform may be defined as the group of other user identities to whom the particular user identity is directly connected. Alternatively in other cases the social network of a particular user identity of a social networking platform may be defined to include a group of other user identities that are within a threshold number of degrees of separation of the particular user identity. In an example a graph or other data structure may be maintained by the social networking platform to describe the degrees of separation between a particular user identity and other user identities.

A social networking platform such as social networking platform commonly facilitates sharing of information and the exchange of electronic communications between user identities and other user identities who are part of their social networks. For example a social networking platform may allow a particular user identity to access more detailed information about the other user identities that are part of the particular user identity s social network than the social networking platform allows the particular user identity to access about user identities that are not part of the particular user identity s social network. Additionally or alternatively a social networking platform may provide communications conduits between a particular user identity and the other user identities who are part of the particular user identity s social network that the social networking platform does not otherwise provide between the particular user identity and other user identities who are not part of the particular user identity s social network.

In addition to enabling user identities to establish connections to other user identities some social networking platforms enable user identities to establish connections with other types of objects. For example some social networking platforms may enable user identities to record information about their hometowns current places of residence or places they have visited including e.g. geographic locations such as cities states or countries as well as local venues or places such as restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. by establishing connections to location objects within the social networking platforms. Additionally or alternatively some social networking platforms may enable user identities to record information about events to which they have been invited are planning to attend and or have attended by establishing connections to event objects within the social networking platforms.

Similarly some social networking platforms may enable user identities to record endorsements of interests such as for example local venues or places e.g. restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. companies organizations or institutions brands or products artists bands or public figures forms of entertainment e.g. books music albums movies etc. and causes or communities by establishing connections to interest objects within the social networking platforms. In some such social networking platforms interest objects may be manifested as so called pages that are maintained by one or more representatives of the interest objects and that among other features provide information about the interest objects and that provide conduits for enabling interaction between the interest objects and the user identities that have formed connections to the interest objects.

In some implementations location objects and interest objects can be different sub types of a common object.

Furthermore some social networking platforms may enable user identities to establish connections with independent applications that leverage the social networking platforms for example by granting the independent applications authorization to access or extract data from the social networking platform on their behalf.

In some social networking platforms that enable user identities to form connections with object types like location objects event objects and interest objects such location objects event objects and or interest objects each may be associated with one or more representatives. Furthermore the social networking platforms may enable these representatives to interact with the user identities to which the objects are connected using the manifestation of the object within the social networking platform.

For example an interest object within a social networking platform may be manifested as a page that provides information about the interest that the object represents and the social networking platform may enable one or more designated representatives associated with the page to share information and exchange electronic communications with the user identities connected to the interest object in a manner in which such shared information or exchanged communications appear to involve the page as opposed to an individual user identity. In one particular example the social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables one or more representatives associated with the interest to broadcast an electronic message that is shared publicly with all or some defined subset of all of the user identities to which the interest object is connected.

As another example a location object within a social networking platform also may be manifested as a page that provides information about the location that the object represents. The social networking platform may enable one or more designated representatives associated with the page to share information and to exchange electronic communications with the user identities connected to the location object in a manner in which such shared information or exchanged communications appear to involve the page as opposed to an individual user identity. In one particular example the social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables one or more representatives associated with the location to broadcast an electronic message that is shared publicly with all or some defined subset of all of the user identities to which the interest object is connected.

A social networking platform may maintain a user profile for a user identity that reflects the user identity s name gender age relationship status education history e.g. schools attended and or degrees awarded employment history e.g. employers and or positions held contact information e.g. e mail address es telephone number s other electronic addresses physical addresses etc. current residence information e.g. city state territory and or country hometown information e.g. city state territory and or country primary language and or sexual orientation. Other user profile characteristics can also be maintained by the social networking platform.

Additionally or alternatively the user identity s profile also may reflect various different interests of the user identity and or indications of various different locations that the user identity or another user identity such as for example a member of the user identity s social network has registered with the social networking platform as locations that the user identity has visited. Such locations may include a wide variety of different types of locations including for example geographic locations such as cities states or countries as well as commercial venues venues or other places such as restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. For ease of reference indications of locations registered with a social networking platform as locations that a user identity has visited may be referred to herein as check ins and information stored in or in connection with a user identity s profile that reflects such indications of locations registered with the social networking platform as locations that the user identity has visited may be referred to herein as check in information. 

In an example a social networking platform may provide a particular user identity with certain increased functionality in connection with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the social networking platform that the social networking platform may not provide to the particular user identity in connection with user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network within the social networking platform. For example a social networking platform may provide a particular user identity with one or more different mechanisms for electronically communicating or otherwise sharing content with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the social networking platform. Furthermore an social networking platform may allow a particular user identity to access more detailed profile information about other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the social networking platform than the social networking platform allows the particular user identity to access about user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network. Additionally or alternatively a social networking platform may enable a particular user identity to access check ins registered with the social networking platform by members of the particular user identity s social network within the social networking platform while not enabling the particular user identity to access check ins registered with the social networking platform by user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network within the social networking platform.

As described above the connections between individual user identities within a social networking platform may be represented in the form of a graph where user identities are represented by nodes and connections between user identities are represented by edges connecting the nodes. As new user identities join and other user identities stop using the social networking platform and or as new connections between user identities are formed and old connections between user identities are dissolved this graph of interconnected user identities may change dynamically in time to represent the current state of connections between user identities within the social networking platform.

Referring again to the social networking platform may include a data store that includes privacy settings data and a data store that includes user data. The data store may include one or more privacy settings that are specified by a particular user of the social networking platform . These privacy settings may control or otherwise suggest how the social networking platform handles a request for user data about the particular user. In one example the privacy settings may specify that no user data stored in the data store be shared with third parties. Additionally or alternatively the privacy settings may specify that posts or other content posted by the particular user is viewable only by a subset of the other users with whom the particular user is connected. Other privacy settings are also possible and can be stored in the data store . As an example one or more privacy settings can be configured for one or more affirmative actions so that some of the affirmative actions are effectively hidden from the server system .

At least some of the shared information e.g. as described above relationships between user identities demographic indicators about particular users corresponding to respective user identities and psychographic information about particular users corresponding to respective user identities can be stored in the user data included in the data store . For example a particular human user may like one or more movies and affirmatively reflect that particular interest by adding content to their user profile. The content added to the particular user s user profile may be included in the data store . As another example when a user first registers to become a member of the social networking platform the social networking platform may ask a series of questions about the human user. In an example some questions may include questions pertaining to date of birth hometown current residence contact information and other information. This information may also be associated with the particular user s user profile and stored in the data store .

In an example as a particular user interacts with content on the social networking platform the user data included in the data store may be updated. For example if a particular user posts a message or some other content to a user profile of another user to which the particular user is connected the social networking platform may capture that action and store the message or other content in the user data included in the data store for that particular user. As another example if the particular user endorses content associated with another user of the social networking platform the social networking platform may capture that action and store the endorsement in the user data included in the data store for that particular user. In a particular example users can endorse content on a social networking platform by pressing selecting or otherwise interacting with a user interface component such as a button displayed on a web page that presents the particular content.

In some implementations an indication can be stored in the data store as a string such as John Doe likes Shakespeare. In addition or alternatively one or more data objects can be stored in the data store that identify a user and an entity or subject of the action where an action may create a relationship or link between the two objects. In this example a first data object may be a data object that identifies a user as John Doe and a second data object that identifies an entity as Shakespeare. Then if John Doe endorses the Shakespeare entity a link or other relationship can be created by the social networking platform to indicate that John Doe likes Shakespeare. As a result the two data objects and their respective relationship can then be accessed and used to determine that the user identified as John Doe performed the action of endorsing Shakespeare. Other affirmative actions can also be captured by the social networking platform including but not limited to checking into a location and or adding a tag to content already posted on the social networking platform .

With respect to checking into a location an entity such as a venue may create a page or some other content type of object that corresponds to the location on the social networking platform . Then when a user of the social networking platform visits the location the user can navigate to that object and select or otherwise interact with a portion of the content to indicate that the user was at the location e.g. check in . In a particular example a button or other user interface component is provided on the object to enable a user to check into the geographic location. In some implementations the social networking platform may detect that the user is at the particular geographic location e.g. using GPS or other location identifying techniques . In such implementations the social networking platform may prompt the user e.g. using a push message or other notification to determine whether the user would like to check in at the geographic location.

The server system includes various components that enable the server system to access the user data stored in the data store . In addition the sever system can use the information stored in the data store to provide one or more different services to a user executing an application on a computing device such as computing devices 

In an example the user data that is included in the data store can be used to determine popularity scores for particular venues. Generally a popularity score may be a value indicative of an affinity of a particular set of users for the particular venue. In this context affinity generally is a measure of how much more or less likely a particular type of user e.g. single males is to have connected with a particular venue than the overall population of users on the social networking platform. For example a user may interact with the venue in a social networking platform e.g. by liking the venue by performing a check in at the venue and so forth. In such examples any or all of the popularity scores the demographic data and psychographic data can be associated with the respective venues. Then the demographic data and or psychographic data about one or more types of people that interact with the particular venue e.g. by performing an affirmative action on the social networking platform that is directed toward the venue can be provided to a user in response to receiving a request for information indicative of venues that are located within a geographic region of interest. In a particular example the venues that are presented in response to receiving a request for information have increased popularity scores relative to popularity scores of other venues located within the geographic region of interest.

In an example the server system includes an input output I O interface memory a bus system and one or more processing devices . The server system may also be in communication with a data store that includes demographic data and psychographic data. In some implementations the demographic data is user data that has been accessed by the server system from the social networking platform or from a plurality of social networking platforms . In some implementations the psychographic data is data about users that the server system has derived or otherwise inferred from the data accessed by the server system from the social networking platform or from a plurality of social networking platforms . The server system can communicate with any of the social networking platform the one or more computing devices and the network through I O interface . In an example the I O interface can be any combination of hardware and software capable of receiving data over a network including e.g. an Ethernet interface a wireless networking interface a fiber optic networking interface a modem and so forth.

A bus system including for example a data bus and a motherboard can be used to establish and to control data communication between the components of the server system . In an example the server system can be one or more desktop computers one or more rack mounted servers and the like. In some implementations the server system may be distributed in different geographic locations or may be contained at a centralized location such as a data center.

The one or more processing devices can each include one or more microprocessors. Generally one of the processing devices can include an appropriate processor and or logic that is capable of receiving and storing data and of communicating over a network e.g. network . Memory can include a hard drive and a random access memory storage device including e.g. a dynamic random access memory or other types of non transitory machine readable storage devices. As shown in memory stores computer programs or other program logic that is executable by one or more of processing devices . In the illustrated example the memory includes a popularity score module and a data extractor .

The popularity score module can be configured to determine a popularity score for a particular venue based at least in part on a number of affirmative actions taken by one or more users of the social networking platform .

The data extractor can be configured to access or otherwise retrieve information from the social networking platform . For example the data extractor can use an application programming interface API to send information requests to the social networking platform . In an example the data extractor may extract data periodically e.g. on demand hourly daily weekly and so forth by using the API to poll the social networking platform . In this example the data extractor may only poll the social networking platform for user data for which the server system can access. This may include particular users that have provided permission for the server system to access their respective user data as well as all of the other users that are socially connected to those particular users depending on the privacy settings set by the other users.

In general the server system can gather information about the popularity of venues as well as certain demographic indicators and psychographic data by utilizing the social networking platform . For example a particular user of the social networking platform may install an application on the one or more computing devices that is configured to communicate with the server system and to receive from the server system information indicative of popular venues near a geographic location of interest. In addition the application may provide the user with demographic data and or psychographic data about users who interact with those popular venues e.g. by performing affirmative actions on the social networking platform . When registering the application the particular user may be prompted to provide login credentials to the social networking platform or may be otherwise required to provide the server system with permission to access the user s user data store in the user data store in order to complete an installation of the application on the computing device. In general the permission may allow the application to access the particular user s user data on the social networking platform . As a result the application can retrieve the particular user s demographic data likes check ins and other data.

In addition with the permission received from the particular user the sever system can access the user data stored in the data store to determine each other user that is socially connected to the particular user. The server system may also access user data stored in the data store for these other users that are socially connected to the particular user although one or more of the socially connected users may prevent the server system from accessing their respective user data. For example some of the other users that are socially connected to the particular user may have set one or more privacy settings stored in the data store to prevent third parties from accessing the respective user data for some of the other users. In this example the privacy settings would indicate that the social networking platform should block any requests for user data about those other users that are submitted by the server system as the server system would be considered a third party. As a result these privacy settings essentially prevent the server system from obtaining any information about those other users who have configured their privacy settings to block user data access by third parties.

In some examples many users do allow third parties to access their user data and in the manner described above the social connections of the various users can be used to generate a robust amount of data about many users and their respective activities on the social networking platform . Many of the techniques described herein utilize this data to provide information services to users of an application executing on the one or more computing devices . In an example the activities may be used to generate a popularity score for one or more venues and the user data may be used to generate demographic data and psychographic data for users that frequent the one or more venues.

In an example the one or more computing devices include an I O interface memory a bus system and one or more processing devices . These elements operate using similar principles and perform similar functions to the I O interface memory bus system and one or more processing devices described in connection with the server system . Any combination of the I O interface memory bus system and one or more processing devices however may be implemented or otherwise configured using different hardware and software to that of the I O interface memory bus system and one or more processing devices described above. The one or more computing devices can be any of a laptop computer a desktop computer a handheld computer a mobile phone or any other computing device capable of executing one or more applications.

In an example the memory includes one or more applications that can present a graphical user interface in a display device of the computing device e.g. computing device . The display device may be a touch sensitive device enabling a user to provide user input by touching gesturing or otherwise making physical contact with the display device . In a particular example one of the one or more applications is an application that provides information indicative of venue that are located within a geographic region of interest to the user. In this example the application can limit the presentation of information indicative of venues to popular venues as determined by the server system . Also in this example the application may present demographic data and psychographic data about one or more users who have interacted with the locations. As described above the demographic data and psychographic data can be determined by the server system and can be associated with the particular venues. In a particular example the demographic data and psychographic data are presented to the user by providing one or more graphical representations of the data e.g. charts graphs and other graphical representations .

The application can be configured to communicate with the server system using the interface . In response the server system may provide information indicative of popular venues to the application which the application can present on the display device using one or more graphical user interfaces. In addition these user interfaces may include demographic data and psychographic data received from the server system . As described above the demographic data and psychographic data may be used to describe one or more users that interact or are otherwise connected to one or more of the one or more venues. In an example this demographic data and psychographic data may be determined by the server system from user data stored in the data store of the social networking platform . In this example the demographic data and the psychographic data about one or more users that interact with the one or more venues e.g. by performing one or more affirmative actions on the social networking platform may be presented to the user in a number of different graphical user interfaces to provide different graphical representations of the demographic data and the psychographic data. In addition in this example the graphical user interfaces may facilitate one or more user interactions to allow a user of the application to configure or otherwise filter the type of information that is displayed. A number of these graphical user interfaces are described in more detail below although they represent an illustrative sample and not an exhaustive collection of graphical user interfaces.

In response the application may provide a request for information that is received by the server system . In an example the request for information corresponds to the user input and is indicative of a geographic region of interest and or one or more filtering criteria. In some implementations the filtering criteria may correspond to a type of venue a type of user or both. In some implementations a ranking of particular venues may also be provided as filtering criteria. In a particular example only the top five most popular venues can be provided as filtering criteria. In another example venues can be filtered according their respective hours of operation. The system may then provide a collection of data corresponding to the request that is received by the application. Once received the application can present a first view of the data in a first graphical user interface and allow the user to change data views by interacting with one or more components of the first graphical user interface. are also described with respect to the system described above in reference to . Different systems may be implemented to provide to the application information indicative of venues and associated demographic data and psychographic data that corresponds to users who interact with the venues.

In some implementations at least some of the information presented in the graphical user interfaces and can be based on historical information about one or more of the users. In a particular example a user Bob may have frequented Joe s Sports Bar when he was single and in college and therefore associated with a type of user that included the characteristics of being single as a relationship status and in college as an education level . As Bob ages he may get married and have children but the server system may use Bob s change in relationship status to avoid associating Joe s Sports Bar with Bob s a more recent demographic characteristic of having a relationship status of married for example.

In some implementations the graphical user interfaces that are represented by different illustrations may be a single graphical view that provides some functionality allowing the different portions of the singe view to be seen by a user after the user provides a user input. For example and as will be described in more detail below the user interfaces shown in respectively may be implemented as a single graphical view. In this example implementation when a user provides a swiping gesture as user input to the touch sensitive display device for one of the computing devices the application executing on the computing device can present a different portion of the single view. In an example the graphical user interfaces provide anonymized demographic data and psychographic data. That is information identifying demographic and or psychographic characteristics of particular users can be removed.

Referring now to an example graphical user interface is shown. In general the graphical user interface allows a user to provide one or more filtering criteria that can be used to identify one or more popular venues within a selected geographic region of interest. For example a user may select one or more types of venues e.g. bars nightlife coffee shops combinations of these or other types of venues for which the user would like to identify one or more popular venues within the geographic region of interest. As another example a user may select one or more types of users e.g. single men single women sports lovers movie lovers combinations of these or other types of users that frequent or otherwise interact with one or more venues within the geographic region of interest. A user can initiate a search for one or more popular businesses based on the selected filtering criteria. For example by selecting both a type of venue and a type of user the user indicates a desire to identify one or more popular venues of the selected type that are frequented or are interacted with by users of the selected type of user. Also and as described in more detail above an application that presents the graphical user interface can communicate with a server e.g. the server system to provide information responsive to the request.

In an example the graphical user interface can be presented by one of the applications executing on one of the computing devices that is configured to present information indicative of one or more venues in a geographic region of interest. In an example the graphical user interface includes an options region a venue filter region a geographic region user interface component and a crowd type filter region .

In this example the options region presents user interface components and . When for example a user selects the user interface component the application may change the manner in which the venues are presented to the user. In one example when a user selects the user interface component the application changes from showing the venues in the geographic region user interface component to presenting the venues in a list as shown in reference to . In addition in this example when a user selects the user interface component the application may present one or more options to the user for posting their activity within the application to one or more social networking platforms. In an example a user may share the presented graphical user interface on the social networking platform . In another example a user may check in to a venue. In yet another example share a venue or a list of venues and the filtering criteria that generated that list . In yet another example a user may share one or more saved search criteria that are used to identify one or more venues. In addition or alternatively a user may instead opt to electronically mail a copy of the presented graphical user interface e.g. take a screen shot of the current graphical user interface and provide it as an attachment in an e mail or other electronic communication . In addition in another example when a user selects the user interface component the user may obtain additional information about the application or logout of the application.

The venue filter region may allow a user to select the type of venue s that the user would like to locate. In an example the venue filter region includes a number of user interface components . These user interface components may correspond to particular types of venues for which popularity scores can be determined. For example user interface components may represent restaurants bars nightlife coffee shops respectively or a variety of other types of venues. When a user selects one of the user interface components the application may present information indicative of venues of that particular type to the user. In a particular example a user can press one of the user interface components using the touch sensitive display of a computing device to make a selection. In response the application can provide the selected venue type to the server system . As a result of receiving the provided selection the server system can identify one or more venues in the geographic region of interest based on a determined popularity score relative to other venues in the geographic region of interest having the same or similar venue type. These identified venues can be provided by the server system to the application and presented in the graphical user interface .

The geographic region user interface component may present a geographic region of interest and one or more venues that are located within that geographic region of interest. In an example the region for which venues locations are identified is defined by what is presented in the geographic region user interface component . That is in general venues that are outside the geographic region user interface component may not be considered.

In an example a user can modify the geographic region user interface component presented by providing user input. In one example a user may scroll the geographic region user interface component by providing user input indicative of a request to scroll the geographic region user interface component such as when a user makes physical contact with a finger on a touch sensitive display device and then moves the finger within the geographic region user interface component . In response to receiving the user input the region of interest displayed within the geographic region user interface component may move in the direction of the request to scroll.

In another example a user may provide user input indicative of a request to zoom in or out within the geographic region user interface component such as when a user makes physical contact with two fingers on a touch sensitive display device and provides tactile input such as by moving the fingers towards each other moving the fingers apart from each other and so forth. In response to receiving the user input the geographic region user interface component may zoom in or zoom out to reflect the request to zoom. In a particular example information indicative of the twenty most popular venues within the geographic region of interest is presented to a user. In this example the popularity of the venues are determined relative to each other and based on affirmative actions of the users performed on the social networking platform as will be described in more detail below. In some implementations the server system may perform one or more techniques to combine or otherwise filter the identified venues within the geographic region of interest. In an example the server system can compare one or more venue names with a trusted source to remove erroneous names e.g. one venue may be associated with a trusted name of Joe s Sports Bar while another venue may be associated with a name Joes Sports Bar . In a particular example even though only Joe s Sports Bar is presented the affirmative actions that are performed for both Joe s Sports Bar and Joes Sports Bar can be combined so that information indicative of the popularity of Joe s Sports Bar is not otherwise lost. In some implementations when the affirmative actions are combined duplicate actions by a same user may be removed. In a particular example if user Bob likes Joes Sports Bar on a social networking platform and Bob also checks in at Joe s Sports Bar Bob s affirmative action of liking Joes Sports Bar may be removed.

In the illustrated example the geographic region user interface component presents a region of interest around the Washington D.C. area. In addition in this illustrated example the geographic region user interface component presents location representations such as location representations and of the most popular venues in the region of interest. In a particular example the representations are push pins that show approximate locations of particular venues within the geographic region of interest. In an example the push pins are selectable. In this particular example each representation includes a number that represents a popularity ranking for each of the presented venues. That is a venue that is associated with a representation labeled number 1 has been determined by the server system to be more popular than a venue that is associated with a representation that is labeled 4. Also in this particular example a user may touch a region of the touch sensitive display to select one of the representations. In response and as will be described in reference to the application may present additional information about the selected venue.

Still referring to the crowd type filter region provides one or more user interface components by which a user of the application can select a particular crowd type. This selected crowd type may be used to define which venues are shown in the graphical user interface by presenting venues that are popular with the selected crowd type. In addition as an example a user can select user interface component to indicate a desire to change crowd types.

In response the application may present a graphical user interface allowing the user to select a particular crowd type. One example user interface that allows a user to select a crowd type is shown in reference to as described in more detail below . In an example once a crowd type has been selected a popularity score for venues within the region of interest with users belonging to the selected crowd type may be determined. In the illustrated example a popularity score for Bars in the geographic region of interest can be determined for users of the social networking platform that belong to the Sports Lovers crowd type. In an example these popularity scores are determined relative to other venues in the geographic region of interest for people belonging to the Sports Lovers crowd type. For example and as will be described in more detail below the server system can compute a weighted score of the affirmative actions performed by users of the social networking platform that belong to the Sports Lovers crowd type to determine a popularity score for each venue within the geographic region of interest.

Referring now to another graphical user interface is shown. In some implementations the graphical user interface may be shown after receiving user input indicative of a zoom request and in response to user input indicative of selecting a particular venue in the selected geographic region of interest. In this particular example graphical user interface presents a zoomed in portion of the map shown in the graphical user interface shown in . In addition graphical user interface presents information in response to the user selecting a particular location representation. In this particular example the graphical user interface is presented in response to the user selecting the location representation that corresponds to location 1 e.g. as illustrated by location representation in the geographic region user interface component . That is if a user selects one of the representations such as location representation or described above with respect to the application may present graphical user interface in response. The graphical user interface shares many of the same user interface components as graphical user interface . For example graphical user interface also includes an options region a venue filter region a geographic region user interface component and a crowd type filter region .

In an example the geographic region user interface component includes a user interface component . In this example the user interface component is presented in response to receiving user selection of a location representation in the geographic region user interface component . In a particular example the user interface component is shown in response to the user selecting the location representation that corresponds to location 1 in the geographic region user interface component . In an example the user interface component may include one or more user selectable controls and that enable a user to change which venue is shown in user interface component .

The user interface component provides the user with at least some of the demographic data and or psychographic data that is associated with the one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the selected venue. In this particular example a region of the user interface component shows information that corresponds to a percentage of the users based on gender of the social networking platform who are frequenting or otherwise interacting with the particular venue e.g. by performing one or more affirmative actions on the social networking platform . Likewise in this particular example a region shows a relationship status that corresponds to a percentage of users based on relationship status of the social networking platform who are frequenting or otherwise interacting with the particular venue e.g. by performing one or more affirmative actions on the section networking platform . Also in this particular example a region shows an average age that corresponds to the average age of all of the users of the social networking platform that have frequented or otherwise interacted with the particular venue.

In this example if a user selects user selectable control a venue that precedes the currently selected venue based on the venue s popularity score is presented. In a particular example if information indicative of a most popular venue is presented in the user interface component i.e. the venue that has the highest relative popularity score and the user selectable control is selected the preceding venue would be the least popular venue or the venue with the lowest relative popularity score of those venues identified. For example if twenty popular venues are identified the least popular venue in this context would be the twentieth most popular venue in the selected geographic region of interest. Similarly when a user selects the user selectable control a venue that succeeds the currently selected venue based on the venue s popularity score is presented. In a particular example when a venue with the highest popularity score is shown and a user selects the user selectable control the next most popular venue would be shown in user interface component .

In this example the user interface component includes a text region that presents the name of the particular venue. Also in this example the user interface component may include a text region that presents the number of users of the social networking platform that have performed a check in at the particular venue as provided by the server system .

The user interface component also includes a selectable user interface component that where selected indicates to the application that the user would like to see additional demographic data and psychographic data about the one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the selected venue. In response the application may present additional demographic data and psychographic data in another user interface. In a particular example graphical user interfaces shown in connection with respectively may be presented to the user allowing the user to view additional demographic data and psychographic data about the selected venue. This additional information may help the user to determine whether to visit the venue. For example the additional information may help the user get a sense for what people at the venue might be like. If for example the user approves of or otherwise feels a connection with the one or more crowd types associated with people that might be at the venue the user may be more likely to visit the venue.

Referring now to in addition to or instead of presenting a geographic region user interface component that includes information indicative of one or more popular venues as illustrated in a list of popular venues can be provided in a list region of the graphical user interface . The graphical user interface shares many of the same user interface components as graphical user interface . For example graphical user interface also includes an options region a venue filter region and a crowd type filter region . In an example the options region includes an interface component that when selected presets the list as a collection of representations in a geographic region user interface component of the graphical user interface of . That is by selecting user interface component a user can switch from the list shown in reference to to the geographic region of interest shown in reference to .

Still referring to the list presented in the list region can present one or more venues located in the geographic region of interest ordered by their relative popularity. In the illustrated example the list region presents the one or more venues in ascending order of popularity with the more popular venues at the top of the list and the less popular venues at the bottom of the list. The list region may also present the venues in a descending order of popularity. In an example the list region may be scrollable. That is a user may provide a vertical swiping gesture as input to the touch sensitive display device to scroll the list in the direction of the gesture e.g. either up or down .

In an example each item of the list includes similar information to that shown with respect to the user interface component shown in reference to . In this example each of the items in the list includes a graphical region such as graphical regions where particular information about the particular venue is displayed. In the illustrated example the graphical region includes a text region that presents the name of the particular venue. Also in this illustrated example the graphical region may include a text region that presents the city and state where the venue is located. Yet still in this illustrated example the graphical region may also include a text region that presents the number of users of the social networking platform that have performed a check in at the particular venue as provided by the server system .

Similar to the user interface component the graphical region may also include at least a subset of the demographic data psychographic data or both for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with a particular venue. As described above the demographic data and psychographic data may be received from the server system and be associated with the particular venue. In this particular example a region of the graphical region shows information that corresponds to a percentage of the users based on gender of the social networking platform who are frequenting or otherwise interacting with the particular venue e.g. by performing one or more affirmative actions on the social networking platform . Likewise in this particular example a region shows a relationship status that corresponds to a percentage of users based on relationship status of the social networking platform who are frequenting or otherwise interacting with the particular venue e.g. by performing one or more affirmative actions on the section networking platform . Also in this particular example a region shows an average age that corresponds to the average age of all of the users of the social networking platform that have frequented or otherwise interacted with the particular venue.

If a user wishes to obtain information about a particular venue presented in the list region the user may provide a user input indicative of such a desire. In an example the user may touch or otherwise provide physical contact with the touch sensitive display device within the graphical region to indicate that the user wishes to view additional demographic data and psychographic data for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the particular venue. In response and similar to when a user selects user interface element described above the application may present graphical user interfaces shown in connection with respectively to allow the user to view additional demographic data and psychographic data for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the selected venue. In some implementations this demographic data and psychographic data is accessed by the server system and from the social networking platform .

Referring now to graphical user interfaces are shown that provide additional demographic data and psychographic data for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with a selected venue. Any or all of the additional information may be based on one or more determinations made by the server system with respect to user data accessed on the social networking platform . As described above in one example graphical user interfaces can be a single graphical view that may be scrolled to show additional information presented in any of . For example if a user is presented with graphical user interface and provides user input indicative of a request to scroll the graphical view downward some portion s of graphical user interfaces may be presented depending on the request to scroll.

Referring now to some additional demographic data is shown for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with a particular venue in graphical user interface . This additional information may help a user of the application determine whether to visit the venue. For example if a user wants to meet people of the opposite sex a combination of additional gender information and relationship status information may help the user decide if the user wants to visit the location. In an example graphical user interface may include a text region indicating the name of the particular venue a text region indicating the city state country and so forth for the particular venue a text region indicating a number of check ins performed on the social networking platform for the particular venue and a text region indicating a number of endorsements performed on the social networking platform .

The graphical user interface may also include a number of graphical representations of demographic data for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the particular venue. In an example the graphical user interface may include a visual indication such as a slider showing a percentage of males and females that frequent the venue. As another example the graphical user interface may show a visual representation such as a bar chart showing percentages of people having different relationship statuses among the people that frequent the venue. Also the graphical user interface may present a visual representation of an average age of the people that frequent the particular venue.

Referring now to additional demographic data and psychographic data for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the particular venue can be shown in graphical user interface . The graphical user interface may include representations of demographic data and crowd types for one or more users that frequent or otherwise interact with the particular venue. In an example graphical user interface may present a visual representation of an average age of the people that frequent the particular venue. In an example graphical user interface is a continuation of the visual representation shown in graphical user interface and may include additional visual representations such as a bar chart illustrating a breakdown of the various ages of people that frequent the particular venue. As another example the graphical user interface may include a graphical representation such as an ordered list that shows the more common crowd types associated with people that frequent the particular venue. Determining crowd types is described in more detail below.

In some implementations the crowd types shown may be any of i the one or more crowd types with which the venue is most popular e.g. crowd types that have the greatest numbers of members who frequent or otherwise interact with a particular venue or ii one or more crowd types that have the greatest affinity with the venue. The information presented in graphical representation may also provide information that allows a user to determine whether to visit a venue. For example the graphical representation suggests that the particular venue is most popular with food lovers party goers sports lovers music lovers and television fans. If a particular user shares interests with one or more of these groups the user may be more interested in visiting the venue.

Examples of techniques for determining if a user identity belongs to the different crowd types introduced above are now described. There may be a number of ways to determine a crowd type to which a user belongs. In an example the application may determine if a user identity and the corresponding human user that is associated with the user identity belongs to a particular crowd type based on the extent to which the user identity has endorsed pages that the application identifies as corresponding to the particular crowd type. As a candidate for a particular crowd type the application may consider any user identity that includes an endorsement of at least one page that corresponds to the particular crowd. Other factors may also be used. In general these factors can measure a strength of connection to other friends or fans of an interest or venue . In a particular example whether a particular user is mentioned in a post can be used to measure a strength of connection between the user in the post and topic that is associated with the post. For a user identity that the application has identified as a candidate for a particular crowd type the application then may calculate a crowd type page score for the user identity according to equation 1 below crowd type page score Eq. 1 

In the above equation 1 A represents the number of pages that the user identity has endorsed that correspond to the particular crowd type and B represents the total number of pages that the user identity has endorsed within the electronic social networking platform. As described in greater detail below the application then may use the crowd type page score calculated for the user identity in determining if the user identity belongs to the particular crowd type.

Another factor the application may consider in determining whether a user identity belongs to a particular crowd type is the user identity s check ins that the application extracted from the electronic social networking platform. Each crowd type may be defined as corresponding to a collection of certain check in locations. The collection of check in locations corresponding to any particular crowd type may be identified based on check in locations that have been assigned one or more category designations within the electronic social networking platform and or check in locations that have been assigned one or more category designations by the application e.g. specific check in locations that have been hardcoded as belonging to one or more different categories by the application itself . The application may determine if a user identity belongs to a particular crowd type based on the extent to which the user identity has checked in at locations that the application identifies as corresponding to the particular crowd type.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity belongs to the music lovers crowd type. One particular example is described below. The music lovers crowd type may be defined as corresponding to pages categorized within the electronic social networking platform as musician band musical genre song music video and music. If a user identity has endorsed any page within the electronic social networking platform categorized as belonging to any one of these categories the application may consider the user identity to be a candidate for the music lovers crowd type and calculate a crowd type page score for the user identity. If the crowd type page score for the user identity is within a predefined top percentile e.g. the top 20 of crowd type page scores for all user identities identified as candidates for the music lovers crowd type then the application may determine that the user identity belongs to the music lovers crowd type. Even if the application determines that the user identity s page endorsements do not qualify the user identity for membership in the music lovers crowd type the application still may determine that the user identity belongs to the music lovers crowd type based on the user identity s check in activity. For example the application may determine that the user identity belongs to the music lovers crowd type if the user identity has checked in to locations classified by the electronic social networking platform and or the application as concert music venues or music stores more than six times within the previous six months.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity belongs to the movie lovers crowd type. One particular example is described below. The movie lovers crowd type may be defined as corresponding to pages categorized within the electronic social networking platform as movie actor director movie genre movie theater and movie general. If a user identity has endorsed any page within the electronic social networking platform categorized as belonging to any one of these categories the application may consider the user identity to be a candidate for the movie lovers crowd type and calculate a crowd type page score for the user identity. If the crowd type page score for the user identity is within a predefined top percentile e.g. the top 20 of crowd type page scores for all user identities identified as candidates for the movie lovers crowd type then the application may determine that the user identity belongs to the movie lovers crowd type. Even if the application determines that the user identity s page endorsements do not qualify the user identity for membership in the movie lovers crowd type the application still may determine that the user identity belongs to the movie lovers crowd type based on the user identity s check in activity. For example the application may determine that the user identity belongs to the movie lovers crowd type if the user identity has checked in to locations classified by the electronic social networking platform and or the application as movie theaters at least once a week every week for the previous six months.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity belongs to the TV fans crowd type. One particular example is described below. The TV fans crowd type may be defined as corresponding to pages categorized within the electronic social networking platform as TV show TV network TV channel TV and TV genre. If a user identity has endorsed any page within the electronic social networking platform categorized as belonging to any one of these categories the application may consider the user identity to be a candidate for the TV fans crowd type and calculate a crowd type page score for the user identity. If the crowd type page score for the user identity is within a predefined top percentile e.g. the top 20 of crowd type page scores for all user identities identified as candidates for the TV fans crowd type then the application may determine that the user identity belongs to the TV fans crowd type.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity belongs to the social activists crowd type. One particular example is described below. The social activists crowd type may be defined as corresponding to pages categorized within the electronic social networking platform as non profit organization and cause. If a user identity has endorsed any page within the electronic social networking platform categorized as belonging to any one of these categories the application may consider the user identity to be a candidate for the social activist crowd type and calculate a crowd type page score for the user identity. If the crowd type page score for the user identity is within a predefined top percentile e.g. the top 20 of crowd type page scores for all user identities identified as candidates for the social activist crowd type then the application may determine that the user identity belongs to the social activist crowd type.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity belongs to the sports lovers crowd type. One particular example is described below. The sports lovers crowd type may be defined as corresponding to pages categorized within the electronic social networking platform as athlete professional sports team sports league sports recreation activities recreation sports amateur sports team school sports team sport and sports.

In another example data for one or more users of the social networking platform can be accessed by the server system from the social networking platform and be periodically cached by the server system and stored in the demographic data and psychographic data . This cached data may be accessed instead of or in addition to accessing user data stored in the data store as described above.

Data indicative of one or more affirmative actions performed by one or more users on the social networking platform can also be identified . In an example the server system can access user data in the data store of the social networking platform. Because the user data likely contains one or more affirmative actions e.g. that a user endorsed content on the social networking platform that a user posted content on the social networking platform that a user checked in to a location and so forth the server system can identify these affirmative actions using a number of different techniques. In a particular example the server system may attempt to identify affirmative actions that include an action of endorsing content available on the social networking platform by identifying one or more likes in the user data for a particular user. In another particular example the server system may attempt to identify an action of checking into a geographic location by identifying a data object that indicates that a particular user has checked into a particular location. As yet another particular example the server system may attempt to identify an action of posting content on the social networking platform by identifying a data object that indicates that a particular user generated a post on a page of another user of the social networking platform. As yet another particular example the server system may attempt to identify an action of adding a tag to content posted on the social networking platform by identifying a data object that is indicative of the tag that has been added to the content. In an example the server system may attempt to identify affirmative actions for each user of the social networking platform who has given the server system permission e.g. either expressly or implicitly through various privacy settings to access the user s respective user data. In another example data for one or more users of the social networking platform can be accessed by the server system from the social networking platform and be periodically cached by the server system and stored in the demographic data and psychographic data . This cached data may be accessed instead of or in addition to accessing user data stored in the data store as described above.

Using the accessed user data one or more popularity scores can be generated . In one example the server system may compute a popularity score for a venue based on one or more identified affirmative actions of one or more users. As described above these affirmative actions may include user generated endorsements user generated check ins user generated posts user generated tags and other affirmative actions. In a particular example when generating one or more popularity scores these affirmative actions may be weighed based on characteristics of the users who performed the affirmative actions. In a particular example affirmative actions of users on the social networking platform that are also users of the application may be weighted more heavily than users that are only users of the social networking platform. In some implementations the one or more popularity scores may be calculated using a function similar to that shown in equation 2 below Ln popularity 0.0528344343 Ln 0.9515309234 Ln segment 0.9330821651 Ln 9.330821651 Ln 1 0.75 0.5 Eq. 2 

In this example snAH are a number of check ins performed by all users of the social networking platform that indicate that the users of the social networking platform visited the particular venue. In some implementations the value snAH can be identified in data made available by the social networking platform for a particular venue. Also in this example segmentAH are check ins performed on the social networking platform and for the particular venue by users for whom the application is authorized to extract data from the social networking platform belonging to a crowd type that has been selected by the user of the application. Examples of the selected crowd type can include but are not limited to Sports Lovers Single Men and so forth. Also in this example appAH are check ins performed on the social networking platform and for the particular venue by users for whom the application is authorized to extract data from the social networking platform regardless of the crowd types to which the users belong. In an example when no crowd type has been specified the popularity score may be based solely on the number of check ins performed by users of the social networking platform that indicate that the users of the social networking platform visited the particular venue. In some implementations snAH segmentAH and appAH may reflect one or more other affirmative actions in addition to check ins.

One or more popular venues can be determined . In an example the popular venues may be determined based on the generated popularity scores for at least some of the venues located in the geographic region of interest. Generally a popular venue includes a venue with an increased popularity score e.g. relative to popularity scores associated with other venues. For example the server system may determine the twenty most popular venues based on the twenty highest popularity scores determined for the venues located in the geographic region of interest.

Data indicative of a type of user of the social networking platform can be generated . That is for particular venues that are identified as popular venues information can be determined about the types of users who frequent or otherwise interact with the venues e.g. as indicated by the affirmative actions performed on the social networking platform . In an example the server system can aggregate relevant user data accessed for particular users of the social networking platform . In this example if there are fifty particular users that have frequented or otherwise interacted with the particular venue the server system can aggregate the user data for all of those fifty particular users. More specifically if twenty five of those users are men and twenty five of those users are women the aggregated demographic data generated by the server system would include an indication that fifty percent of users of the social networking platform that have frequented or otherwise interacted with the particular venue are men and fifty percent are women. In a particular example as illustrated by user interface component fifty five percent of users of the social networking platform that have frequented or otherwise interacted with the Velocity venue are men.

This same percentage can also be shown in with additional demographic and psychographic data. For example in response to selecting a particular venue e.g. by selecting a selectable user interface component FIG. B additional user interfaces and may be presented. In particular as shown in visual indication may show a percentage of males and females that frequent or otherwise interact with the venue.

In an example the data indicative of the type of user may include anonymous demographic data about one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue and anonymous psychographic data about the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. That is there server system may remove identifying information e.g. name contact information and so forth included in the user data when providing the demographic data and psychographic data to a user. For example the income bracket information shown in visual representation does not include any particular information that would allow a user of the application to associate a particular income with a particular user of the social networking platform.

According to various examples the generated data indicative of a type of user of the social networking platform that frequents or otherwise interacts with the one or more popular venues e.g. the anonymous demographic data and the anonymous psychographic data can be provided in various ways to show one or more characteristics of the types of users that frequent or otherwise interact with the one or more popular venues. In an example the anonymous demographic data can include one or more of data indicative of a gender of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue e.g. as shown in the graphical user interface in . In another example the anonymous demographic data can also include data indicative of an age of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue e.g. as shown in the graphical user interface of . In another example the anonymous demographic data can also include data indicative of an ethnicity of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue.

In another example the anonymous demographic data can also include data indicative of knowledge of languages of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue e.g. as shown in the graphical user interface of . In another example the anonymous demographic data can also include data indicative of home ownership of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. In another example the anonymous demographic data can also include data indicative of an employment status of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. In another example the anonymous demographic data can also include data indicative of a relationship status of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular business e.g. as shown in the graphical user interface of .

In another example the anonymous psychographic data can include one or more of data indicative of one or more interests of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue e.g. as shown in the graphical user interface of . The anonymous psychographic data can also include data indicative of a lifestyle of the one or more users of the social networking platform who perform the one or more affirmative actions for the determined popular venue. Other examples of providing demographic data and the anonymous psychographic data to show one or more characteristics of the types of users that frequent or otherwise interact with the one or more popular venues are also possible.

In some implementations however the demographic data and psychographic data may not be anonymous. In an example the information in the graphical user interfaces and may be based on particular friends on the social networking platform of a user viewing the information. In a particular example the user viewing the information may have requested to see where the user s friends on the social networking platform that are associated with the movie lovers crowd type have frequented are currently located e.g. based on a recent check in and so forth. In this particular example the graphical user interfaces and may present representations of the user s friends at or near particular venues and indications e.g. their respective names that allow the user to identify which of their friends are at or near the particular venues.

In some examples the method may also transmit to a client device information indicative of a geographic area that includes representations of the one or more popular venues. In a particular example the server system may transmit information to one of the computing devices that can be interpreted by an application executing on one of the computing device causing the application to present a graphical user interface similar to that of graphical user interface shown in . That is information transmitted by the server system and received by an application may cause the application to display a map or other geographical representation that includes representations of one or more popular venues. In a particular example user interface may present push pins or other representations for the determined popular venues.

In some examples the method may also receive information indicative of a selection of at least one of the representations included in the geographic area. In a particular example if a user selects information indicative of one of the venues the application may cause the one of the computing devices to provide an indication of the selection to the server system . In response the method may also transmit to the client device anonymous demographic data and anonymous psychographic data about one or more users associated with a venue represented by the selected representation. In an example the server system may transmit the anonymous demographic data and anonymous psychographic data such that the anonymous demographic data and anonymous psychographic data is presented by the application. In a particular example the application may present any of graphical user interfaces and shown in to present the anonymous demographic data and anonymous psychographic data to the user of the application.

In some examples the anonymous demographic data and anonymous psychographic data are indicative of users who frequent or otherwise interact with a popular venue. This anonymous data may be cached on the computing device . As a result when a user selects a visual representation of the popular venue for which the anonymous data is cached the application can access the cached data without having to request that information from the server system .

Computers suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example general or special purpose microprocessors or both or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processing unit for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer will also include or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. However a computer need not have such devices. Moreover a computer can be embedded in another device e.g. a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile audio or video player a game console a Global Positioning System GPS receiver or a portable storage device e.g. a universal serial bus USB flash drive to name just a few.

Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory media and memory devices including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.

Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet.

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.

While this specification contains many specific implementation details these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any of what may be claimed but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular implementations. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

Particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. As one example the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown or sequential order to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
