The present application claims priority to and incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 209376 filed in Japan on Sep. 24 2012.

The present invention relates to a communication control device a message transmission method and a message transmission program.

In recent years various kinds of social networking services SNSs have gained popularity. To use these services for example users can send messages to other accounts in the same service write and post diaries of the users or browse the diaries or individual information regarding users of the other accounts by acquiring individual accounts of the service and logging in the services using the individual accounts.

In such SNSs convenience can be achieved when public communication for example communication within companies can be exchanged using usually used private individual accounts. However when the individual accounts of the SNSs are disclosed in working places the private behaviors disclosed on the SNSs are also known to senior members or the like of the working places. Thus disadvantages may occur.

Technologies for keeping individual accounts secret at the time of transmission of electronic mails have been known as technologies of the related art. For example a technology has been known in which when a message in which the address of a sender is A and the address of a destination is B is transmitted to a terminal of a user who is the sender a relay device receives the message converts the address of the sender and the address of the destination to A and B respectively and then transmits the message to a terminal of a user of the destination.

However in the above described technologies of the related art there is a problem that messages may not be exchanged between users using other message communication services while mutual individual accounts are appropriately kept secret. That is as in the above described technology of the related art in the technology for converting addresses and transmitting electronic mails the electronic mails of the same protocol may not be transmitted without disclosing mutual accounts to both sides. Further messages may not be transmitted between users using other message communication services. Therefore messages may not be transmitted and received while individual accounts are kept secret.

It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology.

According to one aspect of an embodiment of the present invention A communication control device includes a destination specifying unit that specifies a destination of a message transmitted from a user terminal based on contents of a text of the message when the message is received a specifying unit that specifies a type of communication service available by a user of the destination specified by the destination specifying unit a creation unit that converts a format of the received message into a format suitable for the type of communication service specified by the specifying unit and a transmission unit that transmits the message converted by the creation unit to the destination specified by the destination specifying unit.

The above and other objects features advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Hereinafter a mode hereinafter referred to as an embodiment for carrying out a communication control device a message transmission method and a message transmission program according to the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Further the communication control device the message transmission method and the message transmission program according to the embodiment of the present disclosure are not limited.

A first embodiment of the communication control device the message transmission method and the message transmission program according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to

First the configuration of a communication control device will be described with reference to . is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of the communication control device according to the first embodiment. The communication control device includes a communication processing unit a control unit and a storage unit . The communication control device is connected to a plurality of user terminals A to C via a network . In the example of an example is illustrated in which the communication control unit is connected to three user terminals A to C but the number of user terminals to be connected is not limited thereto. When it is not necessary to distinguish the plurality of user terminals A to C from each other in description the plurality of user terminals A to C are simply referred to as the user terminal . 

The communication processing unit transmits and receives various kinds of data to and from the plurality of user terminals A to C via the network . The communication processing unit corresponds to for example a network interface card NIC . In the following description a case will be exemplified in which users using the user terminals A to C have individual accounts of different communication services and perform logging in from the individual accounts to transmit and receive messages.

Here the communication services are services that enable messages to communicate between the user accounts and also include social network services that manage connection between users. Specifically as the communication services there are services such as Internet mails short message services Twitter Mixi Ameba Facebook and messengers.

The storage unit is for example a semiconductor memory element such as a random access memory Ram a flash memory or a storage device such as a hard disk or an optical disc. The storage unit stores data and a program necessary for various processes performed by the control unit . The storage unit stores for example a transmission table

The transmission table stores a destination account of an individual account of each user. is a diagram illustrating an example of the transmission table . As exemplified in the transmission table stores a staff name which is the name of a user a destination account which is an individual account of the user and a service indicating a type of communication service associated with the individual account in association therewith.

The transmission table exemplified in stores a destination account yahuu hanako and a service t for a staff name Yahuu in association therewith and stores a destination account morixxxxxxxx mail.com and a service m for a staff name Mori in association therewith. This means that the account yahuu hanako of the service t is registered with regard to the staff Yahuu and the account morixxxxxxxx mail.com and the service m is registered with regard to the staff Mori.

The control unit includes a registration unit a destination specifying unit a service specifying unit a creation unit and a transmission unit . The control unit is realized by performing a process according to a computer program stored in advance in a storage device of a CPU an MPU or the like.

The registration unit registers accounts of various services as accounts for the communication control device relaying messages in advance in the storage unit . Specifically the registration unit inputs and registers the accounts of the various services in response to operations of a manager in advance. The accounts registered in advance here are relay accounts used to transmit and receive the messages by relaying messages between users. Hereinafter the accounts are referred to as relay accounts or accounts of company bot. 

When the registration unit receives a name an individual account and a type of service from a user the registration unit associates the name of the user and the type of service with each other by using the individual account as a destination account and registers the name of the user the type of service and the destination account in the transmission table . Here each communication service associated with each relay account registered in advance is set as a service which can be registered in the transmission table

Specifically the registration unit allows a user to select a desired service from the services which can be registered and also receives and inputs the individual account and the type of service of a user by transmitting the individual account of the service. In the above described example of Yahuu who is a staff selects t as a service which the staff desires to use and transmits the individual account yahuu hanako of the service t to the side of the communication control device .

When a service such as Twitter or Facebook having a following function is registered together with a user name and a destination account the individual account may be transmitted from the relay account of the service to the destination account relevant to the registration a message requesting following of the relay account may be transmitted and the following of the relay account may be urged.

Here a relation between the relay account and the individual account will be described with reference to . is a diagram illustrating an example of a case in which a company A introduces the communication control device according to this embodiment to transmit and receive messages between staffs and is a diagram illustrating an image used to describe the relation between an own company relay account of a company and an individual account of each staff. In the example of the company A has a relay account corresponding to each of a plurality of services. For example the company A has the own company account of each of a service m a service f and a service t as the relay account.

In the example of users are assumed to have accounts of different services. For example as exemplified in the staff using the user terminal A is assumed to have an individual account of the service m the staff using the user terminal B is assumed to have an individual account of the service f and the staff using the user terminal C is assumed to have an individual account of the service t. 

As exemplified in to transmit messages to the other staffs each staff logs in the individual account of the service which each user uses and posts messages to the relay accounts the accounts of company bot corresponding to the same type of service. A specific process of transmitting the posted message will be described in detail below.

Thus the registration unit registers the individual accounts which the users usually use. Therefore for example when the individual accounts are used in companies the individual accounts of the communication services which the staffs usually use may be registered for respective staffs and the companies may not issue staff mail accounts to the respective staffs. For example when the staffs are retired only sections of the retired staffs may be deleted from the transmission table.

The destination specifying unit receives a message transmitted from the user terminal and specifies a destination of the message based on the contents of the text of the message. Specifically for example the destination specifying unit receives messages destined for the relay account from various service sides via the communication processing unit and determines whether the names stored in the transmission table are registered in opening statements of the texts of the messages. When it is determined that the names are registered the names written in the opening statements of the texts of the messages are extracted the individual accounts corresponding to the names are read from the transmission table and the individual accounts are specified as the destinations.

For example in the example in which the transmission table is illustrated in when a message in which Asya TO YAHUU COULD YOU COME TO WORK ON HOLIDAY TOMORROW is written is received as a message transmitted from the user terminal to the relay account Asya the destination specifying unit retrieves the name from the opening statement of the text. When the transmission table determines that the staff name Yahuu is present the transmission table specifies the destination account yahuu hanako corresponding to Yahuu as the destination.

Here the destination specifying unit determines whether the received message is a new message or a reply message when there are a plurality of destination accounts corresponding to the name extracted from the opening statement of the text of the message. Specifically the destination specifying unit determines whether a reply message format in the corresponding communication service is satisfied as a method of determining whether the received message is a new message or a reply message.

For example when there are a plurality of users with the name Mori and the names Taro Mori and Jiro Mori are registered in the transmission table and when To MORI is written in the text of a received message there are the plurality of corresponding names. In this case the destination specifying unit determines whether the message is a new message or a reply message to a previous transmitted message.

As a result when determining that the message is a new message the destination specifying unit transmits a message used to designate a destination to the account which is a sender of the new message and specifies the destination according to a reply to the message. For example the destination specifying unit writes information full name or a department and an age regarding each of the users with the same name as the name extracted from the opening statement of the text of the received message and transmits the message with a text of the contents for selecting whether the mail is a mail transmitted to one user as the message used to designate the destination. Specifically as a specific example the destination specifying unit transmits a message with a text 1. TARO MORI DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL AFFAIRS 32 YEARS OLD 2. JIRO MORI DEPARTMENT OF SALES 27 YEARS OLD PLEASE SELECT EITHER NUMBER AND TRANSMIT MESSAGE and determines a destination according to the number replied to the message.

When determining that the message is a reply message the destination specifying unit sets the account of the sender of the immediately previous message of the reply message as the destination. That is since the reply message is a reply to the immediately previously arrived message the account of the sender of the immediately previous message is specified as the destination account.

The service specifying unit specifies a type of communication service available by the user of the destination specified by the destination specifying unit . Specifically the service specifying unit reads a service associated with the destination account specified by the destination specifying unit with reference to the transmission table and specifies the service.

The creation unit converts the format of the received message into a format suitable for the type of service specified by the service specifying unit Specifically the creation unit converts the format of the transmitted message destined for the relay account into a format suitable for the type of the service specified by the service specifying unit that is the type of service corresponding to the destination account of the destination.

For example when the received message destined for the relay account of the service m is transmitted to the destination account of the service t the creation unit extracts the text of the received message destined for the relay account of the service m and creates a message for the service t to which information such as temporal information submitted to the extracted text of the message is added.

The creation unit may specify the name of the sender from the account of the sender of the received message with reference to the transmission table and add the name of the sender to the opening statement of the text of the message to be transmitted. For example when the received message in which the sender is Mori is transmitted to the destination account yahuu the creation unit adds SENDER MORI to the text of the message and creates a message yahuu SENDER MORI TO YAHUU COULD YOU COME TO WORK ON HOLIDAY TOMORROW 

The transmission unit transmits the message converted by the creation unit to the destination specified by the destination specifying unit . Specifically the transmission unit transmits the message from the relay account of the service to the destination account using the service of the destination account.

Here a message transmission process between different services will be described with reference to an example of . is a diagram illustrating an example of the message transmission process between different services. As illustrated in the communication control device according to this embodiment is introduced by the company A. When Mori using the user terminal A sends a message to Yahuu using the user terminal B Mori logs in the account of the service m and transmits a message in which the name Yahuu is written in an opening statement of a text to the relay account of the service m of the company A using the service m see of .

Next the communication control device ID extracts Yahuu as a staff name from the opening statement of the text of the received message based on the transmission table acquires the destination account yahuu hanako for Yahuu specifies the destination and specifies that the service corresponding to Yahuu is t that is the type of service of the account available by Yahuu is t. Then the communication control device creates a message with a format suitable for the service t from the message received from Mori and transmits the message from the relay account of the service t of the company A to the account of the service t used by Yahuu see of .

When Yahuu using the user terminal B replies the message to Mori a message in which the destination name such as TO MORI is included in the opening statement of the text is replied to the message transmitted from the relay account of the service t of the company A and sent from Mori see of .

Next when the communication control device receives the replied message the communication control device extracts MORI in the opening statement of the text of the message as the destination based on the transmission table acquires the destination account morixxxxxxxx mail.com for MORI specifies the destination and specifies the service m corresponding to MORI that is that the type of service of the account which Mori has is m. Then the communication control device creates a message with a format suitable for the service m from the message received from Yahuu and transmits the message from the relay account of the service m of the company A to the account of the service in which Mori uses see of .

Thus the communication control device can transmit and receive a message for communication within a company using an individual account while the individual account of the communication service which a staff usually uses is not opened to other staffs of the company so as to be kept secret. Here with reference to a process of transmitting a message for communication within a company will be described while an individual account is not opened to the company so as to be kept secret. is a diagram illustrating an overview of the message transmission process performed by the communication control device according to the first embodiment.

As exemplified in for example when Mori sends a message TO YAHUU COULD YOU COME TO WORK ON HOLIDAY TOMORROW to Yahuu the message is transmitted from the individual account of the E mail to the relay account.

Next the communication control device extracts the name Yahuu written in the opening statement of the text of the message of the E mail and transmits a message COULD YOU COME TO WORK ON HOLIDAY TOMORROW from Mori from the relay account to the individual account yahuu hanako for Yahuu. Then Yahuu can receive the message sent from Mori from the individual account.

Therefore in the example of the message can be transmitted to Yahuu although Mori sending the message does not know the individual account of Yahuu. As a result the message for communication within the company can be transmitted and received while the individual account of the service which Yahuu usually uses is not opened to the company so as to be kept secret.

Next a process performed by the communication control device according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to . is a flowchart illustrating the process of the communication control device according to the first embodiment.

As illustrated in when the destination specifying unit of the communication control device receives the message transmitted to the relay account the destination specifying unit determines whether the destination name stored in the transmission table is present in the text of the message. When it is determined that the destination name is present Yes in step S the account of the sender of the message and the destination account corresponding to an address of the opening statement of the text of the message are acquired step S . Specifically the destination specifying unit extracts the account of the sender of the message and extracts the destination name written in the opening statement of the text of the message and then reads the individual account corresponding to the destination name from the transmission table

The destination specifying unit determines whether there are a plurality of destination names corresponding to the address of the opening statement of the text of the message in the transmission table step S . As a result when the destination specifying unit determines that there are no plurality of destination names No in step S the destination specifying unit specifies the destination account of the destination name corresponding to the address of the opening statement of the text of the message as the destination step S .

Conversely when the destination specifying unit determines that there is the plurality of corresponding destination names Yes in step S the destination specifying unit determines whether the received message is a new message step S . As a result when the destination specifying unit determines that the received message is the new message Yes in step S the destination specifying unit transmits the message used to designate the destination to the user terminal transmitting the new message and specifies the destination according to a reply message to the message step S . For example the destination specifying unit transmits as the message used to designate the destination a message including information a department or an age regarding each user corresponding to the name extracted from the opening statement of the text of the message and a text in which contents configured to select whether the message is a message transmitted to one user and urging a reply to the selection result and then specifies the destination according to the contents of the replied message.

Conversely when the destination specifying unit determines that the received message is not the new message that is determines that the received message is the reply message to the previous transmitted message No in step S the destination specifying unit specifies the account of the sender of the immediately proximal message corresponding to the reply message as the destination step S . That is the destination specifying unit specifies the account of the sender of the immediately previous message as the destination account by considering the reply message as the reply to the immediately previous message. The destination specifying unit may specify the account of the sender of the message most recently transmitted to the sender of the reply message as the destination account of the reply message.

The service specifying unit specifies a communication service relevant to use of the user of the destination specified by the destination specifying unit step S . Specifically the service specifying unit reads a service associated with the destination account specified by the destination specifying unit with reference to the transmission table and specifies the communication service.

Next the creation unit converts the format of the received message into a format suitable for the type of communication service according to the type of communication service specified by the service specifying unit step S . Specifically the creation unit converts the format of the message transmitted to the relay account into a format suitable for the type of communication service specified by the service specifying unit that is the type of service corresponding to the destination account of the destination.

The transmission unit transmits the message created by the creation unit to the destination specified by the destination specifying unit step S . Specifically the transmission unit transmits the message to the destination account by using the communication service of the destination account.

As described above when the communication control device receives a message transmitted from the user terminal the communication control device specifies the destination of the message based on the contents of the message specifies a type of communication service available by the user of the specified destination and converts the format of the message into a format suitable for the specified type of communication service. Then the communication control device transmits the converted message to the specified destination. Thus the communication control device can transmit and receive the message while appropriately keeping the individual accounts secret mutually between the users using different communication services.

According to the first embodiment the communication control device includes the transmission table that stores the names of the users the individual accounts which the users have and the types of communication services available by the users in association therewith. The communication control device extracts the name written in the opening statement of the text of the message reads the individual account corresponding to the name from the transmission table specifies the individual account as the destination reads the type of service corresponding to the specified individual account from the transmission table and specifies the type of service as the type of communication service available by the user. Therefore the communication control device can specify the individual account and the type of service when the name serving as the destination is merely written in the opening statement of the text of the message. Therefore the communication control device can transmit and receive the message while keeping the individual account secret appropriately and simply between the users using the different services.

According to the first embodiment when there is the plurality of individual accounts corresponding to the name the communication control device determines whether the received message is a new message or a reply message. When the communication control device determines that the received message is the new message the communication control device transmits the message used to confirm the destination to the user terminal transmitting the new message. Conversely when the communication control device determines that the received message is the reply message the communication control device specifies the account of the immediately previous message as the destination. Therefore the communication control device can appropriately specify the destination even when there is the plurality of candidates of the destination.

According to the first embodiment the communication control device registers the account of each service as the relay account used to relay a message in advance. Then the communication control device receives the message transmitted to the registered relay account and specifies the destination of the message based on the contents of the message. Therefore the communication control device can receive messages from the users using various services by registering the relay accounts relaying the messages in advance for the accounts of the respective services and thus can transmit the messages while appropriately keeping the individual accounts secret.

Hitherto one of the embodiments of the present disclosure has been described in detail with reference to the drawings but the embodiment is merely an example.
