The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The use of reactive powders and in particular powders that react with water are known. This includes the use of such water reactive powders in underwater applications. For example torpedo warheads utilize powdered forms of low atomic metals for example lithium in order to produce the desired underwater explosion.

Reactions that occur underwater or utilize water as an oxidizing agent however are often slowed by the presence of excess amounts water which cool the desired explosive reaction. Slowing of the reaction decreases the effectiveness of the reaction. Another limitation on the effectiveness of these water reactions results from the premature oxidation of the reactive particles within the reactive material. The size of the particles in the water reactive material also affects the efficiency of the reaction. Using large particles of a water reactive material is inefficient. Smaller particles contact the water with a greater surface area and thereby accelerate the reaction. Reaction time is also limited by diffusion rate. For example a thick layer of a water reactive material inhibits the reaction by causing a slow diffusion rate.

In general enhanced shock performance of explosions using water reactive materials comes from increasing the early time frame rate of bubble expansion and sustaining this rate as long as possible. The chemical energy of an underwater explosive is distributed into shock and bubble performance as well as waste energy. Each of the constituents in an underwater explosive contributes to the observed performance. A shock wave initiates the Helium decomposition causing a release of gases and energy which initiates the chemical decomposition of the oxidizer into gas that drives the early bubble expansion. By increasing the energy release from intimate fuel oxidizer combinations i.e. water oxidizer and a water reactive material fuel in this time frame an increase in the rate of oxidizer decomposition and therefore the shock bubble performance is realized.

Subsequently the energy released from the fuel reacting with the product gases is generally slow and contributes to the bubble performance. If the expanding mixture is heavy in solids the conversion of the chemical energy to potential energy will be inefficient and lead to waste energy in the form of hot gases at the end of the bubble expansion. If the expanding mixture is mostly gases then the peak pressure will be high but shock wave will only be supported for a short time. Furthermore the energy from gas producing reactions is generally less than from fuel oxidizer reactions. However the conversion of chemical energy to potential energy of the bubble is generally very efficient leaving no waste energy in the form of hot gases at the end of the bubble expansion. Therefore a system is needed that optimizes the particle composition and ignition of the water reactive material and improve the mixing of the water reactive material with water in order to improve the resulting explosion.

Exemplary embodiments of systems and methods in accordance with the present invention provide for the rapid mixing of a water reactive material with water as an oxidizer within a confined reaction container in order to yield an improved bubble expansion and explosion. In one exemplary embodiment the present invention is directed to a reaction container having an interior and an amount of water reactive material disposed within the interior. The water reactive material is formed as a plurality of separate and spaced apart portions for example two opposing portions. In one exemplary embodiment each portion of the water reactive material contains a plurality of distinct particles of the water reactive material which can be an organic or inorganic water reactive material. Each particle has an average diameter of about 5 nanometers to about 3 micrometers.

Suitable water reactive materials react violently with water to produce gas and heat. In one exemplary embodiment the water reactive material contains a metal a metalloid a metal oxide a metalloid oxide or combinations thereof. In one exemplary embodiment the particles are inorganic particles that include magnesium aluminum boron titanium tungsten hafnium or combinations thereof. In another embodiment the inorganic particles include a metal oxide comprising aluminum oxide titanium oxide molybdenum oxide vanadium oxide iron oxide or combinations thereof. In an exemplary embodiment the water reactive material contains a plurality of distinct particles of aluminum and each aluminum particle has a diameter of about 5 nanometers to about 3 micrometers.

The reaction container also includes a predetermined volume of water disposed within the interior. This volume of water is separated from the water reactive material to avoid undesired mixing between the water and the water reactive material. The volume of water is arranged such that the water is located between any two portions of the water reactive material. The amount of water reactive material and the volume of water are stoichiometrically balanced. A detonation mechanism configured to mix the amount of water reactive material and the volume of water is provided in the interior of the reaction container. The detonation mechanism is in communication with at least one of the plurality of portions of water reactive material or the volume of water.

In one exemplary embodiment the interior of the reaction container includes a first end and a second end opposite the first end. The portions of the water reactive material include a first portion disposed adjacent the first end of the interior and a second portion disposed adjacent the second end. The volume of water is disposed between the first portion and the second portion i.e. generally in the center of the interior of the container. In this embodiment the detonation mechanism includes two identical detonation mechanisms that include a first detonation mechanism disposed between the first portion and the first end and a second detonation mechanism disposed between the second portion and the second end.

The present invention is also directed to a reaction container having an interior an amount of an aluminum containing water reactive material within the interior that is arranged as a plurality of separate and spaced apart portions a volume of water disposed within the interior separated from the water reactive material and arranged such that the water is located between any two portions of the water reactive material and a detonation mechanism configured to mix the amount of water reactive material and the volume of water. The water reactive material reacts violently with water to produce gas and heat and the detonation mechanism is in communication with at least one of the plurality of portions of water reactive material. In addition the volume of water and the aluminum in the water reactive material are stoichiometrically balanced. In one embodiment the water reactive material contains about 85 aluminum and about 15 of a plastic binder.

In one embodiment the water reactive material is configured as two portions. The interior includes a first end and a second end opposite the first end and the two portions of the water reactive material include a first portion disposed adjacent the first end of the interior and a second portion disposed adjacent the second end. The volume of water is disposed between the first portion and the second portion. The detonation mechanism includes two identical detonation mechanisms having a first detonation mechanism disposed between the first portion and the first end and a second detonation mechanism disposed between the second portion and the second end.

In one exemplary embodiment the water reactive material includes exploded aluminum aluminum as a fine powder or combinations thereof. In one exemplary embodiment each portion of the water reactive material contains a plurality of distinct particles containing the aluminum. Each particle has a diameter of about 5 nanometers to about 3 micrometers.

Exemplary embodiments in accordance with the present invention are directed to methods and systems for reacting a water reactive material with water within the interior of a reaction container. Referring initially to an embodiment of the reaction container in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The reaction container includes a container formed from at least one and in an exemplary embodiment a plurality of walls . The container may have a rectangular circular oblong or egg shaped cross section. In one exemplary embodiment the container is cylindrical. In another exemplary embodiment the container is shaped as a spheroid or an oblate spheroid. Therefore the walls and interior surfaces of the container may be smooth without any sharp corners enhancing mixing of reaction components within the container.

The container is in an exemplary embodiment water tight and gas tight. In addition the walls of the container are constructed of materials and have thicknesses suitable for holding un reacted components within the container prior to mixing while allowing the expansion of reaction products e.g. gases through the walls upon mixing and reaction of the reaction components. Suitable materials for the walls of the container include but are not limited to metals metal alloys plastics polymers and combinations thereof.

The walls of the container define an interior . The reaction container includes a predefined amount of a water reactive material arranged as a plurality of separate and spaced apart portions of the water reactive material located within the interior of the container . The water reactive material utilizes water as an oxidizer and reacts violently with water to produce gas and heat.

Suitable water reactive materials include organic materials inorganic materials and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the water reactive material includes a metalloid a metal oxide a metalloid oxide and combinations thereof. For example the water reactive material can include magnesium aluminum titanium tungsten hafnium boron aluminum oxide titanium oxide molybdenum oxide vanadium oxide iron oxide and combinations thereof are used. In an exemplary embodiment the water reactive material includes aluminum for example bare aluminum. Suitable forms of aluminum include but are not limited to exploded aluminum Alex and powdered aluminum.

In general when the water reactive material includes inorganic materials or metals these materials are included as particles that may be of any suitable shaped but in an exemplary embodiment are spherical or oval. In one exemplary embodiment these inorganic particles have a diameter from about 5 nanometers to about 3 microns. In an exemplary embodiment the inorganic particles have a diameter from about 50 nanometers to about 100 nanometers. In one exemplary embodiment the inorganic particles have a diameter of less than about 50 nanometers. Regarding the size of the particles in the water reactive material smaller particles have a larger surface area per unit weight. Smaller particle sizes increase the surface area of the inorganic particles in contact with the oxidizing agent i.e. water causing the reaction to proceed more rapidly.

In one exemplary embodiment the water reactive material includes bare aluminum. Bare aluminum is formed under an inert atmosphere for example neon helium argon or a similar gas. In this inert atmosphere bare aluminum is produced by decomposing alane adducts in organic solvents. A titanium catalyst i.e. a halide amide alkoxide or other titanium compound and a catalyst of zirconium hafnium vanadium niobium or tantalum are added. Varying the type and concentration of the catalyst and the type and concentration of the adducting species produces different sizes of bare aluminum particles. Changes to particle size are also achieved through changes in the reaction temperature.

In one exemplary embodiment the water reactive material contains pellets of a water activated reactive powder WARP 1 and aluminum. The water reactive material also includes a plastic binder. Suitable plastic binders include but are not limited to Poly methyl methacrylate PMMA . The pellets of the WARP 1 and aluminum are pressed together with the plastic binder in order to form the water reactive material. In one exemplary embodiment the water reactive material includes about 85 aluminum and about 15 plastic binder.

The reaction container also includes a predetermined volume of water also disposed within the interior of the container. The arrangement of the portions of the water reactive material and the volume of water is configured such that water is located between any two portions of the water reactive material. Although illustrated as a single continuous volume the volume of water also may be configured as a plurality of separate and independent portions. While being located adjacent the water reactive material and disposed between opposing portions of the water reactive material the volume of water is initially separated from the portions of the water reactive material to prevent an untimely or uncontrolled mixing and reaction between the water and the water reactive material. In one exemplary embodiment the desired initial separation is achieved by providing a barrier at the location of any interface between the water and the water reactive material. Suitable barriers include physical barriers that are made of a frangible material. The barrier is formed as a layer between the water reactive material and the water. Other suitable barrier layers may be chemically bonded to the water reactive material for example on the particle or molecular level.

The reaction container includes one or more detonation mechanisms in communication with one or more of the portions of the water reactive material or the volume of water. In an exemplary embodiment the detonation mechanism is in communication with the water reactive material. For example one detonation mechanism is provided in communication with each portion of the water reactive material. Suitable detonation mechanisms are capable of detonating the water reactive material to drive the water reactive material into the water mixing the water reactive material with the water and producing the desired explosion from the reactive container. In addition the detonation mechanism is sufficient to overcome the separation barrier provided at the interface between the water reactive material and the water. Suitable detonation mechanisms are known and available in the art and include for example polymer bonded explosives PBX . In one exemplary embodiment the detonation mechanism contains a MoSireactive material pellet and a hot wire.

Referring to in one exemplary embodiment the reaction container includes two opposing portions of the water reactive material. The reactive container includes a container and a plurality of walls defining the interior . The interior includes a first end and a second end opposite the first end. A first portion of the water reactive material is disposed adjacent the first end and a second portion of the water reactive material is disposed adjacent the second end . The volume of water is disposed between the first and second portions of the water reactive material in the center of the interior of the container. The reaction container also includes a first detonation mechanism in communication with the first portion of the water reactive material and located between the first portion of the water reactive material and the first end of the interior of the container. A second detonation mechanism is provided in communication with the second portion of the water reactive material and is located between the second portion of the water reactive material and the second end of the interior of the container. Therefore upon detonation both the first and second portions of the water reactive material are driven into the center of the interior and mixed with the water.

As illustrated the interface between each portion of water reactive material and the water is a generally straight line or flat plane. However the shape of this interface may be modified to increase the surface area of the water reactive material adjacent the water. Increasing this surface area increases the rate of mixing between the water reactive material and the water. As illustrated in the first and second portions of the water reactive material may have a plurality of extensions and a plurality of indentations . The total amount of water reactive material remains the same but the length of the interface between the water reactive material and the water is increased. The first and second detonation mechanisms remain in the same relative positions to the first and second portions of the water reactive materials. In other embodiments a curved interface or a saw tooth interface may be used between the water reactive materials and the water.

As an excessive amount of water may inhibit or quench the reaction with the water reactive material the amount of water reactive material and the volume of water are balanced. In one embodiment the amount of water reactive material is stoichiometrically balanced with the volume of water in the reaction container. Therefore the volume of water equals just the amount of water required to oxidize completely the water reactive material. In one embodiment the water reactive material includes aluminum and the amount of aluminum in the water reactive material is stoichiometrically balanced with the volume of water in the reaction container.

When the detonation mechanisms are detonated a shock wave is created that forces the portions of the water reactive material into the volume of water. When an arrangement of two opposing portions of the water reactive material is used two detonation explosions cause opposing shock waves that propagate towards the center of the container and into the volume of water mixing the water reactive material with the volume of water. When the opposing shock waves meet a region of amplified pressure called a mach stem is created. The reaction between the water reactive material and the water often occurs in this mach stem region for example towards the center of the container. The material and the water are mixed in this region and heated to a greater degree. This heating and mixing accelerates the reaction between the material and the water.

Exemplary embodiments in accordance with the present invention provide a stoichiometric balance between the amount of water reactive material and the volume of water in the container. Therefore the volume of water and the amount of water reactive material are selected such that all of the water reactive material reacts with all of the water in the cavity. This balance prevents an excess amount of water that would be cool and slow the reaction.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
