title: Dynamic aircraft threat controller manager apparatuses, methods and systems
abstract: The DYNAMIC AIRCRAFT THREAT CONTROLLER MANAGER APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS (“DATCM”) transforms flight profile information, terrain, weather/atmospheric data and flight parameter data via DATCM components into comprehensive hazard avoidance optimized flight plans. Comprehensive hazard avoidance includes synergistic comprehensive turbulence and airfoil-specific icing data. In one implementation, the DATCM comprises a processor and a memory disposed in communication with the processor and storing processor-issuable instructions to receive anticipated flight plan parameter data, obtain weather data based on the flight plan parameter data, obtain atmospheric data based on the flight plan parameter data, and determine a plurality of four-dimensional grid points based on the flight plan parameter data. The DATCM may then determine comprehensive hazards mappings. With (near) real-time comprehensive hazard information and/or predictive turbulence/icing forecast specific to airfoil type and/or profile parameters, the DATCM may allow aircraft to avoid areas where comprehensive hazard is greater than a predetermined threshold and/or avoid areas where turbulence/icing may occur.
