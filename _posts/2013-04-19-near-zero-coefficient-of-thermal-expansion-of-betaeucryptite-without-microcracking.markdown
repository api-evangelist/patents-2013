This non provisional patent application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 636 016 filed Apr. 20 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under grant number DE FG02 07ER46397 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy s Office of Basic Energy Sciences. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The invention relates to a beta eucryptite material exhibiting a low coefficient of thermal expansion and the method for making the same.

Lithia alumina silica LAS materials may be used for applications in which a very low coefficient of thermal expansion CTE is desired. Applications include but are not limited to thermal shock resistant structures nanolithography platforms and optical windows. One material sometimes used in such applications is beta eucryptite. However a problem that may occur while manufacturing beta eucryptite is the formation of microcracks that reduce the material s strength. Microcracks may also propagate when the material is exposed to additional post manufacture mechanical or thermal stress. Microcracks are caused by large differences in the CTE between different crystallographic directions e.g. the c axis CTE is about 17.6 10 C. while the a and b axis CTE is about 8.21 10 C. . These large differences in axial CTE values are referred to in the art as axial mismatch.

Candidate materials for low zero CTE applications include but are not limited to fused silica and eucryptite oxide composites. However fused silica is very expensive to make as large bodies and eucryptite oxide composites exhibit microcracking.

Because of their low or negative CTE these silica and eucryptite materials are predominantly used to tailor materials with great resistance to thermal shock and good dimensional stability. Traditionally such materials have been made by combining the negative CTE materials with those having a positive CTE in order to produce a composite with a desirable CTE. An alternative method involves changing the composition of the material e.g. by doping to produce single phase materials with coefficients of thermal expansion that are close to zero. This type of doping method to produce low CTE materials has not been explored with regard to beta eucryptite materials.

The present invention overcomes the above mentioned problems by providing doped low thermal expansion materials including zinc doped beta eucryptite materials and methods for making these materials.

The present invention provides a doped low thermal expansion lithia alumina material and a novel sol gel method that introduces a metal dopant to a lithia alumina silica material to produce doped a low thermal expansion lithia alumina silica material that is less prone to microcracking and thus is better suited for a variety of high thermal stress applications.

An aspect of the present invention relates to a method for making a doped lithia silica alumina material the material characterized by low coefficients of thermal expansion and decreased microcracking. Microcracking may decrease due to the reduction in the CTE axial mismatch over a broad temperature range. The method of the present invention incorporates a small amount of a dopant as low as about 0.5 mole into the material. The dopant decreases microcracking in the material which results in a material that is more stable over a broader temperature range. Furthermore the crystallographic average CTE is altered by this dopant from a value that is large and negative to a value that is relatively very small and positive. Though not wishing to be bound by theory the CTE alteration is thought to change because the dopant modifies the response of the crystal structure to a temperature change which may also cause the doped beta eucryptite to exhibit less microcracking. The lower rate or absence of microcracking in the doped beta eucryptite results in a material that is a more suitable candidate for a variety of high thermal stress applications.

In the present invention a measured volume of tetraethylorthosilicate TEOS available from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. 63103 USA was first added to an equal volume of ethanol about 95 and half the original volume of distilled water to achieve an R factor water moles TEOS moles of between about 5 to about 7. In some embodiments the R factor was about 7. Other suitable solvents include methanol tetramethyl orthosilicate TMOS . A person skilled in the art would understand that the moles of water in a suitable solvent would be taken into account to achieve an appropriate R factor. A few drops of a suitable acid such as 1M HNOwere added to adjust the pH of the solution to between about 0.5 4. Though any suitable acid may be used nitric acid is preferred because the present invention utilizes a nitrate precursor. The addition of the acid also helps to obtain a clear solution after a few minutes of stirring the solution at room temperature. Furthermore the more acidic the acid is the less time is required for stirring to obtain a clear solution. An aqueous nitrate solution was prepared by mixing appropriate stoichiometric amounts of aluminum nitrate Al NO .9HO available from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. 63103 USA lithium nitrate LiNOavailable from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. 63103 USA and zinc nitrate Zn NO .6H2O available from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. 63103 USA . In a typical sample about 25 g of powder after calcination may be obtained by mixing. The aqueous nitrate solution was added to the stoichiometric quantity of the TEOS solution. A homogeneous solution was then obtained after between about 30 to about 60 minutes of mixing in some embodiments about 30 minutes of mixing. Any suitable stirrer may be used including but not limited to a magnetic stirrer. This solution was then treated with excess aqueous ammonia about 10 15 weight to obtain a gel. The gel was dried for between about 60 C. to about 100 C. preferably at about 70 C. for between about 24 hours to about 48 hours to obtain amorphous powders. These powders were then calcined in air at between about 900 C. to about 1200 C. in some embodiments about 1100 C. for between about 10 hours to about 36 hours in some embodiment about 15 hours. The resulting powders were analyzed using X ray diffraction XRD to confirm the presence of single phase beta eucryptite.

The resulting powders were then ground in a ball mill in any suitable alcohol medium such as ethanol to achieve a final nominal particle size of about between about 1 m to about 2 m in some embodiments about 1 m. The powders were then poured into a 25 mm in diameter graphite die and sintered in a vacuum hot press approximately 1 10torr to about 7 10ton at between about 1100 C. to about 1300 C. in some embodiments about 1200 C. for between about 1 hour to about 4 hours in some embodiments about 2 hours under an applied load of between about 20 MPa to about 40 MPa in some embodiments about 30 MPa The substrate was cooled at a ramp rate of approximately 1 C. min to about 2 C. min in some embodiments about 1 C. min. The density of all the samples was measured using Archimedes technique and was found to be between about 97 to about 99 in some embodiments about 97 98 theoretical density of about 2.34 g cm .

The calcined powders as well as the sintered pellets were characterized using XRD to determine the purity of the material and confirm the presence of single phase beta eucryptite. XRD was carried out using a Philips X Pert Pro MPD Diffractometer PANalytical Almero Netherlands with a copper source about 1.54 A and a nickel filter. An X Celerator detector was used for all the analysis though it is understood that any suitable detector may be used. The sintered pellet was also characterized using the SEM to determine the microstructure and grain size of the material. A JEOL JSM 7000F field emission scanning electron microscope FESEM with EDAX Genesis energy dispersive X ray spectrometer was used to characterize the microstructures. The specimens were prepared for microscopy by mechanical polishing with silicon carbide papers Nos. 120 240 320 400 600 and 800 followed by fine polishing on nylon cloth with 6 m 3 m 1 m and 0.25 m diamond paste. Etching was performed with different concentrations of hydrofluoric acid for periods of 5 12 seconds.

The thermal expansion measurements were performed on pure beta eucryptite and Zn doped beta eucryptite specimens of dimensions 4 mm 4 mm 15 20 mm. A Netzsch DIL 402C vacuum tight horizontal pushrod dilatometer fitted with a Netzsch TA SC 414 3 temperature controller Netzsch Instruments MA 01803 USA was utilized to measure the thermal expansion of all the samples. The measurements were performed at a heating and cooling rate of about 2 C. min between about room temperature and about 1000 C. The expansion behavior of the ceramic specimens was monitored during the heating and cooling cycles according to ASTM C1470 06. An alumina sample holder and pushrod were used with cubic zirconia based on about 10 mole yttria stabilized zirconia spacers to prevent reaction between beta eucryptite and alumina. A constant force of about 0.3 N was applied to the specimen cross section during the measurements. A fused silica specimen was used as a reference standard to perform a calibration prior to performing the tests on all the samples. The thermal expansion coefficient was calculated from the measurements in the temperature range of about 25 C. to about 1000 C.

The linear thermal expansion for each sample from Example 1 were calculated using equation 1 where Lis the specimen length at room temperature and L is the length at the tested temperature.

For each sample the first heating cycle was used to calculate the coefficient of thermal expansion up to about 1000 C. The calculated CTE of beta eucryptite and Zn doped beta eucryptite as a function of temperature is shown in . The Zn doped beta eucryptite displays a low positive coefficient of thermal expansion CTE for a wide temperature range compared to the negative CTE of pure beta eucryptite.
