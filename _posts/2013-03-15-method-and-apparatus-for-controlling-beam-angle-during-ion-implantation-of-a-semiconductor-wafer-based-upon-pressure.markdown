title: Method and apparatus for controlling beam angle during ion implantation of a semiconductor wafer based upon pressure
abstract: One or more techniques or systems for ion implantation are provided herein. A pressure control module is configured to maintain a substantially constant pressure within an ion implantation or process chamber. Pressure is maintained based on an attribute of an implant layer, pressure data, feedback, photo resist (PR) outgassing, a PR coating rate, a space charge effect associated with the implant layer, etc. By maintaining pressure within the process chamber, effects associated with PR outgassing are mitigated, thereby mitigating neutralization of ions. By maintaining charged ions, better control over implantation of the ions is achieved, thus allowing ions to be implanted at a desired depth.

Generally implantation involves doping in silicon technology which is associated with dosage control ion beam incident angles and controlling various impurities in silicon with a desired doping profile. Ions are accelerated and decelerated to a kinetic energy level and directed towards a surface of a target such as a wafer. Depending on the type of impurity and the kinetic energy level an implant depth is determined. However a random doping variation becomes more significant with advanced technology.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One or more techniques or systems for controlling drive current uniformity of a wafer are provided herein. In some embodiments an ion beam implant system comprises a process chamber where implanting generally occurs. The process chamber is often set at a low vacuum pressure such as less than 10torr. During implanting a wafer or target within the process chamber is coated with a layer of photo resist PR . Sometimes PR outgassing occurs during implantation when an ion beam hits the PR for example. As a result of the PR outgassing a residual gas concentration and a number of slow positively charged ions such as hydrogen ions H within the process chamber increases. It will be appreciated that PR outgassing is associated with an increase in vacuum pressure within the process chamber because the residual gas concentration and number of slow ions is increased. In some instances ions from the ion beam collide with the residual gas from the PR outgassing thereby becoming neutrally charged. When ions from the ion beam are neutrally charged a decel module is often unable to decelerate ions from the ion beam to a desired energy level thus inhibiting an ability to control implantation of the neutrally charged particles to a desired depth. Accordingly according to some embodiments herein a pressure control module is configured to maintain a substantially constant pressure within the process chamber thereby mitigating effects associated with PR outgassing. The pressure control module maintains the substantially constant pressure based on one or more of pressure data associated with at least one of an implant layer a technology associated with the implant layer photo resist PR outgassing a PR coating rate associated with the implant layer or a space charge effect associated with the implant layer. Ions from the ion beam are more likely to be decelerated to a desired second energy level because the pressure control module reduces the availability of residual gas with which ions collide to become neutrally charged where the decal module has little to no effect on neutrally charged particles.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects are employed. Other aspects advantages or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

Embodiments or examples illustrated in the drawings are disclosed below using specific language. It will nevertheless be understood that the embodiments or examples are not intended to be limiting. Any alterations and modifications in the disclosed embodiments and any further applications of the principles disclosed in this document are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

It will be appreciated that layer as used herein contemplates a region and does not necessarily comprise a uniform thickness. For example a layer is a region such as an area comprising arbitrary boundaries. For another example a layer is a region comprising at least some variation in thickness.

In some embodiments the ion source A comprises ionized dopants in a gaseous state such as boron or arsenic for example. The implant module may comprise one or more lenses configured to focus at least some of the one or more ions from the ion source A into an ion beam at . At however the ion beam may comprise one or more undesired impurities such as particle byproducts. A mass separator is configured to deflect or filter one or more particles from the ion beam using a magnetic field. As an example when an ion source comprises boron trifluoride BF the implant module produces an ion beam comprising one or more boron ions B and one or more particles that are byproducts from ionization such as BF BF etc. In this scenario the mass separator is configured to deflect the BF and BF particles at B and C. In this way ion beam A comprises primarily positively charged boron ions B . In other words the mass separator is configured to deflect particles that are heavier or lighter than desired ions such as the positively charged boron ions and provide a desired ion beam at A.

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the mass separator is downstream from a module configured for ion acceleration such as the implant module while in other embodiments an acceleration module is downstream from the mass separator . Similarly in some embodiments the mass separator is downstream from the decel module or vice versa. The ion beam implant system comprises one or more electroplates or deflectors configured to deflect the ion beam A to a desired location on a wafer housed within the process chamber . The electroplates are configured to control a beam angle associated with the ion beam downstream from the mass separator .

Generally regions of a wafer that are not to be doped are covered with a layer of photo resist PR and or a layer of sacrificial material such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride. Additionally the process chamber associated with ion implantation is often at a low vacuum pressure such as a pressure less than 10torr. Ions of the ion beam A will impact the covered portions of the wafer that are not to be doped or implanted. When the covering is PR outgassing occurs. For example PR outgassing is a result of the ion beam bombarding and heating up the PR. PR outgassing creates moisture slow hydrogen ions H or other residual gasses within the process chamber which results in an increase in pressure within the process chamber. Often when the moisture slow hydrogen ions residual gases etc. make their way upstream they collide with particles from ion beam A B or C. As a result at least some of the ions from the ion beam A B or C may become neutrally charged. As an example when an ion source comprises arsenic and PR outgassing occurs positively charged arsenic ions become neutrally charged as follows As H As H

The PR outgassing causes ions to have a higher possibility of hitting residual gas such as hydrogen and losing a positive charge. When ions become neutrally charged a decel module is generally unable to decelerate ions to a second or desired energy level. Additionally electrons produced by PR outgassing often have a space charge impact on an ion beam. For example a high concentration of electrons causes the ion beam to disperse in some instances. According to various embodiments a pressure control module is therefore configured to maintain a substantially constant pressure within the process chamber . For example the pressure control module is configured to mitigate at least one of a pressure increase or a pressure decrease associated with the environment of the process chamber .

The pressure control module is configured to maintain the substantially constant pressure within the process chamber based on an attribute of a layer of a wafer being implanted with ions. In other words the pressure control module can use data such as historical pressure data to compensate for increases or decreases in the pressure within the process chamber . As an example if historical pressure data indicates that the pressure within the process chamber increases more during ion implantation of a specific layer the pressure control module is configured to decrease the pressure of the process chamber by an amount associated with the specific layer. Additionally if historical pressure data indicates that the pressure within the process chamber increases or spikes at a time after implantation is started the pressure control module will adjust the pressure within the process chamber accordingly such as at a corresponding time associated with the spike for example. In this way the pressure control module is configured to mitigate at least one of the increase in the residual gas concentration or the increase in the pressure within the process chamber .

In some embodiments the pressure control module is configured to maintain a substantially constant pressure based on feedback from the process chamber. For example after ion implantation begins a residual gas concentration within the process chamber is monitored and the pressure control module adjusts the pressure within the process chamber accordingly. In some embodiments a current pressure within the process chamber is measured and the pressure control module is configured to adjust the pressure of the process chamber accordingly such as if the current pressure is higher than a starting pressure or a desired pressure. As another example the pressure control module maintains or controls the pressure within the process chamber based on pressure data from a pressure database. The pressure data is historical pressure data indicative of how pressure changes over time across one or more implant layers of a wafer PR outgassing for an implant layer residual gas concentration for an implant layer a technology such as a chemical composition a thickness density attribute etc. associated with an implant layer a PR coating rate for an implant layer or a space charge effect associated with the implant layer. It will be appreciated that an implant layer is generally a topmost layer on the wafer which includes a covering layer such as a layer of PR sacrificial oxide etc. and exposed underlying layers such as layers comprising a desired implant area for example. An implant or topmost layer thus includes both a covering layer such as a layer of PR and an exposed portion of an underlying layer such as silicon to be implanted etc. It will be appreciated that implant or topmost layers may vary from wafer to wafer. For example about 80 of a first wafer may be covered with PR and have about 20 exposed silicon while about 20 of a second wafer may be covered with PR and have about 80 exposed silicon. It will be appreciated different pressures for example would be used to achieve a doping profile that is uniform or substantially uniform across both the first wafer and the second wafer given the differences in the implant layers on the first and second wafers. That is a first pressure would be used to achieve a particular doping profile for the first wafer and a second pressure would be used to achieve the same or substantially same particular doping profile for the second wafer.

By mitigating an increase in pressure or a residual gas concentration within the process chamber the pressure control module reduces the availability of residual gas such as hydrogen ions with which ions of ion beam A B or C collide to produce neutralized particles. Because collisions between residual gasses and ions are mitigated the ions remain positively charged and are thus decelerated to a second desired energy level by the decel module . Accordingly the decel module is therefore able to decelerate at least some additional ions at least because the pressure control module mitigates at least some of the one or more ions from at least one of losing a positive charge or becoming neutrally charged. In this way the pressure control module is configured to mitigate a charge exchange effect associated with at least some of the one or more ions of the ion beam. In some embodiments when the decel module decelerates at least some additional ions a desired implant or dopant depth and drive current uniformity is achieved. Therefore the pressure control module is configured to mitigate at least one of energy contamination EC associated with an energy level higher than the second desired energy level undesirable dopant depth or a space charge effect associated with a beam angle variation of an ion beam for example. As a result ion implantation occurs at a desired doping depth associated with the second or desired energy level.

In some embodiments the pressure data associated with PR outgassing is based on an increase in a residual gas concentration at least due to an ion beam bombarding PR on a wafer for example.

The pressure control module is configured to at least one of maintain or control a pressure within the process chamber based on at least some of the pressure data of the vacuum pressure database . In some embodiments the pressure control module is configured to maintain a substantially constant pressure within the process chamber based on at least some of the pressure data.
