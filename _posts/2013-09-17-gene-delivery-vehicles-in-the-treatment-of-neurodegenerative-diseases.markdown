title: Gene delivery vehicles in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
abstract: Currently no therapies that provide either protection or restoration of neuronal function for adult onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease exist. Many clinical efforts to provide such benefits by infusion of neurotropic factors have failed. An alternative approach such as viral construct transduction may be used to directly activate the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate neurotrophic effects and induce axon growth. Viral construct transduction of dopaminergic neurons with a constitutively active human form of the p70S6K gene—hp70S6K (CA)—was shown to induce axon regeneration from living dopaminergic cell bodies that had no living axons.

The present application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61 702 184 filed Sep. 17 2012 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein under 35 U.S.C. 119 e .

This invention was made with Government support under Grant Nos. NS026836 and NS038370 awarded by the National Institute of Health and Grant No. W81XWH 12 1 0051 awarded by the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

Parkinson s disease PD is a major public health problem in the world with an estimated 1 000 000 individuals affected in the United States alone. It is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the death of neurons that produce dopamine dopaminergic neurons a neurotransmitter essential for proper muscle coordination movement and balance in the substantia nigra SN of the midbrain. PD symptoms vary from person to person but the most evident symptoms include resting tremors rigidity slow movement instability stiffness problems walking and reduced facial expression. Other symptoms include mild to severe cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders such as depression and apathy difficulty sleeping loss of the sense of smell constipation difficulty speaking and swallowing low blood pressure and drooling.

Available therapies aim at replacing dopamine in the brain to restore motor function with drugs such L Dopa. However chronic pharmacological treatment with the dopamine precursor L Dopa leads to a display of involuntary abnormal movements called dyskinesias in PD patients and often cognitive impairment. And there is no treatment that prevents deterioration attributable to progressive neurodegeneration. Other approaches involve infusing a protein molecule into the brain but off target effects occur that are unacceptable rendering therapeutic interventions that block or slow down the ongoing degenerative process less than successful.

Currently no therapies exist that provide either protection or restoration of neuronal function for adult onset neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Many clinical efforts to provide such benefits by infusion of neurotrophic factors have failed in spite of robust effects in preclinical assessments. One important reason for these failures is the difficulty due to diffusion limits of providing these protein molecules in sufficient amounts to the intended cellular targets in the central nervous system. A great need exists for the development of a novel therapeutic approach that promotes an axonal regenerative response where axons are able to regrow reach their targets and restore function. Gene therapy for the central nervous system is a promising approach to treat Parkinson s Disease PD and other central nervous system diseases including but not limited to Alzheimer s Disease AD and Huntington s Disease HD . This challenge suggests an alternative approach that of viral construct transduction to directly activate the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate neurotrophic effects.

Thus embodiments of the invention are directed to treating neurodegenerative disease by transducing neurons in degenerating areas of the CNS with a gene delivery vehicle carrying a gene encoding the constitutively active protein hp70S6K CA .

In other embodiments the substantia nigra neurons are contacted with the gene delivery vehicle by stereotaxic microinjection of the viral construct into the substantia nigra. The subject is preferably a human and the gene delivery vehicle is a viral construct.

It has now been discovered that the p70S6K gene that is located downstream to Akt and hRheb encodes a p70S6K protein that possesses axon regrowth properties. The highly destructive and well characterized 6 OHDA neurotoxin model of Parkinson Disease was used to study axon regrowth from lesioned dopaminergic cells in the Substantia Nigra SN . Sauer H Oertel W H.

Neuronal degeneration in rat brain induced by 6 hydroxydopamine a histological and biochemical study. Brain Res 1972 47 1 36. ANN NEUROL 2011. The experiments described herein show that transduction of 6 OHDA lesioned dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra SN with the adeno associated viral construct AAV hp70S6K CA carrying a gene that encodes the constitutively active human form of the hp70S6K protein hp70S6K CA induced regrowth of axons from the damaged dopaminergic neurons in the SN to their target the corpus striatum. The constitutively active protein is a protein whose activity is constant. Thus embodiments of the invention are directed to treating neurodegenerative disease by transducing neurons in degenerating areas of the CNS with a gene delivery vehicle carrying a gene encoding the constitutively active protein hp70S6K CA .

Eric R. Kandel James H. Schwart Thomas M. Jessell editors. McGraw Hill Appleton Lange New York N.Y. 2000 . Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

The term constitutively active as used herein with respect to a protein means that the protein is always active.

The term p70S6 kinase or p70S6K as used herein means a serine threonine kinase that acts downstream of PIP3 and phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 in the PI3 kinase pathway. Its target substrate is the S6 ribosomal protein. Phosphorylation of S6 induces protein synthesis at the ribosome. P70S6 kinase is in a signaling pathway that includes mTOR the mammalian target of rapamycin . mTOR can be activated in distinct ways thereby activating p70S6K. For example branched chain amino acids such as leucine are sufficient to activate mTOR resulting in an increase in p70S6K phosphorylation thereby activating it . mTOR is also in a pathway downstream of the kinase Akt. Akt is typically activated upon stimulation of a cell with a growth factor such as IGF 1 . Akt then activates mTOR by inhibiting the Tsc complex leading to p70S6K activation. The Gene Bank accession number for wild type p70S6K is NM 3161.

The terms hp70S6K delC T389E and hp 70S6K CA are used interchangeably herein to mean a constitutively active form of human p70S6K protein in which an autoinhibitory domain at the C terminus is deleted to activate the protein and a threonine residue at position 389 is mutated to glutamate hence the name hp70S6K delC T389E . The term hp 70S6K CA is shorthand for hp70S6K delC T389E . When the terms hp70S6K delC T389E and hp 70S6K CA are used to describe a viral construct the terms refer to the gene encoding the constitutively active protein the sequence of which is set forth in SEQ ID NO 1. The amino acid sequence for the hp 70S6K CA protein is set forth in SEQ ID NO 2. It is noted that orthologs of the human protein and gene can be used in non human animals where needed.

The term hp 70S6K CA is shorthand for hp70S6K delC T389E . These viral constructs also have other regulatory elements as described herein typically the chicken active promoter CBA pBL or Woodchuck post transcriptional regulatory element WPRE that stimulates heterologous cDNA expression and can stimulate expression of GFP when a gene is delivered by transduction with an AAV and a polyadenylation sequence such as BGHpolyA bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence.

The term contacting a neuron as used herein means that a therapeutic viral construct or other therapeutic agent makes physical contact with the targeted neuron. The viral construct or agent may be contacted with the targeted neuron in vivo for example via administration of the construct or agent to the animal such as by stereotaxic injection into the SN or the targeted neuron may be contacted in vitro by adding the construct or agent to a culture medium for example. Any method known in the art may be used for contacting a targeted neuron with the construct or agent including the various delivery systems for delivering gene constructs carrying a therapeutic gene to a target. To transduce dopaminergic neurons in the SN in vivo in a subject or animal the viral construct carrying the therapeutic gene is obtained in large quantities is stable when administered in vivo and will reach the targeted neurons thereby efficiently and selectively transducing the targeted dopaminergic neurons as described. In an embodiment the gene delivery vehicles such as viral constructs comprising the gene encoding the constitutively active hp70S6K CA are administered via stereotaxic microinjection.

FRAP1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FRAP1 gene. mTOR is a serine threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth cell proliferation cell motility cell survival protein synthesis and transcription. mTOR belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase related kinase protein family. mTor exists as two functionally distinct complexes 1 mTORC1 and 2 mTORC2.

The term mTor1 or mTOR Complex 1 mTORC1 as used herein means a complex composed of mTOR regulatory associated protein of mTOR Raptor mammalian LST8 G protein subunit like protein mLST8 G L and the recently identified partners PRAS40 and DEPTOR. This complex is characterized by the classic features of mTOR by functioning as a nutrient energy redox sensor and controlling protein synthesis. The activity of this complex is stimulated by insulin growth factors serum phosphatidic acid amino acids particularly leucine and oxidative stress. The Rheb GTPase is a principal activator of mTORC1 that has two principal substrates p70S6K and 4E BP1.

The term mTor2 or mTOR Complex 2 mTORC2 as used herein means a complex that is composed of mTOR rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR Rictor G L and mammalian stress activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 mSIN1 . mTORC2 has been shown to function as an important regulator of the cytoskeleton through its stimulation of F actin stress fibers paxillin RhoA Rac1 Cdc42 and protein kinase C PKC . mTORC2 also appears to possess the activity of a previously elusive protein known as PDK2. mTORC2 phosphorylates the serine threonine protein kinase Akt PKB at a serine residue S473. Phosphorylation of the serine stimulates Akt phosphorylation at a threonine T308 residue by PDK1 and leads to full Akt activation. mTORC2 associates with the protein rictor. Its best characterized function is phosphorylation and activation of Akt at Ser473.

The term neurodegenerative disease as used herein means a disease in which neurons of the CNS die or lose function or exhibit physical degeneration including loss death of axons.

SNVs may be found within a patient sample they may or may not be present in unperturbed populations and they include naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms also referred to as SNPs. 

The term single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP as used herein means a single nucleotide position in a genomic sequence for which two or more alternative alleles are present at an appreciable frequency e.g. at least 1 in a population of organisms.

The term tyrosine hydroxylase or tyrosine 3 monooxygenase as used herein means the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of the amino acid L tyrosine to L 3 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine L DOPA . It does so using molecular oxygen O as well as iron Fe and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. L DOPA is a precursor for dopamine which in turn is a precursor for the important neurotransmitters norepinephrine noradrenaline and epinephrine adrenaline . Tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzes the rate limiting step in this synthesis of catecholamines. In humans tyrosine hydroxylase is encoded by the TH gene and the enzyme is present in the central nervous system CNS peripheral sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla. Tyrosine hydroxylase phenylalanine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase together make up the family of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases AAAHs .

The term treating as used herein means slowing stopping or reversing the progression of a disease particularly a neurodegenerative disease. As used herein the terms treatment treating and the like as used herein refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and or physiologic effect.

Treatment includes any treatment of a condition or disease in a mammal particularly in a human and includes a preventing the condition or disease or symptom thereof from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the condition or disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it b inhibiting the condition or disease or symptom thereof such as arresting its development and c relieving alleviating mitigating or ameliorating the condition or disease or symptom thereof such as for example causing regression of the condition or disease or symptom thereof.

The term transduction as used herein means the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a target cell via a gene delivery vehicle such as a viral construct. Transduction does not require cell to cell contact which occurs in conjugation and it is DNAase resistant transformation is susceptible to DNAase . Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into the genome of a targeted cell in the host. In this case the gene encoding the constitutively active protein hp70S6K CA or a biologically active form thereof is introduced into the brain more specifically into dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra SN using a gene delivery vehicle such as an adeno associated virus as the viral construct. Double transduction can occur where SN neurons are transduced with AAV Tom Tau simultaneously with AAV hp70S6K CA transduction.

The term transgenic TH GFP mouse as used herein means a transgenic mouse that contains additional artificially introduced genetic material in every cell. This often confers a gain of function for example the mouse may produce a new protein. A loss of function may occur if the integrated DNA interrupts another gene. The TH GFP transgenic mouse expresses GFP in the majority of midbrain dopamine neurons under the control of the rat TH gene promoter. This transgenic mouse is useful for visualizing dopamine neurons and axons to study the physiology and pathogenesis of dopamine neurons and axons.

As used herein therapeutically effective amount means an amount sufficient to treat a subject afflicted with a disease e.g. a neurodegenerative disease or to alleviate a symptom or a complication associated with the disease.

The present invention is based on the discovery that transduction of 6 OHDA lesioned dopaminergic neurons in the SN with an adeno associated viral construct AAV hp 70S6K CA containing a gene encoding the constitutively active form of hp70S6K protein induced axon regrowth directly from lesioned dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies in the SN projecting to the corpus striatum. In some embodiments the viral construct contained the neuron zip code cAPP that facilitates specific targeting of neurons. The protein is preferably the human protein referred herein to interchangeably as hp70S6K delC T389E and hp 70S6K CA . When the terms hp70S6K delC T389E and hp 70S6K CA are used to describe a gene delivery vehicle such as a viral construct they refer to the gene encoding the protein.

A longstanding belief in neuroscience has been that the mature mammalian central nervous system CNS unlike the peripheral nervous system PNS is incapable of axon regeneration 1 3 . While local axon sprouting in the adult brain has been described following local administration of neurotrophic factors long range restorative axon growth has been considered to be unachievable. The inability of the mature brain to regenerate axons has been explained by the concepts that following injury to the CNS extrinsic factors prevent axon growth 1 3 4 and that as the brain matures the intrinsic developmental genetic programs that mediate axon growth are silenced. The extrinsic factors that prevent growth have been largely attributed to an unfavorable local environment following injury that is due to glial scar and inhibitory local proteins derived from damaged myelin 3 .

If the intrinsic developmental genetic programs that mediate axon growth can be re activated it may be possible to achieve long range restorative axon growth. Such a possibility has received solid support from recent studies of the activation of Akt mTor signaling in models of axon injury. The critical mediators of the axon growth phenotype downstream to the mTor complex have been identified . Based on results with hRheb it is now known that activation of mTor is sufficient for axon growth. MTor exists as two functionally distinct complexes . mTORC1 associates with the protein raptor. The Rheb GTPase is a principal activator of mTORC1 and it in turn has two principal substrates p70S6K and 4E BP1. The second mTor complex mTORC2 associates with the protein rictor. The function of mTORC2 is best characterized as phosphorylation and activation of Akt at Ser473 9 10 . It was discovered that augmentation of Akt mTor signaling resulted in substantial axon regrowth in the adult optic nerve in a crush injury model 6 and in the corticospinal tract in a spinal cord injury model 7 .

Although these observations offer promise they were made in very limited contexts. First in these studies the activation of Akt mTor signaling was induced before injury. Whether beneficial effects may still be observed by activation of Akt mTor signaling after injury is a more realistic assessment. Second both the optic nerve and the corticospinal tract are relatively simple anatomically bounded projection systems. The vast majority of circuits in the CNS follow complex trajectories through a multitude of cellular environments. Whether Akt mTor stimulation of axon growth would be able to overcome the formidable challenge of enabling new axons to find their way through the complex architecture of the brain was not studied. Third in these studies the attainment of the neural target with restoration of function was not investigated.

It has recently been shown that fetal dopaminergic neuroblasts when implanted into the lesioned SN of the adult brain are capable of extending axons along the damaged nigro striatal pathway to reach their normal target the striatum and achieve a functional integration into host circuitry 8 . These studies suggested that injured adult nigro striatal projections may provide a permissive environment for axon regrowth making the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system ideal for studying this phenomenon. Due to its involvement in human Parkinson s disease nigrostriatal neurocircuitry has been extensively studied and it is highly characterized morphologically neurochemically and behaviorally.

Parkinson s disease PD is a neurodegenerative movement disorder second only to Alzheimer s disease AD in prevalence about 350 per 100 000 population. It is clinically characterized by rigidity slowness of movement and tremor. Most cases of Parkinson s disease are sporadic but both sporadic and familial forms of the disease are characterized by intracellular Lewy bodies in dying neurons of the SN a population of midbrain neurons 60 000 that are selectively decimated in PD. Lewy bodies are predominantly composed of alpha synuclein. Mutations in and duplication of the gene encoding alpha synuclein have been found in patients with familial Parkinson s disease. Another gene associated with autosomal recessive PD is parkin. Diffuse cortical Lewy bodies composed of alpha synuclein are observed in Lewy body disease LBD a dementing syndrome associated with parkinsonian tone changes hallucinations and rapid symptom fluctuation. LBD may be the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia after AD accounting for 20 to 30 percent of cases among persons over the age of 60 years. Similar to the vaccine approach to Alzheimer s disease promising results in a mouse model of Parkinson s Lewy body disease have been obtained by immunization with alpha synuclein. Other dementing syndromes include fronto termporal dementias Pick s disease and corticobasal dementia and others known to neurological medicine.

Alzheimer s disease AD is a common dementing disordered memory and cognition neurodegenerative disease associated with brain accumulation of extracellular plaques composed predominantly of the A 1 40 A 1 42 and A 1 43 peptides all of which are proteolytic products of APP. In addition neurofibrillary tangles composed principally of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein a neuronal microtubule associated protein accumulate intracellularly in dying neurons. Alzheimer s disease is marked by neuron and axon degeneration. See e.g. Nikolaev A McLaughlin T O Leary D Tessier Lavigne M. APP binds DR6 to cause axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases. 19 Feb. 2009 457 7232 981 989. doi 10.1038 nature07767. PMID 19225519. Familial forms of AD can be caused by mutations in the APP gene or in the presenilin 1 or 2 genes the protein products of which are implicated in the processing of APP to A . Apolipoprotein E allelic variants also influence the age at onset of both sporadic and familial forms of AD. A tau and phosphorylated tau has been detected in the blood and CSF of AD patients and in normal controls. Immunization of Alzheimer s disease patients with A has shown some promising preliminary treatment results although limited by autoimmune meningoencephalitis in humans.

Alzheimer s disease is characterized by loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions including degeneration in the temporal and parietal lobes and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Wenk G L. Neuropathologic Changes in Alzheimer s Disease. 2003 64 Suppl 9 7 10. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. H Del Tredici K. December 2012 . Where when and in what form does sporadic Alzheimer s disease begin 25 Pt 6 708 14. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer s disease and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adult.

Huntington s disease HD is an autosomal dominant inherited neuropsychiatric disease which gives rise to progressive motor cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The course of Huntington s is characterized by jerking uncontrollable movement of the limbs trunk and face chorea progressive loss of mental abilities and the development of psychiatric problems. Huntington s disease progresses without remission over 10 to 15 years and usually appears in middle age 30 50 years . Juvenile HD also called Westphal variant or akinetic rigid HD develops before the age of 20 progresses rapidly and produces muscle rigidity in which the patient moves little if at all akinesia . It is estimated that one in every 10 000 persons nearly 30 000 in the United States has Huntington s disease. Juvenile Huntington s occurs in approximately 16 of all cases. Its core pathology involves degeneration of the basal ganglia in particular the caudate and putamen and is caused by an unstable expansion of the trinucleotide CAG coding for glutamine in a single autosomal gene IT 15 on chromosome 4 coding for a mutated form of the protein huntingtin. How the mutation of gene IT 15 alters the function of the protein is not well understood. In Huntington s disease synapse dysfunction is the earliest observable event closely followed by axon degeneration often without signs of neuron loss in animal models. See 2004 3 153 160 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd and M. P. Coleman1 and R. R. Ribchester. 

Treatment of Huntington s disease focuses on reducing symptoms preventing complications and providing support and assistance to the patient. There are several substances available today for the treatment of chorea. Other neurological symptoms such as dystonia can be treated but treatment is associated with a high risk of adverse events. Psychiatric symptoms on the other hand are often amenable to treatment and relief of these symptoms may provide significant improvement in quality of life. Bonelli and Hofmann 2004 Expert Opin Pharmacother 5 767 76 . Most drugs used to treat the symptoms of HD have side effects such as fatigue restlessness or hyperexcitability. Cystamine Decarboxycystine alleviates tremors and prolongs life in mice with the gene mutation for Huntington s disease HD . The drug appears to work by increasing the activity of proteins that protect nerve cells or neurons from degeneration. The study suggests that a similar treatment may one day be useful in humans with HD and related disorders. Karpuj et al. 2002 Nat Med 8 143 9 .

The results of the experiments described below show that transduction of 6 OHDA lesioned neurons in the SN with an adenoviral construct AAV hp70S6K CA carrying a gene encoding the constitutively active form of p70S6K preferably the human protein referred to interchangeably as hp70S6K delC T389E and hp 70S6K CA not only preserved nigrostriatal dopaminergic axons but also induced axon regrowth directly from the lesioned dopaminergic neuronal cell body to the corpus striatum. Embodiments of the invention are directed to a new gene therapy for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as PD by transducing damaged neurons with a gene encoding the constitutively active hp70S6K delC T389E . The following is a summary of the results of experiments described within the Examples.

1. hp70S6K CA was expressed in transduced SN dopaminergic neurons that were stained red by immunofluorescence for a marker protein tyrosine hydroxylase TH .

2. hp70S6K CA protein stained green by immunofluorescence staining for the FLAG epitope tag was expressed in axons of transduced dopaminergic cells.

3. The expressed hp70S6K CA protein was biologically active as shown by its ability to induce of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6.

4. An increased density of immunostaining for TH in the striatum was observed after transduction of neurons in the SN with the AAV hp70S6K CA construct due to the sprouting and regeneration of lesioned dopaminergic nerve fibers in the striatum.

5. In normal non lesioned mice the AAV hp70S6K CA construct did not induce the formation of new axons.

6. In mice lesioned with the neurotoxin 6 OHDA administration of the AAV hp70S6K CA construct by direct SN injection caused significant restoration and regrowth of axons projecting from the SN to the striatum at 12 weeks post injection i.e. 15 weeks post lesion .

7. Significant restoration of axons projecting from the SN to the striatum after AAV hp70S6K CA transduction was also observed in transgenic TH GFP mice that were lesioned with 6 OHDA in which it was possible to visualize dopaminergic axons by the expression of GFP.

8. Restoration of axons was also revealed in 6 OHDA lesioned SN neurons transduced simultaneously with both AAV Tom Tau a fluorescent fusion protein that traffics to axons and AAV hp70S6K CA .

Based on the experimental results described in detail in the Examples a first set of embodiments is directed to methods of treating a subject having or at risk for Parkinson Disease by identifying such a subject and contacting dopaminergic neurons in the SN in the subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a viral construct comprising a gene encoding hp70S6K CA protein e.g. AAV hp70S6K CA or AAV cAPP hp70S6K CA or a biologically active form or variant of hp70S6K CA protein in an amount that promotes axon regeneration in dopaminergic neurons of the SN and their target the corpus striatum. These methods are carried out under conditions that permit transduction of the targeted neuron with the viral construct. The subject may be human and the viral construct may be administered to the SN by stereotaxic microinjection. Any gene delivery vehicle may be used and the non constitutively active form of the protein may have therapeutic utility albeit at a lower level than the constitutive form of the protein. Similar embodiments of this method for treating Alzheimer s Disease Huntington s Disease or other neurodegenerative diseases e.g. brain and spinal cord injuries associated with axon death are also described.

Another embodiment is directed to any gene delivery vehicle carrying a gene encoding hp70S6K CA protein. In an embodiment the gene delivery vehicle is the viral construct AAV hp70S6K CA comprising a chicken actin CBA promoter an hp70S6K CA gene located downstream of the chicken actin promoter a 3 woodchuck post transcriptional regulatory element WPRE pBL located downstream of the hp70S6K CA gene and a BGHpolyA polyadenylation sequence inserted before the 3 ITR inverted terminal repeat sequence. In another embodiment the gene delivery vehicle or viral construct further contains a cAPP neuron targeting sequence. In such a construct cAPP is part of the coding sequence placed at the N terminus. Those of ordinary skill in the art recognize that the viral construct may also include origins of replication regulatory sequences selectable markers tags and unique restriction sites. Certain embodiments are also directed to pharmaceutical compositions and kits that comprise these gene delivery vehicles e.g AAV hp70S6K CA .

The following technological details describe broadly certain aspects of preferred embodiments of the invention.

Gene therapy is the administration of a gene encoding a protein of interest as a pharmaceutical agent to treat a disease. Today most gene therapy studies are aimed at cancer and hereditary diseases linked to a genetic defect. In the present embodiments a gene encoding the constitutively active protein hp70S6K CA or a biologically active form or variant thereof is transduced into targeted neurons to induce axon regrowth from damaged neurons. A defective gene is not being replaced. The most common form of gene therapy involves transducing targeted cells in the host with DNA that encodes a functional therapeutic gene in this case the gene is one that encodes the protein hp70S6K CA that induces axon regrowth from damaged neurons specifically in PD or another of the enumerated diseases. In the present embodiments of gene therapy the gene is packaged within a viral construct under such conditions that facilitates the transfer the gene to the targeted neurons. Once inside the neuron the DNA is expressed by the cell machinery resulting in the production of the constitutively active hp70S6K CA protein which in turn treats the patient s neurodegenerative disease. In the case of PD the viral construct is administered specifically to dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Delivery of DNA into cells can be accomplished by a number of methods summarized below.

According to the various embodiments of the present invention a variety of known nucleic acid viral constructs may be used to deliver the hp706K CA gene to the targeted neurons e.g. recombinant viruses such as recombinant adeno associated virus AAV recombinant adenoviruses recombinant retroviruses recombinant poxviruses and other known viruses in the art as well as plasmids cosmids and phages. Options for gene delivery viral constructs are well known see e.g. Ausubel et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1989 Kay M. A. et al. 2001 Nat. Medic. 7 1 33 40 and Walther W. and Stein U. 2000 Drugs 60 2 249 71 . Methods for assembly of the recombinant viral constructs are well known see e.g. International Patent Publication No. WO 00 15822 published Mar. 23 2000 and other references cited herein .

Viral constructs for delivering nucleic acids can be viral non viral or physical. See e.g. Rosenberg et al. Science 242 1575 1578 1988 and Wolff et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 9011 9014 1989 . Discussion of methods and compositions for use in gene therapy include Eck et al. in Goodman Gilman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Ninth Edition Hardman et al. eds. McGray Hill New York 1996 Chapter 5 pp. 77 101 Wilson Clin. Exp. Immunol. 107 Suppl. 1 31 32 1997 Wivel et al. Hematology Oncology Clinics of North America Gene Therapy S. L. Eck ed. 12 3 483 501 1998 Romano et al. Stem Cells 18 19 39 2000 and the references cited therein. U.S. Pat. No. 6 080 728 also provides a discussion of a wide variety of gene delivery methods and compositions. The routes of delivery include for example systemic administration and administration in situ. Well known viral delivery techniques include the use of adenovirus retrovirus lentivirus foamy virus herpes simplex virus and adeno associated virus viral constructs.

Preferred viral constructs are based on non cytopathic eukaryotic viruses in which non essential genes have been replaced with the gene of interest. Preferred viruses for certain embodiments of the invention are the adenoviruses and adeno associated AAV viruses which are single stranded DNA viruses that have already been approved for human use in gene therapy.

One illustrative method for in vivo delivery of one or more nucleic acid sequences involves the use of an adenovirus expression viral construct. Adenovirus expression viral construct is meant to include those constructs containing adenovirus sequences sufficient to a support packaging of the construct and b to express the gene encoding the hp70S6K CA protein that has been cloned therein.

The viral construct comprises a genetically engineered form of an adenovirus. Knowledge of the genetic organization of adenovirus a 36 kb linear double stranded DNA virus allows substitution of large pieces of adenoviral DNA with foreign sequences up to 7 kb Grunhaus Horwitz 1992 . Generation and propagation of the current adenovirus viral constructs which are replication deficient may utilize a unique helper cell line designated 293 which was transformed from human embryonic kidney cells by Ad5 DNA fragments and constitutively expresses E1 proteins Graham et al. 1977 . Since the E3 region is dispensable from the adenovirus genome Jones Shenk 1978 the current adenovirus viral constructs with the help of 293 cells carry foreign DNA in either the E1 the D3 or both regions Graham Prevec 1991 .

Adenovirus viral constructs have been used in eukaryotic gene expression Levrero et al. 1991 Gomez Foix et al. 1992 and vaccine development Grunhaus Horwitz 1992 Graham Prevec 1992 . Recently animal studies suggested that recombinant adenovirus could be used for gene therapy Stratford Perricaudet Perricaudet 1991 Stratford Perricaudet et al. 1990 Rich et al. 1993 . Studies in administering recombinant adenovirus to different tissues include trachea instillation Rosenfeld et al. 1991 Rosenfeld et al. 1992 muscle injection Ragot et al. 1993 peripheral intravenous injections Herz Gerard 1993 and stereotactic inoculation into the brain Le Gal La Salle et al. 1993 .

By an AAV construct is meant a construct derived from an adeno associated virus serotype of which there are twelve. The Examples herein describe how to make the AAV viral constructs that were used in the described experiments. All of the constructs used in the Examples were AAV1 serotype however while this represents a preferred embodiment other useful serotypes can be determined by routine experimentation to identify the optimum construct depending on the targeted cells. This section provides a background on AAV constructs. Any methods known in the art can also be used to produce AAV constructs.

AAV is a good choice of delivery vehicles due to its safety i.e. genetically engineered recombinant does not integrate into the host genome. There is a relatively complicated rescue mechanism not only wild type adenovirus but also AAV genes are required to mobilize rAAV. Likewise AAV is not pathogenic and not associated with any disease. The removal of viral coding sequences minimizes immune reactions to viral gene expression and therefore rAAV does not evoke an inflammatory response.

Twelve different AAV serotypes AAV1 to 12 are known each with different tissue tropisms Wu Z Mol Ther 2006 14 316 27 . Five serotypes have been isolated of which AAV2 is the best characterized. AAV has a single stranded linear DNA that is encapsulated into capsid proteins VP1 VP2 and VP3 to form an icosahedral virion of 20 to 24 nm in diameter Muzyczka McLaughlin 1988 . Recombinant AAV is derived from the dependent parvovirus AAV2 Choi V W J Virol 2005 79 6801 07 . The adeno associated virus type 1 to 12 can be engineered to be replication deficient and is capable of infecting a wide range of cell types and species Wu Z Mol Ther 2006 14 316 27 . AAV have advantages such as heat and lipid solvent stability high transduction frequencies in cells of diverse lineages and lack of superinfection inhibition thus allowing multiple series of transductions. In some embodiments of the invention neurons such as dopaminergic cells in the SN are transduced with a gene delivery vehicle such as an AAV viral construct carrying the hp70S6K CA gene multiple times.

The adeno associated virus can integrate into human cellular DNA in a site specific manner thereby minimizing the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and variability of inserted gene expression characteristic of retroviral infection. In addition wild type adeno associated virus infections have been followed in tissue culture for greater than 100 passages in the absence of selective pressure implying that the adeno associated virus genomic integration is a relatively stable event. The adeno associated virus can also function in an extrachromosomal fashion.

Typically viral constructs carrying transgenes are assembled from polynucleotides encoding the transgene suitable regulatory elements and elements necessary for production of viral proteins which mediate cell transduction via integration of transferred gene into the genomic DNA of host cells.

Adeno associated viruses are small single stranded DNA viruses which require helper virus to facilitate efficient replication K. I. Berns Parvoviridae the viruses and their replication p. 1007 1041 in F. N. Fields et al. Fundamental Virology 3rd ed. vol. 2 Lippencott Raven Publishers Philadelphia Pa. 1995 . The 4.7 kb genome of AAV is characterized by two inverted terminal repeats ITR and two open reading frames which encode the Rep proteins and Cap proteins respectively. The Rep reading frame encodes four proteins of molecular weight 78 kD 68 kD 52 kD and 40 kD. These proteins function mainly in regulating AAV replication and rescue and integration of the AAV into a host cell s chromosomes. The Cap reading frame encodes three structural proteins of molecular weight 85 kD VP 1 72 kD VP2 and 61 kD VP3 Berns cited above which form the virion capsid. More than 80 of total proteins in AAV virion comprise VP3.

Gene delivery vehicles preferably AAV constructs useful in the practice of the present invention can be constructed utilizing methodologies well known in the art of molecular biology. A constitutively active form of p70S6K CA was designed for inclusion in AAV constructs to transduce targeted neurons for example dopaminergic neurons in the SN by AAV mediated gene transfer. The Gene Bank accession number for wild type p70S6K is NM3161. Wild type p70S6K protein becomes constitutively active by elimination of an autoinhibitory domain at the C terminus and by mutation of a threonine residue at position 389 to glutamate see SEQ ID NO. 1 for the nucleic acid sequence of the gene hp70S6K CA used in the construct. The amino acid sequence of the constitutively active protein hp70S6K CA is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 2. In an embodiment adeno associated viral AAV constructs are employed with a preferred embodiment being AAV1 constructs that target degenerating neurons in the CNS. In another embodiment AAV2 constructs are used to target neurons. Certain other embodiments include without limitation AAV 3 AAV 4 AAV 5 AAV 6 AAV 9 AAV 10 and AAV 11 constructs for use in transfecting transducing neurons. Particularly preferred are viral constructs derived from AAV serotypes having tropism for and high transduction efficiencies in neurons of the mammalian CNS. A review and comparison of transduction efficiencies of different serotypes is provided din Davidson et al. 2000. In one embodiment AAV2 based viral constructs are used as they have been shown to direct long term expression of transgenes in CNS preferably transducing neurons. In other embodiments viral constructs derived from AAV1 AAV4 and AAV5 serotypes are used because they also transduce cells of the CNS Davidson et al. supra .

AAV viral constructs can have one or more of the AAV wild type genes deleted in whole or part preferably the rep and or cap genes but retain functional flanking inverted terminal repeat ITR sequences. Functional ITR sequences are used for the rescue replication and packaging of the AAV virion. Thus an AAV viral construct is defined herein to include at least those sequences required for replication and packaging e.g. functional ITRs of the virus. The ITRs need not be the wild type nucleotide sequences and may be altered e.g. by the insertion deletion or substitution of nucleotides as long as the sequences provide for functional rescue replication and packaging. AAV expression viral constructs are constructed using known techniques to at least provide as operatively linked components in the direction of transcription control elements including a transcriptional initiation region the DNA of interest i.e. the hp70S6K CA gene and a transcriptional termination region. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 173 414 and 5 139 941 International Publications Nos. WO 92 01070 published 23 Jan. 1992 and WO 93 03769 published 4 Mar. 1993 Lebkowski et al. 1988 Vincent et al. 1990 Carter 1992 Muzyczka 1992 Kotin 1994 Shelling and Smith 1994 and Zhou et al. 1994. The AAV hp70S6K CA gene construct described herein is a preferred embodiment.

The control elements are selected to be functional in a mammalian cell. The resulting construct which contains the operatively linked components is bounded 5 and 3 with functional AAV ITR sequences. By adeno associated virus inverted terminal repeats or AAV ITRs is meant the art recognized regions found at each end of the AAV genome which function together in cis as origins of DNA replication and as packaging signals for the virus. AAV ITRs together with the AAV rep coding region provide for the efficient excision and rescue from and integration of a nucleotide sequence interposed between two flanking ITRs into a mammalian cell genome. The nucleotide sequences of AAV ITR regions are known. See e.g. Kotin 1994 Berns K I Parvoviridae and their Replication in Fundamental Virology 2nd Edition B. N. Fields and D. M. Knipe eds. for the AAV 2 sequence. The AAV ITR may be derived from any of several AAV serotypes. In embodiments of the present invention the AAV1 serotype is used. 5 and 3 ITRs which flank a selected nucleotide sequence in an AAV viral construct need not necessarily be identical or derived from the same AAV serotype or isolate so long as they function as intended i.e. to allow for excision and rescue of the sequence of interest from a host cell genome or viral construct and to allow integration of the heterologous sequence into the recipient cell genome when AAV Rep gene products are present in the cell.

The AAV viral construct which harbors the DNA molecule of interest bounded by AAV ITRs can be constructed by directly inserting the selected hp70S6KCA gene sequence s into an AAV genome from which the major AAV open reading frames ORFs have been excised. Examples of constitutive promoters which may be included in the AAV of this invention include without limitation the exemplified CMV immediate early enhancer chicken actin CBA promoter. In certain embodiments the gene delivery vehicle is an AAV expression viral construct that comprises a chicken actin CBA promoter an hp70S6K CA gene located downstream of the chicken actin promoter a 3 woodchuck post transcriptional regulatory element WPRE pBL located downstream of the hp70S6K CA gene and a polyadenylation sequence BGHpolyA inserted before the 3 ITR sequence. In certain other embodiments short peptide sequences or zip codes may be included in the gene delivery vehicle such as the cAPP neuron targeting sequence.

In certain embodiments not only is the serotype selected to optimize delivery to neurons but the construct also comprises a zip code for targeting the encoded protein to neurons. One of the best characterized mechanisms for local axonal mRNA translation is that of zip code binding protein ZBP1 interaction with a 54 nt sequence in the 3 UTR of actin mRNA 11 . In axons ZBP1 and actin mRNA are co localized and transported in axon granules 12 . Initiation of translation of actin mRNA is regulated by Src phosphorylation of ZBP1 13 . A similar 91nt zip code exists in the 3 UTR of tau mRNA 14 15 . In addition to these mRNA zip codes short peptide sequence zip codes have been identified in proteins. Sapute Krishnan and colleagues 16 identified APP C which represents the final 15 amino acids of the 47 aa C terminus of amyloid precursor protein which extends into the cytoplasm. This peptide conjugated to polystyrene beads was sufficient to mediate anterograde transport. This sequence SEQ ID NO. 3 GYENPTYKFFEQMQN was successfully used by Babetto et al. to target NMNAT a mediator of axon protection to axons in vivo in mice 17 . Zuber and colleagues identified a peptide sequence in the N terminus of GAP43 containing two cysteines that serves as a palmitoylation signal and mediates targeting to growth cones 18 . This sequence was again used successfully by Babetto et al. to target NMNAT to axons in vivo and it was also used by Matsuda and colleagues to target GFP to the terminal arborizations of nigro striatal dopaminergic axons. 19 . Constructs in which the sequence for red fluorescent protein Tomato were modified to incorporate either a 3 UTR zip code or a short peptide sequence zip code. Any of these zip codes and other zip codes for neuronal proteins can be used in the gene delivery vehicles of the present invention. In preferred embodiments the zip code is cAPP.

For eukaryotic cells expression control sequences typically include a promoter an enhancer such as one derived from an immunoglobulin gene SV40 cytomegalovirus etc. and a polyadenylation sequence which may include splice donor and acceptor sites. The polyadenylation sequence generally is inserted following the transgene sequences and before the 3 ITR sequence. In one embodiment the bovine growth hormone polyA sequence may be used.

The regulatory sequences useful in the constructs of the present invention may also contain an intron desirably located between the promoter enhancer sequence and the gene. One possible intron sequence is also derived from SV 40 and is referred to as the SV 40 T intron sequence. Another suitable sequence includes the WPRE or woodchuck hepatitis virus post transcriptional element. See e.g. L. Wang and I. Verma 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 3906 3910. 

Alternatively AAV ITRs can be excised from the viral genome or from an AAV viral construct containing the same and fused 5 and 3 of a selected nucleic acid construct that is present in another viral construct using standard ligation techniques. AAV viral constructs which contain ITRs have been described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 139 941. In particular several AAV viral constructs are described therein which are available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC under Accession Numbers 53222 53223 53224 53225 and 53226. Additionally chimeric genes can be produced synthetically to include AAV ITR sequences arranged 5 and 3 of one or more selected nucleic acid sequences. Preferred codons for expression of the chimeric gene sequence in mammalian CNS cells can be used. The complete chimeric sequence is assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides prepared by standard methods. See e.g. Edge 1981 Nambair et al. 1984 Jay et al. 1984. In order to produce rAAV virions an AAV expression viral construct is introduced into a suitable host cell using known techniques such as by transfection. A number of transfection techniques are generally known in the art. See e.g. Graham et al. 1973 Sambrook et al. 1989 Molecular Cloning a laboratory manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories New York Davis et al. 1986 Basic Methods in Molecular Biology Elsevier and Chu et al. 1981. Particularly suitable transfection methods include calcium phosphate co precipitation Graham et al. 1973 direct microinjection into cultured cells Capecchi 1980 electroporation Shigekawa et al. 1988 liposome mediated gene transfer Mannino et al. 1988 lipid mediated transduction Feigner et al. 1987 and nucleic acid delivery using high velocity microprojectiles Klein et al. 1987 .

Selection of these and other common viral construct and regulatory elements are conventional and many such sequences are available. See e.g. Sambrook et al. and references cited therein at e.g. pages 3.18 3.26 and 16.17 16.27 and Ausubel et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York 1989 . Of course not all viral constructs and expression control sequences will function equally well to express all of the transgenes of this invention. However one of skill in the art may make a selection among these expression control sequences without departing from the scope of this invention. Suitable promoter enhancer sequences may be selected by one of skill in the art using the guidance provided by this application. Such selection is a routine matter and is not a limitation of the molecule or construct.

Methods of delivery of viral constructs to neurons include generally any method suitable for delivery viral constructs to the targeted neurons such that at least a portion of cells of targeted neurons are transduced.

To deliver the viral construct specifically to a particular region and to a particular population of cells of the CNS the viral construct may be administered by stereotaxic microinjection. For example patients have the stereotactic frame base fixed in place screwed into the skull . The brain with stereotactic frame base MRI compatible with fiducial markings is imaged using high resolution MRI. The MRI images are then transferred to a computer which runs stereotactic software. A series of coronal sagittal and axial images are used to determine the target site of AAV viral construct injection and trajectory. The software directly translates the trajectory into 3 dimensional coordinates appropriate for the stereotactic frame. Burr holes are drilled above the entry site and the stereotactic apparatus positioned with the needle implanted at the given depth. The AAV viral construct is then injected at the target sites. Since the AAV viral construct integrates into the target cells rather than producing viral particles the subsequent spread of the viral construct is minor and mainly a function of passive diffusion from the site of injection and of course the desired transsynaptic transport prior to integration. The degree of diffusion may be controlled by adjusting the ratio of viral construct to fluid carrier.

The target neurons of the viral constructs of the present invention are cells of the central nervous system of a subject afflicted a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease or Huntington s disease preferably neural cells. Preferably the subject is a human being. In embodiments for Alzheimer s disease the neurons in the cerebral cortex cingulate gyrus and brainstem nuclei are targeted. In Huntington s disease neurons in the basal ganglia are targeted.

However the invention encompasses delivering the viral construct to biological models of the disease. In that case the biological model may be any mammal at any stage of development at the time of delivery e.g. embryonic fetal infantile juvenile or adult preferably it is an adult. Furthermore the target CNS cells may be essentially from any source especially nonhuman primates and mammals of the orders Rodenta mice rats rabbit hamsters Carnivora cats dogs and Arteriodactyla cows pigs sheep goats horses as well as any other non human system e.g. zebrafish model system .

In certain embodiments the viral construct may be a retroviral construct. Non cytopathic viruses include retroviruses e.g. lentivirus the life cycle of which involves reverse transcription of genomic viral RNA into DNA with subsequent proviral integration into host cellular DNA. Retroviruses have been approved for human gene therapy trials. Most useful are those retroviruses that are replication deficient i.e. capable of directing synthesis of the desired proteins but incapable of manufacturing an infectious particle . Such genetically altered retroviral expression viral constructs have general utility for the high efficiency transduction of genes in vivo. Standard protocols for producing replication deficient retroviruses including the steps of incorporation of exogenous genetic material into a plasmid transfection of a packaging cell lined with plasmid production of recombinant retroviruses by the packaging cell line collection of viral particles from tissue culture media and infection of the target cells with viral particles are provided in Kriegler 1990 and in Murry 1991.

The retroviruses are a group of single stranded RNA viruses characterized by an ability to convert their RNA to double stranded DNA in infected cells by a process of reverse transcription Coffin 1990 . The resulting DNA then stably integrates into cellular chromosomes as a provirus and directs synthesis of viral proteins. The integration results in the retention of the viral gene sequences in the recipient cell and its descendants.

The retroviral genome contains three genes gag pol and env that code for capsid proteins polymerase enzyme and envelope components respectively. A sequence found upstream from the gag gene contains a signal for packaging of the genome into virions. Retroviral constructs are gene transfer plasmids wherein the heterologous nucleic acid resides between two retroviral LTRs. Retroviral constructs typically contain appropriate packaging signals that enable the retroviral construct or RNA transcribed using the retroviral construct as a template to be packaged into a viral virion in an appropriate packaging cell line see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 650 764 . These two long terminal repeat LTR sequences are present at the 5 and 3 ends of the viral genome. These contain strong promoter and enhancer sequences and are also required for integration in the host cell genome Coffin 1990 . In order to construct a retroviral construct a nucleic acid encoding one or more oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequences of interest is inserted into the viral genome in the place of certain viral sequences to produce a virus that is replication defective. Also included are episomal or non integrating forms of retroviral constructs based on lentiviruses e.g. a type of retrovirus .

Suitable retroviral constructs for use herein are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 399 346 and 5 252 479 and in WIPO publications WO 92 07573 WO 90 06997 WO 89 05345 WO 92 05266 and WO 92 14829 which provide a description of methods for efficiently introducing nucleic acids into human cells using such retroviral constructs. Other retroviral constructs include for example mouse mammary tumor virus viral constructs e.g. Shackleford et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 9655 9659 1998 lentiviruses and the like. An exemplary viral construct is plentilox IRES GFP.

Viral constructs can also be used for transfection of a mammalian cell such as a neuron and introducing a polynucleotide into its genome. In an indirect method viral constructs carrying genetic information are used to infect target cells removed from the body and these cells are then re implanted. Direct in vivo gene transfer into postnatal animals has been reported for formulations of DNA encapsulated in liposomes and DNA encapsulated in proteoliposomes containing viral envelope receptor proteins Nicolau et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 80 1068 1072 1983 Kaneda et al. Science 243 375 378 1989 Mannino et al. Biotechniques 6 682 690 1988 . Viral constructs can be injected or transduced into host neurons in vitro Nakajima A. et al. J. Clin. Invest. vol. 17 21 p. 1293 1310 2001 and Tuohy V. K. et al. J. Neuroimmunol. vol. 17 2 p. 226 32 2000 fibroblasts Rabinovich G. A. et al. J. Exp. Med. vol. 19 p. 385 98 1999 dendritic cells DCs Kim S. H. et al. J.

Other viral constructs may be employed as expression constructs in the present invention for the delivery of oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequences to a host cell. Viral constructs derived from viruses such as vaccinia virus Ridgeway 1988 Coupar et al. 1988 polioviruses and herpes viruses may be employed. They offer several attractive features for various mammalian cells Friedmann 1989 Ridgeway 1988 Coupar et al. 1988 Horwich et al. 1990 . Also included are hepatitis B viruses Horwich et al. 1990 and Chang et al. 1991 .

Nonviral constructs include plasmid viral constructs. Plasmid viral constructs have been extensively described in the art and are well known to those of skill in the art. See e.g. Sambrook et al. 1989. In the last few years plasmid viral constructs have been used as DNA vaccines for delivering antigen encoding genes to cells in vivo. They are particularly advantageous for this because they do not have the same safety concerns as with many of the viral constructs. These plasmids however having a promoter compatible with the host cell can express a peptide from a gene operatively encoded within the plasmid. Some commonly used plasmids include pBR322 pUC18 pUC19 pRC CMV SV40 and pBlueScript. Other plasmids are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally plasmids may be custom designed using restriction enzymes and ligation reactions to remove and add specific fragments of DNA. Plasmids may be delivered by a variety of routes. For example the DNA plasmid can be injected by intramuscular intradermal subcutaneous or other routes. locally to the degenerating CNS neuron. The plasmids may be given in an aqueous solution dried onto gold particles or in association with another DNA delivery system including but not limited to liposomes dendrimers cochleate and microencapsulation.

In order to effect expression of gene sequences the expression construct must be delivered into a cell. This delivery may be accomplished in vitro as in laboratory procedures for transforming cells lines or preferably in vivo or ex vivo as in the treatment of certain disease states. In certain embodiments of the invention an expression construct may simply consist of naked recombinant DNA or plasmids. Transfer of the construct may be performed by any of the methods mentioned above which physically or chemically permeabilize the cell membrane see Dubensky et al. 1984 and Benvenisty Reshef 1986 . Another embodiment of the invention for transferring a naked DNA expression construct into cells may involve particle bombardment. See Klein et al. 1987 Yang et al. 1990 and Zelenin et al. 1991. The microprojectiles used have consisted of biologically inert substances such as tungsten or gold beads.

Biodegradable microspheres e.g. polylactate polyglycolate may be employed as carriers for the gene delivery vehicles comprising the hp70S6K CA gene. Suitable biodegradable microspheres are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 897 268 5 075 109 5 928 647 5 811 128 5 820 883 5 853 763 5 814 344 5 407 609 and 5 942 252.

Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles facilitate nonviral gene transfer to human embryonic stem cells hESCs . Small approximately 200 nm positively charged approximately 10 mV particles are formed by the self assembly of cationic hydrolytically degradable poly beta amino esters and plasmid DNA.

There may be multiple variants of any given gene in the human population genes leading to polymorphism. For example one of ordinary skill in the art would acknowledge that nucleotide diversity may be based on single mutations called single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs . SNPs are changes in a single nucleotide when alleles are compared. Genes encoding the constitutively active mutant hp70SK CA protein used in the present invention may include well known nucleotide modifications in the gene that can occur without removing the biological activity of the protein.

As defined above the hp70SK CA protein herein also referred to interchangeably as polypeptide includes all biologically active forms fragments and variants that retain the biological activity of stimulating axon regeneration in a degenerating neuron of the CNS. For example dopaminergic neurons in the SN that are involved in PD and degenerated neurons in other neurodegenerative diseases such as AD or HD and brain and spinal cord injuries as a result of axon death. Biologically active fragments and biologically forms of the protein are used interchangeably and include functional variants of the protein for use in the present embodiments. Non human forms of the hp70SK CA protein are also included in certain embodiments.

The hp70SK CA polypeptide may have variations in amino acid sequence molecular weight isoelectric point the presence or absence of sugar chains or form depending on the cell or host used to produce it or the purification method utilized. Such functional equivalents include those wherein one or more amino acids are by one or more substitutions deletions insertions inversions fusions and truncations or a combination of any of these. So long as the activity the protein is maintained the number of amino acid mutations is not particularly limited. However it is generally preferred to alter 5 or less of the amino acid sequence. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the number of amino acids to be mutated in such a mutant is generally 30 amino acids or less preferably 20 amino acids or less more preferably 10 amino acids or less more preferably 6 amino acids or less and even more preferably 3 amino acids or less.

Variants of the hp70SK CA protein or biologically active fragments thereof include forms that are substantially homologous but derived from another organism i.e. an ortholog substantially homologous proteins or peptides that are produced by chemical synthesis or by recombinant methods. As used herein two proteins or a region of the proteins or peptides are substantially homologous when the amino acid sequences are at least about 70 75 typically at least about 80 85 and most typically at least about 90 95 97 98 or 99 or more homologous. Variants include conservative amino acid Substitutions Aromatic Phenylalanine Tryptophan Tyrosine Hydrophobic Leucine Isoleucine Valine Polar Glutamine Asparagine Basic Arginine Lysine Histidine Acidic Aspartic Acid Glutamic Acid Small Alanine Serine Threonine Methionine Glycine.

Substantial homology can be to the entire amino acid sequence or to fragments of these sequences which can be derived from the amino acid sequence of hp70SK CA . However the invention also encompasses fragments of the hp70SK CA . Accordingly a fragment can comprise any length that retains one or more of the desired biological activities of the protein for example the ability to regenerate axons. Fragments can be discrete not fused to other amino acids or polypeptides or can be within a larger polypeptide in which case the viral construct would have the nucleic acid sequence required for the full fused protein.

Polypeptides often contain amino acids other than the 20 amino acids commonly referred to as the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Further many amino acids including the terminal amino acids may be modified by natural processes such as processing and other post translational modifications or by chemical modification techniques well known in the art. Common modifications that occur naturally in polypeptides are described below.

Biologically active functional variants typically contain only conservative variation or variation in non critical residues or in non critical regions. Functional variants can also contain substitution of similar amino acids which results in no change or an insignificant change in function. Certain substitutions may positively or negatively affect the enumerated biological activity to some degree. Variants can be naturally occurring or can be made by recombinant means of chemical synthesis to provide useful and novel characteristics of the desired protein.

Accordingly the polypeptides also encompass derivatives or analogs in which a substituted amino acid residue is not one encoded by the genetic code in which a substituent group is included in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide such as a leader or secretory sequence or a sequence for purification of the mature polypeptide or a pro protein sequence.

An amino acid residue to be mutated is preferably mutated into a different amino acid in which the properties of the amino acid side chain are conserved a process known as conservative amino acid substitution . Examples of properties of amino acid side chains are hydrophobic amino acids A I L M F P W Y V hydrophilic amino acids R D N C E Q G H K S T and side chains having the following functional groups or characteristics in common an aliphatic side chain G A V L I P a hydroxyl group containing side chain S T Y a sulfur atom containing side chain C M a carboxylic acid and amide containing side chain D N E Q a base containing side chain R K H and an aromatic containing side chain H F Y W . Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example the following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Glycine G 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W 7 Serine S Threonine T and 8 Cysteine C Methionine M see e.g. Creighton Proteins 1984 .

Such conservatively modified polypeptides are included in the present protein. However the present invention is not restricted to these and the hp70S6K CA protein includes non conservative modifications so long as at least one relevant biological activity of the protein is retained. Furthermore the modified proteins do not exclude polymorphic variants interspecies homologues and those encoded by alleles of these proteins.

The hp70S6K CA protein also encompass derivatives or analogs in which a substituted amino acid residue is not one encoded by the genetic code in which a substituent group is included in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide such as a leader or secretory sequence or a sequence for purification of the mature polypeptide or a pro protein sequence.

All viral constructs used for these studies were AAV1 serotype. The cDNA clone for wild type human p70S6K was obtained from OriGene Technologies Catalogue No. Accession No. NM 003161 . A constitutively active mutant in which a C terminus autoinhibitory domain aa399 502 is deleted and a threonine at position 389 is changed to a phospho mimetic glutamate hp70S6K DELC T389E also referred to herein by the shorthand form as hp70S6K CA has been previously characterized in in vitro studies Zhang et al. 2006 . This mutation was introduced by PCR based site directed mutagenesis Phusion Kit New England Biolabs and a 3 end FLAG encoding sequence was incorporated.

This modified constitutively active form of hp70S6K was then cloned into an AAV packaging construct that utilizes the chicken actin CBA promoter and contains a 3 WPRE pBL Kim et al. 2011 and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence BGHpolyA . One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the viral construct may further include but is not limited to an origin of replication regulatory sequences selectable markers tags and unique restriction sites.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine solution and placed in a stereotaxic frame Kopf Instruments with a mouse adapter. The tip of 5.0 L syringe needle 26S was inserted to stereotaxic coordinates AP 0.35 cm ML 0.11 cm DV 0.37 cm relative to bregma. Viral construct suspension in a volume of 2.0 L was injected at 0.1 L min over 20 minutes.

Mice were first pretreated with desipramine to block 6 OHDA uptake by noradrenergic terminals thereby limiting the lesion to striatal dopaminergic terminals. They were then anesthetized with ketamine xylazine solution and placed in a stereotaxic frame. A solution of 6 OHDA 5.0 g l in 0.9 NaCl 0.02 ascorbate was injected by microliter syringe at a rate of 0.5 l minute by pump for a total dose of 15.0 g 3 l. The injection was performed into the left striatum at coordinates AP 0.09 cm ML 0.22 cm DV 0.25 cm relative to bregma. After a wait of 2 minutes the needle was withdrawn slowly. 6 OHDA in the striatum causes retrograde degeneration of dopaminergic axons projecting to the striatum from the substantia nigra.

Quantification of GFP Positive Axons and Tomato Tau Positive Axons in the Medial Forebrain Bundle MFB 

Quantification of axons was performed on TH GFP transgenic mice which express green fluorescent protein driven by the TH promoter 11 . Mice were perfused intracardially with 0.9 of NaCl followed by 4.0 paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.1 and then post fixation for 48 hours. The brains were sectioned horizontally on a Vibratome at 50 m. A section containing the posterior third ventricular recess and the A13 dopamine cell group was selected for analysis as described 20 . Confocal microscopy Leica TCS SP5 AOBS MP System was used to acquire images through the entire medial to lateral extent of the MFB. Proceeding from a point midway between the anterior A13 cells and the posterior third ventricle recess images were acquired with a 20 objective with a zoom factor of 8 applied. Seven contiguous fields 97 m 97 m were scanned. Each field was scanned in the Z axis with twenty 0.1 m thickness optical planes from dorsal to ventral for a total vertical distance of 2.0 m in the center of the section. These twenty optical planes were then merged to obtain a single maximal projection of the sampled volume. In order to count the number of axons passing in the rostro caudal dimension through each sample volume two horizontal sampling lines were drawn on the image at a separation distance of 10 m in the center of the maximal projection. Every intact axon crossing both lines was counted as positive. An identical approach was used to count tomato positive axons. In addition tortuous tomato positive axons in the MFB were identified by epifluorescence.

Differences between two groups were analyzed by the Student t test. Multiple comparisons among groups were performed by one way ANOVA and Tukey s post hoc analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat software Systat Software San Leandro Calif. .

At time 0 mice received a unilateral intra striatal injection of 6 OHDA. At time 3 weeks the mice received either AAV p70S6K WT or AAV p70S6K delC T389E also referred to herein as AAV p70S6K CA or control AAV GFP. At Time 15 weeks 12 weeks post AAV mice were sacrificed by perfusion fixation and immunostaining for TH on coronal SN and striatal sections were performed. Transduction of the substantia nigra pars compacta SNpc dopamine neurons with AAV hp70S6K CA was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining for the FLAG epitope and by double immunofluorescence labeling for FLAG and tyrosine hydroxylase TH .

The number of remaining SN dopamine neurons were determined by sterologic counting. The density of TH immunoperoxidase staining in the lesioned striatum was determined and expressed as a percent of the optical density of the contralateral non lesioned striatum which serves as an internal control for each section. For these experiments based on our previous experience with this model an N 8 in each group provided sufficient power to detect an effect. The upper panel indicates immunofluorescence double labeling for TH red and FLAG green demonstrates that transgene expression is identifiable within dopamine neurons of the SNpc for each viral construct. Each viral construct was estimated to achieve efficiencies of transduction of dopamine neurons ranging from 80 in the caudal planes adjacent to the viral construct injection site to 60 in the rostral planes. shows that hp70S6K CA protein is expressed by the axons.

hp70S6K CA induces a detectable increase in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. This induced phosphorylation by hp70S6K CA in the SN was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining to occur exclusively within neurons of the SNpc .

The effects of AAV hp70S6K CA transduction of normal adult non lesioned mice are shown in . An increased density of immunostaining for TH in the striatum was seen and it is most likely due to the induction of sprouting of dopaminergic nerve fibers in the striatum. In normal mice AAV hp70S6K CA did not induce the formation of new axons. Morphologic analysis of SN dopamine neurons at 5 6 weeks after intranigral injection of AAV hp70S6K CA was conducted using tyrosine hydroxylase TH immunoperoxidase staining and thionin counterstaining. The experimental side injected with AAV hp70S6K CA shows an increased density of staining that is associated with an increase in the mean area of the TH positive neurons . A morphologic analysis of the striatum of these AAV hp70S6K CA transduced animals at 5 6 weeks is shown in . is a morphologic analysis of the corpus striatum at 5 6 weeks after intranigral injection of AAV hp70S6K CA . A representative coronal section of TH immunoperoxidase staining reveals an increased density of staining on the experimental side injected with AAV hp70S6K CA . AAV hp70S6K CA induced a 1.2 fold increase in optical density OD of TH peroxidase stain expressed as percent of the contralateral noninjected side in comparison to AAV green fluorescent protein GFP injected mice P 0.005 one way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc analysis as shown n 8 animals each experimental group . .

The effects of post intra striatal 6 OHDA injection are shown in . Mice were subjected to 6 OHDA lesion injected with AAV hp70S6K CA and at time 12 weeks post lesion mice were sacrificed by perfusion fixation. The brains were sectioned horizontally immunostained for TH and quantitatively analyzed for the number of TH positive axons in the MFB. In mice treated with AAV hp70S6K CA there was a significant reinnervation of the MFB and striatum as shown by peroxidase staining for TH as shown in . Representative horizontal sections stained for TH are shown at 15 weeks post lesion. The red rectangles encompass the MFB on the lesioned side and are shown at higher magnification in the panels at the right. The effect of hp70S6K CA is shown quantitatively as TH positive axon counts in . These mice N 9 had a mean of 69.4 axons on the lesioned side whereas AAV GFP N 8 and AAV hp70S6K injected mice N 8 had only 41.9 and 49.8 axons respectively a highly significant different P

The effects of post intra striatal 6 OHDA injection performed in transgenic TH GFP mice is shown in . These mice express GFP in the dopaminergic axons making it possible to quantify them without relying on the expression of TH protein. While immunostaining for TH or other protein markers of dopamine axons provides a useful static picture of the extent of striatal and MFB axon restoration it is not useful for monitoring dynamic aspects of dopaminergic axon growth because TH is highly regulated and in some contexts there is no expression even in structurally intact axons.

In order to monitor the growth of new axons from the SN through the MFB towards the striatum two techniques were utilized. First TH GFP transgenic mice were used to monitor the presence of dopaminergic axons in the MFB without dependence on the TH expression phenotype 31 . . In each panel represents a single confocal maximal projection of a 20 0.1 l Z stack acquired from the MFB of a TH GFP mouse. For each representative set of panels acquired from a single mouse three images are shown from the central and adjacent medial and lateral MFB on both the non lesioned control CON and the 6OHDA lesioned side. . There are more axons in the MFB on the 6 OHDA lesioned side of mice treated with p70S6K CA compared to control mice injected with AAV Tau Tomato. This effect is shown quantitatively in the graph. Quantitative analysis shown in the graph to the right reveals that there is an increase in axon growth in mice receiving AAV hp70S6K CA.

The restoration regeneration regrowth of axons in lesioned mice was revealed by a technique in which axons are visualized by expression of the axonal marker Tomato tau. Tomato tau is a fluorescent fusion protein that traffics to axons. . SN neurons were transduced with AAV Tomato tau simultaneously with AAV hp70SK CA transduction and then visualized and counted at 12 weeks post transduction. Tomato tau transduction also enables quantification of axons without relying on expression of TH protein. Quantitative analysis shown in the graph to the right revealed that there is an increase in axon regrowth in mice receiving AAV hp70S6K CA . Specifically mice transduced with AAV hp70S6K CA showed an increased number of tomato tau positive axons in the MFB. These mice had a mean of 30 axons on the lesioned side whereas mice injected with tomato tau injected alone and P70S6K WT mice had only 10 and 15 axons respectively a highly significant different P
