The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 681 484 filed Aug. 9 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Provided herein are salts and solid forms of the compound of formula I or a stereoisomer thereof solid forms of the salts and methods of synthesizing the salts and solid forms.

Cancer is characterized primarily by an increase in the number of abnormal cells derived from a given normal tissue invasion of adjacent tissues by these abnormal cells or lymphatic or blood borne spread of malignant cells to regional lymph nodes and to distant sites metastasis . Clinical data and molecular biologic studies indicate that cancer is a multistep process that begins with minor preneoplastic changes which may under certain conditions progress to neoplasia. The neoplastic lesion may evolve clonally and develop an increasing capacity for invasion growth metastasis and heterogeneity especially under conditions in which the neoplastic cells escape the host s immune surveillance. Roitt I. Brostoff J and Kale D. 17.1 17.12 3rd ed. Mosby St. Louis Mo. 1993 .

Many types of cancers are associated with new blood vessel formation a process known as angiogenesis. Several of the mechanisms involved in tumor induced angiogenesis have been elucidated. The most direct of these mechanisms is the secretion by the tumor cells of cytokines with angiogenic properties including tumor necrosis factor TNF .

A variety of other diseases and disorders are also associated with or characterized by undesired angiogenesis. For example enhanced or unregulated angiogenesis has been implicated in a number of diseases and medical conditions including but not limited to ocular neovascular diseases choroidal neovascular diseases retina neovascular diseases rubeosis neovascularization of the angle viral diseases genetic diseases inflammatory diseases allergic diseases and autoimmune diseases. Examples of such diseases and conditions include but are not limited to diabetic retinopathy retinopathy of prematurity corneal graft rejection neovascular glaucoma retrolental fibroplasia arthritis and proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

Accordingly compounds that can control angiogenesis or inhibit the production of certain cytokines including TNF may be useful in the treatment and prevention of various diseases and conditions.

Current cancer therapy may involve surgery chemotherapy hormonal therapy and or radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient see e.g. Stockdale 1998 vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. Chapter 12 Section IV . Recently cancer therapy could also involve biological therapy or immunotherapy. All of these approaches pose significant drawbacks for the patient. Surgery for example may be contraindicated due to the health or age of a patient or may be unacceptable to the patient.

Additionally surgery may not completely remove neoplastic tissue. Radiation therapy is only effective when the neoplastic tissue exhibits a higher sensitivity to radiation than normal tissue. Radiation therapy can also often elicit serious side effects. Hormonal therapy is rarely given as a single agent. Although hormonal therapy can be effective it is often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other treatments have removed the majority of cancer cells. Biological therapies and immunotherapies are limited in number and may produce side effects such as rashes or swellings flu like symptoms including fever chills and fatigue digestive tract problems or allergic reactions.

With respect to chemotherapy there are a variety of chemotherapeutic agents available for treatment of cancer. A majority of cancer chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting DNA synthesis either directly or indirectly by inhibiting the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors to prevent DNA replication and concomitant cell division. Gilman et al. Goodman and Gilman s Tenth Ed. McGraw Hill New York .

Despite availability of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents chemotherapy has many drawbacks. Stockdale vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. ch. 12 sect. 10 1998. Almost all chemotherapeutic agents are toxic and chemotherapy causes significant and often dangerous side effects including severe nausea bone marrow depression and immunosuppression. Additionally even with administration of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents many tumor cells are resistant or develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. In fact those cells resistant to the particular chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment protocol often prove to be resistant to other drugs even if those agents act by different mechanism from those of the drugs used in the specific treatment. This phenomenon is referred to as pleiotropic drug or multidrug resistance. Because of the drug resistance many cancers prove or become refractory to standard chemotherapeutic treatment protocols.

Other diseases or conditions associated with or characterized by undesired angiogenesis are also difficult to treat. However some compounds such as protamine hepain and steroids have been proposed to be useful in the treatment of certain specific diseases. Taylor et al. 297 307 1982 Folkman et al. 221 719 1983 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 001 116 and 4 994 443.

Still there is a significant need for safe and effective methods of treating preventing and managing cancer and other diseases and conditions including for diseases that are refractory to standard treatments such as surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy and hormonal therapy while reducing or avoiding the toxicities and or side effects associated with the conventional therapies.

Compounds having a basic moiety can form various salts with acids. Different salts of a given compound may have different properties that affect the compound s stability processability in vivo performance as a pharmaceutical. The physical properties of certain salts of a given compound may also allow for or facilitate the isolation of optically or stereomerically pure forms of the compound.

Compounds may also exist in different solid forms. The selection of a solid form of a pharmaceutical compound may affect a variety of physical and chemical properties which may provide benefits or drawbacks in processing formulation stability and bioavailability among other important pharmaceutical characteristics. Potential pharmaceutical solids include crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Amorphous solids are characterized by a lack of long range structural order whereas crystalline solids are characterized by structural periodicity. The desired class of pharmaceutical solid depends upon the specific application amorphous solids are sometimes selected on the basis of e.g. an enhanced dissolution profile while crystalline solids may be desirable for properties such as e.g. physical or chemical stability see e.g. S. R. Vippagunta et al. . 2001 48 3 26 L. Yu . 2001 48 27 42 .

Whether crystalline or amorphous potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may include single component and multiple component solids. Single component solids consist essentially of the pharmaceutical compound in the absence of other compounds. Variety among single component crystalline materials may potentially arise from the phenomenon of polymorphism wherein multiple three dimensional arrangements exist for a particular pharmaceutical compound see e.g. S. R. Byrn et al. 1999 SSCI West Lafayette .

Additional diversity among the potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may arise from the possibility of multiple component solids. Crystalline solids comprising two or more ionic species are termed salts see e.g. P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth Eds. 2002 Wiley Weinheim . Additional types of multiple component solids that may potentially offer other property improvements for a pharmaceutical compound or salt thereof include e.g. hydrates solvates co crystals and clathrates among others see e.g. S. R. Byrn et al. 1999 SSCI West Lafayette . Moreover multiple component crystal forms may potentially be susceptible to polymorphism wherein a given multiple component composition may exist in more than one three dimensional crystalline arrangement. The discovery of solid forms is of great importance in the development of a safe effective stable and marketable pharmaceutical compound.

Like different crystal forms different polymorphs may have different physical properties such as for example melting temperatures heats of fusion solubilities dissolution rates and or vibrational spectra as a result of the arrangement or conformation of the molecules and or ions in the crystal lattice. The differences in physical properties may affect pharmaceutical parameters such as storage stability compressibility and density important in formulation and product manufacturing and dissolution rate an important factor in bioavailability . Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity e.g. differential oxidation such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph or mechanical changes e.g. tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to a thermodynamically more stable polymorph or both e.g. tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity . As a result of solubility dissolution differences in the extreme case some solid state transitions may result in lack of potency or at the other extreme toxicity. In addition the physical properties may be important in processing for example one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities and particle shape and size distribution might be different between polymorphs .

 Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause and is measured in the intent to treat population. Overall survival should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies. Demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival can be considered to be clinically significant if the toxicity profile is acceptable and has often supported new drug approval.

Several endpoints are based on tumor assessments. These endpoints include disease free survival DFS objective response rate ORR time to progression TTP progression free survival PFS and time to treatment failure TTF . The collection and analysis of data on these time dependent endpoints are based on indirect assessments calculations and estimates e.g. tumor measurements .

Generally disease free survival DFS is defined as the time from randomization until recurrence of tumor or death from any cause. Although overall survival is a conventional endpoint for most adjuvant settings DFS can be an important endpoint in situations where survival may be prolonged making a survival endpoint impractical. DFS can be a surrogate for clinical benefit or it can provide direct evidence of clinical benefit. This determination is based on the magnitude of the effect its risk benefit relationship and the disease setting. The definition of DFS can be complicated particularly when deaths are noted without prior tumor progression documentation. These events can be scored either as disease recurrences or as censored events. Although all methods for statistical analysis of deaths have some limitations considering all deaths deaths from all causes as recurrences can minimize bias. DFS can be overestimated using this definition especially in patients who die after a long period without observation. Bias can be introduced if the frequency of long term follow up visits is dissimilar between the study arms or if dropouts are not random because of toxicity.

 Objective response rate ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period. Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression. Generally the FDA has defined ORR as the sum of partial responses plus complete responses. When defined in this manner ORR is a direct measure of drug antitumor activity which can be evaluated in a single arm study. If available standardized criteria should be used to ascertain response. A variety of response criteria have been considered appropriate e.g. RECIST criteria Therasse et al. 2000 92 205 16 . The significance of ORR is assessed by its magnitude and duration and the percentage of complete responses no detectable evidence of tumor .

 Time to progression TTP and progression free survival PFS have served as primary endpoints for drug approval. TTP is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression TTP does not include deaths. PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death. Compared with TTP PFS is the preferred regulatory endpoint. PFS includes deaths and thus can be a better correlate to overall survival. PFS assumes patient deaths are randomly related to tumor progression. However in situations where the majority of deaths are unrelated to cancer TTP can be an acceptable endpoint.

As an endpoint to support drug approval PFS can reflect tumor growth and be assessed before the determination of a survival benefit. Its determination is not confounded by subsequent therapy. For a given sample size the magnitude of effect on PFS can be larger than the effect on overall survival. However the formal validation of PFS as a surrogate for survival for the many different malignancies that exist can be difficult. Data are sometimes insufficient to allow a robust evaluation of the correlation between effects on survival and PFS. Cancer trials are often small and proven survival benefits of existing drugs are generally modest. The role of PFS as an endpoint to support licensing approval varies in different cancer settings. Whether an improvement in PFS represents a direct clinical benefit or a surrogate for clinical benefit depends on the magnitude of the effect and the risk benefit of the new treatment compared to available therapies.

 Time to treatment failure TTF is defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason including disease progression treatment toxicity and death. TTF is not recommended as a regulatory endpoint for drug approval. TTF does not adequately distinguish efficacy from these additional variables. A regulatory endpoint should clearly distinguish the efficacy of the drug from toxicity patient or physician withdrawal or patient intolerance.

Administration of a salt or solid form provided herein and the second active agents to a patient can occur simultaneously or sequentially by the same or different routes of administration. The suitability of a particular route of administration employed for a particular active agent will depend on the active agent itself e.g. whether it can be administered orally without decomposing prior to entering the blood stream and the disease being treated. One of administration for compounds provided herein is oral. Routes of administration for the second active agents or ingredients are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See e.g. 60ed. 2006 .

In one embodiment the second active agent is administered intravenously or subcutaneously and once or twice daily in an amount of from about 1 to about 1000 mg from about 5 to about 500 mg from about 10 to about 350 mg or from about 50 to about 200 mg. The specific amount of the second active agent will depend on the specific agent used the type of disease being treated or managed the severity and stage of disease and the amount s of compounds provided herein and any optional additional active agents concurrently administered to the patient.

As discussed elsewhere herein also encompassed is a method of reducing treating and or preventing adverse or undesired effects associated with conventional therapy including but not limited to surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy hormonal therapy biological therapy and immunotherapy. Salts and solid forms provided herein and other active ingredients can be administered to a patient prior to during or after the occurrence of the adverse effect associated with conventional therapy.

In certain embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents provided herein are cyclically administered to a patient. Cycling therapy involves the administration of an active agent for a period of time followed by a rest i.e. discontinuation of the administration for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies and or improve the efficacy of the treatment.

Consequently in one embodiment a salt or solid form provided herein is administered daily in a single or divided doses in a four to six week cycle with a rest period of about a week or two weeks. Cycling therapy further allows the frequency number and length of dosing cycles to be increased. Thus another embodiment encompasses the administration of a compound provided herein for more cycles than are typical when it is administered alone. In yet another embodiment a salt or solid form provided herein is administered for a greater number of cycles than would typically cause dose limiting toxicity in a patient to whom a second active ingredient is not also being administered.

In one embodiment a salt or solid form provided herein is administered daily and continuously for three or four weeks at a dose of from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day followed by a rest of one or two weeks. In other embodiments the dose can be from about 1 mg to about 300 mg from about 0.1 mg to about 150 mg from about 1 mg to about 200 mg from about 10 mg to about 100 mg from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg from about 1 mg to about 50 mg from about 10 mg to about 50 mg from about 20 mg to about 30 mg or from about 1 mg to about 20 mg followed by a rest.

In one embodiment a salt or solid form provided herein and a second active ingredient are administered orally with administration of the compound provided herein occurring 30 to 60 minutes prior to the second active ingredient during a cycle of four to six weeks. In another embodiment the combination of a compound provided herein and a second active ingredient is administered by intravenous infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle.

Typically the number of cycles during which the combination treatment is administered to a patient will be from about one to about 24 cycles from about two to about 16 cycles or from about four to about three cycles.

Pharmaceutical compositions can be used in the preparation of individual single unit dosage forms. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein comprise a salt or solid form provided herein. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can further comprise one or more excipients.

Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein can also comprise one or more additional active ingredients. Examples of optional second or additional active ingredients are disclosed above.

Single unit dosage forms provided herein are suitable for oral mucosal e.g. nasal sublingual vaginal buccal or rectal parenteral e.g. subcutaneous intravenous bolus injection intramuscular or intraarterial topical e.g. eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations transdermal or transcutaneous administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include but are not limited to tablets caplets capsules such as soft elastic gelatin capsules cachets troches lozenges dispersions suppositories powders aerosols e.g. nasal sprays or inhalers gels liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient including suspensions e.g. aqueous or non aqueous liquid suspensions oil in water emulsions or a water in oil liquid emulsions solutions and elixirs liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations suitable for topical administration and sterile solids e.g. crystalline or amorphous solids that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.

The composition shape and type of dosage forms will typically vary depending on their use. For example a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms are used will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See e.g. 20ed. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 2000 .

In one embodiment pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy and non limiting examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art including but not limited to the way in which the dosage form will be administered to a patient. For example oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example the decomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little if any lactose other mono or di saccharides. As used herein the term lactose free means that the amount of lactose present if any is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient.

Lactose free compositions can comprise excipients that are well known in the art and are listed for example in the USP 25 NF20 2002 . In general lactose free compositions comprise active ingredients a binder filler and a lubricant in pharmaceutically compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. In one embodiment lactose free dosage forms comprise active ingredients microcrystalline cellulose pre gelatinized starch and magnesium stearate.

Also provided are anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising active ingredients since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example the addition of water e.g. 5 is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. See e.g. Jens T. Carstensen 2d. Ed. Marcel Dekker NY N.Y. 1995 pp. 379 80. In effect water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture handling packaging storage shipment and use of formulations.

Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected.

An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous compositions are in one embodiment packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastics unit dose containers e.g. vials blister packs and strip packs.

Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds which are referred to herein as stabilizers include but are not limited to antioxidants such as ascorbic acid pH buffers or salt buffers.

Like the amounts and types of excipients the amounts and specific types of active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as but not limited to the route by which it is to be administered to patients. In one embodiment dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein in an amount of from about 0.10 to about 500 mg. In other embodiments dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein in an amount of about 0.1 1 2 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 25 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 or 500 mg.

In other embodiments dosage forms comprise the second active ingredient in an amount of 1 to about 1000 mg from about 5 to about 500 mg from about 10 to about 350 mg or from about 50 to about 200 mg. Of course the specific amount of the second active agent will depend on the specific agent used the diseases or disorders being treated or managed and the amount s of a compound provided herein and any optional additional active agents concurrently administered to the patient.

Pharmaceutical compositions that are suitable for oral administration can be provided as discrete dosage forms such as but not limited to tablets e.g. chewable tablets caplets capsules and liquids e.g. flavored syrups . Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally 20th ed. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 2000 .

Oral dosage forms provided herein are prepared by combining the active ingredients in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include but are not limited to water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms e.g. powders tablets capsules and caplets include but are not limited to starches sugars micro crystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents.

In one embodiment oral dosage forms are tablets or capsules in which case solid excipients are employed. In another embodiment tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers finely divided solid carriers or both and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary.

For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredients in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms provided herein include but are not limited to binders fillers disintegrants and lubricants. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose e.g. Nos. 2208 2906 2910 microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include but are not limited to the materials sold as AVICEL PH 101 AVICEL PH 103 AVICEL RC 581 AVICEL PH 105 available from FMC Corporation American Viscose Division Avicel Sales Marcus Hook Pa. and mixtures thereof. An specific binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC 581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL PH 103 and Starch 1500 LM.

Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions is in one embodiment present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form.

Disintegrants may be used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage while those that contain too little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredients may be used to form solid oral dosage forms. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.

Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums and mixtures thereof.

Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethyl laureate agar and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a syloid silica gel AEROSIL200 manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore Md. a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica marketed by Degussa Co. of Plano Tex. CAB O SIL a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston Mass. and mixtures thereof. If used at all lubricants may be used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are incorporated.

In one embodiment a solid oral dosage form comprises a salt or solid form provided herein anhydrous lactose microcrystalline cellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone stearic acid colloidal anhydrous silica and gelatin.

Active ingredients such as the compounds salts and solid forms provided herein can be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 845 770 3 916 899 3 536 809 3 598 123 and 4 008 719 5 674 533 5 059 595 5 591 767 5 120 548 5 073 543 5 639 476 5 354 556 5 639 480 5 733 566 5 739 108 5 891 474 5 922 356 5 972 891 5 980 945 5 993 855 6 045 830 6 087 324 6 113 943 6 197 350 6 248 363 6 264 970 6 267 981 6 376 461 6 419 961 6 589 548 6 613 358 6 699 500 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active ingredients using for example hydropropylmethyl cellulose other polymer matrices gels permeable membranes osmotic systems multilayer coatings microparticles liposomes microspheres or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art including those described herein can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients provided herein. Thus the compositions provided encompass single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as but not limited to tablets capsules gelcaps and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.

All controlled release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non controlled counterparts. Ideally the use of an optimally designed controlled release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug reduced dosage frequency and increased subject compliance. In addition controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics such as blood levels of the drug and can thus affect the occurrence of side e.g. adverse effects.

Most controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug active ingredient that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including but not limited to pH temperature enzymes water or other physiological conditions or compounds.

In certain embodiments the drug may be administered using intravenous infusion an implantable osmotic pump a transdermal patch liposomes or other modes of administration. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Sefton 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. 321 574 1989 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in a subject at an appropriate site determined by a practitioner of skill i.e. thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson Medical Applications of Controlled Release vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 . Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer 249 1527 1533 1990 . The active ingredient can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix e.g. polymethylmethacrylate polybutylmethacrylate plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride plasticized nylon plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate natural rubber polyisoprene polyisobutylene polybutadiene polyethylene ethylene vinylacetate copolymers silicone rubbers polydimethylsiloxanes silicone carbonate copolymers hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid collagen cross linked polyvinylalcohol and cross linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane e.g. polyethylene polypropylene ethylene propylene copolymers ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers ethylene vinylacetate copolymers silicone rubbers polydimethyl siloxanes neoprene rubber chlorinated polyethylene polyvinylchloride vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate vinylidene chloride ethylene and propylene ionomer polyethylene terephthalate butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer ethylene vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol terpolymer and ethylene vinyloxyethanol copolymer that is insoluble in body fluids. The active ingredient then diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active ingredient in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof as well as the needs of the subject.

Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including but not limited to subcutaneous intravenous including bolus injection intramuscular and intraarterial. In some embodiments administration of a parenteral dosage form bypasses patients natural defenses against contaminants and thus in these embodiments parenteral dosage forms are sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include but are not limited to solutions ready for injection dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection suspensions ready for injection and emulsions.

Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include but are not limited to Water for Injection USP aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Dextrose Injection Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and Lactated Ringer s Injection water miscible vehicles such as but not limited to ethyl alcohol polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol and non aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate and benzyl benzoate.

Salts and solid forms that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms. For example cyclodextrin and its derivatives can be used to increase the solubility of a compound provided herein. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 134 127 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Topical and mucosal dosage forms provided herein include but are not limited to sprays aerosols solutions emulsions suspensions eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See e.g. 16 18and 20eds. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1980 1990 and 2000 and 4th ed. Lea Febiger Philadelphia 1985 . Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels.

Suitable excipients e.g. carriers and diluents and other materials that can be used to provide topical and mucosal dosage forms encompassed herein are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. In one embodiment excipients include but are not limited to water acetone ethanol ethylene glycol propylene glycol butane 1 3 diol isopropyl myristate isopropyl palmitate mineral oil and mixtures thereof to form solutions emulsions or gels which are non toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms. Examples of additional ingredients are well known in the art. See e.g. 16 18and 20eds. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1980 1990 and 2000 .

The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Also the polarity of a solvent carrier its ionic strength or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In other embodiments stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation as an emulsifying agent or surfactant or as a delivery enhancing or penetration enhancing agent. In other embodiments salts solvates prodrugs clathrates or stereoisomers of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition

In one embodiment active ingredients provided herein are not administered to a patient at the same time or by the same route of administration. In another embodiment provided are kits which can simplify the administration of appropriate amounts of active ingredients.

In one embodiment a kit comprises a dosage form of a compound provided herein. Kits can further comprise additional active ingredients such as oblimersen Genasense melphalan G CSF GM CSF EPO topotecan dacarbazine irinotecan taxotere IFN COX 2 inhibitor pentoxifylline ciprofloxacin dexamethasone IL2 IL8 IL18 Ara C vinorelbine isotretinoin 13 cis retinoic acid or a pharmacologically active mutant or derivative thereof or a combination thereof. Examples of the additional active ingredients include but are not limited to those disclosed herein.

In other embodiments kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active ingredients. Examples of such devices include but are not limited to syringes drip bags patches and inhalers.

Kits can further comprise cells or blood for transplantation as well as pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active ingredients. For example if an active ingredient is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active ingredient can be dissolved to form a particulate free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include but are not limited to Water for Injection USP aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Dextrose Injection Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and Lactated Ringer s Injection water miscible vehicles such as but not limited to ethyl alcohol polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol and non aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate and benzyl benzoate.
