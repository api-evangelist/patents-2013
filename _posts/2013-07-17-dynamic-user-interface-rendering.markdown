title: Dynamic user interface rendering
abstract: Clickstream data describes a pathway or sequence taken by a user while accessing webpages or other user interfaces. The clickstream data may be parsed or processed to identify the time the user spent viewing each webpage, the number of elements on each webpage, the user's access bandwidth, and other data defining respective user access metrics. The user access metrics may be applied toward the generation of more effective user interfaces having idealized element counts, element placements or counts targeted to a particular user, elements based on estimated user access times, and so on.

A server or other device provides webpages or other user interfaces to various types of client devices. Users of those client devices view the webpages and the respective content. The content may support e commerce businesses manufacturers special interest groups and other entities. Such entities seek to make their webpages more effective informative and engaging with respect to target users.

Certain implementations and embodiments will now be described more fully below with reference to the accompanying figures in which various aspects are shown. However various aspects may be implemented in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

Users access or browse various user interfaces such as webpages e commerce shopping sites and so forth using laptop computers e book readers tablets smart phones and other client devices. The particular sequence that a user takes while accessing a number of different webpages is known as a clickstream. Different users may access the same webpages by respectively varying sequences. Conversely a particular user may repeat a given sequence i.e. clickstream numerous times. Thus webpages may be accessed by way of numerous routes or pathways. Accessing a webpage may also refer to a communications session between a web server and the client device associated with a user.

Several illustrations are depicted and described herein using e commerce related webpages in the interest of clarity. However the methods devices and resources described herein may be applied to user interfaces related to industrial process control banking health care security or police services military operations and many other areas of endeavor.

Respective users spend varying amounts of time viewing any particular webpage. Additionally the same user may access the same webpage numerous times spending different amounts of time during each visit. In some instances a user accesses a webpage and departs therefrom i.e. navigates away or moves on to another webpage before all of the elements have been fully rendered or presented to the user. Such elements may include without limitation user interface elements images text tables audio files and so on. Elements may also include hidden or embedded portions of code that cause various actions to be performed by the client device. Thus elements included in a webpage may include visible visual elements audible audio elements embedded functional elements and so forth.

Clickstream data refers to information that corresponds to or describes a user s access to one or more webpages or user interfaces. For a non limiting example clickstream data may include one or more of a time spent by a user accessing a webpage the number of elements included on a webpage the number of elements rendered on a webpage before a user moved on an access bandwidth corresponding to a user an identity of a user and so forth. Processing clickstream data may provide numerous types of user access metrics that is factors or quantities indicative of user interest or engagement in a webpage or sequence of webpages. In turn a data structure or other data structure can be populated with such user access metrics. Respective data structures may be specific to the webpages provided by a particular server comprehensive of the webpages provided by multiple different servers inclusive of user access metrics for a multitude of users and so on.

Various factors influence the amount of time and presumably attention that a user spends accessing a particular webpage i.e. viewing images listening to audio content and so on . User familiarity with that webpage expectations as to the amount or type of content that is presented use of the webpage as a stepping stone to another webpage and so forth may cause a user to spend less time on a given webpage than anticipated or desired by the designer. Some factors are linked to the specific user or their circumstances such as the bandwidth communicational speed of their webpage access service or the time critical or attention focused nature of their webpage access goals.

In one example a user is seeking a part for a garden tractor through a sequence clickstream of vendor webpages that progressively focus in on the needed component. Such a user may be concentrating upon correct identification of the part and elements that are not directly related to that goal may be distracting and annoying perhaps to the extent that the user abandons the website and seeks another vendor. Thus too much or extraneous webpage content may result in lost sales.

In another example a user is browsing for a gift at a website. The user s clickstream has directed their search to earrings and then narrowed the search to pearl earrings. A webpage presenting four different pairs of pearl earrings may capture the user s attention for at least a few minutes while they visually examine respective fine details. Such a webpage may be an effective place to present sales information loss or damage insurance options or other information due to the relatively longer viewing time anticipated of the user by the webpage designers. Thus the webpage access habits expectations or interests of a particular user or a group of users having some interest in common in association with the primary purpose of a given webpage are among the factors leading to specific user access metrics. Such user access metrics may be analyzed in the interest of improved webpage effectiveness and greater user engagement with the presented content.

A client device and a web server may be configured to perform respective functions for acquiring clickstream data and processing that data to identify or quantify various user access metrics. For example a web server may identify a particular user that has accessed one or more hosted webpages in the past. The web server may also record a timestamp when the user begins accessing a first webpage and record analogous timestamps for other webpages that the user accesses during their visit.

The client device may provide data indicating the number or specific identity of elements rendered on the client device for a given webpage before the user advanced to a next webpage and so on. In this way access times rendered content information or other webpage access i.e. viewing characteristics may be acquired for a particular user by way of the corresponding clickstream data. These and other operations may be performed so as to accumulate user access metrics corresponding to one user many users one or many webpage access sequences and so forth.

Webpages having particular element counts or placements limited or narrowly tailored content types varying elemental or visual complexities or other characteristics may be generated specifically for a particular user improved for a general audience of users or in view of other criteria or goals. In general user access metrics may be used to generate user interfaces such as webpages based on immediately acquired information heuristic or statistical analysis of accumulated information or in accordance with other methods or schemes.

In turn the client device is in the form of a desktop computer and is configured to access websites or other online material perform various business or technical functions in accordance with software programming and so forth. The client device is depicted as a laptop computer equipped and configured so as to access webpages and to display their respective contents. The respective client devices may have a display or touch sensitive display auditory or haptic resources a keyboard or mouse configuration to present a virtual keyboard and so on used for user input output of information

Specific client devices and their respective resources are cited within a given example for purposes of clarity and generally without limitation. Additionally a system of three client devices is depicted for clarity but other systems having or hosting any respective number of client devices configured to selectively access web based information and content are contemplated.

The client devices are configured to communicate with each other or other entities by way of one or more networks . The one or more networks can include the Internet or access thereto local area networks LANs wide area networks WANs and so on. Wired connections wireless communication or other suitable signaling infrastructure or formats may be used.

Respective web servers and are configured to communicate with the client devices using the one or more networks . The web servers generate and provide respective webpages that are accessible i.e. viewable by the client devices in accordance with selection or access input from the respective users . In one non limiting example the web server is operated by an office supply e commerce retailer and generates webpages related to office consumables furniture equipment and similar merchandise. In another example the web server is operated by an e commerce business and generates webpages corresponding to a broad range of consumer offerings such as books audio video media downloadable audio or video material jewelry crafts and hobby supplies household or kitchen items and so forth.

For purposes of non limiting illustration the web server includes a webpage generation module . The webpage generation module uses webpage data stored within the web server to generate i.e. construct or define webpages having elements that may be rendered and presented to a user . The webpage generation module may include electronic circuitry machine readable program code or other resources or constituency. In turn the webpage data may include but is not limited to digital image files photographic images textual information graphs charts tables of numeric or alphanumeric information and so on.

The webpage generation module may be configured to select elements stored within the webpage data and to position scale place modify coloring or perform other functions such that a corresponding webpage is generated. Such a webpage may then be communicated as encoded information to one or more of the client devices where it is rendered for displayed to the corresponding user .

The webpage generation module may also be configured to generate one or more webpages using the webpage data based upon predefined templates or layouts. For example certain webpages having particular elements and arrangements may be presented repeatedly to a multitude of different users . Thus respective templates may be used in generating such webpages according to established patterns or protocols.

The web server may also include a clickstream module . The clickstream module may be configured to acquire clickstream data descriptive of a user s access to a webpage or sequence of webpages generated by the web server . The clickstream module may include any suitable resources such as for non limiting example electronic circuitry machine readable program code and so forth.

The clickstream module may also be configured to parse or process such clickstream data to derive various user access metrics stored within the web server . The user access metrics may be used to populate one or more data structures reformatted or transposed into different coding schemes and so on. The user access metrics may include times spent by a user viewing respective webpages the number of elements included in those webpages or the respective contents or configurations of the webpages. The user access metrics may also include the client device type or access bandwidth associated with the user information analogous to the foregoing regarding multiple users or many other factors and parameters.

The web server may also include an analysis module configured to perform various analysis of the user access metrics . The analysis module may be configured to perform statistical or heuristic analysis filtering derivation of metadata pattern detection functional curve fitting or other operations using the user access metrics . The analysis module may also be configured to report or provide the results of such operations to the webpage generation module for use in generating one or more webpages modification of existing webpage templates or for other purposes.

As depicted the client devices have rendered and are displaying respective webpages and . Each of the webpages was generated and provided by the web server . The webpage including 12 elements elements while the webpage includes 8 elements and the webpage has 5 elements. The particular elements and their configurations are illustrative and simplified in the interest of clarity. However it is noted that the elements of the webpages and are respective subsets of the elements of the webpage . Further description in this regard is provided below.

For illustrative example the user uses the client device to access the web server seeking information regarding printer ink cartridges. The client device provides data to the web server having user input about a particular brand of printer. The webpage generation module selectively retrieves 12 elements from the webpage data in accordance with the printer brand such as photographic images of different ink cartridges text regarding different ink colors or volumetric capacities or other options and information. The retrieved elements are then used by the webpage generation module to generate the webpage which is provided to the client device where it is rendered for display to the user . Similar operations may be performed resulting in the generation provision and display of the webpage and to the users and respectively.

Clickstream data regarding the amount of time each of the users views accesses the respective webpages the particular elements included thereon the number of those elements rendered for each webpage before a user moves on and so forth may be acquired by the clickstream module . The clickstream module may then be parsed or processed or both in order to derive or quantify respective metrics stored as or with the user access metrics . The user access metrics may be analyzed by the analysis module and the results used by the webpage generation module during the generation of similar webpages user targeted webpages or other webpages on an immediate or future basis.

The respective client devices and web servers may be collectively referred to as computing devices. Most or all of the numerous illustrative actions described herein can be performed by or using any one of the computing devices. That is any particular client device or web server may be configured to acquire clickstream data derive user access metrics generate webpages or user interfaces using the user access metrics and so forth. Additionally the operations or functions described herein may be distributed over or performed by a plurality of different computing devices and the respective efforts of each combined toward an end result.

For example the client device may receive user access metrics from the web server which are then used to generate webpages or other user interfaces for presentation to the user and so on. In another example the web server includes resources so as to generate and render user interfaces using operations normally performed by a web browser of the client device . Other variations or operations may also be performed.

In one example the user is presented with the webpage having 12 elements respectively designated Item 1 Item 2 in order through Item 12. Certain elements such as Item 1 Item 3 and Item 7 are depicted as graphic images while others such as Item 4 and Item 6 are depicted as text blocks. Simplified representational icons are depicted for each Item 1 Item 12 in the interest of clarity but actual rendered presented elements may be any suitable thing such as photographic images text or numeric values verbal or musical audio files and the like.

Continuing with the present example the user then viewed the webpage fully rendered for a total of 11 seconds before access viewing was ended. The user for purposes of the present example judged the webpage to be cluttered and confusing having too many elements for useful comparison or requiring too much time to grasp the overall informational content. The user thereafter ended access to the web server at least for purposes of the present access session. In any case the webpage was presented to the user for a relatively brief period and was abandoned by virtue because of too much elemental content.

In another example the user is presented with the webpage having 8 elements including the same Item 1 Item 8 as presented on the webpage . The user viewed the fully rendered webpage for a total of 60 seconds before ending access. In the present example the user found the webpage to be inclusive of sufficient information and elemental content to make a buying decision. The user then clicked on the element of Item 3 thereby advancing to another webpage specific to Item 3 and ultimately placing an order for the corresponding merchandise e.g. an ink cartridge through the web server .

In yet another example the user is presented with the webpage that includes 5 visible elements namely Item 1 Item 5 as presented on the webpages and . The webpage further includes a hidden code element which is not visible to the user but may be configured to trigger presentation of another element present an animation play an audio file or perform various other actions. Thus the hidden code may be javascript or other machine executable code. The user viewed the fully rendered webpage for a total of 77 seconds before access was ended. In this present example the user spent appreciable time studying the similarities and differences between the Item 1 5 e.g. ink cartridge images and corresponding information . The user then selected Item 2 by mouse clicking input placing an order for the corresponding merchandise.

In the illustrative examples above the users spent different amounts of time viewing the respective webpages . Differing element counts i.e. 12 8 and 5 resulted in considerably varied user impressions suitability to individual purposes and end results sale or no sale of merchandise respectively. Within the context of the foregoing three examples fewer elements within a webpage resulted in greater user satisfaction and engagement.

The clickstream module may acquire clickstream data indicative of each of the webpage access events and process that data so as to populate or add to the user access metrics . For instance the user access metrics may indicate that the user accessed the webpage which included 12 particular elements that such webpage was fully rendered and that access ended 11 seconds after full rendering. Similar user access metrics may also be derived from clickstream data for the users and .

The analysis module may access the user access metrics corresponding to the webpages access events performing statistical operations heuristic functions or comparisons and so on. The analysis module may then provide the results or directives based on those results to the webpage generation module for use in other webpage rendering. For example the analysis module may determine that future webpage generations should not include more than eight elements corresponding to the Items 1 12 and provide a corresponding directive or template to the webpage generation module .

In another example the analysis module may identify that the user placed an order during 75 of all previous webpage access events that included six or fewer elements. The analysis module may then direct the webpage generation module to the effect that future webpages provided to the user are limited to six or fewer elements. Any number of other operations stemming from the user access metrics can also be performed.

Various illustrative webpages have been depicted and described thus far. However the apparatus and methods described herein may also be applied in the context of other types of user interface. For example the user may navigate through a particular sequence of user interfaces related to controlling a process within a manufacturing context. Control related user interfaces may include process variable displays user adjustable setpoint or alarm threshold controls and so forth.

User access metrics may be derived from clickstream data corresponding to these respective user interfaces. Analysis of such user access metrics may indicate that process errors occur more frequently when user interfaces having 8 or more visual elements are generated and presented. Thus the underlying process runs better and product quality is improved if control related user interfaces having 7 or fewer visual elements are generated.

The webpage includes illustrative content . As depicted the content includes 13 distinct elements including a promotional statement and links to 12 different categories of merchandise. From one perspective the content may define a landing page for an e commerce online shopping venue of the web server . The user spends a total of 12 seconds i.e. 0 12 accessing or viewing the content after which time the user clicks on the Audio Systems link and advanced to the webpage .

Clickstream data related to the user access to the webpage may be acquired by the clickstream module and processed to derive corresponding metrics to be added to stored with the user access metrics . In the present example such user access metrics may now include the user identity the particular webpage the element count of 13 of the content the user viewing access time of 12 seconds or other metrics or information. The clickstream data and corresponding metrics may be provided immediately to the webpage generation module or stored for later use and so on.

The webpage includes illustrative content . The content includes a promotional statement and 3 photographic images with links to 3 different sub categories of audio electronics merchandise which were rendered in 4 seconds while the user remained at the webpage . However the user then clicked on the Compact audio systems link and advanced to the webpage . As a result a sales promotion element which was configured to be included in the content was not rendered before the user left the webpage .

Clickstream data descriptive of the webpage access event may be acquired by the clickstream module and processed such that corresponding metrics are added to the user access metrics . In the present example such user access metrics may now include the user identity the particular webpage the rendered element count of 5 of the content indication of the un rendered element the user access time of 4 seconds or other metrics. In this example the clickstream data and corresponding metrics are provided immediately to the webpage generation module as a result of the un rendered sales promotion element .

The webpage includes illustrative content . The content includes a merchandise label a photographic image of a particular compact audio system and promotional information regarding the particular merchandise. Additionally the sales promotion element was included moved forward and fully rendered as part of the content . The user remained to view the content for a total of 1 minute and 6 seconds i.e. 1 06 and then presumably satisfied with the information obtained through the elements ended access to exited from the web server .

Clickstream data descriptive of the webpage access event may be acquired by the clickstream module and processed so that corresponding metrics are added to the user access metrics . Thus such user access metrics may now include the user identity the particular webpage a rendered element count of 4 of the content verification of the rendered element the user access time of 1 minutes and 6 seconds or possibly other data or information.

The clickstream is illustrative of a hypothetical pathway taken by the user through a progressive sequence of webpages in an e commerce or online shopping venue. In a first instance the user spent sufficient time at the webpage to consider the content before making a selection and moving on. Thereafter the user quickly identified the subject matter of interest on the webpage and advanced to the webpage before all of the intended content could be fully rendered i.e. presented or actuated .

In response the un rendered element was detected in the clickstream data by the clickstream module which directed the webpage generation module to include that element in the content of the webpage . Thus the webpage generation was effectively modified in real time or on the fly so as to include material intended but not presented earlier in the clickstream . The sales promotional element was thus included in the content where the user spent adequate time to view and consider that information.

Clickstream data and the various user access metrics derived therefrom can be used immediately upon acquisition and processing as well as later during a subsequent visit by the same user accumulated to derive statistical information from a growing population of data and so on. For example if numerous other users access the webpage and move on quickly without seeing some of the intended elements the analysis module may cause the webpage generation module to redesign the content with sales promotion or other elements slated for inclusion on other webpages . In this way webpage content may be more effectively tailored to user habits interests or purposes.

In another example a data structure may include user access metrics corresponding to just a single user . In yet another example a data structure may include user access metrics pertaining to multiple users accessing multiple different web servers . Other data structures inclusive of other user access metrics or derived from different sources may also be used.

The data structure includes a webpage column . The webpage column includes webpage identifiers or names for 15 different webpages e.g. or corresponding templates as used by a web server e.g. . As depicted the webpage column includes a Landing Page webpage identifier a Department 1 webpage identifier and so on. The data structure also includes an element count column which includes counts numbers of elements e.g. included by design in the respective webpages. As depicted the Landing Page webpage includes 13 elements the Department 1 Page includes 5 elements and so on.

The data structure includes an average time column . The average time column includes cumulative average user access times for the respective webpages. As depicted the Landing Page webpage has an average user access time of 12 seconds 0 12 the Department 1 webpage has an average user access time of 7 seconds 0 07 and so on. In the depicted example each average user access time is calculated as the statistical average mean for a respective number of different users e.g. accessing the corresponding webpage varying numbers of times. However other access time related values or data can also be used or calculated using different functions heuristic methods filtering schemes and so forth. For example time related values such as data set minimums or maximums medians modes and so on may be used.

Thus the data structure is arranged as 15 respective rows wherein each row includes user access metrics for a respective predefined webpage as hosted by a web server e.g. . The illustrative user access metrics of the data structure are subject to change with time as they are derived at least in part by statistical averaging. Also additional webpages may be added existing webpages may be deleted element counts may change and so on. Thus respective data structures may include fixed data variable data a combination of fixed and variable data and so forth in accordance with the particular user access metrics used to populate a particular data structure.

Further depicted are user specific access metrics corresponding to the webpage identified as Specific Item 9 . The user specific access metrics are illustrative and non limiting in nature and depict the sort of granularity or resolution that may be achieved through analysis of clickstream data and stored as a part of the user access metrics . Therefore other user specific access metrics having other particular data types or degrees of precision can also be used.

The user specific access metrics include respective identifiers for a plurality of different users actual access times for different visits and numbers of elements rendered during each of the visits. For example the user has accessed the Specific Item 9 webpage at least 3 times spending 1 minute 45 seconds on the first access 1 minute 36 seconds on the second access and 4 seconds on the third access. Furthermore all 5 of the intended elements were rendered during the first and second accesses but only 4 of the 5 total elements were rendered on the third access. Similar data are also depicted for respective accesses by the users and .

For instance the user specific access metrics may indicate or be interpreted that the user had considerable interest in the content of the Specific Item 9 during the first 2 access but much less interest during the third access which may have been made in error while trying to find a different webpage for instance. In response an analysis module e.g. may be configured to disregard the 4 seconds access time value for the third access by the user when calculating the average user access time for the Specific Item 9 webpage. Other suitable operations may also be performed.

The data structure illustrates just one of any number of such data structures that may be constructed or populated using the granular user access metrics and then stored therewith. Such data structures may also be provided to the webpage generation module for use in generating webpages or modifying the generation of predefined webpages and so on.

The histogram includes 14 respective element counts and their corresponding user webpage access times. For example the user accessed a webpage having 1 element for just over 40 seconds and accessed another webpage having 4 elements for about 65 seconds. An increasing user engagement range spans the first 5 element count values wherein a general trend is evident the user spent increasing amounts of time accessing viewing each respective webpage as the number of elements increased from 1 to 5. For purposes of example it is interpreted that the user interest level or engagement corresponds directly to time spent accessing a given webpage. Thus as depicted by the histogram user engagement peaked at 5 elements with an access time of about 77 seconds. This assumption is designed as peak user engagement .

A decreasing user engagement range spans the next 4 element count values where another general trend is depicted the user spent decreasing amounts of time accessing each respective webpage as the number of elements increased from 6 to 9. For purposes of the present example it is interpreted that each successive increase in the number of elements leads to greater confusion on the part of the user . That is it became increasingly difficult for the user to meaningfully evaluate the merits of each element or derive comparative conclusions between different elements as the overall count increased. In short webpages having increasing numbers of elements become less useful to the user beyond a certain point i.e. 5 elements .

A user overwhelmed range spans the remaining 5 element counts wherein the general trend depicted by the adjacent range rapidly accelerates. Namely the user spent less and less time accessing each webpage as the respective element counts increases. In the case of element counts 12 13 and 14 the respective user access times were of such brevity as to conclude that little if any useful information or utility was conveyed. In a more extreme instance the user may even opt to exit move on from a particular webpage before all of the elements are fully rendered. In such an extreme case the given webpage has essentially failed in its informational or other primary purpose and should be redesigned having a reduced element count in order to be effective for the particular user .

User access metrics that are specific to a particular user may be analyzed to determine a element number of peak effectiveness i.e. optimized for that user in the foregoing example the peak user engagement . Thereafter the analysis module may be configured to instruct the webpage generation module to preferentially generate respective webpages e.g. having 5 elements whenever the user accesses the web server . In another example such a user specific peak effectiveness number may be used only when certain types of information or elements being presented such as hand tools or articles of clothing in an online shopping venue. The principles illustrated in the histogram may be analogously applied to user access metrics spanning a multitude of different users e.g. averaged or filtered data and so on.

The I O interface s may couple to one or more I O devices . The I O devices may include input devices such as one or more of a keyboard mouse and so forth. The I O devices may also include output devices such as one or more of a display audio speakers haptic output devices and so forth. In some embodiments the I O devices may be physically incorporated with the computing device or may be externally placed.

The computing device may also include one or more communication interfaces . The communication interfaces are configured to provide communications between the computing device and other computing devices routers access points client devices servers and so forth. The communication interfaces may include devices configured to couple to one or more networks including PANs LANs WLANs WANs and so forth. The computing device may also include one or more busses or other internal communications hardware or software that allow for the transfer of data between the various modules and components of the web server .

As shown in the computing device includes one or more memories . The memory comprises one or more CRSM. The memory provides storage of computer readable instructions data structures program modules and other data for the operation of the computing device .

The memory may include at least one operating system OS module . The OS module is configured to manage hardware resource devices such as the I O interfaces the I O devices the communication interfaces and provide various services to applications or modules executing on the processors . Also stored in the memory may be one or more of the following modules. These modules may be executed as foreground applications background tasks daemons and so forth.

A user interface module may be configured to provide one or more application programming interfaces. The user interface module may also provide data to the client devices that is configured to open or retrieve files enable the rendering of webpages or their contents or as needed for other operations such as hypertext markup language HTML files. The user interface module is configured to accept inputs and send outputs using the I O interfaces the communication interfaces or both.

A communication module is configured to support communication with the client devices other client devices or entities routers and so forth using the one or more networks . In some implementations the communication module may support encrypted communications. For example hypertext transport protocol secured HTTPS or transport layer security TLS may be supported.

The memory may also include one or more application modules . The application modules may be configured or modified and selectively provided to other computing devices to the client devices and so on. Thus various devices can be updated or enhanced as new application modules are generated existing application modules are amended or improved and so on.

The webpage generation module may also be stored within the memory . The webpage generation module is configured to generate one or more of the respective webpages or other user interfaces using the webpage data . The webpage generation module may generate such webpages in accordance with directives or data provided by the analysis module using predefined webpages layouts or templates and so on.

The memory may also store the clickstream module . The clickstream module is configured to parse process or otherwise evaluate clickstream e.g. data so as to identify or derive the various user access metrics . The clickstream module is also configured to construct or populate one or more data structures e.g. using some or all of the user access metrics . The memory may further store the analysis module . The analysis module is configured to analyze the user access metrics using statistical heuristic filtering pattern recognition or other methods. The analysis module is also configured to provide corresponding results of such analysis to the webpage generation module store resulting data or metadata with the user access metrics and so on. The memory may also include other modules respectively configured to perform other functions of the computing device .

The memory may also include a datastore to store data and information. The datastore may use a flat file database linked list tree executable code or other data structure to store the information. In some implementations the datastore or a portion of the datastore may be distributed across one or more other devices including servers network attached storage devices and so forth.

As depicted the datastore may store one or more of the webpage data the user access metrics or any combination of these as previously described. The datastore may also store clickstream data as acquired in whole or in part by operation of the clickstream module . Clickstream data may also be provided by one or more of the client devices .

For example the user may login or otherwise initiate access to the web server providing a unique user identity code in the process. This identity code can be stored in the clickstream data along with other data or values received or detected as part of a distinct webpage access sequence of the user . The clickstream data can then be processed by the clickstream module immediately at some future time and so on so as to supplement the user access metrics . Other data may also be stored in the datastore . For example the other data may include client device communicational bandwidth values characteristics or limitations of the respective client device account information encryption keys and so forth.

Block identifies a user . For purposes of example the user begins an online shopping session by accessing the web server . The clickstream module acquires an identifier for the user such as an Internet Protocol IP address login name or other distinct number or token. Additionally the user initially accesses the landing page and the content thereof is rendered and presented using the client device . The user then clicks on an audio systems link indicating his intent to advance to webpage having that type of content next.

Block analyzes user access metrics corresponding to the user . In the present example the analysis module of the web server accesses the user access metrics retrieving user specific access metrics previously stored therein with respect to the user . The analysis module may now analyze the corresponding user specific access metrics to determine user access habits identify likely interest areas access times correlated to element counts and so forth. In a case where few or no user access metrics exist yet for a particular user the analysis module may resort to predefined default values. In another example such default values are statistically evolving as additional clickstream data is acquired and analyzed.

Block determines a peak number of elements to be presented to the user . In the present example the analysis module reviews the user specific access metrics and determines that peak user engagement e.g. or greatest likely viewing time should occur if not more than 5 elements are presented to the user in a webpage having audio equipment or related elemental content.

Block generates a user specific webpage having the peak number of elements. In the present example the analysis module directs the webpage generation module to generate the webpage having not more than 5 elements for the user . The webpage generation module then accesses the webpage data retrieving textual information digital photographs or other elements so as to generate the webpage . It is noted that the sales promotion element is included in the generated webpage in accordance with the element count directive.

Block provides the user specific webpage to the user . In the present example web server provides the user specific webpage having 5 elements total to the client device . The client device then fully renders the webpage for the user wherein all of the content is presented and viewable. The user then considers the respective elements of the webpage including the sales promotion element which is clicked on so as to advance navigate to another webpage having particular information regarding the sale.

In the immediate foregoing example a user specific e.g. custom webpage was generated for a particular user based on prior user access metrics . The webpage may be generated and provided in an essentially immediate or on demand timeframe with very little if any perceptible delay from the perspective of the user . Thus webpages having specific element e.g. counts selected elements or other characteristics may be constructed and provided with an expectancy of peak value or interest to the particular recipient.

Block determines average times that users e.g. spent at various webpages using clickstream data . For example the clickstream module accesses previously stored clickstream data and calculates average times that a plurality of different users e.g. spent viewing accessing respectively different webpages . The average times thus calculated may be used to populate the data structure .

Block correlates the average times with webpage element counts . In the present example the clickstream module uses the clickstream data to correlate or match up counts i.e. numbers of elements with the average times for those respective webpages . Thus each webpage has a corresponding element count and an average access or viewing time . The element counts may be used to populate the data structure . As depicted the Specific Item 1 webpage has a element count of 4 and an average access time of 1 minute 6 seconds i.e. 1 06 .

Block determines most likely access times for respective element counts . In the present example the analysis module may access the data structure and analyze the element counts against the average times so as to determine most likely i.e. expected or anticipated access times for an average user for webpages having respective element counts.

For instance the analysis module may analyze the data structure and determine that respective webpages having 4 elements range in average time from 14 seconds i.e. 0 14 to 2 minutes 9 seconds i.e. 2 09 . The analysis module may also for further illustration disregard the extremes 0 14 and 2 09 and calculate an overall average of 1 minute 20 seconds i.e. 1 20 for a hypothetical webpage having 4 elements. Similar operations may also be performed with respect to other webpages having other respective element counts

Block stores the most likely access times with the user access metrics for corresponding webpages . In the present example the analysis module matches correlates each of the respective most likely access times with a webpage or webpages having the corresponding number of elements. The analysis module then stores the most likely access times and the corresponding webpage associations as a part of the user access metrics .

The user access metrics now include respective pre calculated most likely time values that may be used in determining the number of elements to be included when generating a webpage e.g. at some later time. For example a new user may access the web server seeking information regarding a particular item of merchandise. The clickstream module determines the new user status of this visitor and informs the analysis module accordingly. In such a case no prior user access metrics for the new user are available to aid in generating a user specific webpage. However existing user access metrics indicate that the average user accesses views visual content corresponding to that merchandise item for 1 minute 37 seconds i.e. 1 37 .

The analysis module responds by applying the most likely access times data in a somewhat reciprocal manner the average access time of 1 37 is matched as closely as possible to the pre calculated most likely access times values. The analysis module thus determines that 5 elements is the corresponding count for the closest most likely access time value e.g. 1 35 . The analysis module then directs the webpage generation module to generate a user specific webpage e.g. for the new user including 5 elements related to the merchandise of interest.

Block identifies a user . For purposes of example the user accesses the web server . The clickstream module acquires an identifier for the user such as an Internet Protocol IP address login name or other information.

Block determines times spent by the user at respective webpages using clickstream data. In the present example the user accesses the webpages and in that order spending 12 seconds 4 seconds and 1 minute 6 seconds respectively accessing these webpages. The clickstream thus corresponds to the webpage access sequence taken by the user . The clickstream module determines detects or acquires the respective access times illustrated above and stores these with the clickstream data .

Block correlates times spent with numbers of elements on the webpages . In the present example the clickstream module correlates the respective times of 0 12 0 04 and 1 06 with element counts of 13 4 and 4 respectively for the user clickstream . These respective user specific access metrics may then be stored with or as the user access metrics .

Block determines particular elements to be presented to the user . In the present example clickstream module informs the analysis module that the user has clicked upon the sales promotion element which was included on the webpage . The analysis module accesses the webpage data and the user access metrics and identifies information regarding 2 particular items of merchandise that are presently on sale. Specifically a pair of stereo headphones and a pair of compact speakers which have not yet been presented to the user . Both of these merchandise items are related to the content of the webpage . The analysis module then flags or otherwise keeps track of these 2 merchandise items as the flow diagram proceeds.

Block estimates the time the user will spend at a user specific webpage. The analysis module now accesses the user access metrics and determines calculates using newly acquired and past access metrics how long the user is likely to spend accessing a webpage provided specifically for him. For instance the analysis module may use pre calculated most likely access time values analogous to those calculated above in the flow diagram . Using these resources the analysis module determines that the user is most likely to spend 1 minute 33 seconds i.e. 1 33 viewing a sale promotional webpage yet to be generated.

Block determines a total number of visual elements to be presented to the user . In the present example the analysis module uses the most likely access time of 1 33 against the user access metrics to determine that 4 elements is a closest match to existing user metrics. The analysis module then directs the webpage generation module to generate a webpage including 4 elements total and including element related to the 2 merchandise items determined in block .

Block generates a user specific webpage including particular visual elements and having the total number of elements. In the present example the webpage generation module accesses the webpage data and retrieves 4 elements respective digital photographs of the stereo headphone and compact speakers and respective blocks of textual information describing the stereo headphones and the compact speakers. The webpage generation module uses these 4 specific elements to generate a user specific webpage e.g. .

Block provides the user specific webpage to the user . In the present example the web server provides communicates the user specific webpage e.g. to the client device using the one or more networks . The client device renders the user specific webpage for viewing by the user . Thus previously acquired or processed user access metrics may be used with newly acquired clickstream data in order to generate a user specific webpage having an optimized number of elements specifically selected for a particular user.

The process of the flow diagram is generally directed to generating a webpage specific i.e. targeted to a particular i.e. individual user. However it is also contemplated that plural different users may have interests goals or other characteristics in common that are relevant to generating respective webpages. Thus the process of the flow diagram or other processes or methods described herein may be used to generate and provide webpages having particular elements element counts and so on to a plurality of such users.

For example the users may all be members of a particular athletics club. The web server may be configured to generate webpages that are provided to such members. Accordingly corresponding user access metrics may be used to generate targeted webpages to be provided presented to the users when they respectively access the web server seeking information or services regarding the athletics club. Such targeted webpages may draw upon idealized element counts anticipated access times and so forth.
