The invention relates in general to electrically fired ammunition and in particular to igniters for electrically fired ammunition.

Electrically fired ammunition may use an electrical current to ignite a primer and the primer may then ignite the main propellant charge in the round of ammunition. Electrically tired ammunition may be stored and transported in packaging containers that help prevent the ammunition from undesirably initiating in the presence of electromagnetic fields EMFs . When the ammunition is outside of the packaging containers there are restrictions on handling the ammunition in the presence of certain EMFs. Tests have shown that some radio generated EMFs may initiate the ammunition causing adverse consequences. This problem has existed for many years but recent research has more precisely recognized the cause of the problem.

The increase in radio technology used in military operations generates a higher risk of unintended initiation during routine loading and handling of electrically fired ammunition. In the past the ammunition was either packaged in metal cans or sealed in ammunition storage compartments to protect the ammunition from EMF initiation. Unfortunately neither of these options lessens the risk during loading and handling operations when the ammunition is not in the cans or storage compartments. One available technology to address the problem is grounding tabs. However the grounding tabs must be removed before the ammunition can be fired. Grounding tabs can be inadequate and unacceptable because of the potential of a misfire caused by failure to remove the grounding tabs. Many concepts have been tested but none appear to be able to withstand the extreme pressure of the ballistic cycle of a cannon gun system while also providing EMF protection. The ballistic pressure may be on the order of 100 000 psi.

A need exists for an igniter for electrically fired ammunition that is hardened against EMF and able to survive the ballistic cycle in a gun cannon environment. The EMF hardened igniter should not degrade the performance of the ammunition nor require changes in ammunition handling and operational procedures.

One aspect of the invention is a novel igniter for electrically fired ammunition. The igniter includes a central electrode a dielectric a conductive body at least one hot wire an ignition mixture and a cup. The central electrode has an input end an output end and an outer surface. The dielectric surrounds the central electrode and has an outer surface and an inner surface. The dielectric inner surface is contiguous to the outer surface of the central electrode. The outer surface of the central electrode and the inner surface of the dielectric are fixed to each other by at least one mechanical lock. The conductive body surrounds the dielectric and has an inner surface that is contiguous to the outer surface of the dielectric. The inner surface of the conductive body and the outer surface of the dielectric are fixed to each other by at least one mechanical lock.

The at least one hot wire is fixed at one end to the output end of the central electrode and at another end to the conductive body. The ignition mixture in contact with a majority of surface area of the at least one hot wire. The cup surrounds and contains the ignition mixture. The cup has an inner surface that is contiguous to the ignition mix. The cup is fixed to the conductive body.

The central electrode may have a generally cylindrical shape. The dielectric may have a generally hollow cylindrical shape. The conductive body may have a generally hollow cylindrical shape.

The at least one hot wire may be parallel to a plane that contains the output end of the central electrode.

The dielectric may include an output end and the conductive body may include an output end. The hot wire may be in contact with the output end of the central electrode the output end of the dielectric and the output end of the conductive body.

The cup may include a bottom and a side. The bottom may be parallel to the plane that contains the output end of the central electrode. The cup may be fixed to the conductive body by welding the side of the cup to the conductive body.

The hot wire may be welded to the output end of the central electrode and the output end of the conductive body.

The at least one mechanical lock that fixes the outer surface of the central electrode and the inner surface of the dielectric may include protrusions on the inner surface of the dielectric and corresponding mating circumferential channels in the outer surface of the central electrode.

The at least one mechanical lock that fixes the outer surface of the dielectric and the inner surface of the conductive body may include a stepped down portion on the inner surface of the conductive body and a corresponding mating stepped up portion on the outer surface of the dielectric.

Another aspect of the invention is a novel primer head assembly. The primer head assembly includes a primer housing and an igniter disposed in the primer housing.

In another aspect of the invention a novel electric primer includes a primer head assembly and a primer body assembly fixed to the primer head assembly.

In a further aspect of the invention a novel electrically fired munition includes a case with a base an electric primer disposed in the base and propellant disposed in the case.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel EMF hardened igniter may be used with a range of electrically fired ammunition calibers for example from about 20 40 mm to about 105 155 mm. EMF hardened means the igniter can withstand a higher EMF environment without igniting the ignition mix in the igniter.

One important feature of the igniter is a heat sink that transfers heat induced by EMFs away from the hot wire in the igniter. Other important features of the igniter are the mechanical connections between the components of the igniter. The mechanical connections remain intact under very high pressure for example 100 000 psi. The self contained hermetic seal of the igniter is an important feature also. The interior of the igniter is sealed independently of the munition in which the igniter may be used.

Axial translation of central electrode with respect to dielectric is prevented by a mechanical lock s formed on one or both of outer surface of central electrode and inner surface of dielectric . The mechanical locks also provide a high pressure gas seal between central electrode and dielectric . In the embodiment shown the mechanical locks are protrusions formed on dielectric and corresponding mating circumferential channels formed in central electrode . Protrusions and channels are an example of a suitable mechanical lock. Other types of mechanical locks may be used to prevent axial translation of central electrode with respect to dielectric . Some other examples of mechanical locks for outer surface and inner surface include notches of various shapes stepped features scoring knurling etc.

An electrically conductive body surrounds dielectric . Conductive body may have the general shape of a hollow cylinder. Conductive body has an inner surface that is contiguous to outer surface of dielectric . Axial translation of conductive body with respect to dielectric is prevented by a mechanical lock s formed on one or both of outer surface of dielectric and inner surface of conductive body . The mechanical locks also provide a high pressure gas seal between conductive body and dielectric .

In the embodiment shown the mechanical lock is a stepped down less radial thickness portion on conductive body and a corresponding mating stepped up more radial thickness portion on dielectric . During operation of igniter high pressure gas acts on igniter with the force vector of the high pressure gas pointing to the left in the orientation of igniter shown in the Figures. Thus stepped up portion is pressed into body . Stepped down portion and stepped up portion is an example of a suitable mechanical lock. Other types of mechanical locks may be used to prevent axial translation of conductive body with respect to dielectric . Some other examples of mechanical locks for outer surface of dielectric and inner surface of conductive body include notches of various shapes stepped features scoring knurling etc.

At least one hot wire is fixed at one end to output end of central electrode and at another end to conductive body . An ignition mixture is disposed such that it is in contact with a majority of the surface area of hot wire . Ignition mixture must maintain intimate contact with hot wire . A cup surrounds and contains ignition mixture . Cup has an inner surface that is contiguous to ignition mix . Cup is fixed to conductive body by for example welding the side of cup to an outer surface of conductive body . Ignition mixture may be for example pressed into cup .

Some ignition mixtures used in the past include for example lead thiocyanate or zirconium potassium chlorate ZPC having an auto ignition temperature in a range of about 190 degrees C. to about 210 degrees C. An ignition mixture with a higher auto ignition temperature can be helpful in hardening igniter against EMF. In one embodiment ignition mixture may be zirconium potassium perchlorate ZPP . ZPP may have an auto ignition temperature of around 350 degrees C. Another advantage of using ZPP is the elimination of environmentally hazardous lead from the ignition mixture.

In operation hot wire is desirably heated when a firing pulse is delivered from the firing pin of a cannon or gun through central electrode . But when a firing pulse is not delivered from a firing pin hot wire may nevertheless be undesirably heated by local EMFs. Conductive body dielectric and central electrode function as a heat sink to transfer heat away from hot wire . Preferably hot wire is a linear wire that is parallel to a plane that contains output end of central electrode . Dielectric includes an output end and conductive body includes an output end . Hot wire is preferably in contact with output end of central electrode output end of dielectric and output end of conductive body .

Hot wire may take several forms. As shown in hot wire may be a single wire that is welded to at least both central electrode and at each end to conductive body . is a schematic top view of igniter with cup and ignition mixture removed showing one alternative arrangement of a hot wire . Hot wire has one end welded to central electrode and another end welded to conductive body . Additional hot wires may be added similar to the appearance of spokes on a wheel. In general the greater the combined length of all the hot wire s in igniter the less sensitive is igniter to EMF.

Preferably an exterior surface of the bottom of cup includes a cruciform not shown formed thereon for uniform rupture and ignition.

In the embodiment of igniter shown in the Figures central electrode optionally includes an extended portion that extends beyond dielectric and conductive body . Extended portion is useful when installing igniter in primer housing of . While shown as being generally cylindrical extended portion may also include for example a head or widened area formed on its free end to facilitate a larger contact area.

Referring to primer housing includes a through bore having one portion sized for a close tolerance fit with cup and a second portion sized for a clearance fit with extended portion of central electrode . A dielectric or insulating material for example plastic glass or ceramic may be inserted between extended portion and second portion . Side of cup forms a metal to metal seal with portion especially when high pressure gas from the main propellant impinges on respective output ends and of central electrode dielectric and conductive body . In addition an aft end of conductive body see also forms a metal to metal seal with housing where through bore transitions or steps down in diameter from portion to portion . Primer housing may include a crimping ring to further seal igniter in primer housing . Other means to secure igniter in primer housing include for example retaining sleeves or rings with or without a shoulder in primer housing welding press fit adhesives etc.

Igniter may be press fit in sleeve such that side of cup forms a metal to metal seal with the interior of sleeve especially when high pressure gas from the main propellant impinges on respective output ends and of central electrode dielectric and conductive body . In addition an aft end of conductive body see also forms a metal to metal seal with housing where through bore transitions or steps down in diameter from the portion of housing that contains sleeve to the portion of housing that contains extended portion of central electrode .

An igniter was constructed with central electrode made of nickel alloy dielectric made of Corning Glass No. 9013 and conductive body made of 304L stainless steel. Hot wire was made of Nichrome with a diameter of 2.25 mils and a resistance of 173.0 ohms foot. Hot wire was welded to central electrode and conductive body . Ignition mixture was made of zirconium potassium perchlorate ZPP comprising zirconium 52 potassium perchlorate 42 graphite 1 and Viton 5 . Cup was made of 304L stainless steel with a cruciform on its top surface for uniform rupture and ignition. Cup was TIG welded to conductive body to provide a hermitic seal and structural integrity.

The igniter survived a ballistic test at 6900 bars 100 ksi . The amounts of electromagnetic field intensity required to exceed the no fire energy threshold of a prior art igniter and igniter were compared. The tests were conducted at worst case conditions wherein the EMF transmitter was tuned to the natural frequency with a metal object touching the central electrode. The prior art igniter required about 1 mW cmto exceed the no fire energy threshold while igniter required about 24.4 mW cm. Igniter displayed a very notable twenty four fold improvement in the EMF threshold. Igniter may be adapted to function on all electrically fired ammunition to thereby render the ammunition EMF hardened. The function time of igniter was about 2 ms faster than the prior art igniter. Igniter is hermetically sealed but the prior art igniter relies on the cartridge environment for sealing.
