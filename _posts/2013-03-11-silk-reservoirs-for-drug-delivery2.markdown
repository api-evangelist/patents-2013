This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of the U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 613 185 filed Mar. 20 2012 the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to silk compositions for sustained delivery of molecules such as therapeutic agent s as well as methods of making and using the same. The disclosed compositions and methods can be used for administering therapeutic agents requiring repeat or frequent administration.

The effectiveness of therapeutic agents in general is limited by patient compliance. At times patient compliance is hindered by treatments that are inconvenient or cause patient discomfort. Importantly certain therapeutic agents have deleterious effects if the plasma concentration thereof falls below a minimum concentration. Although some sustained release formulations are available which increase patient compliance the majority employ poly lactic co glycolic acid PLGA which requires hazardous organic solvents and high temperature for processing thereof. Not only are such organic solvents environmentally undesirable but residual amounts thereof may be present in the end product. Furthermore hydrolytic degradation byproducts of PLGA polymers are acids which may cause inflammation and degradation of the active ingredient. Thus there is a need for improved pharmaceutical compositions lacking potentially inflammatory degradation byproducts that provide sustained delivery of therapeutic agent s which are manufactured in a manner that minimizes the use of hazardous organic solvents.

The present disclosure provides silk based drug delivery compositions that provide sustained delivery of therapeutic agent s . In addition to fostering patient compliance such silk based drug delivery composition exhibit excellent biocompatibility and non inflammatory degradation products such as peptides and amino acids. Therefore potential use of silk in sustained release pharmaceutical formulations as a carrier could minimize immune response and enhance stability of an active ingredient as compared to other polymeric formulations with acidic degradation byproducts e.g. PLGA . Silk compositions can be processed in completely aqueous based solvents. Accordingly such silk based drug delivery compositions avoid the use of hazardous organic solvents that are used in the preparation of PLGA based sustained release formulations. Generally the silk based drug delivery composition described herein comprises a therapeutic agent encapsulated in a substantially silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir comprising silk fibroin wherein the ends of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir are closed to form a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. Further the silk based drug delivery composition is capable of sustained delivery of the therapeutic agent in vivo.

In one aspect the present disclosure provides a method for preparing a silk based drug delivery composition for delivery of a therapeutic agent. The method comprises forming a silk tube from silk fibroin loading the silk tube with a therapeutic agent closing the silk tube ends such that the therapeutic agent is sealed therein. The closed tube ends can be coated with a polymer solution such as a silk solution to form a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

Without limitaitons any method known to one of skill in the art can be used to form the silk tube. In some embodiments the silk tube for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir is made by gel spinning. In gel spinning a silk fibroin solution is delivered over a rotating mandrel which is simultaneously reciprocated horizontally. The silk fibroin forms a coating on the mandrel. This process can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain a desired number of coating layers or wall thickness for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

In some embodiments the silk tube for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir is made by a novel and non obvious modification of the gel spinning technique termed filk spinning herein. In film spinning a silk fibroin solution is delivered over a rotating mandrel which is simultaneously reciprocated horizontally. The silk fibroin forms a coating on the mandrel and the silk coating is treated with heat while the mandrel is spinning. This process can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain a desired number of coating layers or wall thickness for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

In some embodiments the silk tube for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir is made dip coating. In dip coating a rod of a selected diameter is contacted with i.e. dipped into a solution of silk fibroin thereby forming a coating on the rod. The coating is then dried and removed from the rod whereby a tube of tubukar composition comprising the silk fibroin is prepared. The coating process can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain a desired number of coating layers of wall thickness for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

Provided herein is also a silk based drug delivery composition prepared using the aforementioned methods.

In another aspect provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition comprises a silk based drug delivery composition described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

The disclosure also provides kits comprising a silk based drug delivery composition and instructions for use.

In yet another aspect provided herein is a method for sustained delivery in vivo of a therapeutic agent. The method comprises administering a silk based drug delivery composition described herein to a subject. For administering to a patient the silk based drug delivery composition can be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. The therapeutic agent can be delivered in a therapeutically effective amount over a period of time.

In still another aspect provided herein is a method for treating schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder in a subject. The method comprises administering a silk based drug delivery composition described herein to a subject in need thereof. For treatment of schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder the therapeutic agent can be 2 4 3 2 trifluoromethyl 10H phenothiazin 10 yl propyl piperazin 1 yl ethanol fluphenazine . Fluphenazine can be delivered in a therapeutically effective amount over a period of time.

In yet still another embodiment provided herein is a method for treating Alzheimer s disease in a subject. The method comprises administering a silk based drug delivery composition described herein to a subject in need thereof. For treatment of Alzheimer s disease the therapeutic agent can be 3 5 dimethyltricyclo 3.3.1.1 decan 1 amine 3 5 dimethyladamantan 1 amine or memantine . Memantine can be delivered in a therapeutically effective amount over a period of time.

In yet another aspect provided herein is a method for preparing a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir from silk fibroin. The method comprises delivering silk fibroin solution over a mandrel which is simultaneously reciprocated horizontally while being rotated along its axis to form a silk coating thereon. The silk coating is treated with heat while the mandrel is rotating to form a silk film. Optionally the delivery and heat treatment steps can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain desired number of coating layers wall thickness or other desired property. When more than one coating is applied thickness of all coatings can be the same all different or any combinations thereof. Further thickness of two neighboring coatings can be the same or different.

In one aspect described herein is a silk based drug delivery composition and method for preparing the same. The silk based drug delivery composition comprises a therapeutic agent encapsulated in a silk fibroin based tube comprising silk fibroin wherein the ends of the silk tube are closed sealed to form a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. The drug delivery composition allows for the controlled or sustained release of therapeutic agents in vivo.

One of skill in the art would recognize that the in some embodiments the drug delivery composition i.e. the silk fibroin based tube with the closed ends can be considered a capsule like composition wherein the capsule is made from silk fibroin and the at least a part of the amount of the therapeutic agent is present in the lumen of the film spun silk tube. Accordingly in some embodiments at least 5 e.g. at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 98 of the therapeutic agent is present in the lumen of the film spun silk tube. In some embodiments the entire amount of the therapeutic agent is present in the lumen of the drug delivery composition. Without limitations the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can have a cross section. For example cross section of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can be for example without limitation round substantially round oval substantially oval elliptical substantially elliptical triangular substantially triangular square substantially square hexagonal substantially hexagonal or the like. In some embodiments at least a part of the amount of therapeutic agent is present in the wall of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

In some embodiments a second therapeutic agent can be dispersed within the wall of silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. The second therapeutic agent can be present in any form suitable for a particular method to be used for encapsulation and or dispersion. For example the second therapeutic agent can be in the form of a solid liquid or gel. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent can be in the form of a powder or a pellet. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent can be dispersed or encapsulated in a silk solution before forming the silk tube. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent can be dispersed or encapsulated in a silk solution or silk tube after forming the silk tube. For example the therapeutic agent can be dispersed homogeneously or heterogeneously within the silk tube wall e.g. by pre loading or post loading silk fibroin solution e.g. as described in the U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 545 786 the International Application No. WO 2011 109691 and U.S. Pat. No. 8 178 656 or dispersed in a gradient e.g. using the carbodiimide mediated modification method described in the U.S. Patent Application No. US 2007 0212730. In some embodiments the second therapeutic agent can be coated on a surface of the silk tube wall e.g. via diazonium coupling reaction see e.g. U.S. Patent Application No. US 2009 0232963 and or avidin biotin interaction see e.g. International Application No. WO 2011 011347 . In some embodiments the second therapeutic agent can be encapsulated in the silk tube wall e.g. by blending the therapeutic agent into a silk solution before processing into the silk tube. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 8 187 616 and U.S. Pat. App. Nos. US 2008 0085272 US 2010 0028451 US 2012 0052124 US 2012 0070427 and US 2012 0187591 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent can be present in a form of a fusion protein with silk protein e.g. by genetically engineering silk to generate a fusion protein comprising the therapeutic agent.

Generally the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can have any length desired. For example length of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can be from about 1 mm to about 10 cm. In some embodiments length of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can be from about 1 mm to about 5 cm.

Without wishing to be bound by a theory it is believed that the wall thickness of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can affect the release rate of the therapeutic agent encapsulated in the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. Accordingly the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can be selected to have a wall thickness that provides a desired rate of release. For example wall thickness can range from about 50 m to about 5 mm. In some embodiments the wall thickness can be from about 50 m to about 500 m from about 50 m to about 1 000 m from about 200 m to about 300 m from about 600 m to about 800 m from about 200 m to about 800 m from about 300 m to about 700 m from about 400 m to about 600 m or about 500 m. In some embodiments the wall thickness can be greater than about 1 000 m. In some embodiments the wall thickness can be less than about 100 m. In some embodiments the wall thickness can be about 0.25 mm about 0.5 mm about 0.75 mm about 0.9 mm about 1.0 mm or about 1.7 mm.

The silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can have a lumen extending therethrough. The lumen can have the same cross section as that of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir or a cross section that is different than that of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. For example the cross section of the lumen can be round substantially round oval substantially oval elliptical substantially elliptical triangular substantially triangular square substantially square hexagonal substantially hexagonal or the like.

In some embodiments the lumen has a diameter. The diameter can be approximately the same as the diameter of the rotating mandrel used in the preparation of the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. It is understood that the diameter can vary along the length of the lumen. Without limitations the diameter can be from about 100 nm to about 10 mm. In some embodiments the diameter can be from about 1 mm to about 5 mm from about 1 mm to about 3 mm from about 3 mm to about 5 mm from about 2 mm to about 4 mm about 1 mm about 2 mm about 3 mm about 4 mm or about 5 mm. In some embodiments the diameter can be greater than about 5 mm. In some embodiments the diameter can be less than about 1 mm. In so silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir me other embodiments the diameter of less than about 20 mm for example less than about 10 mm or less than about 5 mm.

Generally any amount of the therapeutic agent can be loaded into the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir to provide a desired amount release over a period of time. For example from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg of the therapeutic agent can be loaded in a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. In some embodiment amount of therapeutic agent in composition is selected from the range about from 0.001 w w up to 95 w w preferably from about 5 w w to about 75 w w and most preferably from about 10 w w to about 60 w w .

In some embodiments amount of the therapeutic agent in the silk based drug delivery composition is more than the amount recommended for one dosage of the therapeutic agent. For example if the recommended dosage of the therapeutic agent is X amount then the silk based drug delivery composition can comprise an amount which is 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more times higher than X amount. Without wishing to be bound by a theory this can allow administering the therapeutic agent to obtain a therapeutic effect which is similar to one obtained with multiple administration of the therapeutic agent administered without the silk based drug delivery composition. As used herein the term therapeutic effect refers to a consequence of treatment the results of which are judged to be desirable and beneficial.

The inventors have also discovered that the silk based drug delivery composition can also increase duration of the therapeutic effect for the therapeutic agent. Accordingly the silk based drug delivery composition can comprise the therapeutic agent in an amount which is less than the amount recommended for one dosage of the therapeutic agent. For example if the recommended dosage of the therapeutic agent is X amount then the silk based drug delivery composition can comprise an amount which is X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 X 9 X 10 or less. Without wishing to be bound by a theory this can allow administering a lower dosage of the therapeutic agent to obtain a therapeutic effect which is similar to a higher dosage administered without the silk based drug delivery composition.

In some embodiments amount of the therapeutic agent in the silk based drug delivery composition is equal to the amount recommended for one dosage of the therapeutic agent. For example if the recommended dosage of the therapeutic agent is X amount then the silk based drug delivery composition comprises X amount of the therapeutic agent. Without wishing to be bound by a theory this can allow less frequent administration of the therapeutic agent to obtain a therapeutic effect over a longer period of time.

As used herein the term sustained delivery is refers to continual delivery of a therapeutic agent in vivo or in vitro over a period of time following administration. For example sustained release can occur over a period of at least several days a week or several weeks. Sustained delivery of the agent in vivo can be demonstrated by for example the continued therapeutic effect of the agent over time. Alternatively sustained delivery of the agent may be demonstrated by detecting the presence of the agent in vivo over time. In some embodiments the sustain release is over a period of one week two weeks three weeks four weeks one month two months three months four months five months six months or longer. As described above wall thickness can affect the release rate of the therapeutic agent encapsulated in the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

The silk based drug delivery composition can provide or release an amount of the therapeutic agent which provides a therapeutic effect similar to as provided by a recommended dosage of the therapeutic agent for the same period of time. For example if the recommended dosage for the therapeutic agent is once daily then the silk based drug delivery composition releases that amount of therapeutic agent which is sufficient to provide a similar therapeutic effect as provided by the once daily dosage.

Daily release of the therapeutic agent can range from about 1 ng day to about 1000 mg day. For example amount released can be in a range with a lower limit of from 1 to 1000 e.g. every integer from 1 to 1000 and upper limit of from 1 to 1000 e.g. every integer from 1 to 1000 wherein the lower and upper limit units can be selected independently from ng day g day mg day or any combinations thereof.

In some embodiments daily release can be from about 1 g day to about 10 mg day from about 0.25 g day to about 2.5 mg day or from about 0.5 g day to about 5 mg day. In some embodiments daily release of the therapeutic agent can range from about 100 ng day to 1 mg day for example or about 500 ng day to 5 mg day or about 100 g day.

The inventors have discovered that release of the therapeutic agent from the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir composition follows near zero order release kinetics over a period of time. For example near zero order release kinetics can be achieved over a period of one week two weeks three weeks four weeks one month two months three months four months five months six months twelve months one year or longer.

Further no significant apparent initial burst release is observed from the drug delivery composition described herein. Accordingly in some embodiments the initial burst of the therapeutic agent within the first 48 24 18 12 or 6 hours of administration is less than 25 less than 20 less than 15 less than 10 less than 9 less than 8 less than 7 less than 6 less than 5 less than 4 less than 3 less than 2 or less than 1 of the total amount of therapeutic agent loaded in the drug delivery composition. In some embodiments there is no initial burst of therapeutic agent within the first 6 or 12 hours 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 days 1 and 2 weeks of administration.

Additionally the silk based drug delivery composition can also comprise a targeting ligand. As used herein the term targeting ligand refers to any material or substance which can promote targeting of the drug delivery composition to tissues and or receptors in vivo and or in vitro. The targeting ligand can be synthetic semi synthetic or naturally occurring. Materials or substances which can serve as targeting ligands include for example proteins including antibodies antibody fragments hormones hormone analogues glycoproteins and lectins peptides polypeptides amino acids sugars saccharides including monosaccharides and polysaccharides carbohydrates vitamins steroids steroid analogs hormones cofactors and genetic material including nucleosides nucleotides nucleotide acid constructs peptide nucleic acids PNA aptamers and polynucleotides. Other targeting ligands in the present disclosure include cell adhesion molecules CAM among which are for example cytokines integrins cadherins immunoglobulins and selectin. The silk drug delivery composition can also encompass precursor targeting ligands. A precursor to a targeting ligand refers to any material or substance which can be converted to a targeting ligand. Such conversion can involve for example anchoring a precursor to a targeting ligand. Exemplary targeting precursor moieties include maleimide groups disulfide groups such as ortho pyridyl disulfide vinylsulfone groups azide groups and agr iodo acetyl groups.

The targeting ligand can be covalently e.g. cross linked or non covalently linked to the silk based drug delivery composition. For example a targeting ligand can be covalently linked to silk fibroin used for making the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir or for coating the film spun silk tube ends. Alternatively or in addition a targeting ligand can be linked to an additive present in the silk fibroin solution which is used for making the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir or for coating the film spun silk tube ends.

In addition without wishing to be bound by a theory encapsulating the therapeutic agent in a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can increase the in vivo half life of the therapeutic agent. For example in vivo half life of an encapsulated therapeutic agent can increase by at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 90 at least 1 fold at least 1.5 folds relative to the non encapsulated therapeutic agent.

Again not wishing to be bound by a theory encapsulating a therapeutic agent in a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir can increase the duration of effect for the therapeutic agent. For example amount of therapeutic agent encapsulated in the silk based drug delivery composition provides a therapeutic effect for a period of time which is longer than when the same amount of therapeutic agent is administered without the silk based drug delivery composition. In some embodiments duration of therapeutic effect is at least one day at least two days at least three days at least four days at least five days at least six days at least seven days at least one week at least two weeks at least three weeks at least four weeks at least one month at least two months at least three months at least four months at least five months at least six months or longer than the duration of effect when the therapeutic agent is administered without the silk based drug delivery composition.

The silk based drug delivery composition can also stabilize the bioactivity of a therapeutic agent under a certain condition e.g. under an in vivo physiological condition. See for example WO 2012 145739 content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for additional details on compositions and methods of stabilization of active agents. Accordingly the silk based drug delivery composition can increase the in vivo half life of the therapeutic agent. For example in vivo half life of a therapeutic agent in a silk based drug delivery composition described herein can be increased by at least about 5 at least about 10 at least about 15 at least about 20 at least about 30 at least about 40 at least about 50 at least about 60 at least about 90 at least about 1 fold at least about 1.5 folds relative to the therapeutic agent present in a non silk matrix. Without wishing to be bound by theory the silk based drug delivery composition can provide a longer therapeutic effect. Stated another way an increase in in vivo half life of a therapeutic agent can allow loading of a smaller amount of the therapeutic agent for the same duration of therapeutic effect.

Furthermore the silk based drug delivery composition can increase bioavailability of the encapsulated therapeutic agent. As used herein the term bioavailability refers to the amount of a substance available at a given site of physiological activity after administration. Bioavailability of a given substance is affected by a number of factors including but not limited to degradation and absorption of that substance. Administered substances are subject to excretion prior to complete absorption thereby decreasing bioavailability.

In some embodiments bioavailability of an encapsulated therapeutic agent can increase by at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 1 fold at least 1.5 fold at least 2 fold at least 5 fold at least 5 fold at least 10 fold or more relative to the non encapsulated therapeutic agent.

In another aspect described herein is a method for preparing a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir wherein the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir comprises silk fibroin. The method comprises forming a tube from silk fibroin loading the silk tube with a therapeutic agent closing the silk tube such that the therapeutic agent is sealed therein and coating the closed ends of the silk tube with a silk fibroin solution to form a silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir.

Generally silk tubes can be made using any method known in the art. For example tubes can be made using molding dipping electrospinning gel spinning and the like. Gel spinning involves winding an aqueous solution of silk around a reciprocating rotating mandrel. Final gel spun silk tube porosity structure and mechanical properties could be controlled via different post spinning processes such as alcohol e.g. methanol ethanol etc. . . . treatment air drying water annealing or lyophilization. In gel spinning a silk fibroin solution is delivered over a rotating mandrel which is simultaneously reciprocated horizontally. The silk fibroin forms a coating on the mandrel. This process can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain a desired number of coating layers or wall thickness for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. Gel spinning is described in Lovett et al. 29 35 4650 4657 2008 and the construction of gel spun silk tubes is described in PCT application no. PCT US2009 039870 filed Apr. 8 2009 content of both of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In dip coating a rod of a selected diameter is contacted with or dipped into a solution of silk fibroin thereby forming a coating on the rod. The coating is then dried and removed from the rod whereby a tube of comprising the silk fibroin is prepared. The coating and drying process can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain a desired number of coating layers of wall thickness for the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir. Construction of silk tubes using the dip coating method is described in PCT application no. PCT US2008 072742 filed Aug. 11 2008 content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Without wishing to be bound by a theory it is believed that the inner and outer diameter of the silk tube can be controlled more readily using gel spinning than dip coating technique.

Accordingly described herein is a method for preparation of a film spun silk tube. The method is based on a novel and non obvious modification of the gel spinning technique as described in PCT application no. PCT US2009 039870 and the novel and non obvious dip coating technique as described in PCT application no. PCT US2008 072742 content of both of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Accordingly the film spun silk tube preparation method described herein is different from that described in PCT US2009 039870. The inventors have discovered inter alia that heating the silk during gel spinning surprisingly unexpectedly provides a silk tube with a controlled morphology. Accordingly the tube preparation technique described herein is termed film spinning as it involves a heat treatment step using an in line heating element to transition the silk spinning solution into a tubular film with controlled morphology. Additionally the film spinning method described herein employs a syringe pump to control the flow rate of an injected silk spinning solution precisely. Precise control over the injection rate is an important difference with the gel spinning technique and provides a more controlled tube wall thickness for applications involving controlled delivery of therapeutic agent s . In some embodiments the set up depicted in can be employed for film spinning silk tubes.

Generally the film spinning method for forming a silk tube comprises i delivering a silk fibroin solution onto a mandrel which is reciprocated horizontally while being rotated along its longitudinal axis to form a silk coating thereon and heating the silk coating while the mandrel is rotating to form a silk film on the rotating mandrel. The mandrel can have an elongated structure with a longitudinal axis. The inventors have discovered that simultaneous rotation of the mandrel and treatment of film with heat unexpectedly results in coating thickness uniformity.

Without limitations the delivering and heating steps can be repeated one or more times e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more to form one or more coatings of the silk film. In some embodiments the delivering and heating steps are repeated at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 at least 100 at least 250 at least 500 at least 1000 at least 5000 at least 10000 or more times. In some embodiments the delivering and heating steps are repeated until a desired wall thickness for the film spun silk tube is obtained.

The mandrel can be made of any material known to one of skill in the art. For example mandrel can be made of stainless steel or a stainless steel mandrel coated with a synthetic fluoropolymer.

The mandrel can have a rotational speed of about 0 to about 1000 rpm and an axial movement speed of about 0 to about 1000 mm s.

The silk fibroin solution can be delivered onto the mandrel using any method known in the art. For example the silk fibroin solution can be applied using an applicator. In some embodiments the applicator can be a syringe containing the supply of the silk solution.

The silk fibroin solution can be delivered onto the mandrel using a needle. A needle of any gauge can be used for delivery. For example the needle can be of at least 21 gauge. In some embodiment needle is of gauge from about 25 to about 30.

Without limitations the silk fibroin solution can be delivered onto the mandrel at any flow rate. For example a 30 wt silk solution can be delivered at a flow rate of 0.02 mL min to dispense approx. 1 L of silk solution per millimeter of axial displacement of a 2.7 mm diameter wire rotating at a speed of 70 rpm.

The silk coating can be heated simultaneously while the silk fibroin solution is being delivered onto the mandrel or after delivery has finished. For example the silk coating can be treated with heat within 5 seconds within 10 second within 14 second within 25 seconds within 30 seconds within 35 second within 40 seconds within 45 seconds within 50 seconds within 55 seconds within 1 minute within 2 minutes within 3 minutes within 4 minutes within 5 minutes within 6 minutes within 7 minutes within 8 minutes within 9 minutes within 10 minutes within 15 minutes within 20 minutes within 25 minutes within 30 minutes within 45 minutes within 1 hour within 2 hours or within 3 hours within 6 hours of delivery of the silk solution onto the mandrel.

Any temperature higher than room temperature can be used for heat treating the silk film on the support structure. For example temperature for the heat treatment can range from about 30 C. to about 90 C. In some embodiments temperature for the heat treatment can range from about 35 C. to about 80 C. from about 40 C. to about 75 C. from about 50 C. to about 70 C. or from about 55 C. to about 65 C. In some embodiments temperature for the heat treatment is 67 3 C. or 47 3 C.

Further the silk film on the support structure can be heat treated any period of time. For example heat treatment can be for a period of about 1 minute to about 6 hours. In some embodiments heat treatment can be for from about 10 minutes to about 300 minutes. In some embodiments heat treatment can be for about 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 or 60 minutes. In some embodiments heat treatment can be for duration of the spinning process.

As used herein the term fibroin includes silkworm fibroin and insect or spider silk protein Lucas et al. 13 107 242 1958 . Preferably fibroin is obtained from a solution containing a dissolved silkworm silk or spider silk. The silkworm silk protein is obtained for example from and the spider silk is obtained from . In the alternative the silk proteins suitable for use according to the present disclosure can be obtained from a solution containing a genetically engineered silk such as from bacteria yeast mammalian cells transgenic animals or transgenic plants. See for example WO 97 08315 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 245 012 content of both of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The silk fibroin solution can be prepared by any conventional method known to one skilled in the art. For example cocoons are boiled for about 30 minutes in an aqueous solution. Preferably the aqueous solution is about 0.02M NaCO. The cocoons are rinsed for example with water to extract the sericin proteins and the extracted silk is dissolved in an aqueous salt solution. Salts useful for this purpose include lithium bromide lithium thiocyanate calcium nitrate or other chemicals capable of solubilizing silk. Preferably the extracted silk is dissolved in about 9 12 M LiBr solution. The salt is consequently removed using for example dialysis or chromatography.

If necessary the solution can then be concentrated using for example dialysis against a hygroscopic polymer for example PEG a polyethylene oxide amylose or sericin. Preferably the PEG is of a molecular weight of 8 000 10 000 g mol and has a concentration of 10 50 . A slide a lyzer dialysis cassette Pierce MW CO 3500 is preferably used. However any dialysis system may be used. The dialysis is for a time period sufficient to result in a final concentration of aqueous silk solution between 10 30 . In most cases dialysis for 2 12 hours is sufficient. See for example PCT application PCT US 04 11199 content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Alternatively the silk fibroin solution can be produced using organic solvents. Such methods have been described for example in Li M. et al. J. 2001 79 2192 2199 Min S. et al. 1997 54 85 92 Nazarov R. et al. 2004 May June 5 3 718 26. Exemplary organic solvents that can be used to produce the silk solution include but are not limited to hexafluoroisopropanol HFIP . See for example International Application No. WO2004 000915 content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The inventors have discovered that molecular weight of silk used for preparing the silk tube can have an effect on properties of the silk tube such as swelling ratio degradation drug release kinetics and the like.

Silk fibroin solution for forming the silk tubes or for coating the clamped portions of the silk tube can have a silk fibroin concentration of from about 1 to about 50 w v . In some embodiments the silk fibroin solution has a silk fibroin concentration of from about 10 to about 40 or from 15 to about 35 w v . In one embodiment the silk fibroin solution has a silk fibroin concentration of from about 20 to about 30 w v . In one embodiment the silk fibroin solution has a silk fibroin concentration of about 30 w v . In some embodiments the silk fibroin solution has a silk fibroin concentration of about 0.1 to about 30 w v about 0.5 to about 15 w v about 1 to about 8 w v or about 1.5 to about 5 w v . In some embodiments the silk fibroin solution has a silk fibroin concentration of about 5 to about 30 w v about 10 to about 25 w v or about 15 to about 20 w v . The silk fibroin solution used for coating the clamped portions is also referred to as a silk coating solution herein.

The silk fibroin for making the silk tubes can be modified for different applications or desired mechanical or chemical properties of the silk tube. One of skill in the art can select appropriate methods to modify silk fibroins e.g. depending on the side groups of the silk fibroins desired reactivity of the silk fibroin and or desired charge density on the silk fibroin. In one embodiment modification of silk fibroin can use the amino acid side chain chemistry such as chemical modifications through covalent bonding or modifications through charge charge interaction. Exemplary chemical modification methods include but are not limited to carbodiimide coupling reaction see e.g. U.S. Patent Application. No. US 2007 0212730 diazonium coupling reaction see e.g. U.S. Patent Application No. US 2009 0232963 avidin biotin interaction see e.g. International Application No. WO 2011 011347 and pegylation with a chemically active or activated derivatives of the PEG polymer see e.g. International Application No. WO 2010 057142 . Silk fibroin can also be modified through gene modification to alter functionalities of the silk protein see e.g. International Application No. WO 2011 006133 . For instance the silk fibroin can be genetically modified which can provide for further modification of the silk such as the inclusion of a fusion polypeptide comprising a fibrous protein domain and a mineralization domain which can be used to form an organic inorganic composite. See WO 2006 076711. In some embodiments the silk fibroin can be genetically modified to be fused with a protein e.g. a therapeutic protein. Additionally the silk matrix can be combined with a chemical such as glycerol that e.g. affects flexibility and or solubility of the matrix. See e.g. WO 2010 042798 Modified Silk films Containing Glycerol.

Optionally the conformation of the silk fibroin in the tube prepared using any method can be further altered after formation. Without wishing to be bound by a theory the induced conformational change alters the crystallinity of the silk fibroin in the tube e.g. Silk II beta sheet crystanllinity. This can alter the rate of release of the therapeutic agent from the silk fibroin tube. The conformational change can be induced by any methods known in the art including but not limited to alcohol immersion e.g. ethanol methanol water annealing heating annealing shear stress ultrasound e.g. by sonication pH reduction e.g. pH titration and or exposing a silk matrix to an electric field and any combinations thereof. For example the conformational change can be induced by one or more methods including but not limited to controlled slow drying Lu et al. 10 Biomacromolecules 1032 2009 water annealing Jin et al.

In some embodiments the conformation of the silk fibroin in the silk based delivery system can be altered by water annealing. For example the silk based tube can be subjected to water vapor annealing before during or after loading of the therapeutic agent. Without wishing to be bound by a theory it is believed that physical temperature controlled water vapor annealing TCWVA provides a simple and effective method to obtain refined control of the molecular structure of silk biomaterials e.g. silk tubes disclosed herein. The silk materials can be prepared with control of crystallinity from a low content using conditions at 4 C. a helix dominated silk I structure to highest content of 60 crystallinity at 100 C. sheet dominated silk II structure . This physical approach covers the range of structures previously reported to govern crystallization during the fabrication of silk materials yet offers a simpler green chemistry approach with tight control of reproducibility. Temperature controlled water vapor annealing is described for example in Hu et al. Rergulation of Silk Material Strcuture By Temperature Controlled Water Vapor Annealing Biomacromolecules 2011 12 5 1686 1696 content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the silk tube can be treated with an alcohol e.g. methanol ethanol etc. The alcohol concentration can be at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 or 100 . In some embodiment alcohol concentration is about 90 .

Alternatively the alteration in the conformation of the silk fibroin in the tube can be induced by treating the tube with sheer stress. The sheer stress can be applied for example by passing the tube through a needle. Other methods of inducing conformational changes include contacting the tube with an electric field salt or by applying pressure.

Without limitations the silk tube can comprise a silk II beta sheet crystallinity content of at least about 5 at least about 10 at least about 20 at least about 30 at least about 40 at least about 50 at least about 60 at least about 70 at least about 80 at least about 90 or at least about 95 but not 100 i.e. all the silk is present in a silk II beta sheet conformation . In some embodiments the silk in the silk tube is present completely in a silk II beta sheet conformation i.e. 100 silk II beta sheet crystallinity.

In some embodiments the silk fibroin solution for preparing the film spun silk tube can comprise one or more e.g. one two three four five or more additives.

Without limitations an additive can be selected from small organic or inorganic molecules saccharines oligosaccharides polysaccharides biological macromolecules e.g. peptides proteins and peptide analogs and derivatives peptidomimetics antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof nucleic acids nucleic acid analogs and derivatives glycogens or other sugars immunogens antigens an extract made from biological materials such as bacteria plants fungi or animal cells animal tissues naturally occurring or synthetic compositions and any combinations thereof. Total amount of additives in the solution can be from about 0.1 wt to about 70 wt from about 5 wt to about 60 wt from about 10 wt to about 50 wt from about 15 wt to about 45 wt or from about 20 wt to about 40 wt of the total silk fibroin in the solution.

In some embodiments an additive is a biocompatible polymer. Exemplary biocompatible polymers include but are not limited to a poly lactic acid PLA poly glycolic acid PGA poly lactide co glycolide PLGA polyesters poly ortho ester poly phosphazine poly phosphate ester polycaprolactone gelatin collagen fibronectin keratin polyaspartic acid alginate chitosan chitin hyaluronic acid pectin polyhydroxyalkanoates dextrans and polyanhydrides polyethylene oxide PEO poly ethylene glycol PEG triblock copolymers polylysine alginate polyaspartic acid any derivatives thereof and any combinations thereof. Other exemplary biocompatible polymers amenable to use according to the present disclosure include those described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 302 848 U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 734 U.S. Pat. No. 6 127 143 U.S. Pat. No. 5 263 992 U.S. Pat. No. 6 379 690 U.S. Pat. No. 5 015 476 U.S. Pat. No. 4 806 355 U.S. Pat. No. 6 372 244 U.S. Pat. No. 6 310 188 U.S. Pat. No. 5 093 489 U.S. Pat.

No. 5 270 419 content of all of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Other additives suitable for use with the present disclosure include biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds. Examples of biologically active compounds include but are not limited to cell attachment mediators such as collagen elastin fibronectin vitronectin laminin proteoglycans or peptides containing known integrin binding domains e.g. RGD integrin binding sequence or variations thereof that are known to affect cellular attachment Schaffner P Dard 2003 Cell Mol Life Sci. January 60 1 119 32 Hersel U. et al. 2003 Biomaterials. November 24 24 4385 415 biologically active ligands and substances that enhance or exclude particular varieties of cellular or tissue ingrowth. Other examples of additive agents that enhance proliferation or differentiation include but are not limited to osteoinductive substances such as bone morphogenic proteins BMP cytokines growth factors such as epidermal growth factor EGF platelet derived growth factor PDGF insulin like growth factor IGF I and II TGF 1 and the like.

In some embodiments the silk fibroin solution for making the film spun silk tube or coating the ends comprises one or more therapeutic agents. The therapeutic agent in the solution can be same or different from that is to be encapsulated in the silk tube.

In some embodiments the silk tube can be porous e.g. the wall of the silk tube can be porous. For example the silk tube can have a porosity of at least about 30 at least about 40 at least about 50 at least about 60 at least about 70 at least about 80 at least about 90 or higher. Too high porosity can yield a silk tube with lower mechanical properties but with faster release of a therapeutic agent. However too low porosity can decrease the release of a therapeutic agent. One of skill in the art can adjust the porosity accordingly based on a number of factors such as but not limited to desired release rates molecular size and or diffusion coefficient of the therapeutic agent and or concentrations and or amounts of silk fibroin in the silk tube. As used herein the term porosity is a measure of void spaces in a material and is a fraction of volume of voids over the total volume as a percentage between 0 and 100 or between 0 and 1 . Determination of porosity is well known to a skilled artisan e.g. using standardized techniques such as mercury porosimetry and gas adsorption e.g. nitrogen adsorption.

The porous silk tube can have any pore size. As used herein the term pore size refers to a diameter or an effective diameter of the cross sections of the pores. The term pore size can also refer to an average diameter or an average effective diameter of the cross sections of the pores based on the measurements of a plurality of pores. The effective diameter of a cross section that is not circular equals the diameter of a circular cross section that has the same cross sectional area as that of the non circular cross section. In some embodiments the pores of a silk tube can have a size distribution ranging from about 50 nm to about 1000 m from about 250 nm to about 500 m from about 500 nm to about 250 m from about 1 m to about 200 m from about 10 m to about 150 m or from about 50 m to about 100 m. In some embodiments the silk fibroin can be swellable when the silk fibroin tube is hydrated. The sizes of the pores can then change depending on the water content in the silk fibroin. The pores can be filled with a fluid such as water or air.

Methods for forming pores in a silk matrix are known in the art e.g. porogen leaching method freeze drying method and or gas forming method. Such methods are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. App. Nos. US 2010 0279112 US 2010 0279112 and U.S. Pat. No. 7 842 780 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Though not meant to be bound by a theory silk tube porosity structure and mechanical properties can be controlled via different post spinning processes such as vapour annealingheat treatment alcohol treatment air drying lyophilization and the like. Additionally any desirable release rates profiles or kinetics of the therapeutic agent can be controlled by varying processing parameters such as film thickness silk molecular weight concentration of silk in the silk tube beta sheet conformation structures silk II beta sheet crystallinity or porosity and pore sizes.

For loading into the silk tubes a therapeutic agent can be in any form suitable for the particular method to be used for loading. For example the therapeutic agent can be in the form of a solid liquid or gel. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent is in the form of a solution powder a compressed powder or a pellet. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent can be encapsulated in a silk fibroin particle for loading into the silk tubes. The therapeutic agent can be encapsulated in a silk matrix e.g. by blending the therapeutic agent into a silk solution before processing into a desired material state e.g. a microsphere or a nanosphere for loading into the silk tube. Silk fibroin particles e.g. microspheres or nanospheres which encapsulate a therapeutic agent are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 8 187 616 and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. Nos. US 2008 0085272 US 2010 0028451 US 2012 0052124 US 2012 0070427 US 2012 0187591 the content of all of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments the therapeutic agent is encapsulated in a silk tube based composition described herein i.e. the silk reservoir implant or silk injectable reservoir comprises a silk tube in which are loaded other silk tubes comprising the therapeutic agent.

In some embodiments the silk tube can be optionally hydrated before loading with the therapeutic agent. For example the silk tube can be incubated in deionized water until completely hydrated. In some embodiments the silk tube can be incubated in deionized water for 5 10 15 20 30 45 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 minutes or more. The tube can be hydrated at room temperature or at higher temperatures. Accordingly in some embodiments the tube can be hydrated at a temperature from about 15 C. to about 80 C. In some embodiments the tube can be hydrated at a temperature about 60 C. Without wishing to be bound by a theory hydrating the silk tube before loading can swell or soften the tube thus promoting loading.

In some embodiments the silk tube can be open at both ends during loading. In this case the hydrated silk tube can be held horizontally using tweezers while the therapeutic agent is loaded from one end in solution powder or pellet format using an appropriately sized pipetter spatula or tweezers respectively. In some embodiments one end of the tube can be clamped before loading of the therapeutic agent using for example pinch valves clips or wrenches. The tube clamped on one end can be held vertically while the therapeutic agent is loaded from the open end in solution powder or pellet format using an appropriately sized pipetter spatula or tweezers respectively. Following loading the open end s of the tube can be clamped using for example pinch valves clips or wrenches.

Following loading of therapeutic agent clamped hydrated silk tubes can be dried at a suitable temperature e.g. 20 C. or higher temperatures in ambient conditions for a suitable duration e.g. 30 min or longer to allow complete drying of the tube and the loaded therapeutic agent. Alternatively clamped hydrated silk tubes can be dried under accelerated drying conditions e.g. in vacuum or under gas flow for a suitable duration to allow complete drying of the tube and the loaded drug e.g. for 10 min or longer . Drying conditions can be selected to maximize stability of the therapeutic agent.

After drying the closed ends of the silk tube can be coated with a silk fibroin solution e.g. via dip coating to obtain silk reservoir implants or silk injectable reservoirs. Dip coating can be repeated several times until the desired coating thickness is achieved. Without wishing to be bound by a theory coating the closed ends helps in forming a tight seal and prevents dose dumping. The tube ends can be coated with a silk fibroin solution using any method known in the art. For example the silk fibroin solution can be sprayed on the closed ends or the closed ends dipped into the silk fibroin solution. In one embodiment closed ends of the tube are dipped into a silk fibroin.

All aforementioned steps to produce silk reservoir implants or silk injectable reservoirs can be performed under aseptic conditions. For example the film spinning methanol treatment or water annealing hydration drug loading heat treatment and dip coating procedures can be conducted aseptically inside a laminar flow hood.

In one embodiment loading of the pharmaceutically active agent into silk tubes to prepare silk reservoir implants or silk injectable reservoirs comprises i hydrating the silk tube ii loading the therapeutic agent into the tube and tube end clamping iii drying the silk tube and iv dip coating of tube ends.

The silk based drug delivery described herein can be sterilized using conventional sterilization process such as radiation based sterilization i.e. gamma ray chemical based sterilization ethylene oxide autoclaving or other appropriate procedures. In some embodiments sterilization process can be with ethylene oxide at a temperature between from about 52 C. to about 55 C. for a time of 8 or less hours. The silk based drug delivery can also be processed aseptically. Sterile drug delivery composition can packaged in an appropriate sterilize moisture resistant package for shipment.

In one embodiment a silk solution having a silk concentration of 8 wt or more desirably about 30 wt is injected through a narrow gauge needle 21 G onto a wire which is concomitantly reciprocated horizontally while being rotated along its axis to form a silk coating thereon wherein a syringe pump controls the flow rate of the injected silk solution. The silk coating is then heated while rotating the wire to form a silk film. Notably rotation of the wire during heat treatment promotes uniformity of the silk film thickness. The injecting heating steps are optionally repeated until the desired diameter is achieved. The overall dimensions of the silk compositions from injectable to implantable size range morphology and structure of the silk compositions can be varied as desired. In one embodiment silk II beta sheet crystallinity is induced in the silk composition e.g. by soaking in 90 10 vol vol methanol water followed by hydration thereof e.g. by incubating in deionized water until complete film hydration . The resultant silk compositions are removed from the wire and cut to the desired length.

The silk tubes are loaded with therapeutic agent in powder pellet or liquid form or the therapeutic agent is encapsulated in a particle e.g. a microsphere or a nanosphere while one end of the silk tube is clamped. Following loading of therapeutic agent the film spun silk tube is clamped at the other end and allowed to dry at a suitable temperature e.g. 20 C. or higher temperatures in ambient conditions for a suitable duration to allow complete drying of the tube and the loaded drug e.g. overnight or longer or under accelerated drying conditions e.g. in vacuum or under gas flow for a suitable duration to allow complete drying of the tube and the loaded therapeutic agent e.g. for 10 min or for longer durations . Drying conditions are selected to maximize stability of the therapeutic agent. Silk reservoir implants or injectable silk reservoirs are formed by clamping both ends of the silk tube and their subsequent coating e.g. by dip coating the ends using a silk solution having a silk concentration of 8 wt or higher to ensure a tight seal and prevent dose dumping.

In some embodiments two or more different therapeutic agents can be loaded in the silk tube. When two or more different therapeutic agents are loaded they can be loaded simultaneously one after the other or any combinations thereof. In addition the different therapeutic agents can be loaded in same amount in different amounts or any combinations thereof.

Generally any therapeutic agent can be encapsulated in the silk tube. As used herein the term therapeutic agent means a molecule group of molecules complex or substance administered to an organism for diagnostic therapeutic preventative medical or veterinary purposes. As used herein the term therapeutic agent includes a drug or a vaccine. This term include externally and internally administered topical localized and systemic human and animal pharmaceuticals treatments remedies nutraceuticals cosmeceuticals biologicals devices diagnostics and contraceptives including preparations useful in clinical and veterinary screening prevention prophylaxis healing wellness detection imaging diagnosis therapy surgery monitoring cosmetics prosthetics forensics and the like. This term can also be used in reference to agriceutical workplace military industrial and environmental therapeutics or remedies comprising selected molecules or selected nucleic acid sequences capable of recognizing cellular receptors membrane receptors hormone receptors therapeutic receptors microbes viruses or selected targets comprising or capable of contacting plants animals and or humans. This term can also specifically include nucleic acids and compounds comprising nucleic acids that produce a therapeutic effect for example deoxyribonucleic acid DNA ribonucleic acid RNA or mixtures or combinations thereof including for example DNAnanoplexes.

The term therapeutic agent also includes an agent that is capable of providing a local or systemic biological physiological or therapeutic effect in the biological system to which it is applied. For example the therapeutic agent can act to control infection or inflammation enhance cell growth and tissue regeneration control tumor growth act as an analgesic promote anti cell attachment and enhance bone growth among other functions. Other suitable therapeutic agents can include anti viral agents hormones antibodies or therapeutic proteins. Other therapeutic agents include prodrugs which are agents that are not biologically active when administered but upon administration to a subject are converted to biologically active agents through metabolism or some other mechanism. Additionally a silk based drug delivery composition can contain combinations of two or more therapeutic agents.

A therapeutic agent can include a wide variety of different compounds including chemical compounds and mixtures of chemical compounds e.g. small organic or inorganic molecules saccharines oligosaccharides polysaccharides biological macromolecules e.g. peptides proteins and peptide analogs and derivatives peptidomimetics antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof nucleic acids nucleic acid analogs and derivatives an extract made from biological materials such as bacteria plants fungi or animal cells animal tissues naturally occurring or synthetic compositions and any combinations thereof. In some embodiments the therapeutic agent is a small molecule.

As used herein the term small molecule can refer to compounds that are natural product like however the term small molecule is not limited to natural product like compounds. Rather a small molecule is typically characterized in that it contains several carbon carbon bonds and has a molecular weight of less than 5000 Daltons 5 kDa preferably less than 3 kDa still more preferably less than 2 kDa and most preferably less than 1 kDa. In some cases it is preferred that a small molecule have a molecular weight equal to or less than 700 Daltons.

As noted above any therapeutic agent can be encapsulated. In some embodiments ii is desirable to encapsulate materials to promote the growth of the agent for biological agents promote the functionality of the agent after it is released from the encapsulation or increase the agent s ability to survive or retain its efficacy during the encapsulation period. Materials known to promote cell growth include cell growth media such as Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM fetal bovine serum FBS non essential amino acids and antibiotics and growth and morphogen factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF transforming growth factors TGFs Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF insulin like growth factor IGF I bone morphogenetic growth factors BMPs nerve growth factors and related proteins.

Additional options for delivery via the silk based drug delivery composition described herein can include DNA siRNA antisense plasmids liposomes and related systems for delivery of genetic materials antibodies and antigen binding fragment thereof peptides and proteins to active cellular signaling cascades peptides and proteins to promote mineralization or related events from cells adhesion peptides and proteins to improve gel tissue interfaces antimicrobial peptides and proteins and related compounds.

In some embodiments the therapeutic agent s for use in the present disclosure include but are not limited to those requiring relatively frequent dosing. For example those used in the treatment of chronic disorders or conditions.

In some embodiments the therapeutic agent is 2 4 3 2 trifluoromethyl 10H phenothiazin 10 yl propyl piperazin 1 yl ethanol fluphenazine or 3 5 dimethyltricyclo 3.3.1.1 decan 1amine 3 5 dimethyladamantan 1 amine memantine . Fluphenazine is presently available in oral and injectable dosage forms. Disadvantageously fluphenazine has an incomplete oral bioavailability of 40 to 50 due to extensive first pass metabolization in the liver such that its half life is 15 to 30 hours. Memantine is presently available in oral dosage form as tablets capsules or solution under the brand Namenda by Forest Labs. In some embodiment memantine can be administered in combination with one or more cholinesterase inhibitors e.g. donepezil razadyne and rivastigmin .

In some embodiments the therapeutic agent is a cell e.g. a biological cell. Cells amenable to be incorporated into the composition include but are not limited to stem cells embryonic stem cells mesenchymal stem cells bone marrow derived stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells chrondrocytes progenitor cells pancreatic progenitor cells myoblasts fibroblasts keratinocytes neuronal cells glial cells astrocytes pre adipocytes adipocytes vascular endothelial cells hair follicular stem cells endothelial progenitor cells mesenchymal cells neural stem cells and smooth muscle progenitor cells.

In some embodiments the cell is a genetically modified cell. A cell can be genetically modified to express and secrete a desired compound e.g. a bioactive agent a growth factor differentiation factor cytokines and the like. Methods of genetically modifying cells for expressing and secreting compounds of interest are known in the art and easily adaptable by one of skill in the art.

Differentiated cells that have been reprogrammed into stem cells can also be used. For example human skin cells reprogrammed into embryonic stem cells by the transduction of Oct3 4 Sox2 c Myc and Klf4 Junying Yu et. al. 2007 318 1917 1920 and Takahashi K. et. al. 2007 131 1 12 .

Cells useful for incorporation into the composition can come from any source for example human rat or mouse. Human cells include but are not limited to human cardiac myocytes adult HCMa human dermal fibroblasts fetal HDF f human epidermal keratinocytes HEK human mesenchymal stem cells bone marrow human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells human hair follicular inner root sheath cells human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC and human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells HUVSMC human endothelial progenitor cells human myoblasts human capillary endothelial cells and human neural stem cells.

Exemplary rat and mouse cells include but not limited to RN h rat neurons hippocampal RN c rat neurons cortical RA rat astrocytes rat dorsal root ganglion cells rat neuroprogenitor cells mouse embryonic stem cells mESC mouse neural precursor cells mouse pancreatic progenitor cells mouse mesenchymal cells and mouse endodermal cells.

In some embodiments tissue culture cell lines can be used in the compositions described herein. Examples of cell lines include but are not limited to C166 cells embryonic day 12 mouse yolk C6 glioma Cell line HL1 cardiac muscle cell line AML12 nontransforming hepatocytes HeLa cells cervical cancer cell line and Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO cells .

An ordinary skill artisan in the art can locate isolate and expand such cells. In addition the basic principles of cell culture and methods of locating isolation and expansion and preparing cells for tissue engineering are described in Culture of Cells for Tissue Engineering Editor s Gordana Vunjak Novakovic R. Ian Freshney 2006 John Wiley Sons Inc. and Heath C. A. 2000 18 17 19 content of both of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In yet another aspect provided herein is method for sustained delivery in vivo of a therapeutic agent. The method comprising administering a silk based drug delivery composition described herein to a subject. Without wishing to be bound by a theory the therapeutic agent can be released in a therapeutically effective amount daily.

As used herein the term therapeutically effective amount means an amount of the therapeutic agent which is effective to provide a desired outcome. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. Generally a therapeutically effective amount can vary with the subject s history age condition sex as well as the severity and type of the medical condition in the subject and administration of other agents that inhibit pathological processes in neurodegenerative disorders.

Guidance regarding the efficacy and dosage which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of a compound can be obtained from animal models of condition to be treated.

Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.

The therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 i.e. the concentration of the therapeutic which achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Levels in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. Examples of suitable bioassays include DNA replication assays transcription based assays GDF 8 binding assays and immunological assays.

The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted as necessary to suit observed effects of the treatment. Generally the therapeutic agents are administered so that the therapeutic agent is given at a dose from 1 g kg to 100 mg kg 1 g kg to 50 mg kg 1 g kg to 20 mg kg 1 g kg to 10 mg kg 1 g kg to 1 mg kg 100 g kg to 100 mg kg 100 g kg to 50 mg kg 100 g kg to 20 mg kg 100 g kg to 10 mg kg 100 g kg to 1 mg kg 1 mg kg to 100 mg kg 1 mg kg to 50 mg kg 1 mg kg to 20 mg kg 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg 10 mg kg to 100 mg kg 10 mg kg to 50 mg kg or 10 mg kg to 20 mg kg. For antibody compounds one preferred dosage is 0.1 mg kg of body weight generally 10 mg kg to 20 mg kg .

As disclosed herein the silk based drug delivery can provide a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic agent to a subject for a period of time which is similar to or longer than the period of time when the therapeutic agent is administered without the silk based drug delivery composition. For example amount of therapeutic agent released over a day provides a similar therapeutic effect as provided by the recommended daily dosage of the therapeutic agent when administered without the silk based drug delivery composition.

For administration to a subject the silk based drug delivery composition can be formulated in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a drug delivery composition formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers additives and or diluents. The drug delivery composition can be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form including those adapted for the following 1 oral administration for example drenches aqueous or non aqueous solutions or suspensions lozenges dragees capsules pills tablets e.g. those targeted for buccal sublingual and systemic absorption boluses powders granules pastes for application to the tongue 2 parenteral administration for example by subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous or epidural injection as for example a sterile solution or suspension or sustained release formulation 3 topical application for example as a cream ointment or a controlled release patch or spray applied to the skin 4 intravaginally or intrarectally for example as a pessary cream or foam 5 sublingually 6 ocularly 7 transdermally 8 transmucosally or 9 nasally. Additionally compounds can be implanted into a patient or injected using a drug delivery composition. See for example Urquhart et al. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 24 199 236 1984 Lewis ed. Controlled Release of Pesticides and Pharmaceuticals Plenum Press New York 1981 U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 and U.S. Pat. No. 35 3 270 960.

As used here the term pharmaceutically acceptable refers to those compounds materials compositions and or dosage forms which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio.

Degummed silk fibers were purchased from Suho Biomaterials Technology Suzhou China . Memantine hydrochloride and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. .

Degummed silk fibers were dissolved in an aqueous LiBr solution 20 wt at 60 C. for 4 hours and dialyzed against deionized water for 2 days. The final degummed silk concentration varied between 5 to 8 wt . Control batches of fibers were boiled in 0.02 M NaCOfor up to 300 min prior to dissolution in LiBr to reduce the average silk molecular weight and observe potential subsequent changes in tube swelling and degradation behavior. The reduction in silk average molecular weight due to the boiling treatment was determined via size exclusion chromatography SEC via an Agilent SEC 3 column using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC unit Agilent Technologies Santa Clara Calif. with UV detection at 280 nm. In SEC increasing silk retention times indicate decreasing silk molecular weight. Possible changes in silk aqueous solution 5 wt viscosity due to the boiling treatment were investigated using a Viscolab 4000 viscometer Cambridge Viscosity Medford Mass. .

Regenerated silk solution was concentrated to approx. 30 wt via dialysis against 15 wt aqueous 10 kDa polyethylene glycol solution for 20 hours using 3 kDa MWCO Slide A Lyzer dialysis cassettes Fisher Scientific . Silk concentration was estimated gravimetrically from the ratio of wet mass to dry mass.

Film spinning was conducted using the set up depicted in . Briefly a concentrated silk solution 30 wt was injected through a narrow gauge needle 21 G onto a PTFE coated stainless steel wire McMaster Carr . The silk solution flow rate was controlled typical flow rates were 0.1 ml min or 0.2 ml min using a KD Scientific syringe pump. During injection the wire was concomitantly reciprocated horizontally typically at 5 mm min while being rotated along its axis. The motion of the wire was controlled through an AC gear motor McMaster Carr connected to another syringe pump KD Scientific . For example the solution flow rate was adjusted to dispense approx. 2 L of 30 silk solution per millimeter of axial displacement of a 2.7 mm diameter wire rotating at 70 rpm. Immediately after injection of the silk solution onto the wire the rotating wire was pushed into a tube oven to heat treat the silk coating thereby forming a silk film. The heat treatment temperatures were generally between 45 C. and 80 C. with a temperature variation of less than 0.08 C. mm along the film length. Simultaneous rotation of the wire during the heat treatment enhanced thickness uniformity of the silk film. The injecting heating steps were repeated until the desired tube diameter was achieved. Optionally silk tubes were soaked in 90 10 vol vol methanol water to induce silk II beta sheet crystallinity and subsequently incubated in deionized water until complete film hydration. The resultant silk tubes were removed from the wire and cut to a desired length.

Therapeutic agent was loaded in solution powder or pellet form in silk film tubes prepared as described above while one end of the hydrated silk tube may be clamped. Following loading of therapeutic agent the film spun silk tube was clamped at the other end and allowed to dry at a suitable temperature e.g. 20 C. or higher temperatures for a suitable duration to allow complete drying of the tube and the loaded drug e.g. overnight or longer . Drying conditions were selected to maximize stability of the therapeutic agent. Silk reservoir implants or injectable silk reservoirs were formed by clamping both ends of the silk tube and their subsequent coating e.g. by dip coating the ends using a silk solution having a silk concentration of 30 wt to ensure a tight seal and prevent dose dumping. The whole procedure was conducted aseptically inside a laminar flow hood.

The dosage forms were incubated in 250 mL PBS buffer containing 0.02 wt sodium azide at 37 C. for up to 1 month. Release media was sampled after 2 and 6 hours and daily afterwards. After each sampling the whole media was exchanged with fresh PBS 0.02 wt sodium azide buffer.

A 14 day rat pK study was conducted using silk memantine reservoir implants at a dose of 20 mg memantine rat. Silk memantine reservoirs were implanted subcutaneously. Blood samples were collected serially at pre determined time points for 14 days. Plasma samples were then analyzed for memantine concentration using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS . Homogeneous silk memantine implants were used as a control group in a 3 day rat pK study. For homogeneous implant formulation aqueous memantine solutions up to 5 wt were mixed with concentrated silk solutions approx. 30 wt inside conical PDMS molds and the mixture was dried at 60 C. In this manner memantine was homogeneously encapsulated in silk implants.

Aqueous equilibrium swelling of silk films S was calculated using the formula 100 where mand mare hydrated and dry masses respectively.

In vitro degradation was measured gravimetrically at pre determined time points for up to one week after incubation in PBS buffer containing 0.02 wt sodium azide at 37 C.

Effects of processing parameters such as silk molecular weight film drying temperature and film silk II beta sheet crystallinity as induced by methanol treatment on physicochemical properties such as tube swelling or in vitro degradation were studied using control silk tubes lacking therapeutic agent .

where mand mare hydrated and dry masses respectively. Notably the swelling ratio increased with decreasing molecular weight from 34 for non boiled silk to 48 for 60 min boiled silk and dropped back to 37 for 300 min boiled silk see . Methanol treatment did not have a significant effect on swelling ratio in silk tubes heat treated at 67 3 C. see Groups A and B . On the other hand methanol treatment led to a lower swelling ratio when the silk tubes were annealed at 47 3 C. see Groups C and D . This effect could be attributed to possible silk II crystal formation at high temperatures e.g. 67 3 C. even in the absence of methanol treatment.

Further in vitro degradation was measured gravimetrically at pre determined time points for up to one week after incubation in PBS buffer containing 0.02 wt sodium azide at 37 C. Preliminary one week data suggests that silk molecular weight may have a strong effect on initial tube degradation in vitro. Percent degradation values for non methanol treated tubes prepared from 0 10 60 and 300 min boiled silk were 1.8 1.3 2.3 and 7 respectively .

An FDA approved therapeutic agent for Alzheimer s disease memantine was used as a model therapeutic agent to demonstrate sustained release from silk reservoir implant compositions. Silk reservoir implant compositions prepared as described above having either 2 or 10 coatings of silk film were loaded with 2.5 5.0 or 10.0 mg memantine. These silk reservoir implant compositions were incubated in 250 mL PBS buffer containing 0.02 wt sodium azide at 37 C. for up to 1 month. Release media was sampled after 2 hours 6 hours and daily afterwards. After each sampling the whole media was exchanged with fresh PBS 0.02 wt sodium azide buffer.

Memantine release rate was strongly dependent on film thickness of the silk reservoir implant compositions. The daily release rates of memantine were 38 21 and 8 for 0.5 1.0 and 1.7 mm thick silk films respectively see . On the other hand there was no apparent effect of memantine dose when varied from 2.5 to 10 mg on the release rate see . Importantly no initial burst of memantine release was detected from these silk compositions. Furthermore near zero order release kinetics was achieved over 2 weeks in vitro at a release rate between 0.5 to 1.5 mg day when the loading was normalized to 20 mg memantine per silk implant.

Silk reservoir implant compositions loaded with 20 mg memantine were implanted subcutaneously in rats and blood samples collected serially at pre determined time points for 14 days. Plasma samples were then analyzed for memantine concentration using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS . Additionally for comparison homogeneous silk memantine implants were used as a control group in a 3 day rat pharmacokinetic study. For homogeneous implant formulation aqueous memantine solutions up to 5 wt were mixed with concentrated silk solutions approximately 30 wt inside conical polydimethylsiloxane molds and the mixture was dried at 60 C. In this manner memantine was homogeneously encapsulated in silk implants.

Silk reservoir implant compositions delivered memantine in a sustained manner over a period of 14 days see . In contrast memantine release from a single injection of memantine saline solution terminal half life t 4 hours or homogeneous silk memantine implants failed to deliver memantine in a sustained manner over a period of 14 days see . Importantly the silk compositions implanted into rats showed excellent biocompatibility as the incisions healed well and no adverse effects e.g. inflammation hardening or scar tissue formation were noted throughout the study or during explanation. Moreover a strong in vitro in vivo correlation IVIVC was observed with 1 mg day in vitro 33 ng mL rat plasma .

An FDA approved therapeutic for the treatment of Schizophrenia and acute manic phases of bipolar disorder fluphenazine was used as a model therapeutic agent to demonstrate sustained release from silk injectable reservoir compositions. Silk injectable reservoir compositions prepared as described above having dimensions 2 mm 18 mm diameter length with a 0.5 mm silk film thickness were loaded with 3 or 10 mg fluphenazine. These silk injectable reservoir compositions were incubated in 250 mL PBS buffer containing 0.02 wt sodium azide at 37 C. for up to 1 month. Release media was sampled after 2 hours 6 hours and daily afterwards. After each sampling the whole media was exchanged with fresh PBS 0.02 wt sodium azide buffer.

The silk injectable reservoir compositions exhibited near zero order release kinetics of fluphenazine for up to 1 month. Importantly no initial burst of fluphenazine release was detected from these silk compositions. Furthermore the release rate of fluphenazine varied between 0.05 0.5 mg day and 0.02 0.2 mg day for 3 and 10 mg fluphenazine loading respectively over a period of 25 days see .

In vitro release results obtained from various other silk compositions containing memantine demonstrated an undesirable high initial burst rather than sustained release of memantine.

Two different sphere formulations namely PVA poly vinyl alcohol emulsion nanospheres and microspheres prepared using Spray Crystallize Freeze Drying SCFD method a provisional application for this method has been filed were studied for memantine delivery. The mass ratio of silk to memantine was 4 1 and 2 1 in SCFD and PVA nanospheres respectively. For PVA nanospheres potential effects of two post sphere preparation methods methanol treatment and incubation in silk and silk memantine solutions on memantine release were studied. However in all cases high burst release values were observed while the sustained release was below the target level of 50 g mL after 1 week.

Memantine release from silk films was investigated in a 96 well plate configuration. Films were prepared by drying silk memantine solutions 2.5 wt silk 2.5 memantine to obtain a homogeneous memantine encapsulation with or without additional coatings of silk film. Using different solution volumes 10 100 L varied the thickness of the silk memantine films while increasing the number of coatings from 1 to 4 using 5 wt silk solution varied the thickness of the silk film. In the absence of additional coatings of silk film the burst release was approximately 100 . Increasing the silk film thickness could reduce the burst release down to approximately 30 . However linear release kinetics could not be achieved.

Memantine pellets were prepared using either an EconoPress purchased from Sigma Aldrich or a Table press purchased from Fisher Scientific. The pellets were drop coated with 100 L of 8 wt silk solution on both sides using a similar protocol to that described by Pritchard et al. 144 2 159 167 2010 for adenosine silk formulations. Possible effects of methanol treatment after each coating step on memantine release were also studied. In all cases the release was predominantly due to a burst 90 .

Three different gel formulations silk hydrogels lyophilized gels and air dried gels were prepared. For plain silk and air dried gels the initial silk concentration was varied between 8 and 30 wt whereas lyophilized gels were only prepared from 8 wt silk. In all cases 5 mg memantine was added into 0.5 mL silk solution and the mixture was sonicated to obtain a hydrogel. Lyophilized gels showed the highest initial burst release 85 after 6 hours while lower burst values were observed for hydrogels and air dried hydrogels. Increasing the silk concentration up to 29 wt led to even lower initial burst values of approximately 20 after 6 hours. Although the sustained release values for hydrogels were higher as compared with that for the spheres most of the encapsulated memantine 85 was released after 2 weeks even at the highest hydrogel concentration.

Silk memantine solutions 5 mg memantine loading in 0.5 mL 30 silk were dried into solid plugs that are denser compared to the gels. The memantine loading in dried plugs could be improved 8 fold 40 mg memantine in 0.5 mL 30 silk by dissolution of memantine in methanol instead of water. There was a significant improvement in the release profile a decrease in the burst and longer sustained release approximately 75 of memantine release after two weeks as compared with the hydrogels. However the deviation was higher between repeats for plugs as compared to gels possibly due to heterogeneous distribution of memantine in the matrix.
