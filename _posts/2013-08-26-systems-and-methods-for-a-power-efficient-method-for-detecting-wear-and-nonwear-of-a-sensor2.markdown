Medical alert devices are often marketed to the elderly as a means to stay in contact with caretakers and emergency services. Some devices also enable the measurement of behavioral and environmental parameters. Unfortunately many patients neglect to wear their medical alert devices resulting in a disconnect between the patient and emergency services. Additionally behavioral and environmental parameters collected by the device during a non wear state can prove inaccurate. To date the devices cannot determine their wear state in a power efficient and accurate method.

The present solution provides a system and a method for determining the wear compliance of a wearable sensor. More particularly the systems and methods described herein enable the power efficient and accurate determination of a sensor s wear and non wear state. Accurately detecting the wear and non wear state ensures the correct and accurate measurement of behavioral signals. Additionally the systems and methods enable caretakers to remotely monitor patient wear compliance and behavioral parameters.

According to one aspect of the disclosure a method for determining if a wearable device is worn by a wearer includes sampling for a predetermined time step a signal of a motion sensor within the wearable device. The signal indicates a motion of the wearable device. The method also includes determining an orientation of the wearable device from the signal and detecting a movement of the wearable device based on a difference between the orientation and at least one previously determined orientation. The method further includes storing into an array of flags a flag that indicates the detection of movement of the wearable device. Each flag in the array of flags indicates whether there has been a detection of movement of the wearable device for each of the at least one previously predetermined time steps. The method also includes determining that the wearer is wearing the wearable device at the predetermined time step based on identifying a predetermined number of flags in the array of flags.

In some implementations determining that the wearer is wearing the wearable device is responsive to identifying a continuous subset of flags in the array of flags that all indicate detection of movement.

Detecting the movement also includes determining if the intensity value is above a first threshold.

In certain embodiments summing the samples of the movement signal further includes summing the absolute value of the differences between adjacent samples in the plurality of samples. Summing the samples can include summing the absolute value of each of the plurality of samples minus a running mean.

In yet other implementations sampling includes sampling only one sample during the predetermined time step. In other implementations sampling includes sampling for only a subset of time within the predetermined time step. In some implementations determining that a movement occurred can also include counting a number of flags in the array of flags that have indicate detection of movement and determining if the number of flags is above a second threshold.

In some implementations a band pass filter low pass or a high pass filter is applied to the signal. The motion sensor can be one of an accelerometer a gyroscope or a passive motion sensor. The orientation can include one of the motion sensor s pitch roll or yaw.

In certain implementations the first orientation is determined by filtering the signal and calculating the difference between the x y and z axis. In some implementations the determination that the wearer is wearing the wearable device is made by a second device in communication with the wearable device.

The housing houses the components described above in relation to . The above described sensors may be internal and or external to the housing . For example the wearable sensor may include an accelerometer which need not be exposed to the outside environment. In another example the wearable sensor may include an ambient light sensor that is exposed to the outside environment such that it can measure the light levels. Similarly the wearable sensor may include a galvanic response sensor on the bottom surface of the housing . The galvanic sensor may make contact with a user s skin and be configured to determine when it is in contact with a user s skin and when it is not in contact with a user s skin.

As illustrated the wearable sensor includes a button . In some implementations the wearable sensor includes a plurality of buttons and or a screen. In some implementations the screen is a touch screen. A user may use the bottom to mark events. For example a user may mark the beginning of physical activity. In some implementations the button is coupled to an input on the above described processor . When the button is depressed the processor may mark the event. For example the processor may store a time stamp of when the button was depressed in the storage device .

In some implementations the wearable sensor includes medical alert functionality. The button may be used to request help or to send an alert that a medical incident is occurring. For example if the user falls the user may press the button and the wearable sensor may send an alert to the client device of a care taker.

In some implementations the functionality of a button and or screen located on the wearable sensor is achieved through a client device . For example a user s smart phone may run an application that corresponds to the wearable sensor . The application may be in communication with the wearable sensor through a data connection on the phone and wearable sensor . The application may provide the user with information relevant to the wearable sensor . In some implementations the application may enable the user to activate features on the wearable sensor as if the user was depressing a physical button on the wearable sensor . For example the wearable sensor may include an activity button that when activated causes the wearable sensor to mark a time stamp indicating when the activity button was depressed in the application.

The wearable sensor may be designed and constructed to have a predetermined shape or form that provides a predetermined orientation when the wearable sensor is lying at rest falls and lies at rest or is placed down by the wearer on a surface. In some implementations the wearable sensor is configured such that when not worn it defaults to a particular orientation. For example the top of the housing may be dome shaped and weighted to one side. When not worn the wearable sensor may lean to the weighted side also referred to as the wearable sensor s default orientation . When the wearable sensor or other device in the environment detects the default orientation the wearable sensor may determine that it is not being worn.

In some implementations basing the detection of movement on orientation enables sampling at a relatively lower sampling rate when compared to basing the detection of movement on acceleration. The line indicates an acceleration signal of the same wearable sensor . As illustrated the acceleration signal is relatively steady except for during epochs of large movement. However to capture the rapid change in accelerations the sampling frequency must be high enough to accurately recreate the signal. For example if a sample is only recoded at t t and t far below the Nyquist frequency of the acceleration signal then the acceleration signal would appear flat throughout the recording and it would appear as if no movement occurred. However sampling at t t and t provides data points with substantially different orientation values and thus movement information may be determined from low sampled orientation data.

The systems and methods described herein are related to detecting if a wearable sensor is being or was worn during a specific time epoch. More particularly the system and methods enable the detection of a wear state that is both accurate and power efficient. As described above in some implementations the wearable sensor can be a medical alert device panic button device or physical activity monitor. The wearable sensor enables the passive measurement of behaviors in ambulatory environments. The wearable sensor may sync or communicate with a plurality of devices such as other wearable sensors smart phones computers or any combination thereof. In some implementations the wearable sensor is used by caretakers to remotely monitor patients.

As used herein the term state is used to describe the wearable sensor s relation to a user. For example during a non wear state the user is not wearing the wearable sensor and during a wear state the wearable sensor is being worn by the user. In some implementations the state can also correspond to an activity. For example the state may indicate that the user is wearing the wearable sensor and also sleeping or wearing the wearable sensor and involved in a physical activity.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention described in this disclosure. For example the methods described herein may be included in as a module that is added to an already available wearable sensor or custom built wearable sensor such as the wearable sensor described herein.

The wearable sensor also includes a wear detection module and a movement detection module . The wear detection module and the movement detection module are responsible for the detection of wear state and movement respectively. In some implementations the wear detection module and the movements detection module include processor executable instructions that are stored in the storage device . The storage device also stores a buffer which is used by the wear detection module and or the movement detection module during their respective movement and wear determinations. Each of the wear detection module and the movement detection module may be stand alone components or a software module that is executed by the processor . The function of the wear detection module and the movement detection module are described in greater detail in relation to the method of .

As described above the wearable sensor can include a plurality of sensors. In some implementations wear state is determined responsive to the wearable sensor s orientation and or movement. In some of these implementations the orientation is determined my measuring the gravitational acceleration along the x y and z axis. The accelerometers are configured to detect subtle movements such as those that are difficult to spot with the naked eye. For example the sensor may detect movements that are caused by a user breathing or chewing. In some implementations the sensors can detect orientation to within 1 degree 0.5 degrees or 0.01 degrees.

In some implementations the processor samples the signal generated by the sensors at less than 10 Hz. For example the processor can samples the signal at about 1 5 Hz about 3 7 Hz or about 6 10 Hz. In some implementations the processor samples the signal as few as 1 sample per minute 1 sample per 5 minutes or 1 sample per 10 minutes. In yet other implementations the processor samples the signal above 10 Hz. For example the processor can sample the signal at about 10 50 Hz about 50 100 Hz about 100 200 Hz about 200 1000 Hz.

As set forth above the method of determining the wearable sensor s state begins with the sampling of a motion signal step . As described herein the motion signal refers to any data signal that is generated by the one or more sensors of the wearable sensor. For example a motion signal may be the acceleration of the wearable sensor that is measured by one or more accelerometers along one two or three axes. In some implementations the sampling of the motion signal occurs in predetermined time steps. For example a time steps include but are not limited to 30 seconds 1 minute and 5 minutes. In some implementations the wearable sensor may record additional data to determine the wearable sensor s state. For example the wearable sensor may record a RSSI value to determine approximate location of the wearable sensor.

In some implementations the rate the duration and the duty cycle of sampling is responsive to the power requirements of the wearable sensor. For example the wearable sensor may sample continuously at a rate of greater than 10 Hz in a high power state. In an example of a low power state the wearable sensor may sample at 10 Hz for two seconds at the start of every time step. In another low power state example the wearable sensor may sample at a low frequency. The low frequency may be only one sample per time step. In some implementations sampling more than one sample per time step enables the movement detection module to calculate an indication of acceleration magnitude also referred to as intensity of the motion signal . The plurality of samples per time step may also be used to determine orientation. In some implementations and as illustrated in relation to orientation can be determined with as little as one sample per time step.

At step an orientation of the wearable sensor is determined. The orientation is determined by the above described movement detection module . The orientation can be indicative of a single orientation of the wearable sensor during the time step or the orientation can indicate a plurality of orientations for each time step. The orientation of the wearable sensor at each sampled data point may be determined using the below equations 

In the above equations Grepresents the measured acceleration along the x y and z axes. In some implementations the motion signal is filtered with a low pass filter to substantially isolate the acceleration due to gravity. The low pass filter can remove the component of the motion signal due to movement leaving substantially only the component caused by gravity.

In some implementations the measured acceleration may be used to determine both an orientation and an intensity. In some implementations the intensity of the motion signal is the raw magnitude of the motion signal. In other implementations intensity of the motion signal is a derived value that is calculated from the raw motion signal. For example the intensity value can be the sum of the absolute value of the differential of the samples in the motion signal. More particularly the intensity can be represented by the equation 1 where I is the intensity of the motion signal and x n is the sampled motion signal at sample n.

In a similar implementation the intensity value can be the sum of the absolute value of the samples in the motion signal and a running average. More particularly the intensity can be represented by the equation where I is the intensity of the motion signal and x n is the sampled motion signal at sample n. MAis the moving average over the last x samples of the motion signal.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this and other steps in the method may be calculated live or at a later time. For example in a live implementation the samples from step may be fed directly into the movement detection module for substantially immediate analysis. In other implementations the samples from step may be stored in the storage device . The movement detection module may retrieve the samples form the storage device at a later time for analysis. In other implementations as described above in relation to the wear detection module and or movement detection module may be a component of one of the other devices. The data stored on the storage device can be transferred to one of the other devices for the determination of wear state. For example the data may be transferred to a server for analysis.

At step a detection of movement is made by the movement detection module . As described above the sampling of the motion signal is binned into time steps. In some implementations the detection of a movement is made for each of the time steps. For example the sampled motion signal may be binned into one minute time steps wherein the movement detection module analyzes the one minute time steps to determine if a movement occurred during each time step. In this example where the motion signal is binned into one minute time steps if 60 minutes of data was sampled then the movement detection module would generate a total of sixty flags or indications of detected movement.

In some implementations the method by which the wearable sensor detects movements is selected responsive to the type and amount of data recorded during the time step. For example if the time step includes more than one data point movement detection module can use orientation and intensity to determine if movement occurred. If only one data sample was collected during the time step the movement detection module may only use orientation to determine if movement occurred.

In certain implementations determining if a movement occurred is responsive to the orientation of the wearable sensor. For example after the orientation has been obtained for a time step t the orientation is compared to an orientation from a previous time step t where k is a number of time steps in the past. For example if k 1 the orientation at tis compared to the orientation at the time step immediately before time step t. In some implementations if the difference between the orientations is above a predetermined threshold then a flag is set that indicates that a movement occurred. In some implementations the threshold is set a predetermined amount above the noise level generated by the sensor when the wearable sensor is at steady state. For example the threshold may be set to value twice the height of the noise level. In some implementations the threshold is set responsive to the desired level of sensitivity. For example a lower threshold may be set if the wearer wishes to detect subtler movements. The threshold value can also be set responsive to the wearer s age sex health conditions ethnicity height weight the placement of wearable sensor or any combination thereof.

In some implementations determining if a movement occurred is also responsive to the intensity value s for each time step. For example the movement detection module may count the number of times the intensity rose above a threshold within the time step. If the number is above a second threshold the movement detection module may set a flag indicating that a movement occurred during the time step. In some implementations the second threshold is set to reduce the number of false positives. For example the second threshold may be set such that the wearable sensor does not classify bumping of an unworn wearable sensor as movement made by a wearer. For example the second threshold may be set to correspond to the number of samples recorded in one second. In another implementation a single intensity value may be calculated for the entire time step such as using the above described equation for I. In these implementations if the value of I is above a third threshold then a flag to indicate movement is set. In some implementations employing both intensity and orientation one of or both the intensity calculations and the orientation calculations may have to register a movement before the movement detection module sets a flag indicating movement for the time step.

At step an indication of the detected movement is stored. As described in relation to step the movement detection module determines if movement occurred during each time step. When the determination of step is complete the movement detection module stores the above described flag. In some implementations the flag is stored into the buffer within the storage device of the wearable sensor. In some implementations the buffer stores between 2 and 5 flags 5 and 20 flags 20 and 50 flags or more than 50 flags. The flags can indicate that no movement was detected movements was detected or the flags may indicate that a decision regarding movement could not be made for the particular time step.

At step the wear detection module determines if a wearer is wearing the wearable sensor. During step the wear detection module reads flags from the buffer . The determination of wear state may be responsive to N flags where N is between 1 and the length of the buffer. For example the determination as to if a wearable sensor is being worn during time step tmay be responsive to the flag at tand the previous four flags. In this example N 5.

In some implementations the wear detection module determines that the wearable sensor is being worn if a predetermined number of the last N flags indicate movement. For example the wear detection module may determine the wearable sensor is being worn if 4 of the last 5 flags indicate movement. In some implementations the state determination made by the wear detection module may be responsive to a predetermined pattern with in the last N flags. For example the wear detection module may require that at least M continuous flags indicate movement in order for the wear detection module to determine the wearable sensor is in a wear state.
