This invention relates to protein scaffolds that specifically bind a target and methods of making screening and using such scaffolds.

This invention relates to protein scaffolds useful for example for the generation of products having novel binding characteristics.

Proteins having relatively defined three dimensional structures commonly referred to as protein scaffolds may be used as reagents for the design of engineered products. These scaffolds typically contain one or more regions which are amenable to specific or random sequence variation and such sequence randomization is often carried out to produce libraries of proteins from which desired products may be selected. One particular area in which such scaffolds are useful is the field of antibody mimetic design.

While therapeutic antibodies are known with some successful examples on the market HERCEPTIN AVASTIN SYNAGIS there is a growing interest in generating antibody fragments as therapeutic proteins. The advantages are the ease of manipulation by molecular biology techniques in order to obtain desired binding characteristics the ability to express such fragments in microbial systems and the expectation that antibody fragments will have better tissue penetration than full length antibodies. One example is REOPRO .

In addition there have been efforts to develop small non antibody therapeutics i.e. antibody mimetics in order to capitalize on the advantages of antibodies and antibody fragments such as high affinity binding of targets and low immunogenicity and toxicity while avoiding some of the shortfalls such as the requirement for intradomain disulfide bonds which require proper refolding and the tendency for antibody fragments to aggregate and be less stable than full length IgGs. One example is a minibody scaffold which is related to the immunoglobulin fold which is designed by deleting three beta strands from a heavy chain variable domain of a monoclonal antibody Tramontano et al. J. Mol. Recognit. 7 9 1994 . This protein includes 61 residues and can be used to present two hypervariable loops much like complementarity determining regions CDRs in antibodies. These two loops have been randomized and products selected for antigen binding but thus far the framework appears to have somewhat limited utility due to solubility problems. Another framework used to display loops has been tendamistat a small protein inhibitor of amylase which contains a 74 residue six strand beta sheet sandwich held together by two disulfide bonds and forms 3 CDR like loops McConnell and Hoess J. Mol. Biol. 250 460 1995 .

Other proteins have been tested as frameworks and have been used to display randomized residues on alpha helical surfaces Nord et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 15 772 1997 Nord et al. Protein Eng. 8 601 1995 loops between alpha helices in alpha helix bundles Ku and Schultz Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 6552 1995 and loops constrained by disulfide bridges such as those of the small protease inhibitors Markland et al. Biochemistry 35 8045 1996 Markland et al. Biochemistry 35 8058 1996 Rottgen and Collins Gene 164 243 1995 Wang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 270 12250 1995 .

Thus there is a need to develop small stable artificial antibody like molecules for a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

The present invention provides a family of recombinant non naturally occurring protein scaffolds capable of binding any compound of interest. In particular the proteins described herein may be used to display defined loops which are analogous to the complementarity determining regions CDRs of an antibody variable region. These loops may be subjected to randomization or restricted evolution to generate diversity required to bind a multitude of target compounds. The proteins may be assembled into multispecific scaffolds capable of binding different targets.

The invention provides recombinant non naturally occurring polypeptide scaffolds herein after known as scaffolds of the invention comprising a plurality of beta strand domains linked to a plurality of loop region sequences derived from a naturally occurring protein sequence wherein one or more of said loop region sequences vary by deletion substitution or addition by at least one amino acid from the corresponding loop sequences in the naturally occurring protein sequence and wherein the beta strand domains of the polypeptide scaffold have at least 50 homology to the corresponding domain sequences of a naturally occurring protein sequence.

In other specific embodiments scaffolds of the invention may be encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 33 59.

In other specific embodiments scaffolds of the invention may be encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 89 98.

In another aspect of the invention the scaffolds of the invention also include disulfide stabilized scaffolds. The disulfide stabilized scaffolds exhibit enhanced stability as measured by thermal tolerance resistance to chaotropic denaturation and protease treatment.

The scaffolds of the invention are engineered to bind targets of interest as described herein. Such binding may for example exhibit an affinity of at least 100 M.

The invention also provides multimeric scaffolds comprising at least two scaffolds of the invention hereinafter known as multimeric scaffolds of the invention .

In specific embodiments the invention provides TRAIL R2 specific binders which are useful for preventing ameliorating detecting diagnosing or monitoring diseases such as but not limited to cancer. In other specific embodiments TRAIL R2 specific binding scaffolds of the invention are useful for the treatment of cancers in which cancer cells express TRAIL R2. In some embodiments cancers may include but are not limited to lung cancer non Hodgkin s lymphoma gastrointestinal cancer renal cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer stomach cancer bladder cancer breast cancer colon cancer colorectal cancer pancreatic cancer liver cancer prostate cancer and melanoma.

The protein scaffolds described herein have been designed to be superior both to antibody derived fragments and to non antibody frameworks. The major advantage of the scaffolds of the invention over antibody fragments is structural. These scaffolds are derived from whole stable and soluble structural modules found in human body fluid proteins and from other sources in nature for example but not limited to thermophilic bacteria . Consequently they exhibit better folding and thermostability properties than antibody fragments whose creation involves the removal of parts of the antibody native fold often exposing amino acid residues that in an intact antibody would be buried in a hydrophobic environment such as an interface between variable and constant domains. Exposure of such hydrophobic residues to solvent increases the likelihood of aggregation.

Moreover the scaffolds of the invention provide the functional advantages of antibody molecules. In particular despite the fact that the scaffold is not an immunoglobulin its overall fold is close to that of the variable region of the IgG heavy chain making it possible to display its three loops in an analogous fashion to antibody CDRs in relative orientations. Because of this structure the scaffolds of the invention possess antigen binding properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. As a result loop randomization and shuffling strategies may be employed in vitro that are similar to the process of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo.

The scaffolds of the present invention are based on the structure of a fibronectin module of type III FnIII a domain found in mammalian blood and structural proteins. This domain occurs often in the proteins sequenced to date including fibronectins tenascin intracellular cytoskeletal proteins cytokine receptors and prokaryotic enzymes Bork and Doolittle Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 8990 1992 Bork et al. Nature Biotech. 15 553 1997 Meinke et al. J. Bacteriol. 175 1910 1993 Watanabe et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265 15659 1990 . Although the domain appears many times in nature the amino acid sequences are quite divergent. In particular these scaffolds include the third FnIII domain of tenascin C also known as the Tn3 domain . The overall fold of this domain is closely related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment the variable region of the heavy chain which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG.

In addition the Tn3 domain possesses exposed loop sequences tolerant of randomization facilitating the generation of diverse pools of protein scaffolds capable of binding specific targets with high affinity.

These protein scaffolds may be utilized for the purpose of designing proteins which are capable of binding to virtually any compound for example any protein of interest. In particular the molecules based on the Tn3 structural motif described herein may be used as scaffolds which are subjected to directed evolution designed to randomize one or more of the loops which are analogous to the complementarity determining regions CDRs of an antibody variable region. Such a directed evolution approach results in the production of antibody like molecules with high affinities for antigens of interest. In addition the scaffolds described herein may be used to display defined exposed loops for example loops previously randomized and selected on the basis of antigen binding in order to direct the evolution of molecules that bind to such introduced loops. A selection of this type may be carried out to identify recognition molecules for any individual CDR like loop or alternatively for the recognition of two or all three CDR like loops combined into a non linear epitope binding moiety.

A set of three loops of Tn3 corresponding to the antigen binding loops of the IgG heavy chain run between amino acid residues 23 31 BC 50 56 DE and 75 84 FG . The length of the BC DE and FG loops 9 6 and 10 residues respectively fall within the narrow range of the corresponding antigen recognition loops found in antibody heavy chains that is 7 10 4 8 and 4 28 residue lengths respectively. Alternatively in another embodiment the BC DE and FG loops may run between amino acid residues 23 to 31 51 to 56 and 75 to 84 respectively. Accordingly once randomized and selected for high antigen affinity these loops may make contacts with antigens equivalent to the contacts of the corresponding loops in antibodies. The AB CD and EF loops of the Tn3 domain also share this property and hence also are available for randomization and selection for high affinity for antigens. This process may be accomplished in parallel or in series with the randomization of the BC DE and FG loops.

In an effort to increase the stability of scaffolds of the invention a bioinformatics approach was utilized to identify candidate positions suitable for engineering of a disulfide bond. However disulfide design by manual inspection of protein structures to identify candidate residue pairs in close proximity is often unproductive due to the strict geometric constraints required by that type of bond see Dombkowski Bioinformatics Vol. 19 No. 14 2003 1852 1853 .

The increase in stability contributed by the engineering of disulfide bonds can be readily measured by techniques well known in the art such as thermal T and chaotropic denaturation such as urea or guanidine protease treatment such as thermolysin or another art accepted stability parameter. A comprehensive review of techniques used to measure protein stability can be found for example in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology and Current Protocols in Protein Science by John Wiley and Sons. 2007.

In one embodiment the disulfide containing scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increase in stability of at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 or at least 95 or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering as measured by thermal tolerance resistance to chaotropic denaturation protease treatment or another stability parameter well known in the art.

The stability of a protein may be measured by the level of fluorescence exhibited by the protein under varying conditions. There is a positive correlation between the relative unfoldedness of a protein and a change in the internal fluorescence the protein exhibits under stress. Suitable protein stability assays to measure thermal characteristics include Differential Scanning calorimetry DSC and Circular Dichroism CD . When the protein demonstrates a sizable shift in parameters measured by DSC or CD it correlates to an unfolded structure the temperature at which this shift is made is termed the melting temperature or T . In one embodiment the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increased melting temperature T of at least greater than 45 C. at least greater than 50 C. at least greater than 55 C. at least greater than 60 C. at least greater than 65 C. at least greater than 70 C. at least greater than 71 C. at least greater than 72 C. at least greater than 73 C. at least greater than 74 C. at least greater than 75 C. at least greater than 76 C. at least greater than 77 C. at least greater than 78 C. at least greater than 79 C. at least greater than 80 C. at least greater than 81 C. at least greater than 82 C. at least greater than 83 C. at least greater than 84 C. at least greater than 85 C. at least greater than 85 C. at least greater than 86 C. at least greater than 87 C. at least greater than 88 C. at least greater than 89 C. at least greater than 90 C. at least greater than 91 C. at least greater than 92 C. at least greater than 93 C. at least greater than 94 C. at least greater than 94 C. at least greater than at least greater than 95 C. at least greater than 96 C. at least greater than 97 C. or at least greater than 98 C. or at least greater than 100 C. or at least greater than 105 or at least greater than 110 or at least greater than 120 than the melting temperature T exhibited by the same scaffold prior to engineering under the same experimental conditions.

In another embodiment the disulfide engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit an increased melting temperature T of at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 or at least 95 or more compared to the same scaffold prior to disulfide engineering under the same experimental conditions.

Another assay for protein stability involves exposing a protein to a chaotropic agent such as urea or guanidine for example guanidine HCl or guanidine isothiocynate which acts to destabilize interactions within the protein. Upon exposing the protein to increasing levels of urea or guanidine the relative internal fluorescence is measured to asses a value in which 50 of the protein molecules are unfolded.

The scaffolds described herein may be used in any technique for evolving new or improved target binding proteins. In one particular example the target is immobilized on a solid support such as a column resin or microtiter plate well and the target contacted with a library of candidate scaffold based binding proteins. Such a library may consist of clones constructed from the Tn3 motif based scaffold through randomization of the sequence and or the length of the CDR like loops. In one embodiment the library may be a phage phagemid virus bacterial or yeast display or a ribosome display library. If desired this library may be an RNA protein fusion library generated for example by the techniques described in Szostak et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 258 558 B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 261 804 B1 U.S. Pat. No. 5 643 768 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 658 754. Alternatively it may be a DNA protein library for example as described in Lohse DNA Protein Fusions and Uses Thereof U.S. Ser.

In this regard bacteriophage phage display is one well known technique which allows one to screen large oligopeptide libraries to identify member s of those libraries which are capable of specifically binding to a target. Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles Scott J. K. and Smith G. P. 1990 Science 249 386 . The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein variants or randomly cloned cDNAs can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity.

USA 88 8363 libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides or oligopeptides for ones with specific binding properties Smith G. P. 1991 Current Opin. Biotechnol. 2 668 . Sorting phage libraries of random mutants requires a strategy for constructing and propagating a large number of variants a procedure for affinity purification using the target receptor and a means of evaluating the results of binding enrichments see for example U.S. Pat.

Many other improvements and variations of the basic phage display concept have now been developed. These improvements enhance the ability of display systems to screen peptide libraries for binding to selected target molecules and to display functional proteins with the potential of screening these proteins for desired properties. Combinatorial reaction devices for phage display reactions have been developed WO 98 14277 and phage display libraries have been used to analyze and control bimolecular interactions WO 98 20169 WO 98 20159 and properties of constrained helical peptides WO 98 20036 . WO 97 35196 describes a method of isolating an affinity ligand in which a phage display library is contacted with one solution in which the ligand will bind to a target molecule and a second solution in which the affinity ligand will not bind to the target molecule to selectively isolate binding ligands. WO 97 46251 describes a method of biopanning a random phage display library with an affinity purified antibody and then isolating binding phage followed by a micropanning process using microplate wells to isolate high affinity binding phage. The use of protein A as an affinity tag has also been reported Li et al. 1998 Mol Biotech. 9 187 . WO 97 47314 describes the use of substrate subtraction libraries to distinguish enzyme specificities using a combinatorial library which may be a phage display library. A method for selecting enzymes suitable for use in detergents using phage display is described in WO 97 09446. Additional methods of selecting specific binding proteins are described in U.S. Pat.

For the present libraries of the invention a bioinformatics approach was employed to determine the loop length and diversity preferences of naturally occurring Tn3 structural motifs see Example 2 . During this analysis the preferences for loop length and sequence diversity were employed to develop a restricted randomization approach. In this restricted randomization the relative loop length and sequence preferences were incorporated into the development of a library strategy. For example it was determined that one loop length preference for the BC loop was 9 residues. Upon further analysis of 9 residue containing BC loops it was determined whether there was a preference for a particular amino acid or group of amino acids at that position or if the position was completely random. Integrating the loop length and sequence diversity analysis into library development resulted in a restricted randomization i.e. certain positions within the randomized loop were limited in which amino acid could reside in that position . Examples of the restricted randomization approach are described in the Examples see Example 2 .

The library is incubated with the immobilized target the support is washed to remove non specific binders and the tightest binders are eluted under very stringent conditions and subjected to PCR to recover the sequence information or to create a new library of binders which may be used to repeat the selection process with or without further mutagenesis of the sequence.

A further embodiment of the invention is a collection of isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding a library comprising the scaffolds of the invention and as described above.

A further practical consideration in the design of these Tn3 libraries was to identify an alternative to the NNK N A G T C K G T mixed codon scheme typically used in degenerate oligonucleotides to code for any amino acid. Although the NNK mixture gives 32 different codons which code for all 20 amino acids they are not encoded equally Table 11 . For instance 3 32 codons in the NNK scheme code for Leu CTG CTT TTG but only 1 32 codes for Asp GAT . In addition the NNK mixture encodes one stop codon TAG and a Cys codon TGT neither of which is desirable when generating naive libraries. In considering an alternative scheme we took note of the fact that synthetic antibody libraries have been described which encode CDR sequences composed of a small subset of amino acids. Antibody libraries with CDR s composed of just 4 amino acids Tyr Ala Asp Ser or even a binary pair Tyr Ser have been shown to yield specific high affinity mAbs to protein antigens Fellouse et al Proc Natl Acad Sci 2004 101 12467 72 Fellouse et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2005 348 1153 62 . Similarly a library of 10Fn3 scaffold proteins with randomized loop sequences comprising just Tyr and Ser also yielded specific binders to a protein target Koide et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 2007 104 66 32 7 . Although libraries containing highly restricted sets of amino acids are able to produce specific binding proteins it is likely that the diversity of binders that are obtained from a library will be limited. We therefore designed an alternate NHT mixed codon scheme for introducing diversity into a Tn3 library H A T C . NHT mixes code for a reasonable subset of the 20 amino acids but avoid the disadvantages described with NNK mixed codons Table 12 . This scheme generates 12 codons that code for 12 20 amino acids that is each codon codes for a unique amino acid. Moreover there are no stop or Cys codons. Accordingly in some embodiments scaffolds of the invention comprise codons encoded by the NHT codon scheme. In other embodiments scaffolds of the invention comprise codons encoded by the NNK mixed codon scheme.

In other embodiments the scaffolds of the invention may be subjected to affinity maturation. In this art accepted process a specific binding protein is subject to a scheme that selects for increased affinity for a specific target see Wu et al. Proc Natl Aca Sci USA. May 1998 26 95 11 6037 42 . The resultant scaffolds of the invention may exhibit binding characteristics at least as high as compared to the scaffolds prior to affinity maturation.

In other embodiments the scaffolds of the invention may be subjected to loop grafting analogous to CDR grafting for antibodies. In this art accepted process one or more CDRs from an antibody are grafted onto an acceptor antibody or in this example a scaffold of the invention see Ewert et al. Methods 2004 October 34 2 184 99 . In another embodiment at least one loop from another scaffold may be grafted onto a scaffold of the invention.

The invention also provides methods of identifying the amino acid sequence of a protein scaffold capable of binding to target so as to form a scaffold target complex. In one embodiment the method comprises the steps of a providing a polypeptide display library of the invention b contacting the polypeptide display library of a with an immobilized or separable target c separating the scaffold target complexes from the free scaffolds d causing the replication of the separated scaffolds of c so as to result in a new polypeptide display library distinguished from that in a by having a lowered diversity and by being enriched in displayed scaffolds capable of binding the target e optionally repeating steps b c and d with the new library of d and f determining the nucleic acid sequence of the region encoding the displayed scaffold of a species from d and hence deducing the peptide sequence capable of binding to the target.

In a further embodiment the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one at least two at least three at least four at least five or at least six randomized loops which were previously randomized in the first library.

In another embodiment the further randomized scaffold is subjected to a subsequent method of identifying a scaffold capable of binding a target said method comprising a contacting said further randomized scaffold with an immobilized or separable target b separating the further randomized scaffold target complexes from the free scaffolds c causing the replication of the separated scaffolds of b optionally repeating steps a c and d determining the nucleic acid sequence of the region encoding said further randomized scaffold and hence deducing the peptide sequence capable of binding to the target. In a further embodiment the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one at least two at least three at least four at least five or at least six randomized loops and at least one at least two at least three at least four at least five at least six or at least seven strands which were previously randomized in the first library. In an alternate further embodiment the further randomized scaffolds comprise at least one at least two at least three at least four at least five or at least six randomized loops and at least one at least two at least three at least four at least five at least six or at least seven strands which were not previously randomized in the first library.

In another embodiment one method of obtaining a scaffold of the invention involves a first randomized loop selected from the group consisting of BC DE and FG loops and a second loop not randomized in said library selected from the group consisting of AB CD and EF loops. In yet another embodiment another method of obtaining a scaffold of the invention involves a first randomized loop selected from the group consisting of AB CD EF loops and a second loop not randomized in said library selected from the group consisting of BC DE and FG loops.

The invention also provides a method obtaining at least two scaffolds that bind to at least one or more targets. This method allows for the screening of agents that act cooperatively to elicit a particular response. It may be advantageous to use such a screen when an agonistic activity requiring the cooperation of more than one scaffold is required for example but not limited to agonism of a receptor tyrosine kinase . This method allows for the screening of cooperative agents without the reformatting of the library to form multimeric complexes. In one embodiment the method of the invention comprises contacting a target ligand with a library of the invention under conditions that allow a scaffold target ligand complex to form engaging said scaffolds with a crosslinking agent defined as an agent that brings together in close proximity at least two identical or distinct scaffolds wherein the crosslinking of the scaffolds elicits a detectable response and obtaining from the complex said scaffolds that bind the target. In a further embodiment the crosslinking agent is a scaffold specific antibody or fragment thereof an epitope tag specific antibody of a fragment thereof a dimerization domain such as Fc region a leucine zipper motif a chemical crosslinker or another dimerization domain known in the art.

The invention also provides methods of detecting a compound utilizing the scaffolds of the invention. Based on the binding specificities of the scaffolds obtained by library screening it is possible to use such scaffolds in assays to detect the specific target in a sample such as for diagnostic methods. In one embodiment the method of detecting a compound comprises contacting said compound in a sample with a scaffold of the invention under conditions that allow a compound scaffold complex to form and detecting said scaffold thereby detecting said compound in a sample. In further embodiments the scaffold is labeled i.e. radiolabel fluorescent enzyme linked or colorimetric label to facilitate the detection of said compound.

The invention also provides methods of capturing a compound utilizing the scaffolds of the invention. Based on the binding specificities of the scaffolds obtained by library screening it is possible to use such scaffolds in assays to capture the specific target in a sample such as for purification methods. In one embodiment the method of capturing a compound in a sample comprises contacting said compound in a sample with a scaffold of the invention under conditions that allow the formation of a compound scaffold complex and removing said complex from the sample thereby capturing said compound in said sample. In further embodiments the scaffold is immobilized to facilitate the removing of the compound scaffold complex.

In some embodiments scaffolds isolated from libraries of the invention comprise at least one at least two at least four at least five at least six or more randomized loop regions. In some embodiments isolated scaffold loop sequences may be swapped from a donor scaffold to any loop in a receiver scaffold for example an AB loop sequence from a donor scaffold may be transferred to an y loop region in a receiver scaffold . In specific embodiments an isolated loop sequences may be transferred to the cognate loop in the receiving scaffold for example an AB loop sequence from a donor scaffold may be transferred to a receiver scaffold in the AB loop position . In some embodiments isolated loop sequences may be mix and matched randomly with various receiver scaffolds.

In other embodiments isolated scaffolds sequences may be identified by the loop sequence. For example a library is used to pan against a particular target and an collection of specific binders are isolated. The randomized loop sequences may be characterized as specific sequences independently of the scaffold background i.e. The scaffold that binds target X wherein said scaffold comprises an AB loop sequence of SEQ ID NO x . In alternative embodiments where a scaffold exhibits two loop sequences that bind target X the loop sequences may be characterized as binding target X in the absence of the scaffold sequence. In other words it is contemplated that scaffolds isolated from a library that bind a particular target may be expressed as the variable loop sequences that bind that target independent of the scaffold backbone. This process would be analogous to the concept of CDRs in variable regions of antibodies.

In addition to scaffold monomers any of the scaffold constructs described herein may be generated as dimers or multimers of scaffolds as a means to increase the valency and thus the avidity of antigen binding. Also any of the scaffold constructs described herein may be generated as dimers or multimers of scaffolds as a means to increase the specificity of antigen binding for example scaffolds may be generated that bind distinct antigens . Such multimers multimeric scaffolds or also known herein as multivalent scaffolds may be generated through covalent binding between individual scaffold modules for example by the inclusion of an amino acid linker. In other methods the multimeric scaffolds may be assembled through use of dimerization domains known in the art. In particular examples covalently bonded scaffolds may be generated by constructing fusion genes that encode the monomeric scaffolds or alternatively by engineering codons for cysteine residues into monomer sequences and allowing disulfide bond formation to occur between the expression products.

Non covalently bonded multimeric scaffolds may also be generated by a variety of techniques. These include the introduction into monomer sequences of codons corresponding to positively and or negatively charged residues and allowing interactions between these residues in the expression products and therefore between the monomers to occur. This approach may be simplified by taking advantage of charged residues naturally present in a monomer subunit. Another means for generating non covalently bonded scaffolds is to introduce into the monomer scaffold gene for example at the amino or carboxy termini the coding sequences for proteins or protein domains known to interact. Such proteins or protein domains include coil coil motifs leucine zipper motifs and any of the numerous protein subunits or fragments thereof known to direct formation of dimers or higher order multimers.

In some embodiments multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise at least one scaffold fused to any domain or fragment of an antibody. In some embodiments at least one scaffold is fused to an antibody variable domain a CH1 domain a Ckappa domain a Clambda domain a CH2 or a CH3 domain. In other embodiments at least one scaffold is fused to the CH2 domain of an antibody Fc. In such embodiments the resulting protein when expressed will be bivalent for a particular target through the dimerization of the CH2 and CH3 regions of the antibody Fc fragment. In further embodiments the scaffold of the invention replaces the antibody variable region connected to the Fc fragment. In alternative embodiments the scaffold of the invention does not replace the antibody variable region connected to the CH1 Fc fragment Ckappa or Clambda domains.

In further embodiments multimeric scaffolds are constructed by fusing scaffolds to the CH1 and the Ckappa or Clamdba regions of an antibody. In some embodiments the scaffolds of the invention replace the antibody variable regions fused to the CH1 and the Ckappa or Clambda regions of an antibody. In further embodiments scaffolds of the invention may be fused to the C terminus of the light chain or heavy chain of an antibody. In other embodiments scaffolds of the invention may be fused to the N terminus of the light chain or heavy chain of an antibody.

In some embodiments multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise scaffolds that are specific for the same epitope. In other embodiments multimeric scaffolds of the invention comprise scaffolds that are specific for different epitopes otherwise known as an epitope binding domain. Multimeric scaffolds of the invention may be assembled and utilized as shown in Multispecific epitope binding proteins and uses thereof U.S. application Ser. No. 12 182 975 filed Jul. 30 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Such epitope binding domains may be selected from an antibody an antibody fragment a diabody an scFv a Fab a Fv or a binding peptide.

In other embodiments the epitope binding domain will be specific for the same target as that of the scaffold of the invention.

In another embodiment the epitope binding domain will be specific for a different target as that of the scaffold of the invention.

Choosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two or more scaffolds are to be connected may depend on a variety of parameters including e.g. the nature of the monomer domains and or the stability of the peptide linker towards proteolysis and oxidation.

The linker polypeptide may predominantly include amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly Ser Ala and Thr. For example the peptide linker may contain at least 75 calculated on the basis of the total number of residues present in the peptide linker such as at least 80 e.g. at least 85 or at least 90 of amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly Ser Ala and Thr. The peptide linker may also consist of Gly Ser Ala and or Thr residues only. The linker polypeptide should have a length which is adequate to link two or more monomer domains of the invention or two or more multimeric scaffolds of the invention in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity.

A suitable length for this purpose is a length of at least one and typically fewer than about 50 amino acid residues such as 2 25 amino acid residues 5 20 amino acid residues 5 15 amino acid residues 8 12 amino acid residues or 11 residues. Similarly the polypeptide encoding a linker can range in size e.g. from about 2 to about 15 amino acids from about 3 to about 15 from about 4 to about 12 about 10 about 8 or about 6 amino acids. In methods and compositions involving nucleic acids such as DNA RNA or combinations of both the polynucleotide containing the linker sequence can be e.g. between about 6 nucleotides and about 45 nucleotides between about 9 nucleotides and about 45 nucleotides between about 12 nucleotides and about 36 nucleotides about 30 nucleotides about 24 nucleotides or about 18 nucleotides. Likewise the amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker polypeptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity or function of the polypeptide multimer. Thus the peptide linker should on the whole not exhibit a charge which would be inconsistent with the activity or function of the polypeptide multimer or interfere with internal folding or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the monomer domains which would seriously impede the binding of the polypeptide multimer to specific targets.

The peptide linker may also be selected from a library where the amino acid residues in the peptide linker are randomized for a specific set of monomer domains in a particular polypeptide multimer. A flexible linker could be used to find suitable combinations of monomer domains which is then optimized using this random library of variable linkers to obtain linkers with optimal length and geometry. The optimal linkers may contain the minimal number of amino acid residues of the right type that participate in the binding to the target and restrict the movement of the monomer domains relative to each other in the polypeptide multimer when not bound to specific targets.

The use of naturally occurring as well as artificial peptide linkers to connect polypeptides into novel linked fusion polypeptides is well known in the literature Hallewell et al. 1989 J. Biol. Chem. 264 5260 5268 Alfthan et al. 1995 Protein Eng. 8 725 731 Robinson Sauer 1996 Biochemistry 35 109 116 Khandekar et al. 1997 J. Biol. Chem. 272 32190 32197 Fares et al. 1998 Endocrinology 139 2459 2464 Smallshaw et al. 1999 Protein Eng. 12 623 630 U.S. Pat. No. 5 856 456 .

As mentioned above it is generally preferred that the peptide linker possess at least some flexibility. Accordingly in some embodiments the peptide linker contains 1 25 glycine residues 5 20 glycine residues 5 15 glycine residues or 8 12 glycine residues. The peptide linker will typically contain at least 50 glycine residues such as at least 75 glycine residues. In some embodiments of the invention the peptide linker comprises glycine residues only. In specific embodiments linker sequences may comprise a sequence of G G G G S SEQ ID NO 260 where x is a positive integer. In another specific embodiment linker sequences may comprise a sequence of G A where x is a positive integer. In another specific embodiment linker sequences may comprise a sequence of G G G T P T SEQ ID NO 261 where x is a positive integer.

In some cases it may be desirable or necessary to provide some rigidity into the peptide linker. This may be accomplished by including proline residues in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. Thus in another embodiment of the invention the peptide linker may comprise at least one proline residue in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. For example the peptide linker has an amino acid sequence wherein at least 25 such as at least 50 e.g. at least 75 of the amino acid residues are proline residues. In one particular embodiment of the invention the peptide linker comprises proline residues only.

In some embodiments of the invention the peptide linker is modified in such a way that an amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for a non polypeptide moiety is introduced. Examples of such amino acid residues may be a cysteine residue to which the non polypeptide moiety is then subsequently attached or the amino acid sequence may include an in vivo N glycosylation site thereby attaching a sugar moiety in vivo to the peptide linker . An additional option is to genetically incorporate non natural amino acids using evolved tRNAs and tRNA synthetases see e.g. U.S. patent application Publication Ser. No. 2003 0082575 into the monomer domains or linkers. For example insertion of keto tyrosine allows for site specific coupling to expressed monomer domains or multimers.

Sometimes the amino acid sequences of all peptide linkers present in the polypeptide multimer will be identical. Alternatively the amino acid sequences of all peptide linkers present in the polypeptide multimer may be different.

The scaffolds described herein may be fused to other protein domains. For example these scaffolds may be integrated with the human immune response by fusing the constant region of an IgG Fc with a scaffold through the N or C terminus. The Fc fusion molecule activates the complement component of the immune response and increases the therapeutic value of the protein scaffold. Similarly a fusion between a scaffold and a complement protein such as Clq may be used to target cells and a fusion between scaffold and a toxin may be used to specifically destroy cells that carry a particular antigen.

Additionally various publications describe methods for obtaining physiologically active molecules whose half lives are modified either by introducing an FcRn binding polypeptide into the molecules WO 97 43316 U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046 U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 035 WO 96 32478 WO 91 14438 or by fusing the molecules with antibodies whose FcRn binding affinities are preserved but affinities for other Fc receptors have been greatly reduced WO 99 43713 or fusing with FcRn binding domains of antibodies WO 00 09560 U.S. Pat. No. 4 703 039 . Specific techniques and methods of increasing half life of physiologically active molecules can also be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7 083 784 granted Aug. 1 2006 entitled Antibodies with Increased Half lives which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. Specifically it is contemplated that the scaffolds of the invention can be fused to an Fc region from an IgG wherein said Fc region comprises amino acid residue mutations as numbered by the EU index in Kabat M252Y S254T T256E or H433K N434F Y436H.

In addition the scaffolds of the invention may be fused with molecules that increases or extends in vivo or serum half life. In some embodiments the scaffolds of the invention associate with albumin such as human serum albumin HSA polyethylene glycol PEG polysaccharides immunoglobulin molecules IgG complement hemoglobin a binding peptide lipoproteins and other factors to increase its half life in the bloodstream and or its tissue penetration. Any of these fusions may be generated by standard techniques for example by expression of the fusion protein from a recombinant fusion gene constructed using publicly available gene sequences.

Also the scaffolds of the invention may bind or associate with molecules that increases or extends in vivo or serum half life. In some embodiments the scaffolds of the invention associate with albumin polyethylene glycol PEG polysaccharides immunoglobulin molecules or immunoglobulin molecules having Fc mutations that increase serum half life complement hemoglobin lipoproteins and other factors to increase serum half life. Any of these fusions may be generated by standard techniques for example by expression of the fusion protein from a recombinant fusion gene constructed using publicly available gene sequences.

The term polyethylene glycol or PEG means a polyethylene glycol compound or a derivative thereof with or without coupling agents coupling or activating moieties e.g. with thiol triflate tresylate azirdine oxirane N hydroxysuccinimide or a maleimide moiety . The term PEG is intended to indicate polyethylene glycol of a molecular weight between 500 and 150 000 Da including analogues thereof wherein for instance the terminal OH group has been replaced by a methoxy group referred to as mPEG .

In one embodiment the scaffolds are derivatized with polyethylene glycol PEG . PEG is a linear water soluble polymer of ethylene oxide repeating units with two terminal hydroxyl groups. PEGs are classified by their molecular weights which typically range from about 500 daltons to about 40 000 daltons. In a presently preferred embodiment the PEGs employed have molecular weights ranging from 5 000 daltons to about 20 000 daltons. PEGs coupled to the scaffolds of the invention can be either branched or unbranched. See for example Monfardini C. et al. 1995 Bioconjugate Chem 6 62 69 . PEGs are commercially available from Nektar Inc. Sigma Chemical Co. and other companies. Such PEGs include but are not limited to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol MePEG OH monomethoxypolyethylene glycol succinate MePEG S monomethoxypolyethylene glycol succinimidyl succinate MePEG S NHS monomethoxypolyethylene glycol amine MePEG NH2 monomethoxypolyethylene glycol tresylate MePEG TRES and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol imidazolyl carbonyl MePEG IM .

Briefly in one embodiment the hydrophilic polymer which is employed for example PEG is capped at one end by an unreactive group such as a methoxy or ethoxy group. Thereafter the polymer is activated at the other end by reaction with a suitable activating agent such as cyanuric halides for example cyanuric chloride bromide or fluoride diimadozle an anhydride reagent for example a dihalosuccinic anhydride such as dibromosuccinic anhydride acyl azide p diazoiumbenzyl ether 3 p diazoniumphenoxy 2 hydroxypropylether and the like. The activated polymer is then reacted with a polypeptide as described herein to produce a polypeptide derivatized with a polymer. Alternatively a functional group in the scaffolds of the invention can be activated for reaction with the polymer or the two groups can be joined in a concerted coupling reaction using known coupling methods. It will be readily appreciated that the polypeptides of the invention can be derivatized with PEG using a myriad of other reaction schemes known to and used by those of skill in the art.

In some embodiments scaffolds of the invention are engineered to provide reactive groups for conjugation. In such scaffolds the N terminus and or C terminus may also serve to provide reactive groups for conjugation. In other embodiments the N terminus may be conjugated to one moiety such as but not limited to PEG while the C terminus is conjugated to another moiety such as but not limited to biotin or vice versa.

The term in vivo half life is used in its normal meaning i.e. the time at which 50 of the biological activity of the polypeptide is still present in the body target organ or the time at which the activity of the polypeptide is 50 of its initial value. As an alternative to determining functional in vivo half life serum half life may be determined i.e. the time at which 50 of the polypeptide molecules circulate in the plasma or bloodstream prior to being cleared. Determination of serum half life is often more simple than determining functional half life and the magnitude of serum half life is usually a good indication of the magnitude of functional in vivo half life. Alternative terms to serum half life include plasma half life circulating half life circulatory half life serum clearance plasma clearance and clearance half life. The functionality to be retained is normally selected from procoagulant proteolytic co factor binding receptor binding activity or other type of biological activity associated with the particular protein.

The term increased with respect to the functional in vivo half life or plasma half life is used to indicate that the relevant half life of the polypeptide is statistically significantly increased relative to that of a reference molecule for example an unmodified polypeptide as determined under comparable conditions. For instance the relevant half life may be increased by at least about 25 such as by at least about 50 e.g. by at least about 100 at least about 150 at least about 200 at least about 250 or at least about 500 compared to an unmodified reference molecule. In other embodiments the half life may be increased by about at least 1 fold at least 2 fold at least 3 fold at least 4 fold at least 5 fold at least 10 fold at least 20 fold or at least 50 fold as compared to an unmodified reference molecule.

The present invention encompasses the use of scaffolds conjugated or fused to one or more moieties including but not limited to peptides polypeptides proteins fusion proteins nucleic acid molecules small molecules mimetic agents synthetic drugs inorganic molecules and organic molecules. The present invention encompasses the use of scaffolds recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated including both covalent and non covalent conjugations to a heterologous protein or polypeptide or fragment thereof to a polypeptide of at least 10 at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct but may occur through linker sequences described herein. For example scaffolds may be used to target heterologous polypeptides to particular cell types either in vitro or in vivo by fusing or conjugating the scaffolds to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Scaffolds fused or conjugated to heterologous polypeptides may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art.

Additional fusion proteins comprising scaffolds of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of scaffolds of the invention e.g. scaffolds with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates . See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. 1997 Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8 724 33 Harayama 1998 Trends Biotechnol. 16 2 76 82 Hansson et al. 1999 J. Mol.

Further a scaffold may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety or drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. Therapeutic moieties or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include for example a toxin such as abrin ricin A exotoxin cholera toxin or diphtheria toxin a protein such as tumor necrosis factor interferon interferon nerve growth factor platelet derived growth factor tissue plasminogen activator an apoptotic agent e.g. TNF TNF AIM I see International publication No. WO 97 33899 AIM II see International Publication No. WO 97 34911 Fas Ligand Takahashi et al. 1994 J.

In certain embodiments the macrocyclic chelator is 1 4 7 10 tetraazacyclododecane N N N N tetraa cetic acid DOTA which can be attached to the scaffold via a linker molecule. Such linker molecules are commonly known in the art and described in Denardo et al. 1998 Clin Cancer Res. 4 10 2483 90 Peterson et al. 1999 Bioconjug. Chem. 10 4 553 7 and Zimmerman et al. 1999 Nucl. Med. Biol. 26 8 943 50 each incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Techniques for conjugating therapeutic moieties to antibodies are well known see e.g. Arnon et al. Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy Reisfeld et al. eds. pp. 243 56. Alan R. Liss Inc. 1985 Hellstrom et al. Antibodies For Drug Delivery in Controlled Drug Delivery 2nd Ed. Robinson et al. eds. pp. 623 53 Marcel Dekker Inc. 1987 Thorpe Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications Pinchera et al. eds. pp. 475 506 1985 Analysis Results And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy Baldwin et al. eds. pp. 303 16 Academic Press 1985 and Thorpe et al. 1982 Immunol. Rev. 62 119 58. Similar approaches may be adapted for use with scaffolds of the invention.

The therapeutic moiety or drug conjugated to a scaffold of the invention should be chosen to achieve the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect s for a particular disorder in a subject. A clinician or other medical personnel should consider the following when deciding on which therapeutic moiety or drug to conjugate to a scaffold the nature of the disease the severity of the disease and the condition of the subject.

Scaffolds of the invention may also be attached to solid supports which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include but are not limited to glass cellulose polyacrylamide nylon polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.

Recombinant expression of a scaffold of the invention requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the scaffold. Once a polynucleotide encoding a scaffold has been obtained the vector for the production of scaffold may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing a scaffold encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing scaffold polypeptide coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a scaffold of the invention operably linked to a promoter.

The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce a scaffold of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding a scaffold of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. Suitable host cells include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and .

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the scaffolds of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express a scaffold of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing scaffold coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing scaffold coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing scaffold coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing scaffold coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 NS0 and 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

Expression vectors containing inserts of a gene encoding a scaffold of the invention can be identified by three general approaches a nucleic acid hybridization b presence or absence of marker gene functions and c expression of inserted sequences. In the first approach the presence of a gene encoding a peptide polypeptide protein or a fusion protein in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to an inserted gene encoding the peptide polypeptide protein or the fusion protein respectively. In the second approach the recombinant vector host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain marker gene functions e.g. thymidine kinase activity resistance to antibiotics transformation phenotype occlusion body formation in baculovirus etc. caused by the insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody or fusion protein in the vector. For example if the nucleotide sequence encoding the scaffold is inserted within the marker gene sequence of the vector recombinants containing the gene encoding the scaffold insert can be identified by the absence of the marker gene function. In the third approach recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying the gene product e.g. scaffold or multimer thereof expressed by the recombinant. Such assays can be based for example on the physical or functional properties of the protein in in vitro assay systems e.g. binding agonistic or antagonistic properties of the scaffold.

In some embodiments the scaffolds of the invention may be chemically synthesized at least partially. In other embodiments the scaffolds of the invention may be produced semi synthetically.

Once a scaffold of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of a protein for example by chromatography e.g. metal chelate chromatography ion exchange affinity and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.

The highly stable nature of the scaffolds of the invention allow for variations on purification schemes. For example the thermal stability exhibited by the scaffolds of the invention allow for the heating of the crude lysate comprising the scaffolds to remove the bulk of the host cell proteins by denaturation. In another embodiment the high protease resistance exhibited by the scaffolds of the invention allow for the rapid degradation of host cell proteins in crude lysates prior to any purification steps. Also the pH tolerance exhibited by the scaffolds of the invention allow for the selective precipitation of host cell proteins in the crude lysate by lowering or raising the pH prior to any purification steps. In some embodiments the purification of the scaffolds of the invention are facilitated by a high temperature shift a protease treatment a pH shift up or down or a combination of any of the above in an effort to remove bulk host cell proteins from the crude lysate. In some embodiments the protein remaining after the heat denaturation protease treatment of pH shift is at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 or at least 95 specific scaffold protein.

In other embodiments methods of purification comprise raising the pH of the crude lysate containing said scaffold to about 8.0 or to about 8.5 or to about 9.0 or to about 9.5 or to about 10.0 or to about 10.5 or to about 11.0 or to about 11.5 or to about 12.0 or to about 12.5 in an effort to precipitate the host cell protein.

The scaffolds of the invention may be assayed for specific binding to a target by any method known in the art. Representative assays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitation reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York .

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen e.g. a scaffold coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen adding the epitope binding protein of interest e.g. a scaffold specific antibody conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the epitope binding protein of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the protein of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the antigen the protein of interest may be coated to the well. In this case a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity and other binding properties of a scaffold to an antigen may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods known in the art including for example equilibrium methods e.g. enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA or radioimmunoassay RIA or kinetics e.g. BIACORE analysis and other methods such as indirect binding assays competitive binding assays fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET gel electrophoresis and chromatography e.g. gel filtration . These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in Paul W.E. ed. Fundamental Immunology 4th Ed. Lippincott Raven Philadelphia 1999 .

The stability of scaffolds of the invention may be increased by many different approaches. In one embodiment the scaffolds of the invention comprise a non naturally occurring disulfide bond as described herein. In another embodiment the scaffolds of the invention comprise an elongation of the N and or C terminal regions. In another embodiment the scaffolds of the invention comprise an addition deletion or substitution of at least one amino acid residue to adjust the surface charge of the scaffold.

The stability of scaffolds of the invention may be assessed by many different techniques. A selection of techniques know in the art include melting temperature Differential scanning calorimetry DSC Circular Dichroism CD Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE protease resistance Isothermal calorimetry ITC nuclear magnetic resonance NMR internal fluorescence and biological activity. In one embodiment engineered scaffolds of the invention exhibit increased stability compared to the same scaffold prior to engineering.

In another aspect the present invention provides a composition for example but not limited to a pharmaceutical composition containing one or a combination of scaffolds or target binding proteins of the present invention formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may include one or a combination of for example but not limited to two or more different scaffolds of the invention. For example a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a combination of scaffolds that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen or that have complementary activities.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention also can be administered in combination therapy such as combined with other agents. For example the combination therapy can include a scaffold of the present invention combined with at least one other therapy wherein the therapy may be immunotherapy chemotherapy radiation treatment or drug therapy.

The pharmaceutical compounds of the invention may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids such as hydrochloric nitric phosphoric sulfuric hydrobromic hydroiodic phosphorous and the like as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids phenyl substituted alkanoic acids hydroxy alkanoic acids aromatic acids aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals such as sodium potassium magnesium calcium and the like as well as from nontoxic organic amines such as N N dibenzylethylenediamine N methylglucamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine procaine and the like.

A pharmaceutical composition of the invention also may include a pharmaceutically acceptable anti oxidant. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include 1 water soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid cysteine hydrochloride sodium bisulfate sodium metabisulfite sodium sulfite and the like 2 oil soluble antioxidants such as ascorbyl palmitate butylated hydroxyanisole BHA butylated hydroxytoluene BHT lecithin propyl gallate alpha tocopherol and the like and 3 metal chelating agents such as citric acid ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA sorbitol tartaric acid phosphoric acid and the like.

Examples of suitable aqueous and non aqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like into the compositions. In addition prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Pharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution microemulsion liposome or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases it will be suitable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption for example monostearate salts and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above as required followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying lyophilization that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

In one embodiment the compositions e.g. liquid formulations of the invention are pyrogen free formulations which are substantially free of endotoxins and or related pyrogenic substances. Endotoxins include toxins that are confined inside a microorganism and are released when the microorganisms are broken down or die. Pyrogenic substances also include fever inducing thermostable substances glycoproteins from the outer membrane of bacteria and other microorganisms. Both of these substances can cause fever hypotension and shock if administered to humans. Due to the potential harmful effects it is advantageous to remove even low amounts of endotoxins from intravenously administered pharmaceutical drug solutions. The Food Drug Administration FDA has set an upper limit of 5 endotoxin units EU per dose per kilogram body weight in a single one hour period for intravenous drug applications The United States Pharmacopeial Convention Pharmacopeial Forum 26 1 223 2000 . When therapeutic proteins are administered in amounts of several hundred or thousand milligrams per kilogram body weight it is advantageous to remove even trace amounts of endotoxin. In one embodiment endotoxin and pyrogen levels in the composition are less then 10 EU mg or less then 5 EU mg or less then 1 EU mg or less then 0.1 EU mg or less then 0.01 EU mg or less then 0.001 EU mg. In another embodiment endotoxin and pyrogen levels in the composition are less then about 10 EU mg or less then about 5 EU mg or less then about 1 EU mg or less then about 0.1 EU mg or less then about 0.01 EU mg or less then about 0.001 EU mg.

To prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions including a scaffold of the invention scaffold is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Formulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents can be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers in the form of e.g. lyophilized powders slurries aqueous solutions lotions or suspensions see e.g. Hardman et al. 2001 Goodman and Gilman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics McGraw Hill New York N.Y. Gennaro 2000 Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Lippincott Williams and Wilkins New York N.Y. Avis et al. eds. 1993 Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Parenteral Medications Marcel Dekker NY Lieberman et al. eds. 1990 Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Tablets Marcel Dekker NY Lieberman et al. eds. 1990 Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Disperse Systems Marcel Dekker NY Weiner and Kotkoskie 2000 Excipient Toxicity and Safety Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y. .

Selecting an administration regimen for a therapeutic depends on several factors including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the entity the level of symptoms the immunogenicity of the entity and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. In certain embodiments an administration regimen maximizes the amount of therapeutic delivered to the patient consistent with an acceptable level of side effects. Accordingly the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular entity and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of antibodies cytokines and small molecules are available see e.g. Wawrzynczak 1996 Antibody Therapy Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd Oxfordshire UK Kresina ed. 1991 Monoclonal Antibodies Cytokines and Arthritis Marcel Dekker New York N.Y. Bach ed. 1993 Monoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases Marcel Dekker New York N.Y. Baert et al. 2003 New Engl. J. Med. 348 601 608 Milgrom et al. 1999 New Engl. J. Med. 341 1966 1973 Slamon et al. 2001 New Engl. J. Med. 344 783 792 Beniaminovitz et al. 2000 New Engl. J. Med. 342 613 619 Ghosh et al. 2003 New Engl. J. Med. 348 24 32 Lipsky et al. 2000 New Engl. J. Med. 343 1594 1602 .

Determination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician e.g. using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment. Generally the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of e.g. the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition and mode of administration without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed or the ester salt or amide thereof the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed the age sex weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated and like factors well known in the medical arts.

An effective amount for a particular patient may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated the overall health of the patient the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects see e.g. Maynard et al. 1996 A Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice Interpharm Press Boca Raton Fla. Dent 2001 Good Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice Urch Publ. London UK .

The route of administration may be by e.g. topical or cutaneous application injection or infusion by intravenous intraperitoneal intracerebral intramuscular intraocular intraarterial intracerebrospinal intralesional or by sustained release systems or an implant see e.g. Sidman et al. 1983 Biopolymers 22 547 556 Langer et al. 1981 J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15 167 277 Langer 1982 Chem. Tech. 12 98 105 Epstein et al. 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 3688 3692 Hwang et al. 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 4030 4034 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 350 466 and 6 316 024 . Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. In addition pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See e.g. U.S. Pat.

In one embodiment an antibody combination therapy or a composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR pulmonary drug delivery technology Alkermes Inc. Cambridge Mass. .

A composition of the present invention may also be administered via one or more routes of administration using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan the route and or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Selected routes of administration for scaffolds of the invention include intravenous intramuscular intradermal intraperitoneal subcutaneous spinal or other parenteral routes of administration for example by injection or infusion. Parenteral administration may represent modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration usually by injection and includes without limitation intravenous intramuscular intraarterial intrathecal intracapsular intraorbital intracardiac intradermal intraperitoneal transtracheal subcutaneous subcuticular intraarticular subcapsular subarachnoid intraspinal epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. Alternatively a composition of the invention can be administered via a non parenteral route such as a topical epidermal or mucosal route of administration for example intranasally orally vaginally rectally sublingually or topically.

If the scaffolds of the invention are administered in a controlled release or sustained release system a pump may be used to achieve controlled or sustained release see Langer supra Sefton 198714 20 Buchwald et al. 198088 507 Saudek et al. 1989321 574 . Polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled or sustained release of the therapies of the invention see e.g. Medical Applications of Controlled Release Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 Controlled Drug Bioavailability Drug Product Design and Performance Smolen and Ball eds. Wiley New York 1984 Ranger and Peppas 1983 J. 23 61 see also Levy et al. 1985228 190 During et al. 198925 351 Howard et al. 198971 105 U.S. Pat. No. 5 679 377 U.S. Pat. No. 5 916 597 U.S. Pat. No. 5 912 015 U.S. Pat. No. 5 989 463 U.S. Pat. No. 5 128 326 PCT Publication No. WO 99 15154 and PCT Publication No. WO 99 20253. Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include but are not limited to poly 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate poly methyl methacrylate poly acrylic acid poly ethylene co vinyl acetate poly methacrylic acid polyglycolides PLG polyanhydrides poly N vinyl pyrrolidone poly vinyl alcohol polyacrylamide poly ethylene glycol polylactides PLA poly lactide co glycolides PLGA and polyorthoesters. In one embodiment the polymer used in a sustained release formulation is inert free of leachable impurities stable on storage sterile and biodegradable. A controlled or sustained release system can be placed in proximity of the prophylactic or therapeutic target thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 .

Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer 1990 Science 249 1527 1533 . Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more scaffolds of the invention. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 526 938 PCT publication WO 91 05548 PCT publication WO 96 20698 Ning et al. 1996 Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained Release Gel 39 179 189 Song et al. 1995 Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long Circulating Emulsions PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science Technology 50 372 397 Cleek et al. 1997 Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application 24 853 854 and Lam et al. 1997 Microencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery 24 759 760 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

If the scaffold of the invention is administered topically it can be formulated in the form of an ointment cream transdermal patch lotion gel shampoo spray aerosol solution emulsion or other form well known to one of skill in the art. See e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 19th ed. Mack Pub. Co. Easton Pa. 1995 . For non sprayable topical dosage forms viscous to semi solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity in some instances greater than water are typically employed. Suitable formulations include without limitation solutions suspensions emulsions creams ointments powders liniments salves and the like which are if desired sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents e.g. preservatives stabilizers wetting agents buffers or salts for influencing various properties such as for example osmotic pressure. Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient in some instances in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier is packaged in a mixture with a pressurized volatile e.g. a gaseous propellant such as freon or in a squeeze bottle. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well known in the art.

If the scaffolds of the invention are administered intranasally it can be formulated in an aerosol form spray mist or in the form of drops. In particular prophylactic or therapeutic agents for use according to the present invention can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane carbon dioxide or other suitable gas . In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges composed of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.

Methods for co administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent e.g. a cytokine steroid chemotherapeutic agent antibiotic or radiation are well known in the art see e.g. Hardman et al. eds. 2001 Goodman and Gilman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 10.sup.th ed. McGraw Hill New York N.Y. Poole and Peterson eds. 2001 Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice A Practical Approach Lippincott Williams Wilkins Phila. Pa. Chabner and Longo eds. 2001 Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy Lippincott Williams Wilkins Phila. Pa. . An effective amount of therapeutic may decrease the symptoms by at least 10 by at least 20 at least about 30 at least 40 or at least 50 .

Additional therapies e.g. prophylactic or therapeutic agents which can be administered in combination with the scaffolds of the invention may be administered less than 5 minutes apart less than 30 minutes apart 1 hour apart at about 1 hour apart at about 1 to about 2 hours apart at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart at about 12 hours to 18 hours apart 18 hours to 24 hours apart 24 hours to 36 hours apart 36 hours to 48 hours apart 48 hours to 52 hours apart 52 hours to 60 hours apart 60 hours to 72 hours apart 72 hours to 84 hours apart 84 hours to 96 hours apart or 96 hours to 120 hours apart from the scaffolds of the invention. The two or more therapies may be administered within one same patient visit.

The scaffolds of the invention and the other therapies may be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy e.g. a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a period of time followed by the administration of a second therapy e.g. a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a period of time optionally followed by the administration of a third therapy e.g. prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a period of time and so forth and repeating this sequential administration i.e. the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the therapies to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies and or to improve the efficacy of the therapies.

In certain embodiments the scaffolds of the invention can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example the blood brain barrier BBB excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the invention cross the BBB if desired they can be formulated for example in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 522 811 5 374 548 and 5 399 331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs thus enhance targeted drug delivery see e.g. V. V. Ranade 1989 29 685 . Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 416 016 to Low et al. mannosides Umezawa et al. 1988 153 1038 antibodies P. G.

Transformants of BL21 DE3 harboring Tn3 structural motif expression plasmids were grown overnight at 37 C. in Luria Broth containing 50 g mL carbenicillum. Overnight cultures were diluted 1 in 20 into Super Broth media containing 50 g mL carbenicillum and 2 w v glucose and incubated at 37 C. with shaking until the optical density at 600 nm was 0.6. At this time protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 200 M and cultures were transferred to a 30 C. incubator with shaking After 5 h at 30 C. a small aliquot of culture was removed for SDS PAGE analysis and the remainder of cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen overnight at 20 C. SDS PAGE analysis of whole cell lysates suggested that Tn3 structural motifs 3 4 5 10 were highly overexpressed in as determined by gel bands at approximately 10 kDa . In a separate experiment it was also determined that Tn3 structural motif 12 was overexpressed.

Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer 50 mM NaHPO 300 mM NaCl 10 mM imidazole pH 8.0 containing 1 mg mL lysozyme Sigma and 200 units mL of DNase Invitrogen . Lysis was effected by sonication and clarified lysate was separated from cell debris by centrifugation followed by filtration through a 0.8 m filter. Lysates were loaded onto HiTrap chelating columns charged with Ni washed with 15 column volumes of wash buffer 50 mM NaHPO 300 mM NaCl 20 mM imidazole pH 8.0 and eluted with 4 column volumes of elution buffer 50 mM NaHPO 300 mM NaCl 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0 . The concentrations of purified protein were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm according to Gill and von Hippel Anal. Biochem. 182 319 1989 . Post purification yields of the various Tn3 proteins are reported in Table 1. The Tn3 structural motif derived from human tenascin C Tn3 gave the highest yield which corresponded to 110 mg of purified Tn3 obtained from a 400 mL culture. SDS PAGE analysis of a purified Tn3 sample is shown in .

Given the high yield of soluble Tn3 produced in this protein was analysed for its stability and solution properties.

Thermal unfolding of Tn3 was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry DSC . A 1 mg mL Tn3 sample in 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 exhibited a melting temperature Tm of 45 C. moreover thermal unfolding was reversible as evidenced by superimposable thermograms when the same sample was cooled and reheated. Tn3 was more stable to thermal unfolding at lower pH or high salt. The Tm in 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 was 56 C. and 55 C. in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 containing 1 M NaCl.

Unfolding of Tn3 by chaotropic agents was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. Samples of 0.1 mg mL Tn3 containing different concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride were prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 or 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired on a Photon Technology QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. In the absence of chaotrope folded samples of Tn3 exhibited an emission maxima at 319 nm. Unfolding of Tn3 by urea or GuHCl resulted in a red shift of the maxima to 348 nm in addition to an increase in fluorescence intensity. The midpoint of unfolding at pH 7.0 or 7.5 occurred at approximately 2M urea or 0.8M GuHCl.

The stability of Tn3 to proteolytic degradation was tested by incubation with thermolysin. Tn3 45 M in digest buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 10 mM CaCl was incubated at room temperature with thermolysin 0.45 M . Aliquots of the digest were removed at different time points and the reaction quenched by addition of excess EDTA. Samples were then analysed by SDS PAGE see the WT lanes in . As demonstrated by the wild type Tn3 domain is rapidly degraded when incubated with thermolysin.

Size exclusion chromatography with multi angle light scattering SEC MALS was used to determine whether Tn3 was monomeric in solution. Size exclusion separation was carried out using a Bio Rad Bio Sil SEC 125 5 column 7.8 300 mm at a flow rate of 0.75 mL min. The mobile phase was phosphate buffered saline PBS at pH7.2. Triple detection was accomplished using a Wyatt Technologies DAWN EOS multi angle light scattering detector coupled with a Wyatt Technologies Optilab rEX differential refractive index detector and an Agilent 1100 Series variable wavelength UV detector. SEC MALS analysis showed that the monomer content of a 4.5 mg mL Tn3 stored at 4 C. for 2 months was 97 . The experimentally derived monomer mass was 10.6 kDa which is in close agreement with the calculated mass of 10.8 kDa. The Tn3 scaffold remains as a monomer as a monomer even through extended periods of storage.

An ideal scaffold is highly soluble and stable. It should be small enough for structural analysis yet large enough to accommodate a multitude of changes to facilitate binding of a target. In an effort to facilitate the identification and engineering of non antibody protein scaffolds as well as design of combinatorial libraries of scaffolds a bioinformatics analysis of scaffold sequences was performed.

The Tn3 structural motif is small monomeric soluble and stable. In addition Tn3 structural motifs are present in many different human proteins providing important information on conserved residues which are often important for the stability and folding as well as regions of diversity which can be exploited to introduce novel binding functions. From sequence analysis large variations are seen in the BC and FG loops suggesting that the loops are not crucial to stability. Using this property a strategy was developed to identify candidate protein scaffolds and analyze the loop length and sequence diversity in an effort to characterize the natural extent of variation that occurs in these two parameters.

A search of the available protein databases identified a number of protein scaffolds based on the Tn3 structural motif. Candidate scaffolds contained a similar predicted structure to Tn3 structural motifs namely 7 beta strands each separated by a loop region. An analysis of the location of the beta strands and the loop regions revealed a pattern of diversity that may aide in the prediction of loop length and sequence compositions for candidate scaffolds for which a structure is not available. A length diversity analysis was performed for the BC DE and FG loops of candidate scaffolds in accessible protein databases.

A compilation of identified scaffold sequences has lead to the development of the loop length diversity graphs presented in and . Presented in is the BC loop length diversity obtained from the analysis of 51 sequences from the Protein Data Bank PDB . It is apparent from the graph that the BC loop length in this collection of sequences ranges from about 8 amino acid residues to about 26 amino acid residues with the 9 amino acid residue loop being the most predominant. Presented in is loop length diversity obtained from the analysis of 397 sequences identified from the Swiss prot database. It is apparent from the graph that the BC loop length in this collection of sequences ranges from about 7 amino acid residues to about 19 amino acid residues with the 12 amino acid residue loop being the most predominant. Presented in is the FG loop length diversity obtained from the analysis of 51 sequences identified from the PDB database. It is apparent from the graph that the FG loop length in this collection of sequences ranges from about 6 amino acid residues to about 18 amino acid residues with the 10 amino acid residue loop being the most predominant. A similar analysis as described herein was performed for the DE loop sequences. Presented in is the DE loop length diversity demonstrating that the length of DE loops range from about 4 amino acid residues to about 17 amino acid residues with the 6 residue loop being the most predominant length.

In addition to the length diversity for the more abundant loop lengths a sequence diversity analysis was performed in an attempt to guide the establishment of consensus sequences. Presented in is the sequence diversity graph of 9 amino acid residue BC loops. The prevalence of a particular amino acid at each position is represented by the relative size of the box containing that residue over each position. For example at position 3 of a 9 amino acid residue loop there is a preference of a proline or an alanine Also at position 5 there is a preference for glycine and alanine. At position 7 there is a preference for the amino acids valine isoleucine and phenylalanine Other positions in the loop show greater sequence diversity suggesting that these positions may be suitable for complete randomization in construction of libraries of the Tn3 scaffold. Presented in is the sequence diversity graph of 12 amino acid residue BC loops. In this analysis for example at position 3 a Proline residue is preferred. Also positions 1 4 5 and 12 appear to be suitable for complete randomization as they do not exhibit selectivity for an amino acid residue. Presented in is the sequence diversity graph for all lengths of FG loops. From this analysis position 2 is often asparagine position 5 prefers glycine position 7 is often glycine or serine. Also positions 1 3 4 6 8 9 11 12 and 13 represent candidate positions for complete randomization in library construction as they do not demonstrate selectivity for amino acid residues. The data from this analysis suggests a potential benefit of limiting loop diversity at positions showing a sequence conservation such that a greater proportion of molecules in a library may maintain WT like stability expression and solubility.

Given the loop and sequence diversity established above a directed approach to the development of libraries was performed. More specifically loops BC and FG were randomized in a restricted fashion. The following strategy was employed for the BC and FG loops.

A synthetic cDNA encoding Tn3 corresponding to the Nco I Kpn I fragment of seq. ID 10D See Section 7 for sequence was cloned into a phage display vector enabling display of Tn3 protein on the surface of M13 bacteriophage as a fusion to a fragment of the gene III coat protein. The construct encoded a 20 amino acid Thr Pro rich linker sequence between the C terminus of Tn3 and codons 251 406 of M13 gene III.

Libraries of randomly mutated Tn3 were prepared by Kunkel mutagenesis Kunkel T A et al. Methods Enzym. 204 125 1991 using degenerate oligonucleotides. Three degenerate oligonucleotides were used to randomize the coding sequence of the BC loop and three for the FG loop Table 2. . This strategy resulted in the introduction of characterized sequence and loop length diversity into the Tn3 library consistent with patterns of diversity described for natural Tn3 domains.

Following transformation of electrocompetent with randomly mutated phagemid constructs M13KO7 helper phage was added and cultures were grown overnight at 37 C. in 500 mL of 2YT medium containing carbenicillum. Phage was then isolated from culture supernatants by precipitation with a saline polyethylene glycol solution and resuspended in a small volume of PBS.

SYNAGIS was passively adsorbed onto microtitre plate wells and free sites were blocked with PBS containing 10 mg mL BSA or casein. Phage stocks were diluted with PBS containing 2 mg mL BSA or casein and 0.1 v v Tween 20. Diluted phage samples 100 L 10phage were added to SYNAGIS coated wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking Plates were then washed 10 15 times with PBS containing 0.1 v v Tween 20 and bound phage were eluted with 100 L well of 0.1M HCl then neutralized by addition of 1.0M Tris HCl pH 8.0. Eluted phage were re propagated by infection of XL 1 Blue and harvested from overnight cultures co infected with M13KO7 helper phage in 50 mL 2YT medium containing 50 g mL carbenicillum. The library was panned against SYNAGIS in this manner for a total of four rounds using BSA in the blocking and diluent buffers in the first and third rounds and casein in rounds 2 and 4.

After the final round of panning eluted phage were serially diluted and used to infect XL 1 Blue for 1 h prior to plating overnight on LB agar containing 50 g mL carbenicillum. Individual colonies were picked and grown overnight in 2YT carbenicillum at 37 C. Cultures were then diluted 1 100 in 2YT carbenicillum grown to an optical density 600 nm of 0.4 and M13KO7 helper phage were added followed by overnight incubation at 37 C. with shaking Following centrifugation 50 L of culture supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of PBS containing 0.1 v v Tween 20 and 2 w v skim milk powder and used for analysis by ELISA. Clones that gave the highest response for binding to SYNAGIS but not BSA casein coated ELISA plates were then selected for sequencing. To determine the sequences of Tn3 variants displayed by the selected clones 1 L of culture supernatant was used in a PCR to amplify a fragment encompassing the encoded Tn3 sequence. This PCR product was then treated with ExoSAPit USB Corp. Cleveland Ohio to degrade unconsumed deoxynucleotides and primers and sequenced directly.

DNA sequencing of SYNAGIS binding Tn3 variants identified 3 unique clones. The clone with the highest signal in a SYNAGIS binding ELISA SynBP01 contained novel BC and FG loop sequences as shown in Table 3. To express soluble SynBP01 the NcoI KpnI cDNA fragment was excised from the phage display vector and cloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector previously described. Recombinant SynBP01 was then expressed in and purified as previously described for wild type Tn3. The yield of purified SynBP01 was 18 mg from 400 mL of culture and was greater than 95 pure as judged by SDS PAGE analysis . . As this recovery is close to the capacity of the 1 mL nickel chelate affinity column used it is likely that this yield under represents the actual expression level of SynBP01.

The equilibrium dissociation constant K for binding of SynBP01 to SYNAGIS was measured by surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore 3000 instrument. SYNAGIS was covalently immobilized on the biosensor chip via primary amino groups. Equilibrium binding of SynBP01 was measured by injecting samples of SynBP01 in HBS EP buffer 10 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl 3 mM EDTA pH 7.5 0.005 v v Tween 20 over the chip at a flow rate of 10 L min . Following each equilibrium binding measurement SynBP01 was allowed to completely dissociate by running HBS EP buffer over the chip for at least 25 min prior to injection of the next SynBP01 sample. Binding profiles were analyzed by using BIAevaluation software Biacore AB Uppsala Sweden and the Kfor binding of SynBP01 to SYNAGIS was calculated as 16 M.

The stability of SynBP01 to unfolding by urea at pH 7.0 was measured as described previously for Tn3 See Example 1 . To facilitate a comparison of chaotrope induced unfolding of Tn3 and SynBP01 the relative fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm was plotted as a function of chaotrope concentration for each protein.

A comparison of urea induced unfolding of Tn3 and SynBP01 at pH 7.0 showed that the concentration of urea required to achieve 50 unfolding was similar for both proteins. This indicates that the stability of SynBP01 is similar to that of wild type Tn3.

In other library screens additional SYNAGIS and Lysozyme specific binding scaffolds were identified. The specific BC and FG loops sequences are as follows 

Bivalent or bispecific scaffolds containing 2 identical or 2 distinct scaffolds may be useful therapeutic molecules based on their ability to simultaneously bind 2 target proteins. A method of directly screening pairs of scaffolds for a desired bivalent or bispecific activity without having to reformat and express tandem or fusion scaffolds would vastly simply the process of identifying useful scaffold pairs. Only those pairs identified in the screen would then require reformatting into a form suitable for preparation of a bivalent or bispecific scaffold for example a multimeric scaffold .

Full length IgG antibody molecules contain two antigen binding sites and can therefore bind two target antigens simultaneously. Thus noncovalent monoclonal antibody capture of scaffolds would result in presentation of two scaffolds on each antigen binding arm of the antibody. If the scaffold captured in this way were oriented so that the binding surface formed by the BC DE and FG loops were available for binding to other proteins then this could form the basis for screening pairs of scaffolds. For this reason capture by an antibody which recognizes an epitope involving the C terminus of the scaffold or any all of the AB CD EF loops would be most suitable. Antibody capture of 2 identical scaffolds would result in formation of a homodimeric mAb scaffold complex that could mimic the activity of a bivalent scaffold. Capture of 2 different scaffolds would result in a mixture of homo and heterodimeric mAb scaffold complexes wherein the heterodimeric complex could mimic the activity of a bispecific scaffold.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this assay strategy different concentrations of PentaHis an anti histidine tag monoclonal antibody Qiagen was incubated for 2 h with 1 M SynBP01 in HBS EP buffer. PentaHis capture of SynBP01 was not expected to interfere with its ability to bind SYNAGIS given the C terminal hexahistidine tag should be on the opposite side of the molecule to the binding surface formed by the BC DE and FG loops . The PentaHis SynBP01 samples were then injected over a BIAcore chip onto which SYNAGIS had been immobilized as previously described. The sensorgrams were corrected for background by subtraction of corresponding sensorgrams for injection of PentaHis in the absence of SynBP01 and then compared to the sensorgram obtained for injection of 1 M SynBP01 in the absence of PentaHis.

Binding of the PentaHis SynBP01 complex to SYNAGIS was significantly stronger than binding of free SynBP01 as exemplified by the sensorgram corresponding to the complex of 0.19 M PentaHis with 1 M SynBP01 In particular PentaHis complexed SynBP01 had a much slower dissociation rate from the SYNAGIS surface indicative of bivalent binding than did free SynBP01. Control experiments verified that PentaHis did not exhibit any detectable binding to SynBP01 when injected alone nor did injection of a SynBP01 irrelevant mouse mAb mixture isotype matched with PentaHis show any evidence of enhanced binding relative to SynBP01 alone.

While many naturally occurring Tn3 structural motifs lack disulfide bonds others do contain one or more disulfide bonds. Thus rather than attempt de novo design of disulfide bonds in Tn3 by measuring distances and angles between amino acid side chains we introduced cysteine residues into the Tn3 scaffold at positions analogous to Tn3 structural domains that contain naturally occurring disulfides.

The three dimensional structures of 21 Tn3 structural motifs that naturally contain disulfide bonds were superimposed. The PDB codes and sequences for these structures is shown in . Within these 21 structures disulfide bonds occurred at various positions within the scaffold however a number of these were analogous in that the disulfide bonds were overlaid within the family of superimposed structures. Three examples were found of disulfide bonds that were represented more than twice across the 21 structures. Two of these three correspond to the previously described disulfide bond pair commonly conserved within cytokine receptors Bazan et al. PNAS 87 6934 1990 . A total of 8 and 12 instances of these two disulfides were noted in the 21 structures. The third disulfide occurs less frequently 5 cases 21 structures and results in a crosslink between the F and G strands.

Three cysteine containing Tn3 mutants were designed in an effort to introduce disulfide bonds at positions corresponding to these 3 naturally occurring disulfides. A fourth cysteine containing mutant was also designed to introduce a disulfide which occurs naturally in one of the Tn3 structural motifs from mouse G CSF receptor PDB code 1pgr . Although there was only one instance of this disulfide in the 21 structures it results in a disulfide cross link between the C and F strands that is buried within the protein core and occurs close to the BC and FG loop. For each of the Tn3 mutants designated Tn3 2 cysteines were introduced at positions determined from the structure based sequence alignment of Tn3 with those of the disulfide containing Tn3 proteins . As disulfide 2 occurs across at the base of the DE loop in Tn3 structural motifs which often have longer DE loops than Tn3 2 glycine residues were also inserted into the mutant corresponding to Tn3. The disulfide engineering strategy is graphically depicted in .

Expression constructs for Tn3were generated by site directed mutagenesis of the wild type expression construct described in Example 1. Recombinant protein was expressed in and purified by immobilized nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described in Example 1. All Tn3 mutants expressed at a level in excess of 50 mg L.

Cytoplasmic expression of proteins in generally results in the isolation of cysteine containing proteins in the reduced state or with some degree of inappropriate disulfide formation. To determine whether recombinant Tn3proteins were oxidized i.e. disulfide containing or reduced i.e. lacking disulfide bonds purified material was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC and compared to material that was first pre incubated with the strong reducing agent DTT in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. In all cases DTT treated material chromatographed as a single peak while untreated samples showed the presence of a 2minor peak indicative of partial oxidation to the disulfide containing form Representative HPLC analyses of Tnand Tnare depicted in .

In order to effect complete conversion of reduced Tn3to the corresponding disulfide containing proteins samples were diluted to 1 mg mL with 6M guanidine hydrochloride containing 10 mM DTT and buffered at pH 8. After 10 minutes incubation at room temperature samples were dialyzed overnight against 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride buffered at pH 8.5 with 20 mM Tris HCl. HPLC analysis of material refolded in this way typically showed 30 70 conversion into the disulfide containing species . Further conversion to 90 100 of the disulfide containing species was affected by overnight incubation at 37 C. or by storing samples at 4 C. for 2 weeks. Alternatively near quantitative refolding to the disulfide containing product could be affected by overnight dialysis of reduced and denatured protein into buffer containing 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride 4 mM reduced glutathione 0.8 mM oxidized glutathione and buffered at pH 8.5 with 20 mM Tris HCl.

To determine purity and whether disulfide bonds within refolded Tn3samples were inter or intramolecular samples were analyzed by SDS PAGE under reducing and non reducing conditions . In the presence of reducing agent all refolded Tn3samples migrated at a similar position to Tn3. In the absence of reducing agent Tn3 Tn3and Tn3migrated similarly to Tn3 and were therefore expected to contain an intramolecular disulfide as designed. By contrast Tn3migrated primarily as a dimer with a small amount of protein migrating as a monomer. Accordingly Tn3appears to form intermolecular disulfide linked dimers and was therefore not studied further.

Unfolding of Tn3by chaotropic agents was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence as previously described for wild type Tn3. To facilitate a comparison of chaotrope induced unfolding of wild type and disulfide containing Tn3 the relative fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm was plotted as a function of chaotrope concentration for each protein.

A comparison of urea induced unfolding of Tn3 and Tn3at pH 7.0 showed that Tn3was less stable than the wild type protein but that Tn3and Tn3were considerably more stable. At pH 7.0 the concentration of urea required to achieve 50 unfolding Cm of wild type Tn3 was 2M. By contrast the Cm for unfolding of Tn3was 4M urea while for Tn3Cm was at least 6M but could not be accurately determined as this protein was not fully unfolded at the highest concentration of urea used in these experiments 8M .

Unfolding of Tn3by guanidine hydrochloride GuHCl at pH 5.0 was also determined by fluorescence and compared to unfolding of wild type Tn3. Given GuHCl is a stronger denaturant than urea a complete unfolding transition was obtained by analyzing the fluorescence of protein samples in concentrations of GuHCl ranging from 0 to 5.5M . The Cm for unfolding of wild type Tn3 at pH 5.0 was 1M GuHCl and approx. 3.2M for Tn3.

The stability of Tn3to proteolytic degradation was tested by incubation with thermolysin as previously described in Example 1 for the wild type protein. In contrast to the wild type protein Tn3resisted proteolysis even after overnight incubation at room temperature .

Thermal unfolding of Tn3was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry DSC as previously described. A 1 mg mL Tn3sample in 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 exhibited a melting temperature Tm of 71 C. which is 26 C. higher than the Tm of the wild type protein under the same conditions . The Tm was slightly elevated for Tn3in 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. At this pH the Tm for Tn3was 74 C. which is 18 C. higher than the wild type protein. As with the wild type protein thermal unfolding of Tn3appeared completely reversible at pH 7.0 but resulted in precipitation at pH 5.0.

Size exclusion chromatography with multi angle light scattering SEC MALS was used to determine whether Tn3was monomeric in solution using the same conditions previously described for the wild type protein. SEC MALS analysis of a 2.0 mg mL Tn3sample revealed that the protein was completely in the monomeric state . The experimentally derived monomer mass was 10.7 kDa which is in close agreement with the calculated mass of 10.8 kDa.

Given the enhanced stability of both the Tn3and Tn3variants relative to the wild type protein a new Tn3 variant was prepared to determine whether the stabilizing effect of each disulfide bond would be additive in the context of a combination mutant.

A construct for recombinant expression of this tetra cysteine variant designated Tn3was prepared by methods previously described and contained 4 cysteine residues at positions corresponding to disulfides 3 and 4 see . Protein was expressed and purified as previously described in Example 1. The yield of purified protein obtained for this variant was 22 mg from 200 mL culture. As this is the maximum binding capacity of the column used for purification the actual expression level is at least 110 mg L.

Purified Tn3was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC and compared to material that was first preincubated with the strong reducing agent DTT in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. While the DTT treated material chromatographed as a single peak untreated Tn3showed the presence of 3 additional earlier eluting peaks most likely due to partial formation of either or both potential disulfides bonds .

In order to refold Tn3to the correct dual disulfide containing protein the sample was diluted to 1 mg mL with 6M guanidine hydrochloride containing 10 mM DTT and buffered at pH 8. After 10 minutes incubation at room temperature the sample was dialyzed overnight against 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride buffered at pH 8.5 with 20 mM Tris.HCl and containing 4 mM reduced glutathione. HPLC analysis of the refolded material indicated 95 conversion of the reduced protein to a single peak corresponding to the earliest eluting peak in the unfolded preparation. This product by virtue of its elution time profile was presumed to contain the 2 correctly formed disulfide bonds. .

Unfolding of Tn3by guanidine hydrochloride GuHCl at pH 5.0 was determined by fluorescence and compared to previous data for Tn3 and Tn3. The Cm for unfolding of Tn3at pH 5.0 was between 5.0 5.5M GuHCl . which is considerably higher than the Cm for wild type or Tn3. The significant enhancement in stability to GuHCl induced denaturation suggests that the stabilizing effects of disulfides 3 and 4 are additive when both sets of mutations are combined into the one scaffold.

A BLAST search was performed to identity putative Tn3 structural motif sequences encoded in the 48 archaeal genomes within the NCBI database. The search was further restricted to the genomes of hyperthermophilic organisms which we define here as organisms which grow optimally at temperatures of 70 C. or higher. Tn3 was used as a query sequence and this led to the identification of a Tn3 structural motif within a hypothetical protein from the organism . This Tn3 structural motif was in turn used as the query sequence to identify further Tn3 structural motifs and those in turn were used as query sequences. A total of 14 potential Tn3 coding sequences were identified within hypothetical proteins from 5 hyperthermophilic organisms. The sequences obtained are represented in Section 7 herein.

Five of the predicted hyperthermophile derived Tn3 proteins were selected for expression in . Synthetic cDNAs encoding each of these proteins and optimized for codon usage in were supplied by GenScript Corporation as per the sequences shown. Each cDNA contained flanking Nco I and Kpn I restriction sites and following digestion with these enzymes the inserts were cloned into a modified pET22b vector Novagen containing corresponding Nco I Kpn I sites. Recombinant expression of the encoded C terminal hexahistidine tagged proteins and purification from lysates was performed according to the procedure previously described for human derived Tn3 structural motifs. The Tn3 structural motif from and both Tn3 structural motifs from expressed well while Tn3 structural motifs from and expressed at a low level .

The stability of each Tn3 structural motif with the exception of the Tn3 from was analyzed by DSC fluorescence and thermolysin treatment as previously described See Example 1 .

The thermograms for Tn3 structural motifs at from at pH 7.0 did not exhibit a defined peak corresponding to thermal unfolding. Rather the data showed that 1Tn3 precipitated at temperatures above 70 C. while 1Tn3 precipitated above 50 C. . The thermogram for the Tn3 structural motif from showed a characteristic peak with Tm for unfolding of 77 C. as with the Tn3 structural motif from which had a Tm of 83 C. . Thermal unfolding was not reversible for either of these two proteins which precipitated at temperatures above Tm.

Unfolding of the Tn3 structural motifs at pH 7.0 by guanidine hydrochloride GuHCl was analyzed by fluorescence. All Tn3 structural motifs required high concentrations of GuHCl to effect unfolding with the midpoints of unfolding ranging from 4.5M to 6M GuHCl as exemplified for the Tn3 from .

Stability to proteolysis by thermolysin was analysed using the same conditions previously described See Example 1 where samples of 45 M Tn3 were incubated with thermolysin at 0.45 M. All Tn3 structural motifs were resistant to proteolysis although rapid cleavage of small 1 2 kDa fragments was observed for Tn3 proteins from and 2Tn3 which we assume are N and or C terminal fragments that do not form part of the core Tn3 structural motif. A significant proportion of all 4 core Tn3 structural motifs remained undigested after 16 hr thermolysin treatment as exemplified for the Tn3 from and 2Tn3 FIG. F G .

The stability of the Tn3 structural motifs from was also assessed at pH 3.0 in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer given this organism is acidophilic in addition to being hyperthermophilic. Both 1Tn3 and 2Tn3 were more stable to GuHCl induced unfolding at pH 3.0 compared to pH 7.0 with 1Tn3 being more stable than 2Tn3. Thermal unfolding of 1Tn3 at pH 3.0 in 20 mM sodium citrate was also assessed by DSC. In contrast to thermal unfolding at pH 7.0 the thermogram at pH 3.0 showed a characteristic peak indicating a Tm of 98 C. moreover unfolding at this pH was partially reversible. A comparison of thermal and GuHCl mediated unfolding for 1Tn3 is shown in . 

The stability of hyperthermophile derived Tn3 structural motifs to extremes of temperature pH and proteolysis were exploited to purify these proteins from crude lysates. The Tn3 proteins from and 1Tn3 were expressed in and soluble lysates prepared as previously described. Lysate containing Tn3 was heated at 70 C. for 15 minutes precipated protein was removed by centrifugation then supernatant was analyzed by SDS PAGE and compared to lysate which had not been heated . As seen on the gel a majority of contaminants were removed by the heat treatment resulting in significant purification of the Tn3 protein. Similarly treatment of soluble lysate with thermolysin at 55 C. for 45 minutes also resulted in significant removal of derived proteins and concomitant purification of the Tn3 .

The pH and high temperature stability of 1Tn3 protein were utilized to remove proteins from crude lysate. Dilution of lysate which was buffered at pH 7 with 4 volumes of 200 mM sodium citrate pH 3.0 resulted in significant precipitation of derived proteins. After removal of precipitate by centrifugation the supernatant was then heated at 70 C. for 15 minutes and newly precipitated protein was again removed by centrifugation. SDS PAGE analysis of untreated pH 3 treated and pH 3 heat treated samples shows the dramatic removal of background proteins by these 2 steps .

Three different variants of SynBP01 were constructed to test if one loop or both the BC and FG loops were contributing to the binding interface of the Tn3 . In addition the Tn3mutation was added to test its affect on binding to SYNAGIS . These variants differed in amino acid sequence from SynBP01 as follows 

Phage display vector encoding gene 3 fragment fusions of SynBP01 and its 3 variants were transformed into and these bacteria were then used to prepare phage displaying each of these Tn3 proteins as described in Example 3. Plates were coated with SYNAGIS at 10 g ml in PBS pH 7.2 overnight at 4 C. Plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.1 v v Tween 20 plus 4 w v skim milk powder PBST 4 milk . Diluted phage stocks were added to column 1 and a 3 fold serial dilution was performed across the plate using PBST 1 milk as diluent. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with gentle shaking After washing bound phage were labeled with anti M13 HRP conjugated antibody GE Healthcare Piscataway N.J. and detected colorimetrically by addition of TMB substrate KPL Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. . The absorbance was read at 450 nm after quenching the color development by addition of 2.5M phosphoric acid.

Results The data presented in demonstrates that both the BC and FG loops are required for binding of the Tn3 scaffold to SYNAGIS . SynBP01 variants containing a substitution of either loop with the wild type Tn3 sequence did not exhibit binding to plate bound SYNAGIS . These results demonstrate that at least two loops of the Tn3 scaffold act cooperatively to present a functional binding surface.

In addition the introduction of the SS4 disulfide bond into the SynBP01 scaffold ablates binding to SYNAGIS . A loss of activity for the SS4 containing variant of SynBP01 is probably due to a subtle conformational effect given this disulfide is not expected to result in a large change in the structure of a Tn3 scaffold protein. This further suggests that binding of SYNAGIS is exquisitely dependent on the three dimensional structure of SynBP01.

A new library was constructed based upon the Tn3scaffold shown in . The BC loop diversity was introduced using PCR and the FG loop diversity was introduced using Kunkel mutagenesis Table 5. . A library of approximately 1.12 10members was constructed.

The BC loop diversity was made by using the BC9 11 or 12 primers in Table 5. These primers annealed on their 3 ends to the Tn3 DNA and the degeneracy formed a library upon completion of the PCR. These PCR products were amplified with flanking primers to make a complete Tn3 gene which was then digested with NcoI and KpnI and ligated into the phage display vector. The DNA was transformed into by electroporation. The final diversity of the BC library was estimated to be about 3.4 10members.

After electroporation the BC library was incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. with shaking M13K07 helper phage was added and after one hour the cells were diluted to a larger volume and grown at 37 C. with shaking overnight. The next day phage were removed and concentrated from the supernatant by precipitation with PEG 8000.

BC library phage was used to infect CJ236 . After a one hour infection cells were diluted into 2 YT with 100 g mL carbenicillum and grown overnight with shaking at 37 C. The next day phage were removed and concentrated from the supernatant by precipitation with PEG 8000. Single stranded DNA was recovered by using a Qiagen Valencia Calif. QIAprep spin M13 kit. This DNA served as the template for Kunkel mutagenesis using the FG primers in Table 5.

SYNAGIS was biotinylated with 15 molar equivalents of EZ Link sulfo NHS SS biotin Pierce Rockford Ill. . After incubation for 1 hour at room temperature the sample was dialyzed in PBS overnight to remove unconjugated biotin. The next day M280 streptavidin beads Dynal Carlsbad Calif. and the two loop library were blocked in PBS containing 10 mg ml BSA for 1 hour. 10 ug of biotinylated SYNAGIS were added to the blocked phage and incubated at room temperature on an end over end rotating mixer for two hours. SYNAGIS was captured with the blocked streptavidin beads for 30 min on the rotating mixer at room temperature. After three washes with PBST to remove unbound phage the bound phage were eluted with 75 mM DTT. XL 1 Blue were infected with eluted phage co infected with M13KO7 helper phage and repropagated overnight as described in Example 3. The next day phage were harvested from overnight culture media as described in Example 3.

The second round of panning was the same as the first with casein used at 10 mg ml as the blocking reagent. The beads used for the second round were Spherotech Lake Forest Ill. avidin coated magnetic particles. For the third round casein was used as the blocking reagent and M280 streptavidin beads were used to capture SYNAGIS . For the fourth round BSA was used as the blocking reagent and Spherotech avidin magnetic particles were used to capture SYNAGIS . After 4 rounds of panning were infected with eluted phage and plated. Individual colonies were cultured in 96 well format infected with M13KO7 and culture supernatant was used in a phage ELISA to identify SYNAGIS binding clones. Three new SS4 stabilized clones were identified the sequences of which are shown in Table 6.

M280 streptavidin beads were washed with PBST and biotinylated goat anti human IgG Fc fragment specific antibody Jackson ImmunoResearch West Grove Pa. was added. After overnight incubation at 4 C. a control IgG1 antibody or TRAIL R2 Fc fusion protein R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. was added and again incubated overnight at 4 C. The beads were washed with PBST and blocked in PBST 2 milk prior to use.

The two loop Tn3phage library was incubated overnight at 4 C. with the control IgG1 antibody coated beads to deplete the library of binders to the beads or human IgG1 Fc. The depleted library was then added to TRAIL R2 coated beads and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a rocking platform. Beads were washed with PBST and added to XL 1 Blue to propagate bound phage as described in Example 8. This panning procedure was repeated for 4 more rounds except that incubation with control antibody beads for background depletion was performed for 1 hour rather than overnight. Individual clones were analyzed by phage ELISA after the fourth and fifth rounds of panning to identify TRAIL R2 binding variants.

Following the sequencing of positive clones from the TRAIL R2 phage ELISA nine unique binding clones were identified Table 7 . A lower case q indicates that a TAG stop codon was at that position. A suppressor strain such as XL 1 Blue allows for expression of genes with a TAG stop codon by inserting a glutamine at this position.

Goat anti human Fc IgG was immobilized at a density of 7700 RUs onto a flow cell of a CM5 Biacore sensor chip surfaces using a standard amino coupling protocol BIAcore Inc. . Separately a blank surface was also prepared on the same chip using the identical coupling protocol minus the protein. This blank surface was used as a reference cell throughout the experiment and served to correct for both non specific binding and certain housekeeping artifacts.

TRAIL R2 Fc protein was prepared at 100 nM in instrument buffer in HBS EP buffer BIAcore Inc. consisting of the following 10 mM HEPES buffer pH7.4 150 mM NaCl 3 mM EDTA and 0.005 P20. then injected over both the Fc capture and control surfaces at a flow rate of 75 uL min. Capture levels of the ligand approximated 800 RUs.

After baseline stabilization solutions of the Tn3 clone 5E5 Table 7 were injected over both the captured ligand and control surfaces. Between injections the Fc capture surface was regenerated with two 1 min. injections of 10 mM Gly pH2.

Several buffer and control protein injections were also interspersed throughout the injection series. Later these buffer injections were used along with the reference cell data to correct the raw data sets for injection artifacts and or non specific binding through a technique commonly referred to as double referencing. Myszka D. G. 1999 J. Mol. Recognit. 12 pp. 279 284 . Sensorgram overlays of the fully corrected data were generated using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software BIAcore Inc Uppsala Sweden . The affinity of 5E5 for binding to TRAIL R2 was calculated by measuring the kand k. values in the BIAevaluation software for the sensorgram shown in . This analysis resulted in an estimated Kof 700 nM for 5E5 binding to TRAIL R2.

Soluble 5E5 and 7G11 TRAIL R2 specific clones isolated in Example 9 were expressed and used in a competition phage ELISA assay to assess whether they specifically bind TRAIL R2. TRAIL R2 coated plates were incubated with phage displaying TRAIL 2 specific Tn3 sin the presence or absence of soluble Tn3 clones 7G11 or 5E5. As shown in soluble 5E5 competes with phage displayed 5E5 and all other phage displayed clones except 2H6 and 7G11. Soluble 7G11 only competes with phage displayed 7G11 and 2H6. This experiment indicates that all clones are specific for TRAIL R2 and that there are two different epitopes on TRAIL R2 recognized by this panel of Tn3 proteins.

A phage displayed three loop library based on the Tn3scaffold was made by randomizing the sequences of the BC DE and FG loops using the primers shown in Table 8. Briefly single stranded DNA from the two loop Tn3 BC loop library with Tn3 from Example 7 was used as a template for a PCR with the DE rev primer in Table 8. This PCR generated a product that contained a portion of the Tn3 gene with BC and DE randomization. A second PCR used this BC DE loop randomized PCR product as template for amplification with the FG primers listed in Table 8. The resulting PCR products were amplified with flanking primers to make a complete Tn3 gene which was then cut NcoI to KpnI and ligated into the phage display vector. The DNA was transformed into by electroporation.

After electroporation the library was incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. with shaking M13K07 helper phage was added and after one hour the cells were diluted to a larger volume and grown at 37 C. with shaking overnight. The next day phage were purified from the culture supernatant by precipitation with a saline PEG 8000 solution. The library size was estimated to contain about 1.5 10members based on the number of transformants.

The three loop Tn3library constructed in Example 12 was panned against TRAIL R2 and specific clones identified in by phage ELISA as described in Example 9 In total 19 new Tn3s were identified that bound to TRAIL R2 Table 9 .

The amber stop codon in the nucleotide sequences of clones 2D3 and 1G11 was replaced with a glutamine codon by site directed mutagenesis. These Tn3 clones along with 1E3 1C12 and 2B4 were cloned into a expression vector described in Example 1 and transformed into BL21 DE3 cells. After induction with IPTG the transformed bacteria were grown for 5 hours at 30 C. The cells were pelleted lysed by sonication and the soluble fraction was purified on a HiTrap chelating HP column GE Healthcare Piscataway N.J. . Tn3 clones 2B4 and 1C12 were obtained in good yield however a poor recovery of the remaining three clones was the result of overexpression leading to accumulation of the proteins into inclusion bodies. In this case a high yield of Tn3 was subsequently obtained by solubilizing the inclusion bodies in buffered 6M guanidine hydrochloride GuHCl then purifying on a HiTrap chelating column under denaturing conditions. All Tn3s were subsequently refolded by dialysis of reduced and denatured samples into native buffer in the presence of a cysteine cystine redox pair.

A selection of the phage displayed clones from Table 9 were tested to see if soluble forms of Tn3s 1E3 1G11 2B4 1C12 and 2D3 would compete for binding to TRAIL R2 in a phage ELISA. The assay was performed in a similar manner to the competition for binding in Example 11 and the results are shown in A B and C. Soluble Tn3 clones 1E3 1C12 and 2D3 significantly inhibited the binding of most of the phage linked Tn3s to TRAIL R2 with the exception of clones 8B3 and 7G11. Soluble 1G11 did not significantly compete with any of the phage bound clones. Soluble 2B4 showed little to moderate inhibition in most cases. The fact that 1E3 1C12 and 2D3 competed with the same set of phage linked Tn3s indicates that these three soluble Tn3s and the phage linked Tn3s likely bind to the same epitope on TRAIL R2.

Colo 205 is a cell line which is highly sensitive to TRAIL induced killing. TRAIL R2 binding Tn3s when multimerized via binding to a complex of mouse anti His tag antibody and anti mouse IgG were tested for their ability to induce killing of Colo205 cells. Colo205 cells in 100 ul of RPMI 1640 medium with 10 FBS were plated into each well of a flat bottom 96 well culture plate and incubated overnight at 37 C. Tn3 proteins 7G11 and 5E5 Table 7 1C12 2D3 and 1E3 Table 9 and Tn3 Example 4 were incubated with mouse anti His tag antibody Penta His Qiagen Inc and rabbit anti mouse IgG in a molar ratio of 2 1 0.5. Serial dilutions of each Tn3 complex was made in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 FBS to a final concentration of 5 M 1.66 M 0.55 M 0.185 M and 0 M based on the Tn3 content. After removal of medium from cells cultured overnight 100 l of the Tn3 antibody complexes was added. Each assay point was performed in triplicate.

After addition of Tn3 complexes the cells were incubated for 3 days in at 37 C. after which cell viability was measured in a CellTiter Glo luminescent cell viability assay Promega Corp. Madison Wis. according to the manufacturers instructions. The percent viability for cells treated with a TRAIL R2 binding Tn3s was calculated by dividing the luminescent signal obtained in the CellTiter Glo assay by the corresponding signal obtained for cells treated with the same concentration of non TRAIL R2 binding control Tn.

The cell viability assay showed that Tn3 clones 5E5 1C12 and 2D3 when multimerized via antibody complexation were able to inhibit Colo205 viability in a dose dependent manner relative to treatment of cells with a non TRAIL R2 binding Tn3. Inhibition of cell viability was presumably due to cellular apoptosis triggered by TRAIL R2 ligation although pathway specific assays would be needed to confirm this. Clones 7G11 and 1E3 did not show detectable activity at the concentrations used in the assay. Additional cell assays showed that none of the active Tn3 proteins affected cell viability when assayed without an anti His tag capture antibody. This demonstrates that activity is dependent on the presentation of multimerized TRAIL R2 binding moieties. Clone 5E5 also lacked activity if the anti IgG antibody was not present however clones 1C12 and 2D3 were active in the absence of anti IgG suggesting that dimeric presentation via anti His tag antibody capture is sufficient to trigger TRAIL R2 signaling.

Given the requirement for presentation of oligomeric Tn3 complexes to effect TRAIL R2 dependent cell killing Tn3 fusion constructs were designed for the production of bi and tetravalent Tn3 containing proteins . A bivalent Tn3 construct was designed by fusion of Tn3 to the Fc region of human IgG1 while a two chain tetravalent Tn3 construct was designed based on co expression of a Tn3 C fusion with Tn3 IGHG1 i.e Tn3 fused to a human C kappa region and to the heavy chain constant region of human IgG1. The latter construct is similar in nature to an antibody except that the light and heavy chain variable regions were replaced with a Tn3 moiety.

The constructs shown in and B were expressed in 293F cells transiently transfected with the in house pOE expression vector coding for each of the proteins. After 10 days in culture media 250 mL was harvested and the protein was purified by protein A affinity chromatography. Presented in Table 10 are the expression levels of a selection of multivalent Tn3 constructs. 1C12 and a control SYNAGIS binding Tn3 named D1 from Example 8 Seq ID NO 105 and Seq ID NO 106 expressed well as either the Fc fusion or two chain Tn3 C Tn3 IGHG1 fusions. Hybrid tetravalent fusions of 1C12 and 2D3 1C12 linked to IGHG1 2D3 linked to C and vice versa along with the 2D3 Fc fusion yielded lower amounts of material while the two chain 2D3 C 2D3 IGHG1 fusion did not express SDS PAGE analysis of the protein A purified proteins is shown in .

A qualitative comparison of binding by monomeric 1C12 1C12 Fc and 1C12 C 1C12 IGHG1 proteins was performed by injecting samples of each of these proteins over a TRAIL R2 chip on an Attana biosensor instrument. As shown in complexes of TRAIL R2 with oligomerized forms of 1C12 show a substantial improvement in affinity relative to monomeric 1C12. The specificity of binding was demonstrated by injection of D1 Fc and D1 C D1 IGHG1 proteins which did not interact with immobilized TRAIL R2. The dissociation rates for the different 1C12 constructs followed the order 1C12 1C12 Fc 1C12 C 1C12 IGHG1 consistent with the bi and tetravalent constructs exhibiting avidity in their interaction with TrailR2.

H2122 cells were plated in 96 well plates at a density of 10000 cells well in 50 ul of complete medium RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 FBS . Cells were incubated overnight at 37 C. The next day polyvalent Tn3 fusion proteins Fc fusions or two chain tetravalent constructs alone or in combination with goat anti human Fc were serially diluted in complete medium. To achieve a dose curve a 3 fold dilution scheme was used highest final concentration was 3.6 uM . The goat anti human Fc was added at a 1 2 molar ratio i.e. half of the concentration of the Tn3 containing molecule . Tn3 and anti human Fc alone and in combination were prepared at a 2 concentration 50 ul of each treatment were added per well . All treatments were done in triplicate wells. Commercially available TRAIL ligand Chemicon Cat GF092 was used as a positive control for Trail induced cell death. The final concentrations for Trail were 1 0.1 and 0.01 nM. After 48 hrs the CellTiter Glo kit from Promega was used to determine cell viability. Briefly cells are allowed to equilibrate for about 10 min to room temperature. CellTiter Glo buffer and substrate were mixed to prepare the CellTiter Glo reagent as indicated by manufacturer. Each well received 100 ul of the CellTiter Glo reagent and the plate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to reading luminescence in a Wallac Plate reader. Results are shown in . Each of the 1C12 and 2D3 containing polyvalent constructs were able to inhibit the viability of H2122 cells presumably by activating TRAIL R2 dependent apoptosis moreover this activity was not dependent on higher order crosslinking via coordination with an anti Fc antibody. The tetrameric form of 1C12 was more potent in the cell assay than its dimer form compare consistent with the killing activity being a function of the valency. Fc cross linking did not increase the potency of killing and appeared to reduce the activity of the monospecific 1C12 constructs. Neither D1 Fc nor D1 C D1 IGHG1 control proteins which do not bind TRAIL R2 affected cell viability. The bispecific tetravalent constructs had the greatest potency in inhibiting H2122 cell viability and this increased slightly if co incubated with anti Fc antibody. The improvement in activity for the 2D3 1C12 bispecific constructs relative to monospecific 1C12 C 1C12 IGHG1 may be due to superior potency for 2D3 vs 1C12 Tn3 units or because 2D3 and 1C12 recognize different epitopes on TRAIL R2 which could result in higher order aggregation of cell surface TRAIL R2.

A bacterial expression vector was designed to secrete correctly folded Tn3 scaffold in . This system would allow for correct disulfide bond formation within Tn3 and therefore avoid the refolding process that is required for material expressed intracellularly as described in Example 4. To create a secretion vector an intracellular Tn3 expression vector similar to that described in Example 4 but containing a Ptac promoter instead of T7 was modified by insertion of the signal peptide sequence from oligopeptide binding protein oppA . This signal sequence cloned immediately upstream of Tn3 was chosen because oppA is a highly expressed protein. An extended 8 His tag was encoded downstream of Tn3 to facilitate purification. To simplify the transfer of Tn3 cassettes between this and other plasmids a modified form of this vector was also created by introducing an Nco I site at the 3 end of the oppA signal sequence. This modification results in a single amino acid substitution L25M at the penultimate position within the oppA signal sequence . These vectors were referred to as pSec oppA Tn3 and pSec oppA L25M Tn3.

Superbroth media containing carbenicillum 100 ug mL 1 glucose was innoculated with BL21 DE3 cultures transformed with pSec oppA Tn3 or pSec oppA L25M Tn3. Cultures were grown at 37 C. to an OD of 0.5 0.8 then induced with 0.2 mM IPTG. After shaking at 37 C. for 5 hours cells were separated from the media by centrifugation. Periplasmic extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 1 10 volume of ice cold extraction buffer 10 mM Tris pH 8 and 1 mM EDTA incubating on ice for 10 min then centrifuging to remove cells. Samples of periplasmic extract and media were analyzed by SDS PAGE. Tn3 could be detected in both media and periplasmic fractions and expression levels were similar for constructs containing the wild type or L25M oppA signal peptides . As pSec oppA L25M Tn3 contains a convenient 5 Tn3 cloning site this construct is preferred for the expression of Tn3 clones derived from display libraries.

Purification of Tn3 from media was effected by precipitating the secreted protein with 65 w v ammonium sulfate resuspending the pellet in 50 mM Tris pH 8 buffer then purifying on a HiTrap chelating column charged with Ni as previously described. SDS PAGE analysis of the purified sample is shown in . Purified Tn3 was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described herein either with or without DTT pretreatment to reduce any disulfide bonds. Tn3 eluted as a single peak and the elution time shifted after reduction with DTT indicating the purified sample contained a disulfide bond as expected . Non reducing SDS PAGE and size exclusion chromatography of this material were consistent with a single monomeric species and mass spectrometric analysis gave a molecular weight of 10 896 Da which is within 3 Da of the predicted molecular weight for the mature disulfide containing sequence shown in .

Finally the expression level of secreted Tn3 in media was determined in a biosensor assay. Anti His tag antibody Penta His Qiagen Inc. was immobilized onto an Attana A100 carboxyl sensor chip via standard amine coupling. BL21 DE3 were transformed with pSec oppA L25M Tn3 and protein expression was induced as described above. Dilutions of clarified media were injected over the chip and levels of bound His tag containing Tn3 were compared to that generated from injection of purified Tn3 standard. By this technique the level of Tn3 detected in crude media was 250 mg L.

As described above SynBP01 is a Tn3 variant which was identified from a library of BC loop and FG loop randomized Tn3 variants panned against SYNAGIS . Flanking NheI and KasI sites were introduced by silent mutagenesis and utilized to subclone this construct into the pOE Fc vector. The pOE Fc vector contains the CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG1 Fc which is 3 to the KasI restriction sites. The vector generated by subcloning SynBP01 into pOE Fc was named pOE SynBP01.

293EBNA cells 120 mL culture volume were transfected with pOE SynBP01 through Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen using standard methods. Supernatant was harvested 10 days post transfection and SynBP01 Fc was purified through Protein A affinity chromatography GE Healthcare eluting with 0.1M glycine 0.15M NaCl pH 3.08 and neutralizing with Tris HCl buffer at pH 8. The purified sample was then dialyzed against PBS buffered at pH 7.2. The yield of purified SynBP01 Fc was 4 mg indicating an expression level of 33 mg L.

BIAcore analysis of this molecule was conducted on a BIAcore 3000 GE Healthcare as described in Example 3. This experiment was designed to determine whether the SynBP01 Fc was competent to bind SYNAGIS and to detect qualitatively the difference in apparent affinity between the original SynBP01 binder and the Fc fusion.

Results When injected at equivalent 1 M concentrations SynBP01 Fc yielded an approximately 6 fold increase in total response units compared to SynBP01 . Moreover SynBP01 Fc had a substantially reduced off rate relative to SynBP01 due primarily to the increased avidity of the bivalent Fc fusion. Although the dissociation constant K of the SynBP01 Fc SYNAGIS interaction was not determined in this experiment as the binding surface had not been prepared for a kinetic analysis it is evident that the Kis improved from the Kof 16 M seen with the SynBP01 SYNAGIS interaction in Example 3.

Modification of a protein through PEGylation is frequently used to improve its therapeutic properties such as decreased immunogenicity improved pharmacokinetics and bioavailability by increasing the effective size of small proteins so as to avoid renal clearance. Site specific modification with PEG that is attachment at one or more specific residues in the protein can avoid inactivation of a target proteins activity that could otherwise result from attachment of PEG at or near a functional site within a protein. To demonstrate site specific PEGylation of a Tn3 like scaffold protein a cysteine residue was engineered at the C terminus of STn3 1Tn3 from Example 5 . As the wild type sequence of STn3 does not contain cysteine treatment of the engineered scaffold with a Cys specific PEGylation reaction would lead to site specific attachment of PEG. STn3 had previously been expressed as a fusion to a C terminal 6 His tag in a variant of the pET 22b vector Novagen . This vector contains the linker sequence GGGLE between the protein and the His tag. A variation on the QuikChange Stratagene mutagenesis method was used to mutate the leucine residue in the linker to a cysteine which can be modified by a maleimide reagent. This protein is referred to as STn3 CTC and was expressed and purified from BL21 DE3 cells using an IMAC column as described in Example 1.

The PEGylation reagent Sunbright Me. 200MA NOF was added to STn3 CTC at a 4 1 molar excess PEG reagent protein and was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 72 hours. Protein PEGylation was monitored by SDS PAGE lane 5 which revealed that the majority of the protein had been PEGylated by a single PEG moiety. As PEGylation typically has the effect of masking surface charge of a protein the pH for cation exchange chromatography was lowered from 6.0 for wild type purification to 4.5 to ensure that the protein would effectively bind the column. The protein was purified on a 1 mL SP XL column GE Healthcare using 50 mM acetic acid pH 4.5. A sodium chloride gradient was used to elute the protein with the protein peak occurring at approximately 120 mM NaCl. Successful removal of residual unPEGylated STn3 CTC from the PEGylated product is demonstrated by SDS PAGE analysis of fractions obtained from the cation exchange purification fractions are shown in lanes 1 5. 

To design Tn3 libraries which were randomized in the AB CD and EF loops a bioinformatic analysis was performed to derive information regarding the length and sequence diversity of these loops in naturally occurring Fn3 domains. Due to the difficulty in predicting the AB CD and EF loop regions based on sequence information alone the three dimensional structures of 103 different Fn3 domains from the pdb database were superimposed and this was used to align the corresponding amino acid sequences data not shown . The locations of the loops regions were used to extract length and sequence diversity information for each of the loops. The variation in length for each of the AB CD and EF loops is shown graphically in .

As with loops on the opposite side of the Tn3 molecule the AB CD and EF loops vary in length and sequence composition for different Fn3 domains. The AB and CD loops are usually 5 to 9 amino acids long although exceptions occur for some Fn3 domains which have AB and or CD loops longer or shorter than this. The most common length within this data set was 6 residues for the CD loop 31 of sequences and 7 residues for the AB loop 61 of sequences . Length variation occurs less frequently for the EF loop and an 8 residue loop is most commonly observed 80 of sequences . Both the AB and CD loops show significant diversity in sequence and do not show overt preferences for specific amino acids in particular positions. An exception is the final position in the AB loop which is often Ser or Thr 58 103 sequences . The sequences of EF loops reveals strongly preferred amino acids at specific positions though this is restricted to those that are 8 residues long. A Leu at position 3 within these loops is strongly conserved 76 82 sequences and given the sidechain of this residue is buried in each of the structures it is likely to be important for the structural integrity of the scaffold. A Pro residue is also commonly observed at position 5 44 82 sequences while Gly Asn Asp and Ser are often in position 2 71 82 sequences and Thr in position 7 40 82 .

A further practical consideration in the design of these Tn3 libraries was to identify an alternative to the NNK N A G T C K G T mixed codon scheme typically used in degenerate oligonucleotides to code for any amino acid. Although the NNK mixture gives 32 different codons which code for all 20 amino acids they are not encoded equally Table 11 . For instance 3 32 codons in the NNK scheme code for Leu CTG CTT TTG but only 1 32 codes for Asp GAT . In addition the NNK mixture encodes one stop codon TAG and a Cys codon TGT neither of which is desirable when generating naiive libraries. In considering an alternative scheme we took note of the fact that synthetic antibody libraries have been described which encode CDR sequences composed of a small subset of amino acids. Antibody libraries with CDR s composed of just 4 amino acids Tyr Ala Asp Ser or even a binary pair Tyr Ser have been shown to yield specific high affinity mAbs to protein antigens Fellouse et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004 101 12467 72 J. Mol. Biol. 2005 348 1153 62 . Similarly a library of scaffold proteins with randomized loop sequences comprising just Tyr and Ser also yielded specific binders to a protein target Koide et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007 104 6632 7 . Although libraries containing highly restricted sets of amino acids are able to produce specific binding proteins it is likely that the diversity of binders that are obtained from such a library will be limited. We therefore designed an alternate NHT mixed codon scheme for introducing diversity into a Tn3 library H A T C . NHT mixes code for a reasonable subset of the 20 amino acids but avoid the disadvantages described with NNK mixed codons Table 12 . This scheme generates 12 codons that code for 12 20 amino acids that is each codon codes for a unique amino acid. Moreover there are no stop or Cys codons.

The final design for Tn3 libraries containing randomized AB CD and EF loops is shown below. This design incorporates diversity observed in natural Fn3 sequences two different lengths for the AB and CD loops and uses NHT codon mixes.

The stability of Tn3 to thermal unfolding is greater at pH 5 compared to pH 7 and greater in pH 7 buffer containing 1M salt than the same buffer without salt . As high salt concentrations can mask surface protein charge while buffer acidification can result in neutralization of negatively charged Asp and Glu side chains these observations suggest that surface negative charge on Tn3 has a destabilizing effect.

To explore the potential for enhancing the stability of Tn3 through engineering of surface charge the locations of Asp and Glu side chains were mapped onto the three dimensional structure of Tn3. From a total of 18 Asp and Glu residues contained in Tn3 SEQ ID 1 a panel of 8 mutants were designed in which individual Asp or Glu residues were replaced with the neutral isoteric residues Asn or Gln . The selection of the 8 substitution sites was biased towards Asp and Glu residues that were in close proximity to another Asp or Glu given proximity of like charges can contribute to destabilization through electrostatic repulsion.

Expression constructs for Tn3 mutants were generated by site directed mutagenesis of the wild type expression construct as described previously. Recombinant protein was expressed in and purified by immobilized nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described previously. All Tn3 mutants expressed at high levels and were readily purified although the preparation of the E54Q mutant did contain some impurities as evidenced by SDS PAGE analysis .

Unfolding of charge mutants by urea was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence as previously described for wild type Tn3. To facilitate a comparison of urea induced unfolding profiles of wild type and charge mutants of Tn3 the relative fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm was plotted as a function of urea concentration for each protein.

A comparison of urea induced unfolding at pH 7.0 for wild type Tn3 and the various charge mutants showed that 3 of the mutants D4ON E54Q and E67Q had the same or slighty lower stability than the wild type protein. Five of the mutants E33Q D49N E52Q D53N E86Q showed small but clearly defined increases in the midpoints of urea induced unfolding suggestive of an increase in protein stability. The concentration of urea required to induce 50 unfolding was approximately 0.5M higher for best 3 mutants E33Q D49N and E86Q than for wild type Tn3.

Given the enhanced stability of a number of the Tn3 charge variants new Tn3 variants containing combined charge mutations were prepared to investigate whether additive improvements in stability could be obtained. To this end three new variants were prepared containing paired mutations D49N E86Q and E33Q D49N or a triple mutation E33Q D49N E86Q . These mutants were recombinantly expressed and purified and their urea denaturation profiles were characterized by fluorescence.

When compared to the single charge mutants of Tn3 each of the combination mutants showed further enhancement of stability as determined by the increase in urea concentration required for unfolding . While the midpoint of urea induced unfolding of the individual charge mutants E33Q D49N and E86Q occurred at 2.5M urea the midpoint of unfolding for each of the D49N E86Q E33Q D49N and E33Q D49N E86Q mutants corresponded to 3.0M urea. This indicates that combined replacement of multiple destabilizing Asp or Glu residues can lead to an additive improvement in Tn3 stability although in the examples studied here a triple mutant was no more stable than a double mutant.

To further characterize the stabilities of the combination charge mutants relative to wild type Tn3 these proteins were analyzed by DSC at pH 7 as previously described. This analysis further confirmed that the charge mutations led to an improvement in the stability of the Tn3 scaffold. While the wild type protein had a mid point of thermal unfolding T of 45 C. the E33Q D49N Tn3 mutant had a Tm of 50 C. while D49N E86Q and E33Q D49N E86Q mutants had Tm s of 52 C. .
