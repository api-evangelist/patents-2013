title: Digital delivery system and user interface for enabling the digital delivery of media content
abstract: A system, method, and computer readable storage medium provide multi-platform accessibility of media content in a global computer network. Media content is selected in a client computer. Based on a format of the content, a media content player is loaded. If the content is not digital rights managements (DRM) protected, it is loaded and played in the player. If the content is DRM protected, a license to play the content is requested via an API and obtained via a server process. A web server computer creates/updates an authorized client user by communicating with a DRM server. The web server then creates a session with the DRM server and enables authorization to play by communicating with the DRM server that transmits the license to the client computer. Based on the license, the client loads and plays the content in the player.

CRAIG D. RUSSELL CHRISTOPHER M. BETTES GREG MCCARTHY SRINIVAS KUNDULA and VENKATA NAGARAJU MANTENA.

The present invention relates generally to the delivery of media content and in particular to a method apparatus system article of manufacture and user interface for the digital distribution of all marketing assets low resolution screeners and broadcast quality video.

Many types and pieces of information or media content may be utilized as part of the broadcast advertisement and sale of such content. Content from various studios e.g. FOX may include 

Today s physical media based distribution model is inefficient and subject to challenges including import export delays courier flight or customs problems. In addition the reliance on fuel based logistics during product shipping is counter to television distribution and its licensees carbon neutral operational goals. Finally physical media based distribution is expensive with dependencies on manufacturing shipping and physical media management. For a better understanding of these problems a description of prior art media distribution models is useful.

Prior art techniques used to fulfill its customer s requests for advertising and publicity materials required the physical distribution of such materials on physical paper e.g. slides and transparencies ad slicks camera ready advertisements of varying sizes that are used in print media such as newspapers and magazines scripts and music cue sheets. Slides would be duplicated at a photo lab and scripts would be photocopied. The materials would then be boxed up and shipped out to customers such as international broadcasters. These boxes would often get held up at customs or the materials would be misplaced by the customer adding to the expense of both time and money.

To overcome some of the prior art problems digital processes have been reshaping all aspects of the broadcast television industry. Product is now regularly digitally recorded edited and distributed to audiences via server based play out. This evolution may naturally extend to the content supply chain and distributor relationships whereby physical media and shipping will soon become obsolete means for content delivery. In this regard websites have been developed where customers were able to download advertising and publicity materials needed whenever and as often as necessary. Instead of slides customers downloaded JPGs instead of paper scripts downloadable PDFs were available. Written information like synopses cast and crew biographies awards and press quotes were also available on such web sites e.g. FOXFAST .

Security mechanisms may also exist on such prior art web sites. Such security mechanisms included password protection that was tied into a studio s television distribution sales system so customers were only given access to materials for the television series and films that the customer currently licensed from the particular studio. However such a limited system would not allow the customer to view all of the assets available for the customer to license. In this regard a television distribution sales group is continuously selling titles from a studio s entire catalog and since customers can only see titles they already licensed in prior art websites the need for an overall comprehensive catalog site was desirable.

To overcome such problems a non password protected catalog website was developed in the prior art to showcase all titles e.g. features television series specials movies of the week mini series etc. available from a particular entity. Such a prior art website provided the ability to search assets using a variety of criteria including actor award box office genre and synopsis key words e.g. all titles about baseball .

In addition to the above websites a further website was developed in the prior art to allow customers to screen television shows and movies without waiting for a digital video disc DVD and saving the costs of burning and shipping such discs as well . Such screening was viewed as a desirable pre sales tool. Digital rights management DRM was used in such prior art websites to protect the content from unauthorized viewing and piracy.

However for a media content owner to efficiently and easily deliver pre sales and sold content to a customer while allowing a customer to easily and efficiently browse all content and receive such content was not provided by the above prior art systems. Instead customers were forced to utilize multiple websites for different purposes and media content owners did not have the flexibility to easily manage sample and deliver such content to both prospective and actual customers. In addition prior art systems failed to provide the ability to digitally deliver broadcast quality digital files. Instead the prior art required the duplication of a tape and the shipping of the tape overseas.

Accordingly what is needed is an online digital delivery system using a singular comprehensive easy to use website that provides the capability to search a media content owner s film and television series catalog access and download marketing and publicity assets screen movies episodes and promotional videos and deliver broadcast quality digital files. Thus rather than duplicating a tape and shipping it overseas it is desirable to provide a customer with the ability to download a file and broadcast the file directly out to their viewers. Further it is desirable to quickly transition from physical tape delivery to digital delivery for both television series and feature films.

One or more embodiments of the invention provide a website that provides the capability to securely manage digital distribution of all marketing assets low resolution screeners and broadcast quality video. Such embodiments provide a one stop shop online portal designed to conveniently deliver using house file video standards all assets a licensee may need to make purchase decisions promote market and distribute a media content owner s product.

Clients may execute a client application or web browser and communicate with server computers executing web servers . Such a web browser is typically a program such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER MOZILLA FIREFOX OPERA or APPLE SAFARI . Further the software executing on clients may be downloaded from server computer to client computers and installed as a plug in or ACTIVEX control of a web browser. Accordingly clients may utilize ACTIVEX components component object model COM or distributed COM DCOM components to provide a user interface on a display of client . The web server is typically a program such as MICROSOFT S INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER .

Web server may host an Active Server Page ASP or Internet Server Application Programming Interface ISAPI application which may be executing scripts. The scripts invoke objects that execute business logic referred to as business objects . The business objects then manipulate data in database through a database management system DBMS . Alternatively database may be part of or connected directly to client instead of communicating obtaining the information from database across network . When a developer encapsulates the business functionality into objects the system may be referred to as a component object model COM system. Accordingly the scripts executing on web server and or application invoke COM objects that implement the business logic. Further server may utilize MICROSOFT S Transaction Server MTS to access required data stored in database via an interface such as ADO Active Data Objects OLE DB Object Linking and Embedding DataBase or ODBC Open DataBase Connectivity .

Generally these components all comprise logic and or data that is embodied in or retrievable from device medium signal or carrier e.g. a data storage device a data communications device a remote computer or device coupled to the computer via a network or via another data communications device etc. Moreover this logic and or data when read executed and or interpreted results in the steps necessary to implement and or use the present invention being performed.

Such applications may also be tangibly embodied in memory and or data communications devices thereby making a computer program product or article of manufacture according to the invention. As such the terms article of manufacture program storage device and computer program product as used herein are intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or media.

Although the term user computer client computer and or server computer is referred to herein it is understood that such computers may include portable devices such as cell phones notebook computers pocket computers or any other device with suitable processing communication and input output capability.

Of course those skilled in the art will recognize that any combination of the above components or any number of different components peripherals and other devices may be used with computers .

Using the network architecture of embodiments of the invention may further integrate multiple different systems to provide for the secure management of the digital distribution of media content. illustrates an integrated digital distribution system suite that enables such management and distribution. Each of the systems and components of may be implemented by either a client computer or server computer to provide the features described herein.

A custom built repository referred to as a rights transition system RTS manages content and distribution rights. RTS is the foundation of product status feeding downstream systems with information related to distribution rights media territory language and music rights. In other words the RTS identifies the ownership rights i.e. distribution and licensed rights that are available. Such information includes what one is allowed to do with the product e.g. if one has any rights to give away license with respect to a particular product .

The information in RTS may be transmitted or retrieved using a product availability and management engine . In other words product availability and management engine provides the ability to query RTS to retrieve details regarding sales licensing information. For example engine may provide information regarding what products are available to sell license where the product may be sold licensed what media may be sold licensed when the product may be sold licensed and how long the product may be sold licensed e.g. the availability date of every film before 1975 in German . Accordingly engine may also be known as a recording and reporting engine that provides the ability to query RTS for data to determine available products content.

Contract system retrieves or is transmitted information from product availability and management engine . Contract system records details regarding the specific completed transactions licenses with customers. In other words the licensed rights such as an identification of a particular product the time period of the license and the specific customers part of that license are recorded within contract system . For example all licenses for a television program such as GLEE may be recorded within contract system . For all such licenses a user may be given access based thereon. When a new episode of GLEE is uploaded access may be automatically generated based on such recorded licenses without the need to resubmit or update the license provisions recorded within contract system . In addition any billing to customers for such licensed rights may occur within contract system .

The distribution assets repository also known as ESPIRIT is a custom built system designed as a studio s repository for distribution assets including full length broadcast video promotional material and marketing material. In other words repository provides a distribution warehouse for product deliverables i.e. digital downloads for a product . File acceleration software may be used within repository to expedite the delivery of products to customers. Alternatively broadcast video assets may be stored in repository while marketing and screener assets may be stored in a repository within the digital advertising publicity repository DAPR .

The DAPR is a custom application that feeds to customers contractual licensing and product information from upstream sales applications. DAPR is the air traffic control mechanism of the digital delivery initiative described herein and allows users administrators to define set conditional based access policies for all file based distribution assets. Security controls for products assets may be further established defined modified in DAPR . In other words based on the licensed rights from upstream applications DAPR provides an administrator with the capability to determine how customers or users can view and select products content from a digital delivery system website . Information from the upstream applications may be pushed into the DAPR system on a regular semi regular basis to ensure appropriate security access controls are being utilized. While the different licensed rights information is determined in systems the actual downloadable assets are stored in repository and DAPR controls the security mechanisms i.e. who has appropriate access download privileges to determine whether a customer on a delivery system website can download the assets in repository .

Digital delivery system website is a business to business online portal designed to deliver all file based assets connected to the sales promotion and broadcast of television distribution licensed properties. In other words the website is the storefront for the electronic delivery of professional grade product deliverables.

Through the above described systems and components of and a digital delivery system that may include a website or a network accessible application provides a secure encrypted and easy to use file based delivery solution to receive video assets. The system provides a central access hub for licensees to source all video assets required for content acquisition decisions promotions and broadcast. In this regard preview video streamed through the system can replace DVD screeners while broadcast video accessed via system replaces videotape.

The system provides combines three different sites functions into a single system application 1 a public site catalog 2 marketing assets system and 3 a screening and download system. An overview of each function will be described followed by detailed descriptions of the user interface features of embodiments of the invention.

The public site catalog provides a non password protected area for pre sales information to be searched. All content available can be viewed to assist a customer in evaluating content as part of the purchase decision. As part of the catalog digital posters may be displayed with content information. By hovering over a poster with a cursor an enlarged view may be displayed that upon activation provides an overview of the product property associated with the poster that may include cast or other publicly available information. Low resolution photographs public trailers and other publicly accessible material may be available in this portion of the system .

The marketing assets system is available to authorized users via login and password. The information in the marketing assets system provides information based on the particular license associated with the authorized user. In other words the assets that can be viewed may reflect the licensed rights from contract system based on the security parameters set forth in DAPR . Accordingly when an asset has been licensed the content owner e.g. sales representative from the content owner enters the license terms into the back end system e.g. contract system and such assets are reflected in the logged in area of system .

The screening and download system may be viewed by customers once logged in e.g. via username and password . In this system the authorized customer can view items available for download and screening. The screening capability allows users to preview video content using a graphically rich user interface as described herein. Further the screening capabilities may be configured for multi party viewing via a television or through a mobile device. Such screening and downloading capabilities may include assets such as full length video audio elements photography scripts music cue sheets on air promos etc. In addition to traditional marketing assets authorized customers may have the ability to retrieve download intellectual property including a technical data transfer associated with an asset show concept. Such distribution is referred to as a format title asset distribution. For example the idea concept for a reality show e.g. Beauty and the Geek may be sold to a customer in a different country and the screening download system provides the ability to transfer the concepts set design blue prints etc. for the idea concept to the authorized customer .

In addition the screening and download area provides a unique user interface indicating content available for download and screening for every authorized customer based on what that customer has licensed. Further such downloadable content may be DRM protected.

To provide the digital delivery system various tools and features may be utilized to provide a unique experience for each party accessing the system . The unique and novel user interface provides and enables unique and novel functionality to customers . As described above such an interface not only provides the ability to preview video content but also organizes the video assets to enable convenient access by navigating to a specific program title wherein each title may have its own video asset collection allowing licensees e.g. customers to easily locate organize and stream content.

Authorized customers are provided with the ability to search products assets available to the customer . illustrates an advanced search graphical user interface presented to a customer in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. Various search fields are presented to the customer. The user may enter text to search in the title keywords or synopsis keywords area . Alternatively customers may search based on name box office range release year range WPR world product registry title or the total number of episodes range .

In addition to the text based fields customers may search or filter their search based on a variety of defined categories using radio buttons check boxes such as product category genre MPAA rating run time access theme and or title status . One may note that other search fields may be included in the advanced search options and the selection method e.g. radio button drop drown list etc. is not limited to those described herein.

Once the customer has conducted the search as desired the results may be displayed in a variety of formats. is a graphical user interface displaying search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The bar on the left of the display area indicates the various filters that are used to display the results. Customers can check or uncheck the desired options to modify the filters used. In check marks appear across all of the product categories both licensed and unlicensed assets all run times and only published titles.

The results are illustrated sorted by release date . As illustrated different posters title rep graphics are displayed based on the query results. Each poster represents a title. The posters may further provide information at different levels. For example title A is for a feature film title B is for an individual episode of Burn Notice i.e. episode entitled Question and Answer while title C is for the entire 2009 season of Burn Notice . Thus customers may select a desired title at whatever desired level i.e. series season episode to view additional information. The arrows below the corner of each title poster provides the ability to drill down up to a different level. Thus by clicking the up left arrow on episode title B the user can view more details regarding the season of Burn Notice. Similarly by clicking the up left arrow in season title C the user can view further details regarding the Burn Notice series. The right down arrow allows the user to navigate and view details at a more explicit level e.g. series season episode .

Alternatively the user can select the poster itself and view details regarding the selected poster . illustrates a graphical user interface displaying a detailed overview for a season title i.e. season 8 of 24 that has been selected by the user in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. Once the detailed overview screen has been displayed the user can opt to navigate the entire series. Accordingly in while the user originally selected the poster corresponding to the 8season of 24 the user has opted to navigate the 24 series with a series navigation pop up window . The individual episodes in season 8 are also displayed in the series navigation window . By selecting the arrows within dialog box the user can expand or contract the individual seasons listed therein. By selecting the star icon the title can be added to a favorites list that can be viewed as a group by the user.

In addition to overview the customer may also elect to view the marketing assets or video e.g. to download or screen licensed titles .

The user may further elect to put a particular title into a cart by selecting the cart icon in or . The cart icon may prompt the user to utilize either a title cart or an asset cart. Alternatively when in the overview window titles may be added to the title cart and while in the marketing assets window marketing assets may be placed into the asset cart.

The title cart provides the ability to build a list of titles that may then be used as desired. For example a sales representative may build a title list as a proposed package to sell to customers . Further once the customer navigates to the title cart availability for the titles placed therein can be determined. For example only those titles licensed by the particular logged in customer may appear in the title cart.

As illustrated in the user can easily switch between the title and asset carts by selecting the appropriate tabs buttons and . illustrates an asset cart graphical user interface displayed in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In the asset cart users can organize and manage assets such as photographs scripts trailers etc. that may be available for download. In the first season episode 1 00 P.M. 2 00 P.M. of 24 has been placed in the asset cart and three .jpg images are available for download. Additionally episodes of Bones and another episode of 24 have been placed into the asset cart. The expansion arrows buttons can be used to view the assets available for any particular title in the asset cart. In this regard the arrows may be used to show hide assets for each grouping episode . The download button can be selected to download all checked assets in the broadcast quality asset cart. The download arrow can be selected to download all checked assets in a group while download arrow can be selected to download only that particular asset in the corresponding row.

Returning again to when a user hovers or activates a poster a pop up window such as window displays the different assets titles that can be accessed downloaded etc. The different formats for which the asset title can be provided to the customer may also be displayed and grouped based on the particular asset title. For example videos e.g. PAL HD etc. may be grouped by asset such that all videos of a particular format that can be downloaded screened broadcast etc. may be found within the listing for a particular asset title.

Broadcast Video for a current television product may include two delivery options Quick Delivery and Final International Master FIM Broadcast Video.

Quick Delivery QD is a television distribution descriptor for Broadcast Video of a television product that is mastered with full mix English stereo audio only. QD elements do not include separate music and effects tracks or textless video backgrounds. QD elements are basically clones of U.S. Network broadcast masters. Non English licensees may be unable to create final dubbed language versions of a program from QD elements but the creation of subtitled versions of a product may be possible.

QD elements for current television series products may be made available on the day of U.S. broadcast if a licensee s request is pre approved. Licensees accessing file delivery for these episodes may have the opportunity to schedule broadcast of content immediately following its U.S. broadcast subject to contractual terms.

Final International Master FIM is a descriptor for Broadcast Video of television product that is mastered with full mix English stereo audio stereo music and effects tracks and textless video backgrounds. FIM elements provide the necessary components to create final dubbed language versions for a program. FIM elements for current television series product may be made available for file download 20 30 days after its U.S. broadcast subject to contractual terms of license agreements. Alternatively a mastering process may enable the FIM file to be available slightly before a U.S. broadcast for some titles. Such titles may not have a QD asset.

When a customer logs onto the system the default or homepage presented to the user may be customized. Such customization may be established by the user or by an administrator depending on the implementation utilized . illustrate the graphical user interface for defining the customization attributes for a user s home page in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.

In the user s password can be changed. Further the default sorting order for the titles and assets may be established. In this regard the default sort option may be set to A to Z release date or access date. Further the default view options may be defined as small thumbnail large thumbnail or list view. The title list access options may also be defined to either include or exclude licensed and not licensed from the title list.

In title list status options approved or approval cancelled can be defined. Further the default homepage option allows the customer to change what titles are seen on the default homepage. It may be easier to work with only the titles the customer has under license. However the customer can change the settings to view all titles titles in the user s playlist new titles favorite titles or saved searches e.g. using a drop down for the search selection . The default asset view allows the customer to group or ungroup assets. Video streaming settings are for streaming preview video only and may be defined for a fast internet connection play immediately or slow internet connection wait before play .

In default product category filter options e.g. feature films series seasons episodes miniseries etc. may be specified. Such settings allow the customer to include or exclude product categories from showing up in the customer s my title list .

In addition to additional user preferences may include a listing of season passes for a particular user i.e. those titles for which the user has currently licensed the listed season and or broadcast quality download options may be specified e.g. to opt out of e mail notifications stating when assets have been authorized to automatically add broadcast video to a broadcast video asset cart and or by default to include an identified list of broadcast quality specs in a broadcast quality list e.g. HD 1080I 30 HD 1080I 25 SD PAL 4 3 SD PAL 16 9 etc. . The user can then save all the settings by selecting the save changes icon at the bottom of .

In view of users may have the ability to assign different settings for playlists licensed titles etc. to utilize such settings as default options.

Users may further have the option to save searches queries for content that they have performed. Referring again to as described above the user may define all of the query options in fields . Using buttons icons and such searches can be saved for later use retrieval. Users may further assign a custom identifier e.g. text name to any search. Using button icon the user can easily select any searches previously saved e.g. by selecting the dropdown arrow .

Once a search has been saved the results are dynamically updated based on the saved search. For example if the search criteria specify an actor s name when the search is conducted any new titles with that actor will appear in the query results. Further if the saved search is used as a default home page the results are automatically and dynamically updated based on the most recent list of assets titles available. In addition if the user does not have a license and later obtains a license to a particular product the results of the query will reflect those titles that are actually licensed and will update accordingly. Further users may also have the capability to search for particular assets or types of assets e.g. based on title actors etc. rather than being limited to just searching video titles.

Individualized playlists may also exist for customers . Assets titles can be added to a playlist if screening capability exists for that title. With respect to the playlist a customer may have access to an entire season and can request an entire season worth of video to be added to their playlist at a single time. To add such material to a playlist the customer needs a subscription to a particular season and may simply click the season pass button link icon below a poster billboard e.g. button of .
