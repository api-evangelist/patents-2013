Related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 875 414 filed May 2 2013 and entitled TIME BASED CONFIGURATION PROFILE TOGGLING assigned to the assignee of the present application is hereby incorporated by reference.

In some situations user devices may have access to one or more configuration profiles that may be enabled on the user devices. The configuration profiles may for instance configure the user device for personal and or business use such as configuring email accounts applications hardware features software features and or the like. Conventional approaches of using such persona specific configuration profiles include providing a user device with access to only one of either personal configuration profiles or business configuration profiles to control which persona is enabled on the user device at the proper time. For instance an Information Technology IT administrator may manually enable a set of business configuration profiles on a user device owned by the business upon hiring a new employee that will use such user device for tasks related to the business. The IT administrator may further upon an authorized condition disable the business configuration profiles on the user device and enable the personal configuration profiles on the user device to allow the employee to use the user device for tasks related to the employee s personal affairs.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is this Summary intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Location based configuration profile toggling may be provided. A user device may be instructed to enable a configuration profile if it is determined that the user device is authorized to enable the configuration profile based at least in part on a current location associated with the user device. Additionally a user device may be instructed to disable a configuration profile if it is determined that the user device is not authorized to enable the configuration profile based at least in part on a current location associated with the user device. A user device may thereby be for instance instructed to toggle between personal configuration profiles and business configuration profiles based on a configured office location. More specifically the user device may be instructed to enable business configuration profiles upon entering the office location disable personal configuration profiles upon entering the office location enable personal configuration profiles upon leaving the office location and disable business configuration profiles upon leaving the office location.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory only and should not be considered to restrict the disclosure s scope as described and claimed. Further features and or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example embodiments of the disclosure may be directed to various feature combinations and sub combinations described in the detailed description.

The following Detailed Description refers to the accompanying Drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers are used in the Drawings and the following Detailed Description to refer to the same or similar elements. While embodiments of the disclosure may be described modifications adaptations and other implementations of the disclosure are possible. For example substitutions additions or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the Drawings without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. The methods described herein may be also modified by substituting reordering or adding stages to the methods without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly the following Detailed Description does not limit the disclosure instead the proper scope of the disclosure is defined by the appended Claims.

Location based configuration profile toggling may be provided. To reduce the cost of ownership of user devices and cellular and or data service charges associated with use of such user devices a business may implement a bring your own device BYOD policy to allow an employee to use her personal device to access business resources rather than provide the employee with a business owned user device for such purpose. To support such a BYOD policy a user device administrator i.e. IT administrator may manage a group of personally owned user devices via a management application executed by a management server in communication with the user devices over a network to provide the user devices with secure access to business resources.

The user device administrator may enroll user devices into the management system to monitor the user devices for security vulnerabilities and to configure the user devices for secure access to business resources. The user device administrator may create and or configure at least one configuration profile via a user interface provided by the management system. A configuration profile may comprise a set of instructions and or settings that configure the operations and or functions of a user device which may ensure the security of the accessed resources. The user device administrator may for instance configure a business email configuration profile by specifying the network address and access credentials of a business email account that the users of the user devices are authorized to access. Other configuration policies may include but are not limited to hardware software application function cellular text message and data use restrictions which may be based at least in part on the current time and or location of the restricted user device. The user device administrator may thereafter deploy the configuration profiles to specific user devices such as to groups of user devices of employees with similar roles privileges and or titles.

The user devices may also have access to personal configuration profiles that may be created by the users of the user devices. The user devices may for instance have access to a personal email configuration profile that was created by a user of the user device to provide access to her personal email account. Thus a user device enrolled in a BYOD management system may have more than one configuration profile for a given use of a user device such as a personal email configuration profile and a business email configuration profile that are both used for accessing email accounts on the user device.

Location based configuration profile toggling may be provided which may ensure the security of business resources and or to ensure the productivity of employee users of user devices with access to business resources. User devices may be instructed to enable certain configuration profiles and or disable certain configuration profiles based at least in part on the current location associated with the user devices. More specifically user devices may be instructed to toggle between personal configuration profiles and business configuration profiles based on a configured office location. The user device administrator may instruct the user devices to enable and or disable certain configuration profiles via an agent application executed on the user devices which may be installed on the user devices upon enrollment into the BYOD management system. Alternatively the user device administrator may instruct the user devices to enable and or disable certain configuration profiles via application programming interface API calls to the operating system of the user devices which may be remotely transmitted from the management system to the user devices over a cellular and or data network.

In any case the user devices may be instructed to enable and or disable certain configuration profiles according to authorization rights specified by the user device administrator such as location based authorization rights. For example a BYOD policy may specify that user devices enrolled in the BYOD management system are authorized for personal use outside of the workplace and are authorized for business use inside the workplace. To implement such a policy a user device administrator may instruct the user devices to toggle between personal configuration policies and business configuration policies based on the current location associated with the user device which may be determined by GPS Wi Fi cellular network tower triangulation and or the like. As an example location based configuration profile toggling may be provided by instructing a user device to enable business configuration profiles and disable personal configuration profiles when the current location of the user device is within a configured office location and to disable business configuration profiles and enable personal configuration profiles when the current location of the use device is outside the configured office location.

Time based configuration profile toggling may be provided which may ensure the security of business resources and or to ensure the productivity of employee users of user devices with access to business resources. User devices may be instructed to enable certain configuration profiles and or disable certain configuration profiles based at least in part on the current time associated with the user devices. More specifically user devices may be instructed to toggle between personal configuration profiles and business configuration profiles based on a configured workday. The user device administrator may instruct the user devices to enable and or disable certain configuration profiles via an agent application executed on the user devices which may be installed on the user devices upon enrollment into the BYOD management system. Alternatively the user device administrator may instruct the user devices to enable and or disable certain configuration profiles via application programming interface API calls to the operating system of the user devices which may be remotely transmitted from the management system to the user devices over a cellular and or data network.

In any case the user devices may be instructed to enable and or disable certain configuration profiles according to authorization rights specified by the user device administrator such as time based authorization rights. For example a BYOD policy may specify that user devices enrolled in the BYOD management system are authorized for personal use outside of the workday and are authorized for business use during the workday. To implement such a policy a user device administrator may instruct the user devices to toggle between personal configuration policies and business configuration policies based on the current time associated with the user device. The current time may be based on the current time at the current location of the user device which may be determined by GPS Wi Fi cellular network tower triangulation etc. or may be based on the current time at a configured primary location associated with the user device which may be the primary office location of an employee user of the user device. As an example time based configuration profile toggling may be provided by instructing a user device to enable business configuration profiles and disable personal configuration profiles while the current time is between 9 AM and 5 PM at the current location of the user device and to disable business configuration profiles and enable personal configuration profiles while the current time is between 5 PM and 9 AM at the current location of the user device.

Moreover user device may store one or more compliance rules . Compliance rules may specify conditions and or events required for user device to perform certain functions on user device . In some embodiments compliance rules may specify that user device must satisfy and or comply with a single condition for user device to be authorized to perform certain functions of user device associated with the compliance rules . For instance compliance rules may require that user device is associated with a current time that is within an authorized time period specified by such compliance rules in order for user device to be authorized to perform certain functions of user device . More specifically compliance rules may specify that user device is authorized to access a business email account while the system clock of user device is within a configured workday and is not authorized to access the business email account while the system clock of user device is outside of the configured workday.

In some embodiments compliance rules may specify that user device must satisfy and or comply with more than one condition for user device to be authorized to perform certain functions of user device associated with the compliance rules . For example compliance rules may specify that user device must be associated with a safe zone location to perform certain functions of user device which may require that both a GPS sensor of user device indicates that user device is currently located within the safe zone and a Wi Fi network access point associated with the safe zone is communicatively coupled to and or enrolled with the Wi Fi network access point.

In some embodiments compliance rules may specify that user device and another computing device similar to and or identical to user device satisfy and or comply with one or more conditions for user device to be authorized to perform certain functions of user device associated with the compliance rules . Compliance rules may require that user device be located within proximity of and or be communicatively coupled to a secondary user device and that both user devices be located within an authorized location in order to perform certain functions of user device . As an example compliance rules may specify that user devices associated with nurses may only access medical records of patients while the user devices associated with the nurses are located within 10 feet of user devices associated with such patients and both the user devices associated with nurses and user devices associated with patients are located within examination rooms specific to the patients appointments.

In some embodiments compliance rules may be granular such that user device may be authorized to perform different functions depending on how many of the conditions of the compliance rules are satisfied by user device . For example user device may be authorized to access a business contact list on user device if a GPS sensor on user device indicates that user device is located within the business s office location but user device may be prohibited from sending a business email until it is confirmed that user device is located within a safe zone by being communicatively coupled to a Wi Fi network access point associated with the business s office location.

In any case compliance rules may be associated with configuration profiles such that compliance rules may determine whether user device is authorized to enable configuration profiles on user device . For instance compliance rules may specify that certain configuration profiles may only be enabled on user device while a current time associated with user device is within an authorized time period specified by compliance rules as within a configured workday. User device may receive configuration profiles and compliance rules from a user device management service communicatively coupled to user device . User device may receive a distribution of configuration profiles and compliance rules from a user device management service over the air such as via a data network .

An agent application on user device may determine whether compliance rules are satisfied for instance by determining whether device profile satisfies compliance rules . For instance agent application may determine whether device profile specifies that the current time associated with user device is within a configured workday specified by compliance rules . Alternatively user device may transmit all and or a portion of device profile to a user device management service that may determine whether user device satisfies compliance rules . In any case user device may be authorized and or instructed to perform functions of user device according to the specifications of configuration profiles in response to a determination that user device complies with compliance rules associated with such configuration profiles .

The management server may comprise a configuration profile store comprising a plurality of configuration policies that may be applicable to user device as described herein. The management server may further comprise a compliance rule store comprising a plurality of compliance rules . While the configuration profile store and compliance rule store are shown as within the management server the configuration profile store and compliance rule store may alternately be within the user device and or remotely located on a file server and may be remotely updated periodically by management server according to common over the air OTA updating methods.

As described herein requests and or attempts by user device to perform certain functions on user device may require user device to be in compliance with compliance rules stored which may be stored in compliance rule store . Further if the user device complies with compliance rules associated with the requested functions of user device user device may provide the functions in accordance with configuration profiles which may be stored in configuration profile store . Depending on the sensitivity of a given functionality different compliance rules may be necessary to ensure that the functionality is adequately restricted. Some functionality may only require ensuring that the proper user is requesting the functionality. Other resources may require compliance with more stringent authorization rules such as determining whether the functionality is restricted within and or outside of certain locations. Accordingly user device and or management server may be operative to determine whether a user of user device is authorized to perform requested functionality upon the user s request to perform such functionality.

In some embodiments an agent application executed on user device may make the compliance determination based on a device profile user credentials and or user preferences. For instance the agent application may monitor calls by applications such as a web browser an e mail client and or a secure application on user device to the operating system of user device to determine whether user device seeks to perform functionality associated with a given compliance rule . Additionally the agent application on user device may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the agent application may instruct operating system on user device to enable certain configuration profiles on user device in response to a determination that user device is authorized to enable the configuration profiles based at least in part on the user device s current location and compliance rules associated with such configuration profiles specifying at least one authorized location where the user device is authorized to enable such configuration profiles .

While agent application is depicted as a single application on user device capable of determining whether user device is authorized to perform functions of the user device agent application may comprise applications plug ins application wrappers and or software developer kits SDK specific to certain functionality of user device . Accordingly user device may store a multitude of function specific agent applications that collectively communicate with operating system of user device and or management server .

In some embodiments the agent application executed on user device may rely on management server to determine whether a given functionality request on user device is authorized according to the compliance rules . For instance the agent application may transmit a functionality request a device profile user credentials and or user preferences to management server so that management server may determine whether user device seeks to perform functions of user device that may violate certain compliance rules associated with the functions. Additionally management server may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the management server may instruct operating system on user device via agent application on user device to disable certain configuration profiles on user device in response to a determination that user device is not authorized to enable the configuration profiles based at least in part on the user device s current location and compliance rules associated with such configuration profiles specifying at least one authorized location where the user device is not authorized to enable such configuration profiles .

The network may comprise for example any type of wired and or wireless network such as a wireless local area network WLAN a wireless wide area network WWAN Ethernet fiber optic network and or any other type of wired and or wireless network now known or later developed. Additionally the network may be or include the Internet intranets extranets microwave networks satellite communications cellular systems PCS infrared communications global area networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of such networks .
