Advantages of the communication system according to the example of this embodiment will be described. In the technique disclosed in this Description the mobile phone can be used as an input module for inputting a character string to the MFP . Since the size of the panel of the mobile phone is larger than the size of the panel of the MFP it is possible to increase the displayed keyboard image for accepting the input of character strings and to improve character input operability.

In the technique disclosed in this Description the general purpose character input application that is already mounted on the mobile phone can be used as an application for inputting a character string to the MFP . Thus it is possible to eliminate the need to provide the mobile phone with a special purpose character input application for inputting a character string to the MFP .

In the technique disclosed in this Description character string information is communicated between the MFP and the mobile phone using the standard character code system for example Unicode . Due to this it is possible to deal with various kinds of character input applications and to eliminate the dependence on the model of the mobile phone . Moreover since the size of the character string information can be decreased it is possible to communicate the character string information using the NFC communication which provides a lower transmission rate than a wireless LAN or the like.

In the technique disclosed in this Description using the establishment of the NFC communication with the mobile phone as a trigger S YES the item identification information and the like can be sent to the mobile phone S . Thus it is possible to eliminate the operation for sending the item identification information and the like to the mobile phone and to improve the user convenience.

In the technique disclosed in this Description by sending the character type group to the mobile phone S and S the mobile phone can be informed of the character type that the MFP accepts. Due to this the character input application for inputting the character type that the MFP accepts can be activated by the mobile phone S . Thus since the user of the mobile phone does not need to perform the operation for selecting the same character type as the character type that the MFP accepts it is possible to improve the user convenience.

In the technique disclosed in this Description by sending the MFP input character string information to the mobile phone S and S it is possible to display the character string input by the MFP on the mobile phone S . Due to this since a continuation of the character string that is input halfway on the MFP side can be input using the mobile phone it is possible to improve the input operability.

In the technique disclosed in this Description when the character type of the character string represented by the mobile phone character string information that is received from the mobile phone is the character type that is available for the selected input item S YES the process of displaying the character string represented by the mobile phone character string information in the character string display area is completed S . Due to this it is possible to prevent the occurrence of a situation in which a received character string is displayed in the character string display area when the character string of the character type that is not accepted for the selected input item is received from the mobile phone .

In the technique disclosed in this Description when the mobile phone character string information for an input item that is different from the selected input item is received from the mobile phone S NO the character string represented by the mobile phone character string information can be controlled so as not to be displayed in the character string display area. Due to this it is possible to prevent the occurrence of a situation in which the received character string is displayed in an incorrect input item.

In the technique disclosed in this Description the input of a character string that is accepted by the mobile phone can be limited to fall within the range of a character number upper limit S . Thus it is possible to prevent the occurrence of a situation in which a character string having a number of characters exceeding the upper limit is sent from the mobile phone .

In the technique disclosed in this Description the NFC communication is used for the communication between the MFP and the mobile phone . Due to this by bringing the mobile phone so as to approach the MFP the approached MFP can be selected as a character input target MFP . That is even when there is a plurality of MFPs it is possible to identify the character input target MFP using a communication module. Thus it is possible to intuitively select a character input target MFP .

In the technique disclosed in this Description the NFC communication is used for the communication between the MFP and the mobile phone . Thus since it is not necessary to perform communication setting when initiating communication between the MFP and the mobile phone it is possible to select the character input target MFP with a simple operation of bringing the mobile phone close to the MFP .

When the item identification information for identifying each input item is allocated in advance to each input item the size of the item identification information increases as the number of input items increases. For example in an address book when the input item is identified for each registered person the item identification information required has a larger size as the number of registered person increases. In the technique disclosed in this Description item identification information random number is generated whenever communication is executed S . Due to this it is possible to eliminate the process of allocating item identification information in advance to each input item. Thus it is possible to prevent the occurrence of a situation in which the size of the item identification information increases even when there is a number of input items.

While specific embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above such description is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope and claims of the invention. Techniques described in the claims of the invention include various modifications and changes made to the specific examples illustrated above. Modifications will be described below.

The character string input screen P shown in is an example of a display screen and another display mode may be used. For example the name Name of the selected input item may be not displayed in the character string display area A. Further a plurality of input items Name Mail Address and the like may be displayed in the character string input screen P. Moreover an input item that is selected as an input target item among the plurality of input items may be highlighted. Furthermore a cursor that indicates the position at which characters are input may be displayed in the input item selected as an input target item.

Although a case where when it is judged in S that the character type that is not available for the selected input item is included in the character string represented by the mobile phone character string information an error message is displayed S has been described the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. Only characters that are available for the selected input item may be extracted from the character string represented by the mobile phone character string information and the extracted character string may be displayed in the character string display area A.

Although a case where a random number is used as the item identification information has been described S the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment. The item identification information may be allocated in advance to each input item.

Although an embodiment in which the input of the character string by the mobile phone is confirmed when the Confirm button image is pressed S has been described the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment. For example the input of the character string by the mobile phone may be confirmed when the NFC communication with the MFP is established in S that is when the mobile phone is held over the MFP . As a result since the operation of confirming the input of a character string and the operation of executing communication can be integrated it is possible to simplify the operations.

When it is judged in S that the OK button image B is not pressed S NO the flow may proceed to S. In S the CPU may judge whether an instruction to cancel the character string input operation is input. By doing so when a character string is sent from the mobile phone the user can be allowed to judge whether or not to confirm the input of the character string.

Although input items such as name reading and pronunciation thereof mail address and telephone number have been illustrated as examples of the input item the present invention is not limited to these examples. Other information password or the like may be used as the input item . Although an address book has been illustrated as an example of the information stored in the information storage area other information may be stored.

The standard character code system used for the MFP input character string information and the mobile phone character string information is not limited to Unicode and other character code systems may be used.

Although an embodiment in which the NFC communication is used for communicating various items of information between the MFP and the mobile phone has been described the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and wireless LAN communications and may be used for example.

Further devices such as notebook type PCs which have an NFC communication function may be used instead of the mobile phone . In this case the character input application and the communication application may be various types of driver software that are installed in the notebook type PC.
