This patent application is a divisional of and claims priority from non provisional patent application 13 363 486 filed Feb. 1 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to the employer employee relationship of the Government to the inventors as U.S. Department of Energy employees and site support contractors at the National Energy Technology Laboratory.

One or more embodiments relates to an MCrAlY bond coat comprised an MCrAlY layer in contact with a Y AlOlayer. The MCrAlY composition is comprised of Yttrium and Aluminum and further comprised of greater than 50 weight percent wt. of a metal M where the metal M is Ni Co Fe or combinations thereof and the MCrAlY layer is comprised of a M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics. The Y AlOlayer is comprised of Yttrium atoms coordinated with oxygen atoms comprising the AlOlattice. Both the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer have a substantial absence of Y Al oxides providing advantage in the maintainability of the Yttrium reservoir within the MCrAlY bulk. A method of fabrication is additionally disclosed.

MCrAlY type coatings are commonly used as overlay coatings and bondcoats for the protection of components against high temperature oxidation and corrosion. During exposure to high temperatures an oxide scale forms on the MCrAlY surface becoming part of the original system. This thermally grown oxide is largely comprised of alumina and often represents the starting point for failure. Correspondingly the growth rate and adhesion of the oxide scale and the aluminum depletion in the bondcoat are among the determining factors for the useful lifetime of am MCrAlY bond coated article.

At long term exposures the alumina scales are prone to spallation. The scale spallation is a common event under temperature cycling conditions due to the thermal expansion mismatch between the oxide and the metallic substrate and failure is generally related to scale thickness growth rate and adherence. The two latter parameters are crucially affected by the addition of Yttrium as well as other reactive elements such as Lanthanum Zirconium and Hafnium. These reactive elements will commonly constitute some percentage typically less than 0.5 wt. to the base MCrAl composition. These reactive elements have been found to greatly improve alumina scale adherence and significantly increase the critical scale thickness for spallation. However this beneficial effect is highly sensitive to the Y concentration. In some cases optimum oxidation and improved adherence is obtained by low concentrations of Y in the coating around 0.1 wt. whereas a few tenths of a weight percent more over 0.5 wt. can lead to accelerated oxidation and detrimental oxide morphology. This implies that relatively low amounts of Yttrium are desired in the coating. Issues have arisen as a result of this Yttrium content sensitivity however because Yttrium can be tied up by Y Al oxides resulting from typical fabrication processes and the effective Yttrium concentration of the MCrAlY coating may significantly deviate from that of the original MCrAlY source material.

Depletion of the Yttrium reservoir through the formation of excessive Y Al oxides will therefore promote TGO spallation in service. Such depletion results in deviation from the optimum Yttrium content designed to obtain a compromise between the beneficial effect on oxide adherence without extensively enhancing the growth rate of the oxide. Defining and maintaining this optimum yttrium content it is absolutely necessary to take into account the actual Yttrium reservoir in the MCrAlY coating. See e.g. Toscano et al. Parameters affecting TGO growth and adherence on MCrAlY bond coats for TBC s 201 2006 among others. It would be advantageous to provide an MCrAlY bond coat wherein the formation of Y Al oxides is suppressed and the Yttrium reservoir of the final heat treated composition could be largely defined by the Yttrium concentration of the original MCrAlY source material. Such an MCrAlY bond coat would mitigate variations in the Y distribution and the reservoir of metallic Y in MCrAlY coatings and avoid the significant variations in the alumina scale growth rate and adherence which accrue from nominally equivalent MCrAlY bond coat compositions.

Additionally a common feature of the oxide morphology in MCrAlY bond coats is the formation of YOcompounds near or at the metal oxide interface known as pegs. The coefficient of diffusion of oxygen in YOis about 2.2 10cm s and is considerably higher than the surrounding AlO where the value is generally around 1 10cm s at 700 C. . As a result the presence of YOin the alumina scale is associated with locally accelerated oxidation along these Y compounds which leads to internal oxidations intruding in the coating alloy. In real oxide scales this short circuit path diffusion significantly impacts the kinetics of internal MCrAlY bulk oxidation. It would be additionally advantageous to provide an MCrAl bond coat wherein an upper surface layer of Y AlOwith an absence of YOcould be formed in order to mitigate internal MCrAlY bulk oxidations enabled by short circuit path diffusion through YOin the upper layer. Such an absence of YOand other Y Al oxides in the MCrAlY upper layer would further preserve the reservoir of metallic Y in MCrAlY coatings and promote MCrAlY effective lifetimes.

Provided here is an MCrAlY bond coat comprised of an MCrAlY layer in contact with a Y AlOlayer. The MCrAlY layer is comprised of a M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics. The Y AlOlayer is comprised of Yttrium atoms coordinated with oxygen atoms comprising the AlOlattice. The MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer have a substantial absence of Y Al oxides. The absence of selected Y Al oxides within the MCrAlY layer provides advantage in the maintainability of the Yttrium reservoir within the MCrAlY bulk and the absence of selected Y Al oxides within the Y AlOlayer mitigates oxygen diffusion and undesired modification of the originally intended Yttrium distribution in the underlying MCrAlY bulk.

These and other objects aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the accompanying description and claims.

The disclosure provides a bond coat comprised of an MCrAlY layer in contact with a Y AlOlayer. The MCrAlY layer may be further in contact with a substrate surface. The MCrAlY layer is comprised of Yttrium and Aluminum and further comprised of greater than 50 weight percent wt. of a metal M where the metal M is Ni Co Fe or combinations thereof. In an embodiment the MCrAlY layer is in contact with a nickel based substrate and the metal M is Ni Co or Ni and Co. The MCrAlY layer is comprised of a M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics and has a substantial absence of Yttrium Aluminum Garnet YAG and Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite YAP phases. The Y AlOlayer is comprised of Yttrium atoms and AlO where the Yttrium atoms are coordinated with oxygen atoms comprising the AlOlattice. Generally the Y AlOlayer is comprised of equiaxed grains of AlOwhere the AlOgrain boundaries are enriched with Yttrium at grain boundary cation sites.

Additionally the MCrAlY layer and Y AlOlayer have a substantial absence of various Y Al oxide phases as opposed to typical MCrAlY bond coats generated through the vacuum heat treatment of MCrAlY materials. The absence of these Y Al oxides maintains the Y oxide distribution within the MCrAlY bulk and has a significant effect on the growth rate and adherence of the alumina scale and lifetime of the bond coat. The absence of these Y Al oxides within the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer is both advantageous and difficult to achieve.

In a particular embodiment MCrAlY layer and Y AlOlayer are fabricated by a process of depositing an MCrAlY material on a substrate preparing a YOpaste comprised of a halide activator and heat treating the article in a non oxidizing atmosphere to generate the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer. The YOpaste is comprised of YOand a halide activator and may be further comprised of inert filler and inert transport fluid. The halide activator may be selected from any of the activators known for use in the pack cementation technique and suitable for the production of yttrium containing vapors when placed in the presence of YOat sufficient temperature. The YO halide activator and optionally inert filler are combined and thoroughly mixed as required to make the YOpaste composition. The YOpaste is applied to the MCrAlY upper surface by any convenient cost effective manner and the paste covered article is heated in a non oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of from about 400 C. to about 1300 C. for a sufficient period of time sufficient to generate the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer. Following the heating period any excess remaining YOpaste may be removed from the heat treated article generating a bond coated article.

The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention. Various modifications however will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art since the principles of the present invention are defined herein specifically to provide a bond coated article comprised of a Y AlOlayer atop an MCrAlY layer where the Y AlOlayer and the MCrAlY layer have a substantial absence of Yttrium Aluminum Garnet and Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite phases.

The disclosure provides a bond coat comprised of an MCrAlY layer in contact with a Y AlOlayer. The MCrAlY layer may be further in contact with a substrate surface. The MCrAlY layer is comprised of Yttrium and Aluminum and further comprised of greater than 50 weight percent wt. of a metal M where the metal M is Ni Co Fe or combinations thereof. In an embodiment the MCrAlY layer is in contact with a nickel based substrate and the metal M is Ni Co or Ni and Co. The MCrAlY layer is comprised of a M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics and has a substantial absence of Yttrium Aluminum Garnet YAG and Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite YAP phases. The absence of YAG and YAP phases provides advantages in Y distribution and maintainability of the Yttrium reservoir within the MCrAlY bulk over typical MCrAlY bond coats generated through the vacuum heat treatments.

The Y AlOlayer is comprised of Yttrium atoms and AlO where the Yttrium atoms are coordinated with oxygen atoms comprising the AlOlattice. The Yttrium enrichment along the grain boundaries provides significant benefit in terms of oxygen diffusivity. Additionally the Y AlOlayer has a substantial absence of Yttria YAG and YAP phases as opposed to the typical upper layers generated through the vacuum heat treatment of MCrAlY materials. The absence of Yttria and mixed Y Al oxide compounds in the Y AlOlayer mitigates diffusion and undesired modification of the originally intended Yttrium distribution in the underlying MCrAlY bulk. The absence of Yttria and mixed Y Al oxide compounds additionally reduces scale spallation due to stress concentration and thermal expansion mismatch.

Within this disclosure the descriptive MCrAlY when applied to a layer or material denotes a material composition comprised of a base metal M chromium Cr aluminum Al and yttrium Y where the base metal M is typically Iron Fe Nickel Ni Cobalt Co or a combination of Ni and Co and where the material composition is at least 50 wt. of the base metal M at least 10 wt. Cr and at least 7 wt. Al where the wt. values are based on the total weight of the material composition. In an embodiment the material composition is about 0.05 to about 1.5 wt. yttrium. In a further embodiment an MCrAlY material has a composition of 22 wt. Cr 10 wt. Al 1.0 wt. Y balance Ni. In another embodiment an MCrAlY material has a composition of 32 wt. Ni 21 wt. Cr 8 wt. Al 0.5 wt. Y balance Co

Within this disclosure an MCrAlY layer means a layer having an MCrAlY composition and comprised of an M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics. A M solid solution means a face centered cubic FCC solid solution of the base metal M in the MCrAlY composition where the base metal M is the solvent and Al Cr and possibly other elements are the solute. MAl intermetallics means a body centered cubic BCC intermetallic of the base metal M and Al. Y type intermetallics means an intermetallic of Yttrium and the base metal M or other metallic elements. As is understood typically the M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics will result from the heat treatment of an MCrAlY material under specific temperature time and atmospheric requirements.

Within this disclosure YAG means a Yttrium Aluminum Garnet having the chemical structure YAlO YAP means a Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite having the chemical structure YAl and Yttria means a Yttrium oxide having the chemical structure YO.

Within this disclosure a substantial absence of Yttria YAG and YAP phases within a Y AlOlayer means that cathodoluminescence of the Y AlOlayer generates a CL emission spectra where absorption peaks corresponding to Yttria YAG and YAP wavelengths are undetectable above background. Similarly a substantial absence of YAG and YAP phases within a MCrAlY layer means that cathodoluminescence of the MCrAlY layer generates a CL emission spectra where absorption peaks corresponding to YAG and YAP wavelengths are undetectable above background.

The disclosure further provides a process for producing the bond coated article disclosed comprised briefly of depositing an MCrAlY material on a substrate preparing a YOpaste comprised of a halide activator and heat treating the article in a non oxidizing atmosphere. The process generates the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer disclosed by blocking oxygen diffusion into the MCrAlY bulk during heat treatment and mitigating Yttrium diffusion toward the surface thereby avoiding significant variation in the intended Y distribution and the Yttrium reservoir.

At Y AlOlayer is comprised of Yttrium atoms and AlO where the Yttrium atoms are coordinated with oxygen atoms comprising the AlOlattice. Generally and without being bound by theory Y AlOlayer is comprised of equiaxed grains of AlOwhere the AlOgrain boundaries are enriched with Yttrium at grain boundary cation sites. Typically the grain boundary enrichment is reflected by an enrichment factor of at least 100 where the enrichment factor is the ratio of Yttrium concentration at grain boundaries to that within some statistically significant population of grains with an average grain boundary cation coverage of typically between 6 and 10 . See e.g. Thompson et al. Dopant Distributions in Rare Earth Doped Alumina 80 2 1997 . The Yttrium enrichment along the grain boundary provides significant benefit in terms of oxygen diffusivity within Y AlOlayer as is understood. In some cases Yttrium enrichment along the grain boundaries of AlOhas generated diffusivities up to 10 times lower than that of pristine grain boundaries. See e.g. Nakagawa et al. Yttrium doping effect on oxygen grain boundary diffusion in a Al2O355 2007 .

Additionally Y AlOlayer has a substantial absence of Yttria YAG and YAP phases as opposed to the typical upper layers generated through the vacuum heat treatment of MCrAlY materials. In typical vacuum heat treatments where residual oxygen partial pressures on the order of 10mbar are experienced the formation of Yttria and mixed Y Al oxide compounds is expected. These compounds result from the high oxygen affinity of Yttrium driving a Yttrium diffusion from within the bulk of the MCrAlY material which modifies the originally intended Y distribution in the heat treated MCrAlY bondcoat. Additionally Yttria and mixed Y Al oxide compounds particularly large YAG particles are linked to increased scale spallation due to stress concentration and thermal expansion mismatch. See e.g. Pint Optimization of Reactive Element Additions to Improve Oxidation Performance of Alumina Forming Alloys 86 4 2003 . The absence of Yttria YAG and YAP phases within Y AlOlayer is thus a configuration which is both difficult to achieve and advantageous in operational service.

The Y AlOlayer may be a continuous or discontinuous layer. For example illustrates MCrAlY layer in contact with substrate at substrate surface and further in contact with Y AlOlayer at MCrAlY upper surface where Y AlOlayer is a discontinuous layer comprised of Y AlOregions such as Y AlOregion . When the Y AlOlayer is comprised of regions such as Y AlOregion the individual Y AlOregions have the same properties as those described for the Y AlOlayer such as Y AlOlayer . As such whether the Y AlOlayer is a continuous or discontinuous layer is not a limitation of this disclosure. Within this disclosure it is only necessary that the Y AlOlayer whether continuous or discontinuous is in contact with the MCrAlY upper surface and that when the MCrAlY layer is in contact with a substrate surface that the Y AlOlayer is separated from the substrate surface by at least some portion of the MCrAlY layer.

At MCrAlY layer is comprised of Yttrium and Aluminum and further comprised of at least 50 wt. of a metal M at least 10 wt. Cr and at least 7 wt. Al where the metal M is Ni Co Fe or combinations thereof and comprised of phases including a M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics. Depending on the exact chemical composition of MCrAlY layer additional phases may also be present. Generally the structure of MCrAlY layer is comprised of distinct M solid solution and MAl intermetallic phases with Y type intermetallics between the phases. In an embodiment an MCrAlY material utilized to form MCrAlY layer has an MCrAlY composition comprised of from about 15 to about 25 wt. chromium from about 7 to about 15 wt. aluminum from about 0.05 to about 0.5 wt. yttrium and at least 50 wt. of the base metal M where the wt. values are based on the total weight of the composition.

Additionally MCrAlY layer has a substantial absence of YAG and YAP phases as opposed to typical MCrAlY bond coats generated through the vacuum heat treatment of MCrAlY materials. Generally residual oxygen partial pressure in typical vacuum chambers is on the order of 10mbar resulting in the formation of mixed Y Al oxide compounds. Depending on the Yttrium content of the MCrAlY material and the oxygen partial pressure employed Y Al oxide compounds can additionally be expected within the bulk of the MCrAlY bond coat layer along with in some cases a generally continuous layer of yttria and significant Yttrium diffusion toward the surface. See e.g. Gil et al. Y rich oxide distribution in plasma sprayed MCrAlY coatings studied by SEM with a cathodoluminescence detector and Raman spectroscopy 204 2009 and see Subanovic et al. Effect of manufacturing related parameters on oxidation properties of MCrAlY bondcoats 59 2008 . This generated Y oxide distribution modifies the Y distribution within the MCrAlY bulk and has a significant effect on the growth rate and adherence of the alumina scale and lifetime of the bond coat. Additionally because significant variations in the Y distribution and the reservoir of metallic Y in MCrAlY coatings can be caused by only minor variations in the processing parameters the alumina scale growth rate and adherence may be different for nominally the same MCrAlY bondcoats negatively impacting the reproducibility of bond coat lifetimes. See e.g. Toscano et al. Parameters affecting TGO growth rate and the lifetime of TBC systems with MCrAlY bondcoats 59 2008 among others. Thus the substantial absence of YAG and YAP phases within MCrAlY layer provides a more uniform and predictable Y distribution and significantly mitigates issues associated with Y oxide formation and altered Y distribution profiles.

When MCrAlY layer is a cast layer it is expected that MCrAlY layer will additionally have a substantial absence of Yttria in addition to the absences of YAG and YAP phases. However depending on the method of fabrication some Yttria formed during application may be unavoidably present. See e.g. Gudmundsson et al. Yttrium oxides in Vacuum plasma Sprayed CoNiCrAlY Coatings 173 1989 among others.

It is known that Yttria YAG and YAP exhibit significant cathodoluminescence and may be utilized to determine the morphology and distribution of YOand Y Al mixed oxide phases within MCrAlY coatings. See Gil et al. and see Subanovic et al. among others. Correspondingly as used herein and above a substantial absence of Yttria YAG and YAP phases within Y AlOlayer means that cathodoluminescence of some portion of Y AlOlayer generates a CL emission spectra where absorption peaks corresponding to Yttria YAG and YAP wavelengths are undetectable above background. Similarly a substantial absence of YAG and YAP phases within MCrAlY layer means that cathodoluminescence of some portion of MCrAlY layer generates a CL emission spectra where absorption peaks corresponding to YAG and YAP wavelengths are undetectable above background.

As stated MCrAlY layer is comprised of a M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics. As defined a Y type intermetallic as used here means an intermetallic compound consisting of Yttrium and at least one other metal. For example when MCrAlY layer derives from a source material composition where the base metal M is Nickel and Cobalt MCrAlY layer may be comprised of NiY CoY and CrY among others as Y type intermetallics. These intermetallics define a Yttrium atomic concentration within MCrAlY layer which is relatively stable around the original Yttrium atomic concentration of the MCrAlY source material utilized to generate the MCrAlY layer. For example when the MCrAlY source material has an MCrAlY composition comprised of 0.1 wt. Yttrium and MCrAlY layer comprised of M solid solution a MAl intermetallic phase and Y type intermetallics results from heat treatment of the MCrAlY source material the resulting Y type intermetallics define a Yttrium atomic concentration within MCrAlY layer approximately equivalent 0.1 wt. . This is distinguished from typical Yttrium containing MCrAlY layers where even low oxygen partial pressures during heat treatment are sufficient to tie up a significant portion of the MCrAlY source material s Yttrium in Y Al oxides within the MCrAlY bulk. Additionally as will be discussed infra the diffusion of Yttrium toward the surface is mitigated during vacuum heat treatment resulting in a relatively homogenous Yttrium distribution within MCrAlY layer .

Maintaining a significant majority of the Yttrium as a Y type intermetallic has distinct advantage over MCrAlY layers where a significant portion of the Yttrium component may be tied up in Y Al oxide inclusions effectively removing that Yttrium from the available Yttrium reservoir of the MCrAlY layer. There is strong indication that an important life time governing factor of MCrAlY coatings is the Yttrium incorporation into the alumina based Thermal Grown Oxide TGO formed during service which correspondingly generates a decrease of the yttrium concentration in the coating over a component lifetime. If the yttrium concentration is decreased beneath a critical level its positive effect on TGO adherence is lost resulting in TGO spallation. See e.g. Toscano et al. Parameters affecting TGO growth rate and the lifetime of TBC systems with MCrAlY bondcoats 59 2008 . Thus within the MCrAlY layer of this disclosure maintaining a large majority of the Yttrium component in the form of Y type intermetallics with a substantial absence of Y Al oxides acts to maximize the Yttrium reservoir of the material delaying spallation of thermally grown oxides during subsequent service.

In an embodiment the Yttrium within an MCrAlY layer such as MCrAlY layer defines a Yttrium component and the Y type intermetallics within the MCrAlY layer are comprised of at least 90 wt. of the Yttrium within the Yttrium component. Stated differently 90 wt. of the Yttrium in the MCrAlY layer is in the form of a Y type intermetallic.

As indicated at MCrAlY layer may be further in contact with substrate surface of substrate . In an embodiment substrate is nickel base alloy and the base metal M comprising MCrAlY layer is Ni Co or Ni and Co. Additionally Y AlOlayer may be further in contact with topcoat . In an embodiment topcoat is comprised of yttria stabilized zirconia.

In a particular embodiment MCrAlY layer and Y AlOlayer are fabricated by a process of depositing an MCrAlY material on a substrate preparing a YOpaste comprised of a halide activator and heat treating the article in a non oxidizing atmosphere to generate the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer as follows 

As earlier defined an MCrAlY material is a material having a material composition comprised of a base metal M chromium aluminum and yttrium. The base metal M is typically Iron Nickel Cobalt or a combination of Nickel and Cobalt. Generally the MCrAlY material has an MCrAlY composition comprised of from about 15 to about 25 weight percent wt. chromium from about 7 to about 15 wt. aluminum from about 0.05 to about 0.5 wt. yttrium and greater than about 50 wt. of the base metal M where the wt. values are based on the total weight of the composition. In an embodiment the MCrAlY material has an MCrAlY composition comprised of 22 wt. Cr 10 wt. Al 1.0 wt. Y balance Ni. In another embodiment an MCrAlY material has an MCrAlY composition of 32 wt. Ni 21 wt. Cr 8 wt. Al 0.5 wt. Y balance Co.

The MCrAlY material composition described can be manufactured as a powder for use in depositions using for example a spraying technique. The material composition including all elemental constituents may be prepared with powders generated by conventional powder processing methods such as inert gas atomization from ingots. Alternatively powder blends may be prepared by mixing separate powders of individual elements or alloys. In a final powder composition prepared in this manner the weight percentage of each elemental constituent corresponds to the ranges earlier provided. A preferred diameter for the metallic powder particles regardless how formed is between about 5 to about 50 microns.

The MCrAlY material is deposited as a coating layer on a substrate surface such as substrate surface of substrate at . The MCrAlY material is deposited using conventional methods such as low pressure plasma spray LPPS electron beam physical vapor deposition EBPVD High Velocity Oxygen Fuel HVOF spray or other methods known in the art for deposition of an MCrAlY material onto a substrate surface. See e.g. Pawlowski 2Ed. 2008 . In an embodiment the MCrAlY material is deposited on the substrate surface to a thickness of about 20 microns. In another embodiment where the base metal M of the MCrAlY material is Nickel or Cobalt the substrate is comprised of a nickel base alloy. Deposition of the MCrAlY material onto substrate surface of substrate generates an MCrAlY material surface where the MCrAlY material surface is a surface of the MCrAlY material separated from substrate surface by some portion of MCrAlY material .

In an embodiment the MCrAlY material has an MCrAlY composition comprised of 22 wt. Cr 10 wt. Al 1.0 wt. Y balance Ni or comprised of 32 wt. Ni 21 wt. Cr 8 wt. Al 0.5 wt. Y balance Co and the MCrAlY material is deposited by atmospheric plasma spray APS or high velocity oxygen fuel HVOF on a substrate comprised of an advanced Ni based single crystal alloy such as RENE N5 developed by General Electric Company PW1484 developed by Pratt Whitney RR2000 developed by Rolls Royce or CMSX 4 developed by Cannon Muskegon Corporation and the equivalents.

The YOpaste is comprised of YOand a halide activator and may be further comprised of inert filler and inert transport fluid. In an embodiment the YOcomprising the YOpaste is at least 10 wt. of the combined weight of the YO halide activator and inert filler and the halide activator is at least about 0.1 wt. of the combined weight of the YOand the halide activator.

YOis commercially available as a powder with typical purities of 99.5 wt. to 99.99 wt. . Although any particle size may be employed it has been found advantageous to use particles of relatively fine size. Preferably the YOis relatively fine for ease in suspending in a paste or slurry. Generally YOparticle size is less than 200 microns preferably less than 45 microns more preferably less than 10 microns.

The halide activator serves to reacts with the YOpowder during a high temperature coating process to produce yttrium containing vapors which are carried to the MCrAlY upper surface. The halide activator may be selected from any of the activators known for use in the pack cementation technique and suitable for the production of yttrium containing vapors when placed in the presence of YOat sufficient temperature. Suitable halide activators may be selected from any of the activators known for this purpose and combinations thereof and equivalents. Typically the halide activator includes one or more halide salts. Suitable halide activators include AlF AlCl NHF NHCl NaF NaCl KF and KCl among others. In an embodiment the halide activator is present in an amount of at least about 0.1 wt. of the combined weight of the YOand the halide activator. In an embodiment the YOpaste is comprised of 0.5 g NaCl per 150 g YO.

The inert filler is a material which is not reduced by yttrium containing vapors and which prevents the sintering of YO. Generally the inert filler may comprise 10 wt. to 80 wt. of the YOpaste. Fillers are known in the art that inhibit sintering of YOand include alumina thoria calcia zirconia and other stable and inert refractory oxides and mixtures thereof. The inert filler may be added in the same particle size range as the YO with typical particle size less than 200 microns preferably less than 45 microns more preferably less than 10 microns.

The YO halide activator and optionally inert filler are combined and thoroughly mixed as required to make the YOpaste composition. An inert transport fluid such as water may be added generally in an amount of about 30 wt to 40 wt of the YOpaste. In an embodiment the YOpaste is comprised of 0.5 g NaCl and 150 g YOper 100 cc of water. This is stirred until it has a consistence of about milk or cream. Frequent stirring or continuous stirring during application provides the best coating.

The YOpaste is applied to the MCrAlY material surface by any convenient cost effective manner. Dipping brushing and spraying are all effective. In an embodiment the YOpaste is applied to the MCrAlY material surface in a layer less than about 1 micron thick. illustrates YOpaste applied to MCrAlY material surface . Application of YOpaste to MCrAlY material surface generates a paste covered article where the paste covered article is comprised of substrate MCrAlY material and YOpaste where MCrAlY material is in contact with substrate at substrate surface and further in contact with YOpaste at MCrAlY material surface and where YOpaste is separated from substrate by at least some portion of MCrAlY material as illustrated at . In an embodiment a topcoat material such as yttria stabilized zirconia is then applied to the surface of the YOlayer.

The paste covered article is then heated in a non oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of from about 400 C. to about 1300 C. for a sufficient period of time sufficient to generate the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer where the MCrAlY layer and the Y AlOlayer have properties as described. In an embodiment the paste covered article is heated at a temperature of about 900 C. for a period of about 2 hours. A non oxidizing atmosphere as used in this disclosure means an atmosphere having either a total pressure or partial pressure of oxygen less than about 10mbar.

Following the heating period any excess remaining YOpaste may be removed from the heat treated article generating a bond coated article.

The method as described above may be utilized for the production of the bond coated article comprised of the Y AlOlayer and the MCrAlY layer as described. Without being bound by theory it is believed that utilization of the YOpaste in the non oxidizing atmosphere as described acts to severely mitigate the diffusion of any residual oxygen existing during the heat treatment prescribed. This residual oxygen is typically present in vacuum heat treatment furnaces which generally exhibit oxygen pressures on the order of 10mbar during operation. As is understood Yttrium has the highest oxygen affinity in typical MCrAlY materials and Yttria is generally the first oxide to form during early oxidation stages. The low oxygen pressure exhibited by standard vacuum heat furnaces is sufficient to generate a strong diffusion of Yttrium within the MCrAlY material toward the surface and subsequent oxidation as well as the formation of YAG and YAP phases within the MCrAlY bulk. The method as described above allows the formation of a bond coated article comprised of the Y AlOlayer and the MCrAlY layer as described by blocking oxygen diffusion into the MCrAlY bulk during heat treatment resulting in a Y AlOlayer comprised of equiaxed grains of AlOenriched with Yttrium at grain boundary cation sites and having a substantial absence of Yttria YAG and YAP phases and an MCrAlY layer in contact with the Y AlOlayer where the MCrAlY layer is comprised of M solid solution MAl intermetallics and Y type intermetallics with a substantial absence of YAG and YAP phases. The produced material thus avoids significant variation in the intended Y distribution and the reservoir of metallic Y in MCrAlY coatings and mitigates the negative impacts to bond coat lifetimes.
