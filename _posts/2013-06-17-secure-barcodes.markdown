This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 173 606 filed on Jun. 30 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure.

The present disclosure relates generally to methods and systems for generating and authenticating barcodes and in particular to generating trusted barcodes.

As business governmental academic and scientific operations become increasingly computer enabled and thus dependent on the storage and manipulation of electronic or digital information a greater need arises for efficient mechanisms for communicating electronic information to users.

Barcodes provide a useful and convenient way to convey electronic information through a variety of electronic devices. A barcode is generally an optical machine readable representation of data which for example shows data about the object to which it is attached. Traditionally barcodes have represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel dark lines and are often referred to as linear or one dimensional 1D barcodes. 1D barcodes are scanned in a one dimensional fashion by special purpose optical scanning devices that are able to decode the information encoded in the barcodes by measuring the widths and spacings of the parallel barcode lines through reflective light feedback.

1D barcodes however suffer from the drawback that their one dimensional structure allows for only a limited amount of information to be encoded in the barcode. For example a Universal Product Code UPC which is a one dimensional barcode format that enjoys widespread usage today is capable of encoding only 12 decimal digits including start and end patterns. Because of this limitation the last several decades have seen significant growth in the number of standards for two dimensional 2D or matrix barcodes.

Many matrix barcodes mimic the functionality of traditional one dimensional barcodes by providing a pattern of two dimensionally arranged squares rectangles dots hexagons or other shapes of varying lengths and widths distributed in two dimensions. One example of a type of matrix barcode that has enjoyed popular usage is the Quick Response or QR code standard. Governed by several standards various versions of QR codes are capable of storing up to 7 089 numeric code characters 4 296 alphanumeric characters or 2 953 bytes when encoding purely binary data.

Although by no means a new standard QR codes have recently gained widespread use as a result of the advancement of mobile devices such as smartphones which are capable of reading and quickly rendering barcode data such as QR codes. One common use of QR codes has been to encode Uniform Resource Locators URLs such as website addresses. Such QR codes are often placed on billboards mailers or even buildings to provide consumers with a quick and easy way to visit a company s website without having to memorize write down or manually type a URL into a smartphone or other mobile devices. Consumers who see a QR code displayed may take a picture of the QR code using a camera embedded for example in the smartphone and may utilize a smartphone application to automatically translate the QR code to a URL and launch a browser application pointed to the URL. Additional commercial uses of QR codes include encoding coupons or other purchase information into QR codes customers may decode such QR codes into graphical or textual coupons and present those coupons at businesses to receive discounts on purchased goods or services.

One problem with barcodes including QR codes is their safety that is it may be difficult or impossible for a user to determine whether a URL encoded within a QR code points to a malicious or otherwise inappropriate website. For example although a business could attach a QR code on a billboard to advertise its website custom address an imposter may surreptitiously overlay a second QR code over the original QR code such that the second QR code directs customers to the imposter s website intended to mimic the website of the business. The imposter s website may then perform malicious acts such as infect the user s device with malware or steal the user s password or identity information. Similarly customers providing or decoding QR codes for the purpose of obtaining coupons or discounts could potentially print out or display forged QR codes that fraudulently entitle them to increased discounts or rewards.

Therefore there is a need for a system to create for businesses QR codes that promote those businesses in a manner that prevents an imposter from abusing the QR code. Alternatively there is a need for a method to enable the user to verify or at least assure that a URL encoded in a QR code is secure and thus can be trusted.

The disclosure is directed to methods and systems for introducing trust into bar codes such as QR codes by providing a mechanism for a trusted third party such as a Certificate Authority CA to verify their content.

In implementations a non transitory computer readable storage medium comprising instruction that cause one or more processors to perform a method is disclosed.

In implementations the target content data can include a first target content data and response data can include a first response data that includes the first target content data and the method can further include generating a mapping to reflect an association between the identifier and the first response data and modifying the mapping to reflect an association between the identifier and a second response data the second response data including a second target content data that is different from the first target content data.

In implementations the target content data can include a first target content data and response data can include a first response data that includes the first target content data and the method can further include generating a mapping to reflect an association between the identifier and the first response data modifying the mapping to reflect an association between the identifier and a second response data the second response data including a second target content data that is different from the first target content data receiving the request data including the identifier extracting the identifier from the request data identifying the second response data based on the mapping and providing the second response data.

In implementations the request data can be received from an author of the target content data and receiving the target content data can further include receiving the target content data from the author of the target content data and providing to the author a business to business Application Programming Interface B2B API that enables the author to send the target content data to the trusted third party and to receive the resolution data from the trusted third party.

In implementations the encoding the identifier and the IP address of the trusted third party in the n dimensional barcode can include encoding the identifier and the IP address of the trusted third party in the QR code using a base64 encoding scheme or a custom encoding scheme.

In implementations the method can further include storing the QR code in a computer readable storage medium at the trusted third party and providing a memory address corresponding to a location of the stored QR code.

In implementations a non transitory computer readable storage medium is disclosed that can comprise instruction that cause one or more processors to perform a method. The method can include receiving request data that includes an identifier extracting the identifier from the request data retrieving a response data corresponding to the target content data based on the identifier wherein the response data and the identifier are associated with an n dimensional barcode verifying the target content data and transmitting the response data that was retrieved to an electronic device.

Importantly although the disclosure is contemplated primarily in the context of QR codes it can be applied to any type of bar code that is capable of encoding URLs or other types of content that a business wishes to transfer to a user. The disclosure may be applied to various types of contents including barcodes and in particular 2D matrix barcodes such as QR codes.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosure as claimed.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. Also similarly named elements perform similar functions and are similarly designed unless specified otherwise. Numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the embodiments described herein. The embodiments may be practiced without these details. In other instances well known methods procedures and components have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the embodiments described. While several exemplary embodiments and features are described herein modifications adaptations and other implementations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly the following detailed description does not limit the disclosure. Instead the proper scope of the disclosure is defined by the appended claims.

In various embodiments a certificate authority CA creates for a business trusted content that can be safely used by a user. illustrates an exemplary system for creation of trusted content in accordance with some embodiments. System includes an author and a certificate authority CA . In various embodiments author is a business client of CA who creates a target content and in response receives from CA a corresponding trusted content in the form of resolution data which in the embodiment of is a QR code.

For example in author is a business called Enterprise Business and target content is a URL target URL or destination URL created by author . Further resolution data is a QR code that encodes an address resolution address as further explained below. In author desires to encode into a trusted QR code the target URL www.EnterpriseBusiness.com promotions coupons coupon 425135 which encodes a URL address of a coupon issued by author . Alternatively author may advertise a special product or offering such as a contest and may thus encode the URL of the contest s webpage into a trusted QR code. In some embodiments whenever a user scans the trusted QR code with the user s mobile device the mobile device displays the content of the barcode. In some embodiments the mobile device upon selection and load commands by the user or automatically opens the target address or displays the target content.

CA is a system that receives target content and accordingly creates a trusted content for example trusted QR code for author . In the embodiment shown in CA includes various modules including a receiver a target verifier a response generator a resolution generator a transmitter and a storage medium .

Receiver receives from author target content and transmitter transmits to author resolution data . In some embodiments receiver and transmitter may be a processor executing receiver and transmission software modules. In some embodiments receiver and transmitter may be dedicated hardware modules executing firmware for receiving and transmitting information respectively. Receiver and transmitter may also respectively include a network receiver and transmitter such as a wired or a wireless network card and execute the corresponding software for respectively receiving target content from a network connected to author and transmitting to that network resolution data . Alternatively in various embodiments author and CA communicate via other mechanisms for example near field communication techniques.

Target verifier verifies the content of target content . In some embodiments target verifier can include a malware analyzer e.g. a virus detector for checking that target content does not include any malicious software that might harm a user s receiving device. Alternatively in some embodiments target verifier can include a content analyzer for checking whether target content includes any content that might not be appropriate for a specific group of users. In some embodiments target verifier is a hardware module e.g. a processor which executes software codes encoding the malware analyzer or the content analyzer or both. In the embodiment shown in target verifier verifies that the target URL www.EnterpriseBusiness.com promotions coupons coupon 425135 does not direct to a location which includes malware or inappropriate content.

Response generator generates response data and an identifier for response data . In some embodiments depending on the results of the analysis by target verifier response data is data that either points to target content or points to a warning or an access denial message. In the embodiment shown in for example target verifier verifies that target content is safe and accordingly response generator generates response data that includes the URL address www.EnterpriseBusiness.com promotions coupons coupon 425135 pointing to the coupon.

Upon generating response data response generator also generates identifier . In some embodiments identifier is a unique identifier for response data . In the embodiment shown in response generator generates identifier with a value 12986 and maps this identifier to response data . Moreover in some embodiments response generator passes identifier to resolution generator .

Resolution generator receives identifier and accordingly generates a resolution address . In some embodiments resolution address includes an address e.g. a URL address of CA . Moreover resolution address encodes identifier . In the embodiment shown in for example resolution address is the URL address www.verisign.com secure QR code.aspx id 12986 which includes the URL address of CA www.verisign.com and also the value of identifier id 12986 . A browser upon receiving resolution address connects to a server for CA here verisign.com and sends to that server the identifier also embedded in resolution address . Alternatively in some embodiments resolution generator generate a shortened URL such as http vsn.qr znqkh2 which uniquely identifies CA and the target URL or identifier and embeds that shortened URL in resolution address .

In the embodiment of resolution data is a QR code that encodes resolution address . CA transmits through transmitter resolution data to author . Author can then apply the QR code directly on its products or on a location e.g. a billboard to be scanned by a user.

In some embodiments the author sends the CA the target content or receives the QR code via a web application. In some other embodiments the author uses an application programming interface API to interact with the CA. In particular such an API can enable a business to interact with another business e.g. the CA. Moreover in some embodiments the CA encodes the QR image into a base64 or a custom encoding and transfers that encoded QR image to the author. Such encoding minimizes the amount of data transfer over the network.

In yet other embodiment instead of transmitting the QR code the CA stores the QR image in storage medium and sends an address of the image to author . Author can thus retrieve the QR image by using its address at a later time.

The CA thus performs steps required to generate resolution data based on the target content received from the author. illustrates an exemplary flow chart performed by the CA for generating resolution data according to some embodiments.

In block the CA receives the target content. In various embodiments target content can be the URL address of the website of an author the address of a promotion or an advertisement by the author or a file containing an image audio data or video data which the author wishes to convey to a customer via some trusted content. In some other embodiments the CA receives the target content in the form of a text a barcode encoding the target content or an address of the target content or digital data representing the barcode. In some embodiments the barcode itself is a QR code.

In block the CA verifies the target content. In various embodiments the CA verifies the target content by checking whether the target content includes any malicious software or content that might not be appropriate for a specific group of users.

In block the CA generates response data in accordance with the results of the verification in block . In some embodiments if in block the CA determines that the target content includes malicious or inappropriate content the CA generates response data to include warning or access denial messages as explained below in detail. Alternatively if the CA determines that the target content is safe and appropriate in some embodiments the CA generates response data that may include a target URL pointing to the target content.

In block the CA generates an identifier for the response data. In various embodiments the CA generates the identifier as a unique identifier of the response data. In some embodiments the CA generates for each response data a unique identifier and stores in a storage medium each response data and its corresponding identifier. Further the CA stores information related to the one to one mapping between each identifier and its corresponding response data such that a response data can be identified from its identifier.

In block the CA uses the identifier to generate resolution data. In various embodiments the resolution data is a resolution address which includes an address e.g. a URL address of the CA and also encodes the identifier. In some embodiments the resolution address of the CA is a shortened URL that uniquely identifies the CA and the target content. In some embodiments the shortened URL may be a vrsn URL.

In some embodiments the author receives the resolution address and generates a barcode e.g. a QR code encoding the resolution address. In some embodiments the CA generates the resolution data as a barcode e.g. a QR code that encodes the resolution address.

In block the CA analyzes the target content for harmful content e.g. computer viruses worms trojan horses or spywares. To that end the CA may apply an anti malware software tool to the target content. In some embodiments the CA uses VIMS a malware detector created by VeriSign Inc.

Based on the results of block in decision block the CA determines whether the target content is deemed safe. If the target content is not safe block No in block the CA generates a corresponding message as the response data and ends the process. For example in block the CA may generate an access denied page for informing the user that the user cannot access the target content because the target content is unsafe. In some embodiments and based on the policy of the business the CA may instead generate a warning or an alert and give the user the option to further proceed or stop navigating into the unsafe content.

If the target content is deemed as safe block Yes in block the CA analyzes the target content for inappropriate content. For example in some embodiments the CA checks whether the target content includes illegal content or adult content that might not suit young users. Illegal content may include for example content that is being distributed in violation of copyright laws.

Based on the results of block in decision block the CA determines whether the target content is appropriate. If the target content is not appropriate block No in block the CA generates a corresponding message as the response data and ends the process. For example in block the CA may generate a warning page for warning the user that the target content includes some inappropriate content and inquiring the user whether to proceed.

If the target which was already deemed safe in block is also deemed appropriate block Yes the CA generates a safe response data that can be used by the user and ends the process. In some embodiments safe response data includes the target content. In some other embodiments safe response data includes an address pointing to the location of target content on a server.

In some embodiments the CA generates and sends to the author a QR code that encodes the response data. Further in some embodiments the CA also includes in the QR codes some human readable information for authenticating the QR code or providing a seal of confidence. illustrates such a QR code in accordance with some embodiments. QR code includes a QR pattern a human readable PIN and a human readable authentication mark . In some implementations the authentication mark can include alphanumeric characters or a picture that is unique to the trusted third party a website associated with the trusted third party the content provider a website associated with the content provider or the content consumer.

QR pattern is the pattern of the QR code which encodes the information in the QR code. In various embodiments QR pattern includes a set of two dimensionally arranged squares rectangles dots hexagons or other shapes of varying lengths and widths distributed in two dimensions. In some other embodiments the shapes in QR pattern all have the same color. In some other embodiments the shapes in QR pattern have different colors and thus QR code conveys some of the information by using those various colors.

QR code patterns present some error correction capability due to some redundancy that is provided in their pattern. In other words if some portion of the QR code is lost or not captured correctly the information embedded in the QR code can still be recovered from the remainder of the QR code. Therefore in these embodiments a portion in the area of the QR code pattern can be covered by some other information without affecting the information encoded in the QR code. In some embodiments the information in the QR code can be fully recovered from at little as 70 of the pattern embedded in the QR code. In these embodiments thus up to 30 of the area of the QR code can be used for conveying information other than the QR pattern.

Accordingly in the embodiment shown in the CA has overlaid some portions of QR code by PIN and authentication mark . PIN is a human readable PIN that corresponds to the response data encoded in the QR code as described below in more detail. In some embodiments the CA generates PIN as a unique PIN mapped to the response data and stores the PIN and the mapping to the response data in a storage medium. In yet other embodiments the CA maps and stores a one to one relationship between a PIN and an identifier both corresponding to the same response data. In some embodiments the CA generates PIN as part of generating resolution data in block of flowchart .

PIN is a human readable PIN and in various embodiments includes alphanumeric characters shapes or other images that can be easily recognized by a user. In the embodiment shown in PIN consists of the characters X23A. PIN is used by the user when interacting with the CA to further verify the authenticity of the QR code. In particular the CA can identify an imposter who has tampered with a QR code to modify the resolution data because the tampered QR code does not include a PIN that corresponds to the modified resolution data.

Authentication mark is also a human readable portion that indicates to the user that the QR code was generated by the CA. In some embodiments authentication mark includes a trademark of the CA a web address of the CA or another identification of the CA. In for example authentication mark consists of VERISIGN.COM indicating that QR code was generated by VeriSign Inc and thus infer the QR code must point to VeriSign.com. Authentication mark provides to the user an additional level of authentication for QR code as described below in more detail. In some embodiments authentication mark changes based on the target content. In some embodiments the CA generates authentication mark as part of generating resolution data in block of flowchart .

A user who is familiar with the CA and trusts the CA will trust the QR code that bears the authentication mark of the CA. In particular when using the QR code the user expects the QR code to point to the address of the CA whose authentication mark appears on the QR code. For example a user expects QR code to direct the user s device to VeriSign.com. Thus the user may refuse to use the QR code if the QR code resolves to a different address or points to a different site. Such a difference may indicate that the QR code has been tampered by an imposter with the intention to redirect the user s device to a different address. Alternatively a user s device may be configured such that it will automatically refuse using a QR code if the QR code does not point to the address of the trusted CA. In some embodiments the QR code encodes the identifier and the user device is configured to upon reading an identifier append to the identifier the address of a predetermined trusted CA. In some embodiments the user device is configured to read the identifier and send the identifier to a predetermined trusted CA.

In various embodiments the CA may generate and include one both or none of a PIN and an authentication mark in the QR code. Moreover in various embodiments PIN or authentication mark are not overlaid on some section of the QR code and are instead provided next to the QR code or by other means. In some embodiments PIN may be provided to the user via alternative methods e.g. through mail email or phone messages.

The author thus uses the resolution data e.g. the QR code in its advertisements or other commercial interactions with the user. A user upon seeing the QR code can use an electronic device to scan and resolve the QR code such that the user s device connects to the CA and retrieves the content encoded in the QR code.

User device decodes and analyzes the information encoded in QR code to determine the target address and further to extract a request data . In the embodiment shown in the target address extracted from QR code is www.verisign.com and the request data includes the identifier value 12968 also extracted from QR code i.e. from the information secure QR code.aspx id 12986.

User device uses the extracted target address to connect to CA and further transmits to CA request data and in response receives from CA response data . In the embodiment of response data includes the target URL www.EnterpriseBusiness.com promotions coupons coupon 425135 discussed above. In some embodiments response data also includes other information related to the target URL such as the type of its content or whether it contains any malicious code.

In the embodiment shown in CA receives and processes information embedded in request data and accordingly generates response data . In accordance to the embodiment shown in CA includes various modules for processing request data including an ID extractor a PIN verifier and a response provider . In various embodiments ID extractor PIN verifier or response provider are each a hardware or a software module performing the functions outlined below. In some embodiments CA includes a processor that executes software modules corresponding to one or more of the ID extractor PIN verifier and response provider .

ID extractor receives information in request data and extracts from request data an identifier . In the embodiment shown in ID extractor receives request data which includes the information related to identifier and accordingly extract the value 12986 for identifier . ID extractor transmits identifier to PIN verifier .

In embodiments which use a PIN for further verification of the QR code PIN verifier uses identifier to identify the corresponding PIN. In particular PIN verifier uses the mapping between the identifiers and the PINs to identify the PIN corresponding to identifier . In yet other embodiments PIN verifier identifies the PIN by first identifying the resolution data that corresponds to the identifier and then identifying the PIN that corresponds to the identified resolution data.

Upon identifying the PIN PIN verifier verifies the identified PIN by interacting with the user in accordance with some embodiments. In the embodiments shown in the identified PIN is X23A. In some embodiments PIN verifier causes a PIN confirmation form or its equivalent to be displayed on user device . PIN confirmation form displays the identified PIN X23A and requests that the user confirm that the identified PIN X23A is the same as the human readable PIN that the user can read on QR code . Alternatively in some embodiments PIN verifier causes a PIN entry form or its equivalent to be displayed on user device . PIN entry form requests that the user enter the human readable PIN that the user can read on QR code . PIN verifier reads the PIN that the user enters into PIN entry form and verifies that the entered PIN is the same as the identified PIN.

If the PIN read by the user from QR code matches the identified PIN PIN verifier directs response provider to provide the response to user device . In some embodiments response provider uses identifier to identify the corresponding response data e.g. by using the mapping between the response data and the identifier. Upon identifying the corresponding response data that is response data response provider transmits that response data to user device .

In the embodiment shown in response provider causes a response retrieval screen to be displayed on user device to inform the user that the PIN has been verified and that user device is being redirected to the target URL embedded in response data . In some embodiments response provider automatically redirects user device to the target URL using a redirect mechanism such as the 302 http redirect. Upon redirect the target URL automatically opens on user device . In some embodiments response provider transmits target URL to user device and directs the user to open the target URL to access the desired content. In yet other embodiments the CA performs as a proxy server for the server presenting the target content.

The CA thus performs steps required to verify the request data and accordingly send the response data to the user device. illustrates an exemplary flow chart for verification and transfer of response data in accordance with some embodiments.

In block the CA receives the request data. In some embodiments the request data includes an identifier. In some embodiments the request data is extracted from sections of a URL address that is generated by decoding a QR code. In block the CA extracts the value of the identifier from the received request data.

In block the CA verifies that the user is in possession of the PIN that corresponds to the received identifier. In various embodiments the CA first finds the corresponding PIN by using a direct mapping between the identifiers and the PINs or an indirect mapping between them using the response data corresponding to both. Further in some embodiments the CA uses a PIN confirmation form or a PIN entry form displayed on the user s device to verify that the identified PIN is the same as a human readable PIN that the user has received along with the request data.

In decision block the CA checks whether the user is in possession of the identified PIN. If the CA determines that the user was not in possession of the correct PIN block No in block the CA denies the user access to the corresponding response data and ends the process. In some embodiments in block the CA displays a message on the user s device indicating that the PIN could not be verified. In some other embodiments the CA may request the user to try re entering the PIN and attempt verifying the reentered PIN up to a number of times.

If the CA verifies that the user was in possession of the correct PIN block Yes in block the CA finds the response data that corresponds to the identifier. In some embodiments the CA uses the pre stored mapping between the identifiers and the response data to find the corresponding response data.

In block the CA transmits the found response data to the user s device and ends the process. In some embodiments the response data is in the form of a data file an image an audio file a video file or a URL address transferred to the user s device. In some embodiments the response data is in the form of a URL address that is redirected to the user s device such that the user s device automatically opens the destination of the URL address.

In some embodiments an author can later switch the target content without changing the identifier. The CA can thus provide a service to the author allowing the author to switch the mapping of the same identifier from a first target content to a second target content. In these embodiments an identifier is originally mapped to a first target content e.g. www.ijk.com. Thus users who scan the corresponding QR code encoding the identifier is directed to the first target content. The author might then generate a second target content e.g. www.xyz.com that is distinct from the first target content. The author can then use the service provided by the CA to change the mapping of the identifier from the first target content to the second target content. From then on a user who scans the same QR code will be directed to the second target content.

In yet other embodiments the CA provides an auditing service. Via the auditing service the CA collects the statistics of some specific actions by the user s of the system and feeds them to the system for other usages. For example the auditing service may collect the statistics of the number of times a specific QR code is decoded and use that statistics to identify the QR codes that are highly used or underused.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that although described primarily in the context of barcodes for optical scanning the present disclosure may be applied to any situation in which physical objects or phenomena in which machine readable information has been encoded are converted to digital or electronic data by a scanning listening or other detection advice. For example the present disclosure may be applied to information encoded within magnetic strips audio signals RFID signals and other real world hardlinks. 

The foregoing description of the disclosure along with its associated embodiments has been presented for purposes of illustration only. It is not exhaustive and does not limit the disclosure to the precise form disclosed. Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing description that modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practicing the disclosure. For example the steps described need not be performed in the same sequence discussed or with the same degree of separation. Likewise various steps may be omitted repeated or combined as necessary to achieve the same or similar objectives.
