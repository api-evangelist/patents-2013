The present invention is directed to automated apparatuses and methods for measuring in connection with one or a plurality of pre drilled or other fastener or other holes that are present in a workpiece fastener hole depth fastener length countersink depth workpiece thickness and or hole diameters in an automated and very rapid efficient and accurate manner. Because fastener hole depths and object thickness each correspond with fastener lengths such apparatuses and methods enable a user to easily and rapidly identify and select a fastener having a correct length for a particular hole. The apparatuses may be operably connected with one or a plurality of computers or other data collection devices to provide them with hole depth countersink depth hole diameter measurement data and or data and or information each time that a hole is measured. Such data and or information may be recorded stored organized manipulated and or otherwise used by the computers or other devices in any manner desired or required by an operator.

The invention is also directed to a method for measuring pre drilled and other fastener hole depths countersink depths and or hole diameters and to identifying and selecting corresponding fasteners having correct lengths for such holes.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the present invention may be employed for example in conjunction or connection with computerized optical systems for the projection of three dimensional text images and or symbols in a substantially or fully undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of surfaces of a variety of different three dimensional objects or parts thereof regardless of their shape of size.

The invention is also directed to measurement apparatuses of the invention that are used in combination with computerized optical manufacturing guidance systems. Such systems can provide ordered step by step manufacturing instructions which instruct manufacturing personnel assembly technicians and other system users how to manufacture measure and or assemble any three dimensional objects or systems which may be extremely complex such as an aircraft or a part thereof a wing a vertical stabilizer or the like in a very efficient rapid and accurate manner particularly in comparison with a manual manufacture or assembly of the same three dimensional objects or parts which uses blueprints plans instruction manuals other paper based products and or computer screens for teaching an assembly of the objects and with laser based assembly systems. The manufacturing or assembly instructions or other optical projections are in the form of calibrated three dimensional text symbols and or images and are projected by one or a plurality of optical projector that are operably connected with one or a plurality of computers onto the three dimensional objects or systems or components thereof. Uniquely and very advantageously the three dimensional text images and or symbols such as manufacturing instructions have an ability to wrap around the three dimensional objects or systems or parts and to appear thereon in a manner that is not distorted by the three dimensional nature of the text images and or symbols or of the objects or parts being manufactured and or by other potential distortions such as curves or contours. The invention also provides methods for projecting three dimensional text images and or symbols in a substantially or fully undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of surfaces of a variety of different three dimensional objects and methods for providing an ordered step by step assembly of three dimensional objects or parts thereof which may be relatively or extremely complex and which may be used for example on an assembly line or in another manufacturing environment or in some other environment .

In an assembly manufacture or other production process of a complex three dimensional object such as a workpiece for example on an assembly line or in a production facility assembly workers manufacturing technicians or others must typically assembly the object using a series of ordered step by step assembly or manufacturing guidance work instructions that teach instruct or guide them as to how the object should be assembled manufactured or produced. Such instructions may be provided to them via a set of blue prints including both illustrations and text often thousands of pages in length laser projection technology optically assembly projection technology and or the like. For example a set of assembly instructions may direct that the following steps be performed by an assembly operator in the particular order listed i remove a panel from an object ii remove a clamp from the object iii measure a depth diameter and or countersink depth of each of a series of pre drilled fastener holes potentially hundreds or thousands of them iv insert a series of different sized and types of fasteners into the pre drilled fastener holes in a manner that the characteristics of the particular fasteners selected length diameter and or the like accurately correspond with the particular measurements made of the corresponding holes into which they are to be installed v remove a bolt from the object before sliding an engine in vi sliding an engine in vii putting the clamp back onto the object and viii put the panel back on the object.

Structural fasteners that may be used in an assembly manufacture or production of three dimensional workpieces objects and parts thereof come in greatly varying lengths and widths to accommodate any thickness of the three dimensional workpieces objects and parts thereof and or fastener hole lengths diameters and counterskings present therein such as complex and other structures for example the skins of aircrafts submarines automobiles military vehicles missiles and the like which must generally be very securely attached to some type of a substructure of the workpiece object or part. The thickness of a workpiece structure substructure part or skin and or the diameters and countersink depths of fastener holes present therein may vary widely. It is thus generally very important to measure the length diameter and countersink depth of each of potentially hundreds thousands or even tens of thousands of pre drilled or other fastener holes that may be drilled or otherwise present therein and into which some type of a fastener is to be passed or extended and installed and to identify and record each particular fastener hole being measured which permits corresponding fasteners having the correct length diameter and countersink depth to be identified selected employed and installed therein. Such a process is often critical because the structural integrity of an object or part that is being assembled produced or otherwise manufactured such as a commercial or military airplane boat or submarine may be compromised i.e. weakened or destroyed if fasteners having an incorrect length width and or countersink depth are employed to attach various parts thereof together which in turn could very disadvantageously lead to a massive loss of human lives and or substantial amounts of money resulting from objects that function in a sub standard manner or that must have fasteners haring an incorrect length width and or countersink depth removed and replaced with correct fasteners i.e. those having a correct length width and countersink depth which is extremely labor intensive and lime consuming. The latter may additionally and very disadvantageously result in damage to the workpiece or other object potentially resulting in a large financial loss. Fastener length may also be critical in minimizing weight on certain types of assemblies. Various types of manual and automated measurement devices are thus available for measuring the lengths widths and countersink depths of pre drilled and other holes in which fasteners are to be extended and installed.

Grip gages for example are one such type of measurement devices and permit users to determine proper bolt and or fastener lengths for corresponding pre drilled or other holes present in a workpiece of other object or part thereof manually or in an automated manner. A corresponding dual use scale can measure depth of holes in 1 16 increments to 2 and grip length of fasteners in 1 16 increments to 2 . These gages generally include a probe that has a configuration of a fish hook which can be hooked on the back side of a fastener hole. The length of the fastener hole is typically indicated by a number provided by a linear scale that is present inside the grip gun. Manual grip gages are typically far less rapid efficient and accurate than some automated grip gages and often greatly extend assembly or manufacturing times in comparison with automated grip gages. Moreover known automated grip gages very disadvantageously generally require a use of three hands to operate i.e. hands of two different operators rendering them extremely labor intensive time consuming awkward and difficult to use since each operator only has two hands and thus expensive to use in terms of labor costs . Further they are typically extremely slow and inefficient generally performing steps of normalization measurement data recordation and the like in a series of separate steps that are not concurrent but are consecutive rendering such devices extremely inefficient labor intensive time consuming and as a result expensive to operate.

Further current projection systems for manufacturing three dimensional objects utilize laser projectors to project points or text onto a surface. The laser projectors emit highly amplified and coherent electromagnetic radiation of one or more specific frequencies in a form of an intense beam of nearly monochromatic visible or infrared light through a process of stimulated emission. The radiation emitted by the laser consists of a coherent beam of photons all in phase and having the same polarization and at any given time a user will always see a moving dot. Very disadvantageously laser systems and their replacement parts are extremely expensive often prohibitively and thus are not widely used in manufacturing processes and assembly lines.

Further laser systems very disadvantageously are not capable of projecting images or symbols such as graphics pictures illustrations or drawings onto a surface and cannot display large amounts of text or other drawn objects without severe flickering blinking and or other significant distortions all of which generally are at the least annoying and cause eye strain to the user. Further when large amounts of text are projected by laser projectors this causes the laser projectors to operate extremely slowly. In contrast with optical projections laser projections work in the same manner in which one writes with a pen. The laser projections actually write out each letter of a word like one would using a pen. The laser itself is physically moving or has an internal mirror that moves. Consequently the more text that is to be displayed by a laser projector the longer it takes for the laser projector to make one complete projection. For example if a user of a laser projector projects only the letter A onto a surface the time between projection cycles would be very short. However the time between re paints i.e. re projecting the information becomes significantly longer and the laser projection very disadvantageously begins to flash similar to how fluorescent lights start to flicker as they get older or are cold. The foregoing problems render laser projectors very difficult and time consuming to use in an assembly guidance system in addition to being extremely costly .

Optical systems that can project three dimensional text images and or symbols onto one or a plurality of surfaces of a variety of different three dimensional objects or parts thereof in an undistorted manner currently do not exist. Laser systems are not capable of making such projections.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 216 585 describes a depth gage for indicating the depth of a hole through a workpiece which is to be attached to a nut plate by a threaded fastener which comprises a rod with a cylindrical portion adapted to pass through the hole and abut the nut plate so that a forward section of the rod enters within the threads of the nut plate. The 585 patent states that a sleeve slidable on the rod in front of the workpiece can be slid to abut the front surface of the workpiece and that graduated markings on the rod indicate the depth of the hole.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 111 406 describes a fixture that is prepared with fixture holes arranged in a pattern that corresponds with the locations of fiducial pads that are located on a multilayer board. The fixture has tooling pins that engage with tooling holes in the panel to hold the panel in an absolute position relative to the fixture. An x ray inspection system views a superimposed image of a selected fixture hole and a corresponding fiducial pad that is visible within the boundary of the fixture hole. A software routine is then used to compute the offset between the fixture hole and the fiducial pad. The process is then repeated for the remaining sample of fixture holes and fiducial pads. The results are then fitted and sent to a drilling machine to determine a position for the drilled holes in the panel that compensates for the registration of the solder pads.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 195 451 describes a projection of an image of a stitch pattern onto a workpiece. A projector is stated to project a full sized image of the stitch pattern on the basis of image data read from RAM on a workpiece held by an embroidery frame.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 757 950 describes a process for cutting or stamping individual parts from an animal skin in which the contours of the individual parts are stored in a computer and can be assembled to form a cutting pattern. For optimizing the cutting the cutting pattern is established individually as a function of the quality of the skin and is projected by a projection device onto the skin.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 192 777 describes an apparatus and method for cutting pieces of material from a workpiece such as a web of patterned fabric which includes irregularities or which is misaligned with respect to a coordinate system of the cutting apparatus. The workpiece is spread on a cutting table where it is cut by a numerically controlled cutter in accord with an electronic marker stored in the cutter controller. The marker is matched to the workpiece and appropriate adjustments are made to the marker before the workpiece is cut. A laser operatively connected to the controller projects a match target onto the workpiece at a point corresponding to a selected point on the marker. The marker is then adjusted such that the selected point coincides with a desired location on the workpiece. Adjustment is achieved by electronically displacing the match target from a non preferred location to a preferred one. Software in a controller translates this displacement into appropriate adjustments to the marker.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 205 370 describes a production of a nest of cuts for cutting blanks out of flat irregular workpieces wherein the contour and the flaws of the spread workpieces together with a workpiece characteristic are detected by means of a digitizing unit and the corresponding data are read into a computer which on the basis of these data and the data stored in the computer concerning number shape and quality requirements of the blanks calculates and stores a nest of cuts and utilizes the detected workpiece characteristics of the workpieces as a workpiece code for allocating the nests of cuts to the respective workpieces.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 304 680 describes a method and system for monitoring a process which determines a location of a product in three dimensional space with respect to a process monitoring system.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 314 311 describes a registration system for use in connection with an image guided surgery system. It includes a medical diagnostic imaging apparatus for collecting image data from a subject. An image data processor is stated to reconstruct an image representation of the subject from the image data. An image projector depicts the image representation on the subject.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 600 476 describes a video aid to an assembly system and methods of using the system for providing production personnel access to manufacturing drawing information with minimum user intervention. The system scrolls manufacturing drawings automatically as a monitor is moved relative to a workpiece so that the manufacturing drawing corresponds with the identical location on the workpiece. The system is stated to eliminate the need to store retrieve and maintain individual hardcopy drawings.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 731 991 describes a method and system of projecting light on a planar surface to produce an image for tracing. The system includes a projector that has a light source and a signal conditioner that is operably connected to the projector. A computer is operably connected to the signal conditioner and a scanner is connected to the projector. A test pattern from the computer is projected from the projector through the scanners to visually align an image to a sector on a work surface. A grid is operably aligned with the work surface and a geometric pattern from the computer is then projected by the projector on the planar work surface for tracing. The method comprises the steps of creating a pattern tracing lines along the pattern on the planar work surface cutting the pattern along the traced lines discarding pieces of the planar surface outside the pattern and placing edging along an outer edge of the pattern.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 813 035 describes a formation of a two dimensional color pattern consisting of colored pattern elements that is stated to enable a particularly compact and fault proof color pattern for a coding. The 035 patent states that three dimensional data of an object point can be calculated by subsequent triangulation at a known position of a projector and a camera. Also described is a method for determining three dimensional surface coordinates comprising an illumination of an object with a color pattern of known structure by a projector and recording an object image by a camera.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 016 052 describes a quick simple and accurate manner in which to measure the dimensions or characteristics of a hole without contacting the hole. The 052 patent states that the apparatus and method described therein also automatically detect different materials defining the hole and therefore the location of the interface where the materials meet. To measure the characteristics of the hole the 052 patent states that the apparatus and method measure the intensities of light reflected off of the hole wall and that the light directed toward the hole wall by the optical fiber may be of the type such as collimated or focused to provide distinct reflections that are received and measured by the optical receiver to supply accurate measurements of the hole characteristics.

U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010 0236087 describes an apparatus comprising a housing a clamping unit associated with the housing a biasing system and a length indicator. This publication states that the clamping unit can be inserted through a hole in a structure into an interior of a nut that is positioned relative to a first surface of the structure and that the clamping unit can engage the interior of the nut when a portion of the housing is positioned relative to a second surface of the structure. The first structure is stated to be substantially parallel to the second surface. The biasing system is stated to be capable of biasing the portion of the housing positioned relative to the second surface of the structure and the clamping unit towards each other while the clamping unit is engaged with the interior of the nut.

None of the above references or others that are described herein teach or suggest the novel automated very accurate and extremely rapid fastener hole measurement apparatuses or methods or the computerized optical systems or methods of the present invention.

There is a need in the assembly manufacturing production and other industries world wide for automated measuring apparatuses that perform very rapid efficient and accurate measurements of the lengths of pre drilled and other fastener holes and of required or desired corresponding fasteners of a correct length for such holes hole countersink depths and or hole diameters which may be operably connected with one or more computers or other data collection devices in a manner that data resulting from one or all of such measurements may be readily and rapidly transmitted or otherwise transferred to one or a plurality of computers and or other data collection devices for recordation or other use each time that a hole is measured.

Further there is a long felt but unsolved need worldwide in the manufacturing and production industries for efficient rapid and accurate guidance systems that have an ability to significantly reduce the amount of time labor manufacturing errors and paper products blueprints plans instruction manuals and or the like that are typically required to manually assemble or otherwise manufacture complicated three dimensional objects such as aircrafts submarines and automobiles and that can be used on assembly lines and or in other manufacturing and production environments.

The present invention provides automated measuring apparatuses in both a wired and a wireless form that perform extremely rapid efficient and accurate measurements typically of the exact depths countersink depths and diameters of each of a series of pre drilled and other fastener holes that are present in a workpiece or other three dimensional object or part thereof which correspond accurately with corresponding fasteners having particular lengths hole countersink depths and or diameters in a continuous manner. These measuring apparatuses may also extremely rapidly and accurately measure skin and workpiece thicknesses grip lengths and other measurements. The measuring apparatuses may be operably connected with one or more computers and or other data collection devices in a manner that hole depth countersink depth and or hole diameter data may be readily and extremely rapidly transferred from the apparatuses to one or a plurality of the computers and or other data collection devices each time that a hole measurement is made by the apparatus where the data may be recorded stored manipulated used to identify a corresponding fastener having particular measurements for a particular sized hole and or the like with potentially thousands of such measurements being made in connection with potentially thousands of holes that may be present in a single workpiece object or part and with the measuring apparatuses typically continuously making measurements . The apparatuses of the invention enable an effective and correct determination and identification by a user of the correct or otherwise suitable fastener length and or type for each particular fastener hole of a three dimensional or other object or part that is being assembled manufactured or otherwise processed potentially out of thousands of different types and or lengths of fasteners such as pre drilled holes that are present in a skin of an aircraft that is to be securely attached to an aircraft substructure. Very advantageously the measuring apparatuses and related methods of the invention may be employed alone or in connection with computerized optical assembly systems and methods as well as with any other type of projection system such as a laser projection system and other assembly production and manufacturing devices systems and methods such as non guided applications to measure hole depths hole diameters object thickness required fastener length and or the like.

The automated measuring apparatuses of the present invention are a great improvement in the art in comparison with other apparatuses for performing measurements of the depths of pre drilled and other holes hole countersink depths and hole diameters. Extremely advantageously using only one hand and by only squeezing a trigger or similar device one time and in one single action an operator of an apparatus of the invention has an ability to successfully very accurately and extremely rapidly instantaneously or almost instantaneously perform all three of the following functions simultaneously or almost simultaneously 

The measurement apparatuses of the invention may be operably connected with one or a plurality of computers data collection devices and or similar devices using for example one or a plurality of serial ports. USB cables Ethernet cables wireless transmission or the like in order to communicate measured data and or information back to one or a plurality of host or other computers data collection devices or similar devices or to otherwise supply data and or other information to the computers and or receive data and or other information from the computers .

In one embodiment the measuring apparatuses and methods of the present invention may be employed in connection with computerized optical manufacturing and guidance systems and related methods for the optical projection of three dimensional text images and or symbols in a substantially or completely undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of surfaces of a variety of different three dimensional objects or parts thereof. These systems and methods may be employed in any field industry application location and or environment in which it is necessary or desirable to project three dimensional text images and or symbols in a substantially or fully undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of three dimensional objects or parts including but not limited to the manufacturing building construction automotive aviation maritime military medical veterinary entertainment advertising publishing and or textile industries. Such computerized optical manufacturing guidance systems and methods enable assembly technicians and other manufacturing personnel to very efficiently rapidly and accurately assemble any three dimensional objects without the use of lasers or laser technology generally in a step by step order of a work process whether having flat curved contoured and or complex curved surfaces including those objects that are relatively or very complex such as aircrafts submarines missiles military vehicles and automobiles and objects that are not complex such as cables in a manner that tremendously reduces the amount of time labor paper products and or computer screens that would otherwise typically be required to assemble or otherwise manufacture such objects manually or using a laser system and that significantly reduces or completely eliminates assembly errors both of which result in tremendous cost savings in time labor blueprints plans instruction manuals and or the like . The resulting cost savings which typically increase as the complexity of the particular object or part being assembled increases can be millions of dollars for each object being assembled such as an aircraft. Such cost savings are multiplied accordingly when more than one of the same object is being assembled. For example if a cost savings of two million dollars is achieved in an assembly of one submarine a cost savings of four million dollars will generally be achieved in an assembly of two such submarines a cost savings of six million dollars will generally be achieved in an assembly of three such submarines a cost savings of eight million dollars will generally be achieved in an assembly of four such submarines and so forth.

The above manufacturing guidance systems and methods use optical projectors to optically project calibrated three dimensional assembly or work instructions in the form of text images and or symbols in one or a variety of different colors and or patterns onto three dimensional objects or parts that are being constructed such as an aircraft or a part thereof such as a vertical stabilizer or a component thereof such as a skin of a vertical stabilizer in a substantially or fully undistorted manner even when the objects or parts include curved contoured and or complex curved surfaces such as curved surfaces having bumps or other raised areas thereon rather than flat surfaces and even when the optical projectors are not positioned and or located in a manner that is perpendicular to or straight in front of the object being assembled. The three dimensional text images and or symbols are projected onto the three dimensional objects or parts when they are needed by manufacturing technicians or other system users where they are needed on the object or part and in the manner that they are needed i.e. at any time at any place on the surface of the object or part and in any manner . These systems and methods are pioneering and are such an advance over the current state of the art that they may revolutionize the manner in which complicated three dimensional objects are assembled or otherwise manufactured worldwide.

Three dimensional optical projection is a brand new technology that can display three dimensional images of objects as well as text and symbols onto the surfaces of three dimensional objects or parts thereof without distortion. When employed in the manufacturing industry by sequencing in order preferably the best order a series or set of complicated assembly instructions or steps i.e. in the order of a work process very complex assemblies or other manufactures for example of aircrafts jets helicopters missiles submarines ships boats tanks automobiles and a wide variety of other objects or systems or parts thereof can be assembled with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Such technology is expected to cause a significant improvement for manufacturing in industrialized countries. By implementing three dimensional optical projection technology on their assembly lines and in other production environments businesses in countries with high cost labor can provide a new tool to their workforces that will allow the output from one individual to be enhanced considerably. Further third world countries are improving their workforces so that they are taking on ever increasing complex manufacturing tasks. Three dimensional optical projection technology is expected to enhance the productivity of workers in industrialized countries to such a large extent that third world countries current competitive advantage inexpensive or less expensive labor will be greatly mitigated with the benefit to the industrialized countries of having production performed in those countries rather than in foreign third world countries.

The Annotated Geometry file contains the 3D data that describes everything that gets projected onto the surface of a three dimensional object or part. While an image file for example a picture of a mountain is not stored inside the Annotated Geometry a reference to it is stored inside the Annotated Geometry. Thus the foregoing is all considered to be data because it is all a part of the data set. The Annotated Geometry contains the data that will be projected onto the one or a plurality of object or parts being projected upon by one or more optical projectors. The data is altered transformed prior to projection using the information from a calibration procedure as is described in. The altering of this data is performed so that the text images and or symbols or a combination thereof that will projected by the optical projectors is distorted in such a way as to look correct to the person viewing it once it is on the three dimensional object or part on which it is being projected upon regardless of where the optical projectors are placed located and or positioned in a manufacturing or other environment in relation to the three dimensional object or part being projected upon .

The phrase application as is used herein means software other than the operating system such as Word processors database managers Web browsers and the like.

To counter such so called zero day threats heuristics can be used. One type of heuristic approach generic signatures can identify new viruses or variants of existing viruses for looking for known malicious code or slight variations of such code in files. Some antivirus software can also predict what a file will do if opened and or run by emulating it in a sandbox and analyzing what it does to see if it performs any malicious actions. If it does this could mean the file is malicious.

The phrases Application Program Interface and API as is used herein means a set of commands functions and or protocols which programmers can use when building software for a specific operating system. The API allows programmers to use predefined functions to interact with an operating system instead of writing them from scratch. All computer operating systems such as Windows Unix and the Mac OS usually provide an application program interface for programmers.

The phrases assembly jig and tooling as are used herein mean the structure s that hold and or support an object or part thereof being assemble or manufactured or worked on usually in a repeatable and secure position so that a finished product is consistent with other such projects.

The terms automated and automatic as are used herein mean to control or operate using automation i.e. operating with minimal or no human intervention or manual labor and or being independent of external control . For example a measurement of a pre drilled hole in an object may be made fully manually using 100 manual labor in a fully automated manner using 0 manual labor or in a partially automated manner using more than 0 but less than 100 manual labor and automation . When this measurement is made in an automated manner some part of the manual process has been replaced by electronic means. This results in a labor cost savings by reducing the length of time the measurement process takes. So even if when a process is not fully automated requires no manual labor automation can reduce manufacturing costs by reducing labor costs even if not reduced to zero . For an automation project typically a reduction to about 50 of manual labor is involved and preferably less than about 20 of manual labor is involved and still more preferably less than about 10 of manual labor is involved and even more preferably less than about 5 of manual labor is involved and most preferably 0 manual labor is involved.

The phrase Base Geometry file as is used herein means a data file that contains a three dimensional 3D representation of a three dimensional object or part that is being projecting on by an optical projector. For example if a user wanted to place fasteners into a skin for an airplane door the Base Geometry file would be the 3D representation of this door.

The terms bolt and screw as are used herein refer to a type of a fastener that is usually characterized by a helical ridge known as an external thread or thread that is typically wrapped around a cylinder and often may operably engage or be connected with a nut plate and may also have a shank having a smooth section which typically should not engage with a nut plate. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread known as an internal thread often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects. Often screws have a head which is a specially formed section on one end of the screw that allows it to be turned or driven using a tool such as a screwdriver or wrench manual or electrical . The head is often larger than the body of the screw which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions for instance carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven set screws have a head that is smaller than the outer diameter of the screw and J bolts do not have a head and are not designed to be driven. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the shank and it may be partially greater than 0 but less than 100 or fully 100 threaded. The majority of screws are tightened by a clockwise rotation which is termed a right hand thread. Screws with left hand threads are typically used less often but may used for example when the screw will be subject to anticlockwise forces which would work to undo a right hand thread .

Since software is virtual and does not take up any physical space it is generally easier and often less expensive to upgrade than computer hardware. Computer software is often continuously upgraded and improved. CD ROMs DVDs and other types of media can be used to distribute software. When one purchases a software program it usually comes on a disc which is a physical means for storing the software. Many software programs require that one first install them on a computer before using them. For example if one purchases Microsoft Office it needs to be installed on a computer before one can run any of the included programs such as Word or Excel. The software can be installed from a CD or DVD an external hard drive or from a networked computer. A software program or software update can also often be installed using a file that is downloaded from the Internet. Installing a software program generally writes the necessary data for running a program on a computer s hard drive. Often the installer program will decompress the data that is included with the installer immediately before writing the information to a hard drive. Software updates which are often downloaded from the internet generally work the same way. When an update is run the installer file generally decompresses the data and then updates the correct program or operating system. Installing software usually involves double clicking an installer icon and then clicking I Agree when the license agreement pops up. A computer operator may have to choose what directory on a hard disk that the software should be installed in but often the installer will even choose that for the computer operator. Some software can be installed by simply dragging a folder or application program onto a hard drive.

The term coordinate system as is used herein means schemes for locating points in a given space by means of numerical quantities specified with respect to some frame of reference. These quantities are the coordinates of a point. To each set of coordinates there corresponds just one point in any coordinate system but there are useful coordinate systems in which to a given point there may correspond more than one set of coordinates. A coordinate system is a mathematical language that is used to describe geometrical objects analytically that is if the coordinates of a set of points are known their relationships and the properties of figures determined by them can be obtained by numerical calculations instead of by other descriptions. It is the province of analytic geometry aided chiefly by calculus to investigate the means for these calculations. The most familiar spaces are the plane and the three dimensional Euclidean space. In the latter a point P is determined by three coordinates x y z . The totality of points for which x has a fixed value constitutes a surface. The same is true for y and z so that through P them are three coordinate surfaces. The totality of points for which x and y are fixed is a curve and through each point there are three coordinate lines. If these lines are all straight the system of coordinates is said to be rectilinear. If some or all of the coordinate lines are not straight the system is curvilinear. If the angles between the coordinate lines at each point are right angles the system is rectangular. A Cartesian coordinate system is constructed by choosing a point O designated as the origin. Through it three intersecting directed lines OX OY OZ the coordinate axes are constructed. The coordinates of a point P are x the distance of P from the plane YOZ measured parallel to OX and y and z which are determined similarly. Usually the three axes are taken to be mutually perpendicular in which case the system is a rectangular Cartesian one. A similar construction can be made in the plane in which case a point has two coordinates x y . A polar coordinate system is constructed in the plane by choosing a point O called the pole and through it a directed straight line the initial line. A point P is located by specifying the directed distance OP and the angle through which the initial line must be turned to coincide with OP in position and direction. The coordinates of P are r . The radius vector r is the directed line OP and the vectorial angle is the angle through which the initial line was turned if turned counterclockwise if clockwise. Spherical coordinates are constructed in three dimensional Euclidean space by choosing a plane and in it constructing a polar coordinate system. At the pole O a polar axis OZ is constructed at right angles to the chosen plane. A point P not on OZ and OZ determine a plane. The spherical coordinates of P are then the directed distance OP denoted by p the angle through which the initial line is turned to lie in ZOP and the angle ZOP. Cylindrical coordinates are constructed by choosing a plane with a pole O an initial line in it and a polar axis OZ as in spherical coordinates. A point P is projected onto the chosen plane. The cylindrical coordinates of P are r z where r and are the polar coordinates of Q and z QP . By means of a system of equations the description of a geometrical object in one coordinate system may be translated into an equivalent description in another coordinate system.

Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by another computer. The term computer virus may also mean all types of malware computer viruses worms trojan horses most rootkits spyware dishonest adware crimeware and other malicious and unwanted software including true viruses . A worm can exploit security vulnerabilities to spread itself to other computers without needing to be transferred as part of a host and a Trojan horse is a program that appears harmless but has a hidden agenda. Worms and Trojans like viruses may cause harm to either a computer system s hosted data functional performance and or networking throughput when they are executed. Some viruses and other malware have symptoms noticeable to the computer user but many are surreptitious. Additional information regarding computer viruses is present in Deborah Russell et al. O Reilly ISBN 0937175714 .

The term wave as is used herein means a disturbance that propagates through space and time usually with transference of energy. Waves travel and transfer energy from one point to another often with no permanent displacement of the particles of the medium that is with little or no associated mass transport they consist instead of oscillations or vibrations around almost fixed locations.

The term wavelength as is used herein in connection with a sinusoidal wave sin means is the spatial period of the wave the distance over which the wave s shape repeats . It is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase such as crests troughs or zero crossings and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves as well as other spatial wave patterns. Assuming a sinusoidal wave moving at a fixed wave speed wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.

The present invention is directed to pioneering and very advantageous computerized optical systems for the projection of three dimensional text images and or symbols in a substantially or fully undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of surfaces of a variety of different three dimensional objects or parts thereof.

In one embodiment out of many the present invention provides unique very rapid efficient substantially or fully error free and successful systems and methods for assembling or otherwise manufacturing any type of a three dimensional object or part thereof including those that are relatively or very complex such as an aircraft a submarine a helicopter a missile a tank a military vehicle an automobile or the like.

In this embodiment the systems of the invention significantly facilitate an assembly or other manufacture process for example on an assembly line or in a production facility by providing ordered step by step assembly or manufacturing guidance work instructions that teach or guide one or a plurality of person or entities that are to assemble or manufacture any three dimensional object or system or component part surface or skin thereof hereinafter collectively referred to as object which may be relatively or very complex the manner in which object may properly be assembled or manufactured step by step with a series of ordered steps generally in the best manner. For example a set of assembly instructions may direct that the following steps be performed in the order listed i remove a panel from an object ii remove a clamp from the object iii measure a depth of a series of pre drilled holes iv insert a series of different sized and types of fasteners into the pre drilled holes v remove a bolt from the object before sliding an engine in vi sliding an engine in vii putting the clamp back onto the object and viii put the panel back on the object.

Using the systems and methods of the invention to optically project any text images and or symbols onto any three dimensional objects parts or skins or even onto people animals or locations three dimensional geometric data can be created in or imported into one or a plurality of computers using a software program such as Catia SolidWorks Word or the source code provided herein or the like. A drawing can then be created on the computer s in a wide variety of different colors patterns shapes and or the like such as lines squares triangles rectangles circles ovals polygons trapezoids and the like . The systems will accept as input the output files from most three dimensional CAD or other programs. The drawing can then be incorporated into the imported three dimensional geometric data and the resulting product text images symbols and or the like for example that provide process instructions such as assembly or manufacturing instructions can then be optically projected onto any three dimensional object to be assembled or manufactured or otherwise using three dimensional optical projection. Such process instructions can be fully implemented on a computer or other screen before the images are ever projected onto the three dimensional object. Process steps text other text images of object component parts or of the object itself symbols and or the like are optically projected by one or a plurality of optical projectors as three dimensional text images and or symbols that are displayed directly onto the three dimensional object or part of skin for example in an assembly process at a location at which an attachment of two or more component parts is to be made by bolting fastening gluing and or the like . The projected material has an ability to wrap around the three dimensional object part or skin for example that is being assembled manufactured or otherwise processed permitting one or a plurality of assembly workers manufacturing technicians and or other system users to assemble or manufacture the object part or skin or to carry out some other desired process and have control over such processes. Very advantageously text images and or symbols to be displayed on the three dimensional object part or skin may be very rapidly calibrated in a manner that they can be projected in a substantially and usually fully undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of surfaces of the three dimensional object part or skin which may be curved contoured complex curved complex and or flat even when the optical projector s employed in the systems are not perpendicular to or straight in front of and or centered in connection with the objects parts or skins as is discussed in detail hereinbelow . The three dimensional text images and or symbols may be for example three dimensional images of the object that is being assembled written assembly manufacturing and or other process steps or instructions symbols and or the like. For example written instructions that instruct individuals that are assembling the object such as a description of which of thousands of pre drilled holes present in a skin of the object that specified fasteners fit within and may be used with may be projected directly onto the object.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention a first computer program called an Authoring Assembly Software Tool which may be run on the computer s operating system such as Windows XP allows a user to put all of the required or desired components for a particular project into a computer with a wide variety of annotation pictures video symbols drawings audio and or the like without concern for the number of optical projectors and or computers that are being employed and or their location within a particular assembly manufacturing work or other area or environment. A second computer program called a Configurator Assembly Software Tool which may also be run on the computer s operating system allows a user to decide where within a particular assembly manufacturing or other work area or environment the optical projectors being employed can be located the number of optical projectors that are required for a particular assembly manufacture process or situation to have a good preferably 100 coverage of an object part or skin or a portion thereof that is being projected upon the number of workers that may be required or desired for executing one or more concurrent processes for example four different assembly technicians working simultaneously on the same aircraft wing and or other such information. This tool creates a file that can be run by an assembly manufacturing or other technician each time that a particular assembly manufacture or other process is being built or carried out. A third computer program called an Operator Assembly Software Tool which may also be run on the computer s operating system guides a user through a process such as an assembly of a three dimensional object or part or skin step by step in an ordered manner using the file created by the Configurator Assembly Software Tool along with a wide variety of optional programming aids such as annotation pictures video symbols drawings and or audio to aid the workers throughout the assembly manufacturing or other process. For example a video tutorial may be projected by one or more optical projectors directly onto a three dimensional object that is being worked on or with such as on the surfaces of a vertical stabilizer that is being manufactured.

The systems of the invention use one or more optical projectors that are operably connected with one or a plurality of computers to project text images symbols and or the like in a calibrated form in a manner that they appear substantially undistorted and typically fully undistorted when projected by the optical projectors onto a non flat and or non perpendicular three dimensional surface generally regardless of where the optical projectors are positioned in relation to the three dimensional surface. A dataset for the optical projectors that is created and or provided by a user becomes calibrated by software that is present on the computer and the resulting calibrated dataset becomes projected onto the 3 dimensional projection surface in a manner that projected text and images appear on the surface in a manner that generally is undistorted. The position of the optical projector in space relative to a coordinate system can be determined while simultaneously calibrating the projector optics. This allows a user to project three dimensional geometry such as from a CAD system CATIA SolidWorks or the like directly onto complex three dimensional surfaces which can be of virtually any shape and or size. The optical projection system automatically compensates and wraps the projected material onto the surface s of the three dimensional object or part of skin preserving its true shape. Text images symbols and or the like and or any other projected matter wrap around curved contoured complex slanted and or otherwise non flat surfaces in an undistorted manner and appear in the same manner that the would if they had been projected directly onto a flat surface.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the present invention permit assembly workers manufacturing technicians and other users to determine and or catalog the lengths diameters countersink depths and or other measurements of various fasteners that are desired or required as a result of their length diameter or other measurement or characteristic to be inserted into or partially or fully through particular corresponding pre drilled fastener or other holes as is shown in in an assembly or subassembly that is being manufactured using a measurement device such as an electronic grip gage or similar device that is operably connected with one or a plurality of computers or other data collection devices being employed in the systems. The measurement apparatuses and methods have an ability to utilize data and or information that they collect upon an insertion into a fastener or other hole can be used to coordinate data collection sequences so that large data sets can be collected in one sequence with measurement values that correlate to specific positions on a three dimensional object part or skin that is being assembled manufactured or otherwise worked with. This data is used at a subsequent time to project proper assembly manufacturing or other instructions based on measured data.

The methods of the invention provide guidance in connection with an optical projection of three dimensional text images symbols and or the like in a substantially or fully undistorted manner onto three dimensional objects parts skins or systems. In one embodiment they also provide assembly and or other manufacturing guidance and instructions for an assembly or other manufacture of three dimensional objects parts skins and or systems.

Three dimensional workpieces and other objects or parts thereof that may be assembled using the measurement apparatuses and methods of the invention include but are not limited to cables aircrafts commercial military jets props helicopters or the like submarines ships missiles tanks boats heavy machinery earth moving equipment automobiles trucks buses trains trailers campers military and other vehicles or the like or a part or skin thereof such as a wing of an airplane a tail of an airplane an electrical panel a control panel a cableway and or the like.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the invention are extremely useful among other things for an assembly or other manufacture of workpieces objects parts or skins that are complex in other words those that take a significant amount of time and or labor to assemble or otherwise manufacture as one example two weeks while one technician is working on such assembly in a full time manner that are difficult to assemble or otherwise manufacture and or that would normally have numerous pages of associated blueprints plans other assembly or manufacturing instructions and or drawings sometimes many hundreds thousands or hundreds of thousands of pages .

The present invention is directed to very advantageous automated wired and wireless apparatuses permitting or enabling an operator to extremely rapidly efficiently accurately and continuously i.e. without an interruption or a substantial interruption measure the depths diameters countersink depths and or other measurements in connection with one or a plurality of pre drilled and or other fastener holes that may be present in three dimensional for other workpieces objects and or parts thereof such as the skins and or substructures of aircrafts. Such items may be in a process of being assembled manufactured or otherwise processed may be riveted or otherwise attached to one or a plurality of nut plates and may include hundreds thousands or even hundreds of thousands of fastener holes possibly having different depths diameters countersink depths and or other measurement which need to be rapidly and accurately measured so that corresponding fasteners for each such hole having a correct length diameter countersink depth and or other measurement may be readily and properly identified and selected for use which such holes. The apparatuses which may have a pistol grip barrel or other required or desired body style or design for a particular application or assembly and which enable an operator to make retraction triggered plunge triggered and or other styles of measurements also perform countersink depth hole diameter and or other measurements in this manner. The fastener hole depth measurements enable an operator to select suitable fasteners for the measured holes i.e. fasteners that would be of the correct type and or length for the particular holes measured which is very advantageous because many objects and parts that are being assembled or manufactured have areas that vary in thickness. Pre drilled fastener holes present in such areas would likely have different depths and require fasteners of different lengths and or types. Further because the apparatuses of the invention can operate to measures material or object thickness they can be employed in the same manner to measure fastener length. Fastener length is determined by measuring the material or object thickness.

Measurement apparatuses within the present invention include but are not limited to the following different types of measurement apparatuses which make take or perform different types of measurements and or perform one or a plurality of measurements in different manners 

The measurement apparatuses of the invention preferably are optionally but preferably operably connected with a power source and or one or a plurality of computers and or other data collection devices to rapidly and efficiently provide them via transmission and or other transfer with fastener hole length countersink depth and or hole diameters measurement data and or information preferably each time that a fastener hole is measured i.e. right away and before a subsequent fastener hole is measured . Each fastener hole that is measured has its measurement data and or information documented by the computer s and or other data collection devices as well as the particular fastener hole possibly out of hundreds of thousands of different fastener holes having varying depths and or diameters that has been measured. This provides a significantly more rapid efficient and accurate method for recording fastener hole depth countersink depth and or hole diameter measurement data and or information in comparison with a manual system in which an operator uses a writing instrument such as a pen to manually record for example in a notebook or logbook such data for each of the various holes and implements some manual system of keeping track of which types of measurements were taken which measurement corresponds with which hole possibly out of hundreds of thousands of holes and the like. Such a manual system often results in numerous human errors which are reduced or completely eliminated by the apparatuses of the present invention which are typically 100 accurate. Further such manual processes are significantly less efficient and significantly more time consuming in comparison with the apparatuses of the present invention. Using fastener hole depth measurement apparatuses of the invention fastener hole depths corresponding fastener lengths and structure thickness to identify a fastener length may be measured and recorded significantly more rapidly efficiently and accurately in comparison with manual methods for making the same measurements. The same is true with respect to countersink depth measurements and hole diameter measurements. Thus such apparatuses significantly facilitate an assembly or other manufacture process for example when employed on an assembly line or in a production facility for example for aircrafts or submarines by providing rapid and accurate fastener hole depth countersink depth and or hole diameter measurements.

Also very advantageously the measurement apparatuses of the invention operate to perform a plurality of tasks or functions with only one single squeeze of the trigger thereof by an operator or other user i.e. automatically and generally instantaneously once it is powered by a power source and using only one hand including 

The fastener hole depth measurement apparatuses of the invention can measure for example the depths of holes that light or a probe may pass through fully 100 as well as holes that light or a probe is not permitted to pass though more than 0 but less than 100 such as a hole that has one end partially or fully closed off with for example some type of an enclosure or bottom like a can that has one of its ends removed by a can opener . In the first case when the trigger of the apparatus is squeezed its probe typically extends or protrudes fully through the front and back ends of the hole with the hook of the probe resting on the back surface of an object including the hole that is adjacent with the back of the hole. When the probe contacts such surface the depth measurement is made by the apparatus. In the second case when the trigger of the apparatus is squeezed its probe typically extends into the hole as far as it is permitted by the enclosure which may vary widely and may be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. Once the end of the probe contacts the enclosure enclosing the bottom of the hole a depth measurement of the hole is taken by the apparatus. The countersink depth and hole diameter measurements may be performed in a similar manner.

The invention also provides a method for measuring the depths of pre drilled and other fastener hole lengths countersink depths and or hole diameters very rapidly and efficiently and in a manner that is substantially or fully 100 error free.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the invention can measure the depths diameters and or countersinks of fastener holes and grip or other lengths of fasteners of virtually any size. This includes a depth ranging from about 0.001 to about 2.00 inches or corresponding metric units and from Grip 1 to Grip 64 a diameter ranging from about 0.100 to about 1.000 inches or corresponding metric units and a countersink ranging from about 0.001 to about 2.000 inches in virtually any increments 0.0001 0.0005 0.001 0.002 0.005 and so forth and at virtually any angle to determine for example proper fastener lengths or other lengths . Grip length calculations may made by a host or other computer based on measurement data supplied by measurement apparatuses of the present invention or computed in the on board processor that is included on the circuit card. The conversion from the hole depth measurement to grip length may be by a look up table using tables and sources thereof that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art in software or firmware or by calculation. All four cases calculations in software or firmware by look up table or by algorithm will yield identical results if properly implemented. Countersink depth measurements include a depth ranging from about 0.001 to about 2.00 inches or corresponding metric units and hole diameter measurements include hole diameters ranging from about 0.100 to about 1.000 inches or corresponding metric unit .

The apparatuses and methods of the invention advantageously may be employed to perform measurements in connection with or relative to virtually any type of a three dimensional object or part thereof including those that are relatively or very complex such as an aircraft a submarine a helicopter a missile a tank a military vehicle an automobile or the like or a part thereof including skins . Three dimensional objects that may have their pre drilled or other fastener hole depths countersink depths and or hole diameters measured by the apparatuses and methods of the invention include but are not limited to aircrafts commercial military jets props helicopters or the like submarines ships missiles tanks boats heavy machinery earth moving equipment automobiles trucks buses trains trailers campers military and other vehicles or the like or a part thereof including a skin or substructure such as a wing of an airplane a tail of an airplane an electrical panel a control panel a cableway and or the like.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the invention are extremely useful among other things for an assembly or other manufacture or production of objects parts or skins that are complex in other words those that take a significant amount of time and or labor to assemble or otherwise manufacture and or include a large number of pre drilled or other fastener holes that must be properly measured in order to identify and select corresponding hole fasteners of the proper type and or length. They may be used to perform any or all of the measurement functions that are described herein alone or in connection or combination with any of a wide variety of one or more other or different devices apparatuses systems and or methods in English or in any other language including but not limited to any type of an assembly production and or manufacturing device or system such as the computerized optical assembly system that is described in Provisional patent application U.S. Ser. No. 61 281 108 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 590 500 and its corresponding international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

In addition to the advantages that have been described above the assembly or manufacturing guidance systems and methods of the invention have numerous additional very important and significant advantages associated with them which result in a significant increase in an efficiency of an assembly or other manufacture and a corresponding savings of a significant amount of time labor paper products and money in comparison with known methods for assembling or otherwise manufacturing three dimensional objects parts or skins such as manual systems and methods and laser systems and methods. Such advantages are also provided in connection with other uses or applications of the systems and methods of the invention.

First such systems and methods significantly reduce and usually completely eliminate a need for persons or entities that are assembling or manufacturing a relatively complicated three dimensional object part or skin to continuously or otherwise use and refer to blueprints plans drawings and or other paper instructions or computer displays for the assembly or manufacture which are often several dozens hundreds thousands or even hundreds of thousands of pages or screens in length i.e. several inches thick to learn and understand how to assemble such items. For example a typical aircraft may have more than 100 000 pages of blueprints and or written instructions to teach and guide an assembly technician how to assemble the aircraft which components go where which order of steps should be followed how various parts are connected together and the like . In contrast using the systems and methods of the invention a set of step by step assembly or manufacturing instructions in the best or most logical order may be prepared very rapidly in an automated manner. This in turn eliminates the extensive amount of time and labor that is associated with reading understanding and implementing the information that is present in such lengthy and complicated blueprints drawings plans other paper instructions or computer displays and the high labor fees that would be associated with paying workers or employees to carry out such tasks renders these assembly and manufacturing processes tremendously more rapid. They tremendously reduce the labor and time required to perform an assembly or manufacturing process in comparison with assembly or manufacturing processes for assembling the same three dimensional object part or skin but using blueprints plans drawings other paper instructions or computer displays. Such time and labor may be and is often reduced by at least about 10 20 30 40 or 50 or even a higher percent depending upon the complexity of the particular object part of skin being assembled or manufactured. Typically the more complex an item is that is being assembled or manufactured the more time and labor savings will be achieved with the systems and methods of the invention. Further a much larger quantity of particular items being assembled or otherwise manufactured can be assembled or manufactured within a given period of time in comparison with assembly or manufacturing processes that employ blueprints plans drawings other paper instructions or computer displays to produce the same items rendering an assembly or manufacturing process or line tremendously more efficient.

Second the systems and methods of the invention greatly improve the accuracy of assembly or other manufacture of a three dimensional object part or skin in comparison with other assembly methods such as those that employ blueprints plans drawings and or other paper instructions or computer displays usually providing error free assemblies and manufactures. In the systems and methods of the invention step by step instructions in a logical or required order and usually the best order if more than one order is possible for an assembly of a particular three dimensional item are provided to an operator and improve the accuracy of the assembly or other manufacture by highlighting specific points on the item being assembled or otherwise manufactured and detailing specific instructions which very advantageously reduce or eliminate assembly and manufacturing errors which errors can be extremely costly. Typically the systems and methods of the invention result in one or a plurality of assemblies or other manufactures of a three dimensional object part or skin that is substantially or fully error free i.e. 100 accurate . For example if in assembling a particular object part C cannot be fastened to part B until part B is fastened to part A the step of fastening part C to part B will be ordered by the systems and methods of the invention in a manner that is subsequent to the step of fastening part B to part A i.e. the steps will occur in a logical or proper order for an assembly or other manufacture of this particular object . An error in assembly can result in large quantities of wasted costs relating to raw materials machine time labor time interruption of assembly process rework and or scrap disposal.

Third the systems and methods of the invention provide an extraordinarily effective means to pass information from highly skilled and or experienced workers to less experienced or even inexperienced individuals to readily be able to assemble or otherwise manufacture or carry out some other process in connection with a three dimensional object part of skin the second third and subsequent times i.e. after the first time . Once a complex object is assembled or otherwise manufactured using the systems and methods of the invention a first time the second third fourth fifth sixth and subsequent times that the same complex object is assembled generally become less complicated and less time consuming generally permitting a less experienced individual to readily be able to assemble or otherwise manufacture the object the second third and subsequent times in a rapid efficient and error free manner. This is because the system generally only needs to be set up one time for each different object part or skin being assembled using the computer software and other items that is described herein . Once all of the data is entered by a user into the Authoring Tool Configurator Tool and Operating Tool computer software programs that are described herein and the various resulting files are created in connection with one type of Item to be assembled such as an airplane vertical stabilizer the user typically does not need to do this again even though than more than one of the same object will likely be assembled . Thus the second third fourth fifth sixth and subsequent times that the same object part or skin is assembled using the system no initial set up of the system typically needs to be performed resulting in a tremendous savings in time and labor and consequently cost.

When assembling the same exact type of object part or skin the Authoring Tool and the Configurator Tool will not need to be re run by the user. The Operator Tool will be re run because it contains all of the ordered assembly or other manufacturing sequence instructions. Further the calibration step in the Operator Tool may not have to be re run if the object part of skin being assembled or manufactured is placed in the same place position and orientation as the previous objects parts or skins that were assembled with respect to their locations and orientations in connection with the optical projector s . In these cases the Tweak screen could be used to make a final alignment between the three dimensional object part or skin and the projected text images and or symbols so that the latter appears in an undistorted manner on the former. If the object part of skin cannot be placed in the same spot and orientation then the calibration step wilt usually need to be re run. Thus it is preferred that an assembly line reliably place the object part of skin to be assembled or manufactured in the same place position and orientation each time that another one is being assembled or manufactured which can avoid re running the calibration step.

As an example a complex three dimensional object that takes approximately thirty hours to assemble the first time that it is assembled using the systems and methods of the invention may take only eighteen hours to assemble by the same or a different individual the second third fourth fifth sixth and subsequent times that it is assembled. The foregoing advantages result in an additional increase in efficiency for assembling the object and a corresponding additional savings of time and money. Labor savings of 30 and greater have been demonstrated during testing of these systems.

Fourth the systems and methods of the invention do not depend upon the particular type of lens that is used in an optical projector employed therein regular lens fixed local lens wide angle lens wide short throw lens zoom lens or the like and thus can operate successfully using a wide variety of different types of optical projector or other lenses regardless of how close that a three dimensional object part skin being assembled or manufactured is to the optical projector s being employed. For example typically with other types of projection based processes a wide angle lens would be required when projecting from a projector that is physically located close to a screen being projected upon and a different lens would be required if the projector were moved a great distance from the screen. This is not the case with the systems and methods of the invention which can use any type of a suitable lens whether close or far from an object being projected upon.

Fifth the systems and methods of the invention have an ability to operate successfully in daylight and or in other types of bright light that is typical in production environments i.e. they do not need to operate in a dimly lit or dark room in order to properly operate .

Sixth in contrast with laser assembly guidance systems for assembling objects which very disadvantageously can only project a limited quantity of a single color onto an object cannot project images pictures drawings illustrations figures tables or other graphics shapes or video onto an object must write out each letter of a word or text individually which is extremely time consuming and often have accompanying severe flashing or blinking with their laser projections the systems and methods of the invention have an ability to very rapidly project virtually unlimited quantities of a wide variety of texts images shapes and video onto a three dimensional object part or skin that is being assembled otherwise manufactured or processed without having to write out each letter of a word being projected such as dots lines and or a wide variety of shapes or a combination thereof and in any color or combination of colors in an unlimited quantity and without flashing blinking and or other distortions. Virtually an unlimited pallet of a wide variety of different colors or combination of colors from black to white can be displayed on a three dimensional object part or skin at the same or different times including but not limited to orange red maroon pink purple cyan violet fuchsia blue royal navy aqua or the like green lime green olive green light green dark green or the like teal yellow brown black white grey silver gold and or the like. The systems and methods of the invention provide a user with an option of using a standard windows or other color pallet that is available in many Microsoft Windows and other computer software programs and all of the various colors provided therein. Such color pallets typically show a rainbow of color that start with black and ends with white. The user can lace a mouse over the rainbow to select a color or can enter RGB Red Green Blue values using a text box to define an exact color. As can be seen from the foregoing the systems and methods of the invention are significantly more rapid versatile and efficient in comparison with laser assembly guidance systems and do not project projections that are distorted like laser projection systems often project.

In order to present an image to observers laser projectors move a laser beam quickly over the surface using computer controlled mirrors. This laser beam when not moving is a simple point of light and looks like a line when it is moving at a fast enough rate of speed. From the point at which a laser projects the start of an image to the point at which the laser projects the last point in an image before starting over again is called a frame. How many of these frames can be displayed per second is referred to as frames per second fps . This can be thought of as being equivalent to hertz cycles per second .

For the human eye to perceive no flickering and for images to seem fluid a laser must generally project an image at a rate of at least 24 frames per second. Consequently if the image a laser is projecting can be fully painted 24 times per second the human eye shouldn t see any flickering. However as the size of the image being displayed by the laser increases so does the amount of time that it takes to paint an entire frame since the mirrors in the laser cannot be sped up. Therefore flickering will begin at less than 24 frames per second and will get progressively worse as this number decreases.

An optical projector is different from a laser projector in that an optical projector contains a relatively high intensity light bulb inside that typically operates at from about 50 to about 60 hertz. This light shines through an image then through the projectors lens and onto the projection surface. The entire image is projected at the same time and not one point at a time as occurs with a laser. In addition the laser projects only in one color whereas an optical projector projects in whatever color each point of an image being projected is since the light shines through it. Because the light is generally on continuously and generally projects an entire image continuously there is no flickering no matter how big the image gets.

The above features and other features described herein along with tremendous time and labor savings which result in tremendous cost savings significantly increase the utility of the system and methods in comparison with similar laser systems and render them significantly more advantageous and desirable.

Seventh in stark contrast with a standard Power Point or laser projection due to their three dimensional calibrations described herein the systems of the invention may be placed anywhere within a given assembly or work area such as a conference room a factory an assembly line a theater or the like on one side on the other side in the front in the back in the middle and the like and retain an ability to project a picture or other image text or both onto a three dimensional object that is undistorted regardless of projector placement and or surface contours of the object. Standard projections do not have such an ability. Software employed in the system includes a calibration routine that guides an operator through a sequence of steps that determines the relative positions and orientations of the optical projector s and the three dimensional object part or skin being illuminated. The system software then projects the image in a manner that orientation appears correct regardless of the projector to object or part of skin orientation.

Eighth there is no system limit regarding the quantity of information that can be included in one or more assembly manufacturing or other process steps although practical limits may vary by application or the number of such steps that may be programmed.

Ninth the same systems and methods of the invention very advantageously can be used to assemble any three dimensional object part or skin regardless of the complexity or non complexity of the object part or skin and can project text images and or symbols upon any three dimensional object or part in a substantially or fully undistorted manner. They are not limited to assembling manufacturing or projecting upon only one or two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so forth particular type of three dimensional object part or skin. The same systems and methods can be used to assemble manufacture process and project upon a wide variety of different three dimensional objects parts skins or systems having a varying complexity.

Tenth the systems and methods of the invention very advantageously can be calibrated in the manner described herein very rapidly generally in about three minutes or less and usually in about two minutes or less and often in about one minute or less while producing very accurate alignments.

Eleventh the three dimensional optical projection technology of the systems and methods of the invention allow an assembly manufacturing or other business to record have inputted into the computer its best practices i.e. the best method for assembling manufacturing or otherwise processing a particular three dimensional object part or skin rather than just any one or more different ways out of a variety of different possible ways so that there is an assurance that every worker knows the best way to assemble manufacture or process any object any lime that such assembly manufacture or process is being performed even if they have never done this particular assembly manufacture or process or task thereof before.

Twelfth the systems and methods of the invention significantly reduce often by as much as 50 or greater assembly manufacturing or other process errors made by workers when manually assembling manufacturing or processing a three dimensional object part or skin i.e. using blueprints plans instructions manuals other paper products and or computer screens to learn and understand how to assemble manufacture or process a particular three dimensional object part or skin . For example if an L shaped part needs to be mounted to another part in a configuration in which the L should face to the right and upwards as opposed to the left and downwards an assembly technician would typically mount the L shaped piece in an incorrect configuration about 50 of the time greatly reducing the efficiency and accuracy of the assembly resulting in large additional and unnecessary assembly costs. This problem is solved by the systems and methods of the invention which can project an L in a desired color directly onto the three dimensional object part or skin being assembled in the exact orientation in which it is to be configured facing to the right and upwards very advantageously eliminating any possibility of assembly errors and associated assembly costs.

Thirteenth in stark contrast with laser projection systems and methods employed in an assembly of an object which operate in a completely different manner from the optical systems and methods of the present invention such laser systems are extremely expensive often about 250 000.00 or more per system . In contrast the optical systems of the invention currently cost much less than corresponding laser systems often up to eight times less or more. Further when a laser burns out it is extremely expensive to replace. In contrast when a light bulb employed in an optical projector burns out it is relatively inexpensive to replace.

Fourteenth unlike laser based projection systems which only have an ability to illuminate one relatively small dot on a screen or object at one time which may be moved by the operator to attempt to form a shape of a letter the systems and methods of the invention very advantageously can illuminate a large area at one time such as an entire aircraft.

Fifteenth the systems of the invention can generally be installed and set up for operation in an assembly environment very rapidly by only one person usually in about four hours or less and more usually in about two hours or less and still more usually in about one hour or less and even still more usually in about thirty minutes or less. In some cases it takes only one person about twenty minutes to install the system take all of the steps that are necessary to make the system run to operate an assembly manufacturing or other process . Further the components of the systems can properly be calibrated in the manner described herein very rapidly by only one person at a very low cost often at no cost usually in about twenty minutes or less and more usually in about ten minutes or less and still more usually in about five minutes or less and even still more usually in about one minute or less.

Sixteenth in contrast with laser based systems and methods the systems and methods of the invention typically do not produce any blinking flickering or other phenomena that can cause eye strain for the user or otherwise be annoying to the user .

The foregoing advantages will likely make American and other industrialized country s assembly lines manufacturing environments and systems significantly more efficient resulting in tremendous time and cost savings.

In addition to other advantages that are described herein the measurement apparatuses and methods of the invention have numerous novel and extremely important and advantageous characteristics and benefits associated with them which result in a significant increase in an efficiency of an assembly or other manufacture and a corresponding savings of a significant amount of time labor and money in comparison with manual and other automated measurement apparatuses and methods.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the present invention tremendously reduce the labor and time required to perform an assembly or manufacturing process in comparison with assembly or manufacturing processes for assembling the same three dimensional workpiece object or part but using manual or other automated measuring apparatuses. Such time and labor may be and is often reduced by at least about 10 20 30 40 or 50 or even a higher percent depending upon the complexity of the particular workpiece object part of skin being assembled or manufactured. Typically the more complex an item is that is being assembled or manufactured the more time and labor savings will be achieved with the measuring apparatuses and methods of the invention. Further a much larger quantity of particular items being assembled or otherwise manufactured can be assembled or manufactured within a given period of time in comparison with assembly or manufacturing processes that employ manual or other automated measurement apparatuses to produce the same items rendering an assembly or manufacturing process or line tremendously more efficient.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the present invention also tremendously increase the accuracy of assembly or other manufacture of a three dimensional workpiece object part or skin in comparison with assembly or manufacturing processes for assembling the same three dimensional workpiece object part or skin but using manual or other automated measuring apparatuses in a manner that is usually fully 100 accurate error free or at least substantially accurate error free which very advantageously reduces or eliminates assembly and manufacturing errors which errors can be extremely costly. An error in assembly can result in large quantities of wasted costs relating to raw materials machine time labor time interruption of assembly process rework and or scrap disposal. The measurement apparatuses and methods of the present invention significantly reduce often by as much as 10 20 30 40 or even 50 or greater assembly manufacturing production or other process errors made by workers when making fastener hole measurements manually or using other automated measurement apparatuses.

Measurement apparatuses within the invention including those that are specifically identified herein include the numerous advantageous characteristics and benefits that are set forth below.

The automated measuring apparatuses and methods of the invention are much more rapid and accurate in comparison with a manual measurement of fastener hole depths countersink depths and hole diameters with the result that time and labor associated with an assembly or manufacturing process is often significantly reduced with the amount of reduction depending upon the complexity of the particular workpiece object part of skin being assembled produced or manufactured. Typically the more complex an item is that is being assembled produced or manufactured the more time and labor savings will be achieved with the apparatuses and methods of the invention. Further a much larger quantity of particular items being assembled or otherwise produced or manufactured can be assembled produced or manufactured within a given period of time in comparison with assembly or manufacturing processes that employ manual or other automated fastener hole depth countersink depth and hole diameter measurements rendering an assembly production or manufacturing process or line tremendously more efficient and less costly.

Further the apparatuses and methods of the invention greatly improve the accuracy of assembly production or other manufacture of a three dimensional object part workpiece or skin in comparison with assembly methods that employ manual and other automated methods for measuring fastener hole depths or lengths countersink depths and or hole diameters. The apparatuses of the invention improve the accuracy of the assembly or other manufacture by making very accurate fastener hole depth countersink depth and hole diameter measurements in an automated manner. Again errors in assembly can result in large quantities of wasted costs relating to raw materials machine time labor time interruption of assembly process rework and or the like.

Additionally the apparatuses and methods of the invention can be employed to measure fastener hole lengths and fastener lengths as well as countersink depths and hole diameters in connection with any three dimensional workpiece object part or skin regardless of the complexity or non complexity of the workpiece object part or skin.

Various advantages also may exist between wireless and wired Power over Ethernet measuring apparatuses of the invention. Very advantageously the wireless measuring apparatuses typically have a very easy mobility and a reduced opportunity to become damaged as a result of a cable becoming caught on or wrapped around an item such as a computer or projector stand or a chair. However their battery lives may terminate within a finite period of time for example a period of about eight hours and certain high security areas do not permit wireless transmission data. Power over Ethernet measuring apparatuses in contrast advantageously have an unlimited operation time and are typically permitted in highly classified areas. They however are typically less mobile and include one or more cables that can become caught on or wrapped around a different item potentially causing damage to the apparatuses and surrounding items.

The above features and other features described herein along with tremendous time and labor savings which result in tremendous cost savings significantly increase the utility of the measuring apparatuses and methods of the present invention in comparison with manual and other automated measuring apparatuses and render them significantly more advantageous and desirable. The foregoing advantages will also likely make American and other industrialized country s assembly lines manufacturing environments and systems significantly more efficient resulting in tremendous time and cost savings.

For the purpose of illustrating the measuring apparatuses systems processes uses and methods of the present invention in a manufacturing application there are shown in the drawings which form a material part of this disclosure various illustrations schemes apparatuses and flowcharts of preferred embodiments thereof. However the measuring apparatuses systems and methods of the present in invention are in no way limited to manufacturing applications and may be employed in any application process situation and or environment in which it is desired or required to project three dimensional text images and or symbols in a substantially or fully undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of three dimensional objects parts skins persons animals and or the like and or to take fastener hole depth countersink depth and or hole diameter or other measurements.

After very extensive experimentation and testing with complex three dimensional workpieces and other objects such as aircraft vertical stabilizers and development the inventors discovered how to accurately and successfully optically project three dimensional text images and or symbols in an undistorted manner onto one or a plurality of three dimensional objects parts or skins to provide a series of logically ordered assembly instructions steps for an assembly or other manufacture of the object having the numerous advantages that are described herein which was extremely difficult and challenging and which is completely different from the manner in which laser projection systems operate. They also determined how to very rapidly and accurately measure structure thickness grip lengths fastener hole depths countersink depths hole diameters and other measurements in an automated manner. Because mistakes in an assembly or other manufacture of many complex three dimensional objects military and other aircrafts vehicles ships trains missiles and the like cannot be made without producing potentially very dire consequences including a massive loss of human lives an extensive amount of testing was required to perfect the measuring apparatuses systems and methods of the present invention and to have them operate extremely accurately.

While preferred embodiments of the measuring apparatuses systems and methods of the invention are describe herein and illustrated herein these are only specific examples of how the apparatuses systems and methods of the invention can be successfully configured set up and employed to operate and there are many other ways that such apparatuses systems and methods can be configured arranged set up and employed to operate and or programmed by a computer programmer or electrical worker having ordinary skill in the art using the information drawings equations and source code that are all taught or provided herein in very great detail. The inventors solved hugely important and long felt but unresolved needs worldwide in the manufacturing production assembly and three dimensional projection industries which is expected to revolutionize the manner in which three dimensional objects parts skins and or the like are assembled manufactured or processed particularly complex three dimensional objects such as airplanes jets helicopters submarines ships boats automobiles trucks trains military vehicles missiles tanks cables heavy industrial machinery and the like and parts thereof. They developed solutions to very large problems and their solutions are not limited to any particular type size shape number or brand of optical projectors computers computer software programs computer code measurement apparatuse or components thereof mounts and or the like and or to any particular arrangement of parts or components of the apparatuses. Using the information drawings equations and source code that are taught by the inventors herein in very great detail i.e. the information that was discovered and developed by the inventors any computer programmer or electrical worker having ordinary skill in the art can write and develop a wide variety of one or a plurality of computer software programs and or pieces of computer code and circuit boards that can act alone or together in a wide variety of different combinations and use such software programs and circuit boards in the manner described by the inventors herein with a wide variety of different optical projectors computers measurement apparatuses mounts and or the like to produce the systems measuring apparatuses and methods of the present invention.

The various components of the preferred embodiments of the measuring apparatuses and systems of the invention may be generally arranged in the manner shown in the drawings and or described herein or otherwise as may be desired or required in a particular situation and or for a particular application.

These parts components arrangements configurations dimensions instrumentalities angles codes circuit boards electrical components cards softwares programs computer programming languages user interfaces display screens frames calibrations correlations and or conditions may be varied widely as circumstances industries environments applications individuals entities and or locations require or as is desired. Further one or a plurality of these parts and or components may be present and arranged in a wide variety of different manners. One item may be positioned relative to another item in a number of different ways. For example a nut may be positioned relative to a surface by being adjacent to touching or some distance away from the surface. The location of the various components or parts of the measuring apparatuses and systems and parts thereof and the means employed for attaching or connecting one or more components or parts of the measuring apparatuses or systems with one or more other components or parts thereof may also be varied Still further various components or parts of the systems may be either permanently or removably attached with other components or parts thereof and may be movable or stationary. Removably attached components and parts are often preferable because such components and parts may generally be replaced in a simpler and more cost effective manner in the event that they become worn damaged or destroyed.

Specific and preferred embodiments of the systems of the invention as they are employed in a manufacturing application and or environment will now be described with reference to the drawings.

In the different advantageous embodiments one component may be associated with another component in a number of different ways. For example the measuring probe may be associated with the housing by being attached to bonded to welded to or otherwise being secured to the housing. Further the measuring probe may be associated with the housing by being an extension or part of the housing. As another example when one component is associated with another component the component may be moveably or non movably attached to the other component.

Referring now to there is shown in an optical projection assembly system being employed in a manufacturing application which includes an optical projector that is connected via a cable with a computer . The cable permits information to be transferred to the computer from the optical projector and information to be transferred to the optical projector from the computer and is connected with the optical projector via a port located in the back of the device and with the computer via a port not shown located in the back of that device . The optical projector is mounted onto an adjustable tripod and is optically projecting a projection of a plurality of small circles onto pre drilled holes present in a three dimensional object that is being assembled a vertical stabilizer of an aircraft . The computer is sitting on a movable stand including wheels permitting the computer and stand to readily be moved from one location to another location within an assembly or manufacturing area. A keyboard is connected to the computer with another cable and two monitors and are connected with the computer with cables and that are connected to ports not shown that are located at the back of the computer and of the two monitors and . The cable that connects the computer with the keyboard permits information to be transferred between the computer and the keyboard and the cables and permit information to be transferred between the computer and the two monitors and . A mouse sits next to the keyboard on the stand . additionally shows a measurement apparatus having its probe inserted into a pre drilled hole that is present in the three dimensional object being assembled. In and the pre drilled holes that are darker in color represent those holes that are being projected upon by the optical projector and the pre drilled holes that are lighter in color represent holes that are not being projected upon by the optical projector . In both and the portion of the object vertical stabilizer being projected upon has its pre drilled holes illuminated by the projection and the portion of the object that is not being projected upon includes pre drilled holes that are not illuminated.

The measurement apparatuses and methods of the invention may be employed with optical projection assembly systems which are discussed below as well as with any other types of an assembly manufacturing production and or similar system in particular laser projection systems.

The optical projection assembly systems and methods include one or a plurality of optical projectors or similar devices that function in the same or a similar manner that function to i provide an amount of illumination in an assembly manufacturing or other area such as on a production line or inside an assembly building that is effective for permitting optically projected text images and or symbols to be partially or fully visible to an average sighted user preferably fully visible preferably in any of a wide variety of different lighting conditions and or situations ranging from no natural or other light 0 light to full natural and or other light 100 light which typically depend upon a variety of factors such as the size of a work or other area the number of windows present therein the number of lights present therein the type of light bulbs employed in the lights and or the like for example a large fully dark room having no windows and no lights a partially dark room having one or a plurality of windows and or one or a plurality of lights turned on ambient light a room that is bright as a result of having one or a plurality of windows and or one or a plurality of lights turned on and a small room that is as bright as possible for example having many windows with sun shining through and a plurality of high wattage fluorescent or sodium vapor lights turned on and preferably in ambient light and ii provide an amount of coverage by such text images and or symbols on a three dimensional object or part or skin thereof being projected upon in terms of height width depth perimeter circumference diameter and or the like that is effective for permitting one or a plurality of workers or other system users to properly assemble manufacture or process the object or part or skin thereof from greater than about 0 to about 100 which coverage may be partial less than 100 as is shown in the drawings or full 100 but is preferably full. For example if an entire automobile is present in an assembly area and the part being assembled is a handle of the automobile or the handle is being affixed to another part on the automobile it is preferable that the entire handle be covered by the projected text images and or symbols but the remainder of the automobile need not have any text images and or symbols projected thereon.

The optical projectors that are employed in these systems and methods of the invention should have a luminosity that is sufficient to overcome the amount of light that is present in a particular assembly manufacturing work or other area such as ambient light which may vary widely depending upon the situation and area and which often ranges from about 1500 lumens in dark assembly areas to about 5 000 lumens in bright assembly areas with a lot of natural light or auxiliary lighting with at least about 4000 lumens being preferred. An effective amount of coverage of an object or of a part portion or area thereof being projected upon generally ranges form about 50 to about 100 and preferably ranges from about 90 to about 100 with about 100 coverage being most preferred but may vary. The type natural light sunlight light from light or other bulbs and or the like of light and or the amount of light that is present when the optical projectors are being employed generally ranges from about full brightness 100 light to about complete darkness 0 light with ambient light being in between.

A lumen is a unit of measurement of the amount of brightness that comes from a light source. Lumens define luminous flux which is energy within the range of frequencies that human beings perceive as light. For example a wax candle generates 13 lumens and a 100 watt bulb generates 1 200 lumens.

When choosing an optical projector the lumen rating is an important specification to be considered and is greatly influenced by the available surrounding light. The standard lumen rating of a projector is the average of photometer readings at several points on a full white image on a screen.

While the intensity of an optical projector is rated in lumens the power density on the object being illuminated is measured in foot candles. Power density is defined as follows in which 

The ambient light in a typical production assembly area ranges from about 20 to about 100 foot candles with from about 30 to about 70 foot candles being typical and about 40 being ideal. The optical projection system setup preferably is at least about 80 of ambient light preferably no more than about 150 of ambient light. An even match of 100 is ideal. For example with ambient light of 40 foot candles and a projector of 4000 lumens the ideal illumination would mean the projected area would be 100 square feet or 10 10 feet.

While a user of these systems and methods having ordinary skill in the art may generally readily be able determine what size of optical projectors to use for a particular assembly manufacture or other process and in a particular environment the user may optionally use a calculator to help make this decision. One calculator that the user may use for this purpose is present at the web site infocus dot com. Other such calculators are known by those having ordinary skill in the art and are often provided by manufacturers of optical projectors.

Using the information that is provided herein those having ordinary skill in the art can readily select a suitable or desirable optical projector an amount of ambient light and a size of a work area that are suitable or required for properly using the systems and methods of the invention to assemble manufacture or otherwise process a particular three dimensional object part or skin.

The optical projectors that are used in these systems and methods may be of any brand model or type as long as they can perform the functions that are described herein. As is known by those having ordinary skill in the art component parts of optical projectors typically include a lamp a cross dichroic prism dichroic mirrors LCD panels reflection mirrors lenses polarizing converters and or a projector lens. Additionally they may include mounts screens digital or other zooms magnifiers fans mouses remote control or other cameras laser pointing devices computers VGA RGB IN and or other ports and or cables RGB1 RGB2 video and or other inputs computer connections and or the like. Such components typically work together to affect light that is emitted from the lamp and may facilitate a connection of the projector with a computer.

LCD optical projectors that are employed in these systems and methods generally project very tiny dots of light that produce red blue and green lights on an object surface of projector screen. By combining these primary colors more interesting colors and tones are typically created. Red and blue light is combined to make purple while green and red creates yellow. Transparent light is created by combining the three primary colors red blue and green with equal brightness. The colors of light are mixed into varying combinations to produce natural looking colors before the light exits the projector lens.

With most projectors lighting conditions play a significant role in projecting an image onto a screen or other surface or object . A dark room will work well for most LCD and other projectors but there are times when it is not possible or desirable to have a room be dark such as when a projection is being made in a well lit room. LCD projectors may work differently in regards to brightness. Highly lighted areas such as a room with many windows may require an LCD projector with a brightness of 5 000 lumens or more ANSI whereas a room that does not include windows may require an LCD projector with a brightness as little as 1500 lumens.

When choosing a projector the lumen rating may be an important specification to consider. In a darkened room 1 000 lumens may be ample but in a typical production environment with normal lighting 4 000 lumens may be more desirable. In a room with daylight greater than 5 000 lumens may be preferred. The standard lumen rating of a data projector is the average of photometer readings at several points on a full white image on the screen.

With respect to the first variable there are some lenses that are capable of projecting an image that may be 10 wide by 10 high when the projector is 8 away. There are other lenses that would only project an image that is 5 wide by 5 high from the same 8 distance. Therefore the user needs to determine how close to the three dimensional object part or skin he can situate the optical projectors and how far he can move them back if needed. It is preferable that the optical projectors be as close as possible to the three dimensional object part or skin in order to get it to fully 100 cover the object with the projected text images and or symbols. The larger the image the dimmer the image will get. For example a 4000 lumen projector will generally look the same with an 8 8 projection area if the projector is 6 feet or 60 feet different lenses away. No matter what lens is chosen the user has the same amount of light coming out of the optical projector. So if the user chooses a lens that provides a 5 5 image from 8 away its picture will be much brighter than if the user chooses a lens that provides a 10 10 image from 8 away. The concept is similar to that of a flashlight. The closer that one is to an object the smaller the light spot will be on its surface but the brighter it will be. The farther back that one gets the spot gets bigger but dimmer. 

With respect to the second variable if a three dimensional object is so large that an optical projector cannot be moved far enough back to cover it or there is no lens available that will project an image that is large enough to cover it then at least two optical projectors will generally be required. Using all of the guidelines discussed in the following paragraph the first optical projector would generally be placed with the optimal lens and then the second optical projector would be placed in order to project an image over all of the areas that are not covered by the first optical projector. Additional optical projectors and associated projector lens may need to be added if coverage is not sufficient using just two of them. For example if a computer having a plurality of video outputs specifically includes eight video outputs typically up to eight monitors and optical projectors may be connected with the computer such as one monitor and up to seven optical projectors using various cables . A plurality of optical projectors computers monitors and or associated equipment each of which may have a plurality of inputs and outputs and associated cables may be operably connected with each other in a manner that data may be transferred from one to the other or vice versa or both. The number of optical projectors needed or desired and their placement within a particular assembly manufacturing work or other area may be estimated and often ranges from about 2 to about 4 per part of an object that is being assembled. For example in one manufacturing environment a manufacturer could have for example one hundred different stations in which various different three dimensional component parts of one three dimensional object are separately being assembled or otherwise manufactured with each station using from about 2 to about 4 optical projectors and a total of 200 to 400 optical projectors being employed. However the most accurate method for ensuring that the appropriate number and placement is to try it. The user should first determine the size of the three dimensional object or part being assembled.

Optical projector placement may be directed by many variables the most important being that it needs to be placed in a manner that it is not in the way of anything such as workers or objects such as aisles. Once this is determined the type of lens to be used in the optical projector can readily be selected by those having ordinary skill in the art based on an analysis of throw ratio. Throw ratio is defined as a distance to target divided by the width of the three dimensional object part or skin being projected upon or assembled or manufactured. For example if a three dimensional object being assembled is 5 feet wide and the optical projector is going to sit 10 feet away from the object that means that the throw ratio should be 10 5 which is a throw ratio of 2. The optical projector and lens may then be placed in position and powered up by electricity a battery and or the like . If a user then determines that the object or part is not fully covered by one optical projector a second optical projector should be added generally off of either side of the first optical projector. If the user then determines that the object or part is still not fully covered by two projectors then a third optical projector should be added generally off of either side of the first or second optical projector and so forth. All optical projectors should be placed in locations within an assembly or work area so as to minimize any interference with workers aisles and the like. Further if an object or part can be covered width wise with one optical projector but the height of the object or part is such that one optical projector cannot cover it a second optical projector will typically be needed. In this situation the second optical projector will most likely need to be placed above the first optical projector and high enough to cover the top of the three dimensional object or part .

With respect to the third variable the ambient light plays a factor because the brighter the work or other area the harder it is to see the projected text images and or symbols. Therefore a user will generally have to move the optical projector closer or use a lens that projects a smaller image in a brighter environment as opposed to a darker environment .

Projector sizing calculators may be employed in or to carry out the systems and methods of the invention and are available on or from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as the web site infocus dot com. Data regarding image size projection distance distance from the optical projector to the three dimensional object or part being assembled optical projector model and or other variables typically may be input into the calculator and the calculator will typically provide corresponding data such as how large a particular image will be or how far back from an object that a optical projector should be located.

The number type size and capacity of optical projectors optical projector lens computers monitors inputs outputs cables associated equipment and the like and their placement within a particular assembly manufacturing work or other area and in relation to one another that would be suitable or desirable for a particular project object or part and or situation may readily be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art using the information that it taught herein.

Some optical projectors have interchangeable lenses but others do not. The following list of InFocus optical projectors that may be employed in these systems and methods include interchangeable lenses.

Very advantageously these systems and methods permit the optical projectors employed therein to be placed virtually anywhere within a particular work or other environment such as an assembly line even often at extreme angles thereby permitting workers to see projected data sets of text Images and or symbols from virtually any work station in that environment. Because multiple optical projectors can be used and each is projecting the appropriate calibrated text images and or symbols if one optical projector gets obscured by a worker the projected data sets of text images and or symbols from the other optical projectors will still generally be visible on the three dimensional object.

Preferably included in the optical projection assembly systems and methods is one or a plurality of means for supporting the optical projectors and or maintaining the optical projectors stationary and or steady in place and or at a desired height and or other position while in use and so that any calibrations that are made using these systems and methods do not change.

Round Rock Tex. power cables typically one per monitor that are usually supplied with monitors Dell Inc. Round Rock Tex. and video cables typically one per monitor that are usually supplied with monitors Dell Inc. Round Rock Tex. .

The systems and methods of the invention optionally may include one or a plurality of movable or non movable mountings stands tables and or the like for the computers or similar devices and or peripherals keyboard mouse monitors and or the like which function to provide support therefore and a place for them to rest at a position height and or location that renders them convenient for a user to use and preferably out of the way of any projections being projected upon a three dimensional workpiece object part or skin being assembled otherwise manufactured or processed in some way. It is preferable that the mounting be movable for example having wheels as is shown in and so that the user can conveniently move the computer measuring apparatuses and or peripherals around to a variety of different locations within an assembly manufacturing work or other area location and or environment.

Various means may be employed in connection with the measuring apparatuses systems and methods of the invention to connect or attach various component parts and or surfaces of a three dimensional workpiece object part or skin that is being assembled manufactured or processed in some way together such as various glues and other adhesives or bonds cements fasteners including bolts with nuts or nut plates nails screws and or the like of various sizes diameters lengths types and or configurations which may vary widely according to a particular workpiece object part or skin being produced or processed and which may readily be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art using the information that is provided herein.

When a three dimensional workpiece object or part thereof is being assembled or manufactured using for example bolts with nuts or nut plates nuts that are generally glued to an internal surface or structure of an object being assembled or fasteners optical projection laser and other assembly systems and methods of the invention preferably include one or a plurality of means for measuring fastener hole depths of pre drilled or other holes that may be present in the workpiece object part or skin to determine proper bolt and or fastener lengths for example a manual or other known grip gage grip gun which is commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art a wired or wireless measuring apparatus of the present invention or the like. Some preferred measuring apparatus of the present invention and corresponding cables and hardware for use in the foregoing systems and methods are commercially available as of the effective filing date hereof from Delta Sigma Corp. Kennesaw Ga. Part No. PWHDGG1 POE Grip Gage with cables and all necessary hardware or Part No. PWHDPG1 POE Plunge Style Grip Gage with cables and all necessary hardware . One of these types of measuring apparatuses of the invention may be operably connected to one or a plurality of computers with the use of a serial cable by plugging the serial cable into a serial port of the computer and typically requires that a serial card also be inserted into the computer which generally comes from the manufacturer or distributor along with a measuring apparatus . The other of these types is generally connected with a computer by plugging a connecting cable into the computer s USB port. Another type of a measuring apparatus that may be employed in the foregoing systems and methods is one that performs the same function but that uses a Power Over Ethernet connection cable to connect to the computer which could use a commercially available CAT6 network cable rather than a serial or USB port. Yet a further type of measuring apparatus that could be employed is one that performs the same function but that is wireless and thus requires no cables attached to the measuring apparatus or otherwise which cables are often tripping hazards for workers. Such a measuring apparatus generally would not have any cables attached to the device or otherwise and would have a wireless adapter installed in the computer. As is apparent from the foregoing a wide variety of grip gages and similar devices and measuring apparatus of the invention may be employed in the optical projection assembly systems and methods that are described herein.

While a known grip gage or measuring apparatus of the invention is an optional feature of the optical projection assembly systems and methods that are described herein they are typically required when fasteners are to be installed into a workpiece object part or skin that is being assembled or otherwise manufactured to connect various component parts of the workpiece object part or skin together . The maximum fastener size that typically may be employed is about diameter about 1 long and the minimum fastener size that typically may be employed is about diameter long with the use of smaller or larger fasteners also being possible. The head configuration of such fasteners generally has no restrictions and can be for example a hex head a socket head cap screw a countersunk or the like all of which work well and do not affect grip gages or measurement apparatuses of the invention.

When a three dimensional workpiece object part of skin is being assembled using nails and or screws generally there would not be a grip gage or measurement apparatuses of the invention involved in the process. In such a situation a spot would most likely be projected by the one or plurality of optical projectors on the workpiece object part or skin along with some text informing illustrating or showing a user the location s at which to insert a nail or screw or similar device and there generally would not be any restrictions on diameter and or length of the nail or screw.

When a three dimensional workpiece object part of skin is being assembled using glue or the like generally a line that is a specific length width and shape i.e. straight curvilinear wiggly curved and or the like would be projected on the workpiece object part or skin that shows the user the location at which to apply a bead strand or other application of the glue and a grip gage or measurement apparatuses of the invention would not need to be used.

Further if it is desired or necessary to measure the conductivity of one or a plurality of surfaces of a three dimensional workpiece object part or skin or the thickness of a coating that is present thereon the spots projected on the workpiece object part or skin and the text would generally inform a user of the location at which to place the applicable measurement device thickness or conductivity . When the user places it at the indicated location and triggers the measurement apparatus a reading would generally be sent back to the computer. Some aircraft parts have a conductive coating sprayed on them and for quality assurance reasons a conductivity meter gage is used to ensure that the coating is conductive and therefore thick enough. These measurements are typically made in the same location for each of the same workpiece object part of skin that is made. This tool could project a spot onto the part where the measurement should be made.

A general discussion of the operation of the measuring apparatuses of the invention is set forth below and a more detailed discussion regarding such operation is set forth in a subsequent section of this document.

Measuring apparatuses of the invention generally operate in the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention in the manner that is shown in . shows a starburst pattern that is projected by an optical projector onto a pre drilled fastener hole present in an object or part that is to be measured and shows a measuring apparatus that is placed into a hole shown in in a manner that its three feet are in contact with a surface of an object being assembled.

A measuring apparatus of the invention generally includes a relatively long probe for example one that is about 1.5 inched long having a relatively blunt hook on its end that is placed partially greater than 0 but less than 100 or fully 100 through the hole extending through it and out its back or far end when extending fully through the hole.

For a retraction trigger type of measuring apparatus of the invention in operation a user typically squeezes a handle and or trigger that is present on the apparatus until the hook on the probe is pulled inward and contacts the back of the object. Typically once the handle clicks the computer s that the measurement apparatus is connected and can exchange data with reads circuitry that is present inside of the measurement apparatus to procure a thickness reading of the skin of the object or other surface or part of the object which typically correlates with fastener length and or some type of a hole measurement hole depth diameter countersink depth and or the like . If the thickness or measurement reading is within a particular tolerance band as opposed to not being within the tolerance band the starburst pattern shown in generally advances to the next pre drilled hole and the measurement apparatus is moved to that location to measure the skin thickness fastener length and or perform one or more hole measurements in connection with that hole. If the measurement is out of the tolerance band the starburst typically turns red and does not advance to the next hole. Many product manufacturers will specify to assembly technicians that the thickness of a skin of a particular product or component or surface thereof must be at least about X inches but no thicker than about Y inches which is a tolerance band for the particular product. When a user measures fastener length in this step the user is effectively measuring skin thickness. Because the skin on for example the vertical tails of F 22 aircrafts is typically a graphite composite layup its thickness can vary and should be accurately measured. A composite layup is made up of numerous layers of fiberglass graphite or other cloth and resin which typically gets compressed and heated into a rigid skin. Because it is a layup it can have a thickness variation. Thus if the thickness that is measured falls within this tolerance band it is said to be intolerance. If it is outside this tolerance band it is out of tolerance. The user can then push a yellow or other button that may be present on the measurement apparatus to repeat the measurement. Alternatively the user can press the red or other button that may be present on the measurement apparatus to advance to the next hole and the Operator Assembly Software Tool that is described herein will automatically save this out of tolerance hole information to the computer. The user can subsequently view all of the holes that were out of the tolerance band i.e. at the time that the user starts to insert fasteners into the holes .

A wide variety of measurement apparatuses of the invention and or input devices can optionally be employed in the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention preferably in a manner that permits the computer s to interface with the devices i.e. to be able to transfer information between the two so that they can accept input information from the devices and or that information can otherwise be exchanged between the programmable computers and the devices. Examples of such devices include devices that measure weight depth angles size shape width and the like for example continuity checkers depth gages and or the like.

The present invention is equally beneficial when used with laser projection systems for similar assembly applications.

The computers that are included in or employed with the measuring apparatuses systems and methods of the invention may include one or more different computer software programs which function in the manner that is described herein and which may be procured from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art and or written by computer programmers having ordinary skill in the art using the information drawings and source code that is described and provided herein in great detail.

When writing a computer program a programmer typically tries to solve a particular problem by for example understanding the problem breaking the problem into manageable units designing a solution considering alternatives to the solution refining the solution implementing the solution by writing a program in the form of code and testing the solution fixing any problems. When developing software separate pieces are generally designed that are responsible for different parts of the solution and then are subsequently put together. A program is written in a particular programming language such as Java an object oriented programming language in which objects are the basic pieces that make up a program Ada C C Pascal or Smithtalk which typically employ specific words and symbols to express the problem solution. Different programming languages define different sets of rules that determine exactly how a programmer can combine the words and symbols of the language into programming statements instructions that are carried out when a program is executed .

Four general categories of programming languages currently exist and include machine language assembly language high level languages and fourth generation languages. In order for a particular program to run on a computer the program must be in the computer s machine language. Each type of a CPU typically has its own machine language. Because machine language code is expressed as a series of binary digits such code is difficult for human beings to read and write. While assembly language which employs relatively short words that represent commands or data is significantly easier for programmers to use a program in this language cannot be executed directly on a computer. It first needs to be translated into machine language. Most programmers employ high level language such as Java Ada C C and Smithtalk to write software which employs phrases and is relatively easy for programmers to read and write but must also be translated into machine language before it can be executed for example using a compiler and or interpreter. A wide variety of commercially available Software Development Kits SDKs are often used by programmers to develop software such as the Java Software Development Kit which includes a compiler an interpreter and several other software tools that may be useful for a programmer and may be downloaded at no cost from the Sun Microsoft web site java dot sun dot com. In addition Integrated Development Environments IDEs programs that combine an editor compiler and other Java support tools may be used by programmers to support a development of Java programs. One of these programs known as NetBeans incorporates the development tools provided by Java Software Development Kits into one convenient GUI based program and may be downloaded at no cost from the web site netbeans dot org. A similar Integrated Development Environment IDEs that is called Eclipse and is promoted by IBM may be downloaded at no cost from the web site eclipse dot org.

A wide variety of computer software programs and operating systems that may be employed in connection with the measurement apparatuses systems and or methods of the invention are commercially available from sources that are know by those having ordinary skill in the art such as Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. . Dell Inc. Round Rock Tex. Apple Computer. Inc. Cupertino Calif. Hewlett Packard Company Palo Alto Calif. . Delta Sigma Corp. Kennesaw Ga. and similar computer software supply or other companies and or may be written by computer programmers having ordinary skill in the art using the information drawings and computer source code that are provided herein. The present in invention is not limited to any particular type number or version of computer software programs or operating systems or to any particular manufacturer or distributor of computer software or operating system. As is well known by those having ordinary skill in the art more than one computer software program or version thereof and often a wide variety of computer software programs and versions thereof or combined software programs may be used to perform the same function on or in connection with a computer. Also computer software programs that may retain the same function are often routinely or continuously updated or enhanced sometimes with the use of plug in or add in computer code and or with other enhancements additions deletions and or substitutions to existing code. Thus any type and number of computer software programs and or operating systems may be employed in connection with the measurement apparatuses systems and or methods of the present invention as long as they have an ability to perform the functions that are described herein and such computer software and operating system may be procured from any known or other computer software manufacturer or distributor or store or generated by a computer programmer having ordinary skill in the art. Further additional computer programs may be employed in connection with the measurement apparatuses systems and or methods of the invention as long as they are compatible with computer programs that are required for the invention to properly operate which may be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art.

There are several general categories of computer software that may be employed in connection with the measurement apparatuses systems and methods of the invention. Programming software generally come in forms of tools that assist a programmer in writing computer programs sets of logical instructions that make a computer system perform certain tasks . The tools that help the programmers in instructing a computer system include text editors compilers and interpreters. System software helps in running the computer hardware and the computer system and is a collection of operating systems devise drivers servers windowing systems and or utilities. System software helps an application programmer in abstracting away from hardware memory and other internal complexities of a computer. Application software enables the end users to accomplish certain specific tasks. Business software databases and educational software are some forms of application software. Different word processors which are dedicated for specialized tasks to be performed by the user are other examples of application software. Inventory management software helps an organization in tracking its goods and materials on the basis of quality as well as quantity. Warehouse inventory management functions encompass the internal warehouse movements and storage. Inventory software helps a company in organizing inventory and optimizing the flow of goods in the organization thus leading to an improved customer service. Utility software helps in the management of computer hardware and application software and performs a relatively small range of tasks such as disk defragmenters systems utilities and virus scanners. Data backup and recovery software provides functionalities beyond simple copying of data files. This software often supports user needs of specifying what is to be backed up and when. Backup and recovery software generally preserve the original organization of files and allow an easy retrieval of the backed up data. Installation software functions to prepare an application software package to run in a computer. Typically combined with the application it is installing the install program creates a folder with a default hame on the hard disk and copies the application files to that folder. The complete installation package is generally either an Internet download or on a CD ROM DVD ROM or a diskette. Application files are generally compressed in the package and the install program decompresses them into their original format and respective folders. With Windows applications the install program often adds or updates extensions to Windows that reside in the Windows folder. It is also customary for the install program to deposit an uninstall option so the application can be easily removed later on. Install programs may also be used to attach a measuring apparatus or a new peripheral device to a computer. The install program may add the device s driver to the operating system or it may be used to set or reset parameters in an updatable memory flash memory EEPROM etc. on the expansion board that has been plugged in. Security software provides some measure of security from attack to a an individual computer or a computer that forms part of a network and the data present therein. Document display software functions to display text documents on a display screen so that they can be read and or modified. Networking software such as Microsoft Outlook and Internet Explorer function to permit communication over a network via email internet and or the like and or allow a user to perform network maintenance troubleshooting and or setup. Computer configuration software functions to configure a computer for usage for example setting up graphics cards performing maintenance such as cleanup and or error detection on hard drives and or to install configure and or uninstall other hardware components on the computer. Database software development software functions to create maintain and or query databases that can be used as standalone databases and or have them incorporated into one or more other software programs. Software development software functions to permit a user to write one or more software programs that will run execute on one or a plurality of different software programs such as the Authoring Configurator and or Operator Assembly Software Tools that are described herein which were written using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.

The computer software that is employed in connection with the measuring apparatuses and or optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention performs necessary or desired adjustments translations and or transformations to data for example so that a projected image onto a three dimensional object part or skin preferably appears undistorted or so that measurement data can be recorded stored manipulated and or used in some other manner and often should be installed on a programmable computer. One preferred embodiment of this software for an optical projection assembly system includes three separate software tools or software components as are described below and as are illustrated in the flowcharts that are present in and . The source code for these three separate components is described herein and is provided herewith. Detailed information about this source code is present towards the end of this document.

One of the key features of the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention is that when an assembly or other manufacture is being designed all the details about how it will be assembled or manufactured are not needed. The Authoring Tool allows an engineer or other user to put all of the components into the project with all of the associated text images and or symbols and without having to be concerned with determine or evaluate the number of optical projectors that will be required where they will need to be located or positioned within a particular area or even how many systems it will take for a particular job such as manufacturing an entire aircraft.

The production department of a manufacturer or other business typically will take the project file from the Authoring Tool and load it into the Configurator. In the work cells for a particular process a user will decide where optical projectors can be located how many are needed to get a desired or good coverage of a three dimensional object part or skin how many technicians will be used executing concurrent or separate process steps and other such information. The Configurator Tool creates a file that can be run for example by a technician each time that the sane three dimensional workpiece product or part thereof is assembled manufactured or otherwise processed.

The Operator Tool is very easy to run and requires practically no computer knowledge. An operator system user is led through for example a manufacturing assembly or other process step by step in a logical or best order of steps with all of the programmed aids to help along the way such as a video tutorial and typically cannot change any step of the process.

The three software tools can be present in one computer program in a series of two or more computer programs in any manner desired or the like and can be installed together or separately on a single computer or on separate computers. If installed on separate computers the necessary or desired files can be transferred between the two or more computers using a means for transferring data and or files between computers such as a memory stick a CD a DVD or a floppy disc or transferred over a network if the computers are linked together.

Included herein is computer source code written in Microsoft Visual Studio C that shows one solution for projecting three dimensional projections using one or a plurality of optical projectors onto three dimensional objects parts or skins. The solution that is described below is one way of achieving such results and these results could also be achieved by a computer programmer having ordinary skill in the art using different algorithms and or computer languages such as C C . Java Fortran Visual Basic and the like and is not limited to that which is shown below. The computer language selected was based primarily on the inventors experience and preference as none of these computer languages hold significant advantages over all of the other computer languages.

In order for the systems and methods of the invention to work in addition to the computer hardware peripheral devices and optical projectors that are described herein there must be a specialized software program written specifically for this purpose or otherwise procured . An example of one such program referred to as code or source code is included herein. This code is to be compiled from the source code into an executable code to be run on a computer using the computer operating system for which it is compiled.

The details of every aspect of how to accomplish the task of projecting three dimensional text graphics and or symbols and a combination thereof onto three dimensional objects parts or skins in a substantially or fully undistorted manner as is described herein is included in the source code that is described herein and provided herewith. Additionally the following paragraphs provide a high level overview of that which is being accomplished in the programs. The necessary functions have been divided into three separate programs in this implementation but all of those functions could have been put into one or two programs or perhaps more than three. This is one example that is a matter of programming preference and what is expected to be the most convenient to the particular user.

It is first required that the three dimensional geometry dataset of the surface s that will be projected upon by the optical projector s be supplied in a format that can be consumed by the computer code. This format is dictated by the source code author and programming language and can vary depending upon how the source code is written. The contents of this three dimensional geometry is created or generated by a third party or other three dimension modeling tool such as Catia Computer Aided Three dimensional Interactive Application or SolidWorks. This file is preferably exported from the three dimensional modeling software in an .STL format but the format required is dictated solely by how the source code requires it. The software also provides a means to create simple planar surfaces to use as projection surfaces if CAD or similar data is not available or required.

The second dataset that is needed in this example of three dimensional projection using optical projectors is what is referred to as the Annotated Geometry file. This dataset file contains all of the information that is necessary to define what is projected onto the three dimensional surface s . This dataset can be built and then imported from a CAD or similar system or it can be built within the software here. In examples used herein fastener hole locations are being projected onto the three dimensional surface. Holes are used only as an example. The projected features can be any desired geometry. The Annotated Geometry file for this type of dataset contains the X Y and Z location point in space of the hole as well as the I J K orientation in space normal vector for each hole which can be thought of as the definition of which direction the hole is facing. The format for this file is dictated by the source code Authoring Assembly Software Tool and can vary for different implementations. The annotated geometry can be created or modified within the software tool.

After these datasets are consumed or created within the source code described and provided herein the next step in performing a three dimensional projection is to determine where the three dimensional workpiece object or part to be projected upon is located in a manufacturing or any other environment or location with respect to the one or plurality of optical projectors being employed. This is accomplished using a Calibration step. In this step a series of points must be chosen from the Annotated Geometry file or the Base Geometry file that can be used as calibration points. These points are chosen in such a way as to insure that all geometric variances of the three dimensional object part or skin are calibrated. In other words these points are chosen so that all of the visible corners and or visible edges of the object part or skin are calibrated as well as any variances in depth. The example source code that is included herein has algorithms that require a minimum of 8 calibration points 8 or more calibration points with no upper limit .

While it could be possible in other calibration methods that may be employed in connection with the systems and methods of the invention that as few as 3 calibration points could possibly be employed it is typical in most calibration methods for most three dimensional objects parts or skins to employ from about 8 to about 10 calibration points 3 calibration points can generally only be employed if the optical parameters are already known. If a user knows nothing about the target position optical projector position or optics generally about 7 or more calibration points and usually 8 or more need to be employed. Some ambiguities can exist with 7 calibration points and 8 calibration points will usually work over 99 of the time and is thus preferred. However if the optics were calibrated in a prior step and there were certain constraints on the target position it could be resolved in as little as 3 calibration points. In other words 8 or more calibration points generally always work but a lesser number of calibration points could work given the right set of conditions. The number of calibration points needed in a particular situation and with respect to a particular three dimensional workpiece object part or skin being projected upon varies in accordance with the complexity of the surfaces of the workpiece object part or skin being projected on i.e. the greater the complexity more variations of the surface of the object part or skin the more calibration points that typically may be desired or required . Thus for some more complex three dimensional workpieces objects parts or skins for example 20 to 30 calibration points may be desired or required. Typically the greater number of calibration points that are employed the longer that the systems and methods of the invention take to operate but the less distorted a projected three dimensional text image or symbol or combination thereof will appear to the human eye when projected onto a three dimensional workpiece object part or skin up to a certain number of calibration points . At some point additional calibration points will not make much or any difference in the appearance of the projected material. Using the information that is set forth herein a person having ordinary skill in the art can determine a suitable number of calibration points to employ in connection with a particular situation and three dimensional workpiece object or part to be projected upon.

To perform the calibration the optical projector is set up to illuminate the area of interest on a three dimensional workpiece object part or skin. The projector is essentially a second computer display hereinafter referred to as the Projector Display while the first display shows the software User Interface hereinafter referred to as the User Display . The geometry to be calibrated is shown on the User Display. The software sequentially steps through the calibration points highlighting each point. In the projected view the user moves the cursor to the corresponding point on the actual three dimensional object part or skin and clicks the mouse. The software captures the x y screen position of the mouse click hereinafter referred to as the projected point . This point represents the projection of the actual three dimensional point onto the projector s image plane and it s conversion into the digital graphics coordinate system.

The projected point along with the three dimensional coordinates of the actual point define a point correspondence. Using a set of these point correspondences minimum of 8 it is possible to calculate the location and orientation of the projector or multiple projectors within the geometry s coordinate system and to calibrate the projector s optics including focal length lens distortion optical center and scaling. The result of this calibration is a graphical transformation matrix which can then be used to accurately draw within the geometry s coordinate system.

This transformation is now applied to the projected annotated geometry dataset and projected onto the actual three dimensional workpiece object part or skin in true scale. If the projected image was viewed on a standard LCD type monitor the geometry would appear to be distorted due to the transformation but on the three dimensional workpiece object part or skin the geometry is drawn accurately undistorted and in true scale.

The calibration procedure that is described herein for a use with the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention may be performed very rapidly often in one minute or less by a few clicks of a mouse and can last for a particular optical projection for a very long period of time for example for a period of at least 2 years and sometimes longer .

Further in contrast with a manual calibration system a user could use a vision calibration system with the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention which uses for example one or more machine vision cameras. It would work by using the cameras to identify known points or features on the three dimensional object. Machine vision software packages such as Cognex VisionPro are commercially available and have utilities built into them in which a Machine Vision Camera would take an image of a known object and determine its orientation in space with respect to the camera by locating predefined features on the part. With this information it is able to determine where in space i.e. the coordinate system the object is located and provide back to the systems and methods of the invention the same information determined by using a mouse method of calibrating. Other calibration systems could also be employed.

At this point the optical projection assembly system of the invention now allows a user to collect information about the three dimensional workpiece object part or skin based upon the points in the Annotated Geometry file. Examples of the type of information that can be collected about these points can include but are not limited to skin thickness at each projected point on the three dimensional workpiece object or part surface conductivity at each point coating thickness at each point and or the like. This information is collected for example using an external measurement apparatus of the invention that is operably connected with the computer. Information that is sent from this collection device may be stored along with the point geometry for future use by the source code. In the source code that is described and provided herein this information is used to indicate to an assembly technician or other system user what type of fastener out of possibly many different fastener types and or lengths that may be used to manufacture a particular three dimensional object or part should be placed into each of a series of pre drilled or other holes of any number that are present in the three dimensional object s or part s surface and how long this fastener should be. Other implementations of this source code could use this information to perform various other tasks and are not limited to fastener installation. Examples of additional or other implementations could include quality control for surface conductivity or coating thickness application of external coatings both visible and non visible locations for surface decals or paint features installation of specific components and or the like.

After all of the inputs have been gathered the data is processed and made ready to be displayed by the optical projector s . The algorithms used are similar in concept to those used for making three dimensional measurements with a camera with an exception that the process is reversed. Rather than viewing the image of a physical object through a lens onto a CCD charge coupled device or another type camera image sensor and then transforming that into a three dimensional computer model the optical projection assembly system of the invention uses a similar process but inverted to take a three dimensional computer model and place that on a LCD liquid crystal display or on another type device in an optical projector where it will be backlit and pass through a lens such that it will conform to the physical three dimensional workpiece object or part of the computer model.

In the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention the actual assembly production or manufacture instructions for assembling or otherwise manufacturing a particular three dimensional workpiece object part or skin i.e. an assembly or manufacturing process in a logical step by step order preferably of the best way to assemble a particular object part or skin such as an aircraft or a wing or tail of an aircraft are typically initially provided by the technicians that normally assemble or otherwise manufacture the particular workpiece object part of skin or by the engineers or others that designed the particular object part of skin and then programmed as a sequence of ordered assembly instructions steps into the computer. These instructions are used to initially only the first time that an object part or skin is assembled setup the systems of the invention using the Authoring tool and must generally be provided by individual s that have knowledge about the particular item being assembled. In contrast if the item were to be assembled manually i.e. using blueprints plans instruction manuals other paper documentation and or computer screens which may be hundreds of thousands of pages in length such documents must be re read each time that the item is assembled or manufactured whether performed by a skilled technician or an unskilled technician rendering such process extremely time consuming difficult inefficient and subject to a significant amount of human error.

Someone with no knowledge of the particular object being assembled in connection with the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention would not have the knowledge required to design and create an assembly process for that object. Further the person s who create the assembly manufacturing or other process for a particular object will generally be one who is already skilled with respect to the particular object. The goal of this software is not to take someone who knows nothing about assembling manufacturing or processing the object and have them create an assembly or manufacturing process for the object but rather to have someone who has never assembled or otherwise manufactured the object execute the assembly or manufacturing process created and perform the associated assembly or manufacture in much less time than would otherwise be required if the process was performed manually i.e. without the optical projection assembly systems measuring apparatuses and methods of the invention . For example a workpiece or other three dimensional object or part being assembled or manufactured may include several thousands of pre drilled holes having a variety of different depths and thirty different fastener part numbers may be required for use in various groups of different holes. The process assembly instructions can thus be set up to specify which fastener parts are to be used in which pre drilled holes and which fastener parts are to be used with specified groups of pre drilled holes before other fasteners i.e. steps and an order of assembly .

The Authoring Tool is used to create or read into the computers employed in the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention the Base Geometry and Annotated Geometry for a particular three dimensional workpiece object or part to be projected upon and then create various frames that are needed to perform a single or multiple step assembly manufacturing or other process with the number of frames being created corresponding with the number of assembly manufacturing or other steps to be performed for example in the manufacture of the three dimensional object or part and each frame describing a separate step. The Authoring Tool generally does not perform any data manipulation which generally does not occur until the calibration step in the Operator Tool .

To start the user launches the Authoring Tool by selecting on the main computer screen Start and then All Programs and then Authoring Tool or by using a desktop short cut . The User Interface of the Authoring Tool is then used to create processes that may be needed or desired to assemble manufacture measure or otherwise process a particular part.

A Base Geometry file should first be imported into the Authoring Tool. This may be performed by selecting from the top level menu Import and Base Geometry. The Base Geometry file is a stereo lithography formatted file of the three dimensional object part or skin that will ultimately be used as the projection surface. This file is created or generated by a third party three dimensional modeling tool such as Catia Computer Aided Three dimensional Interactive Application or SolidWorks. This file is preferably exported from the three dimensional modeling software in .stl format for use by the Authoring Tool. Once imported into the Authoring Tool the Base Geometry file will be displayed on the User Interface of the Authoring Tool as is shown in .

After importing the Base Geometry file into the Authoring Tool an Annotated Geometry file should be imported into the Authoring Tool using Import and then Annotated Geometry. The Annotated Geometry file is preferably generated by the same person who generated the Base Geometry file but may be generated by a different person. The Annotated Geometry file format should be a comma tab or whitespace delimited format. An example file is shown in . In this example file each row represents a hole into which the Base Geometry panel i.e. the actual part that will have a fastener inserted into it should ultimately have a fastener inserted. Because the Base Geometry panel is three dimensional each hole in the annotated file should be defined in 3D. In this example file the columns are defined as is shown in the table below.

The Annotated Geometry file should be a comma tab or whitespace delimited and each line should define an object to be displayed. The order of the columns is not particularly important but should be consistent from line to line.

After Import and Annotated Geometry is selected the user should be prompted to enter the delimiter type that is used in the file as shown in . The example is a tab delimited file so the user would select Tab and then Next . The user should then see the screen shown in . In this screen the user should define the column location for the hole ID and fastener part of the three dimensional workpiece object or part being assembled or manufactured. In this example these are located in columns 1 and 2 of the file respectively. This information should be entered using a drop list marked Column located next to the ID and fastener part label on the screen in . The user should set this drop list to the correct value that reflects the column location for each of these items.

Additional fields may be supplied as are shown in to specify optional information that the user may have included in the Annotated Geometry file. The optional fields can be activated for example by selecting the checkbox next to tag or . When checked the Column and User label field should become active. As before the user should then specify the column in which this optional data should be located by setting the drop list to the appropriate column value. The user should also specify the User Label to be used when this data is displayed. If this data is to be used by the Authoring Tool as a default value for a fastener length or other variable the Default Measured Value check box should be selected. This indicates to the Authoring Tool that the specified column contains a default value that should be used for the specified item unless it is overridden by a measured value. When the user has supplied all of the necessary information on the Next button should be selected.

The screen in should be displayed next and allows the user to specify how the Annotated Geometry should be displayed. The user should select one of the options available within the Symbol Type area of the screen by selecting the push button next to the desired symbol type. Preferably only one selection is allowed. The user also has an ability to select the color that should be used when displaying the symbol and whether the symbol should be filled with color by selecting the Fill checkbox or whether it should be outlined by leaving the Fill checkbox unchecked. The Fill option should have no effect upon Lines Segmented Lines or Cal Points. Once the user specifies the Symbol Type and the color the Next button should be selected.

At this point the screen in should be displayed. The user may use this screen to specify the columns that the x y and z position data for the hole are located in. As in the previous screen the user should select the column location using the drop lists that correspond to each position variable on the Position frame of the window in . The user should also specify the column location for the normal vector of the hole on the Normal frame of this same window. The user should also have an option of specifying if the 3D data should be displayed in a 2D plane. If the X Y Plane option is selected all points should be projected onto an XY plane. If the Y Z Plane option is selected all points should be projected onto an YZ plane. If the X Z Plane option is selected all points should be projected on the XZ plane. The user can also specify an offset for the plane which should indicate that the selected Plane will be offset from its zeroed location by the amount entered into the Plane Offset text field. Once the user has entered all of the data for each required field the Finish button can be selected. This should finish the Annotated Geometry input and pull all of the data into the Authoring Tool and the User Interface for such software should be displayed.

All of the data import screens that are illustrated in and preferably have a Cancel button located on them. If a user selects this button the import operation should be canceled and the window should close. In and the user has an option of selecting a Back button which should close the current screen and take the user back to the previous screen. At that point the user should be able to change the selections if needed before proceeding forward.

At this point the screen shown in should be shown which is typically the main User Interface screen of the Authoring Tool. The Base Geometry should be shown with the Annotated data displayed over the top of it. At this point the user should now be able to start to enter a plurality of process frames that are needed or desired to perform a particular assembly manufacture or other process.

Along the left hand side of the User Interface of the Authoring Tool there is a framed panel called Processes. By right or other clicking a mouse in this window the user is able to add a process frame to an assembly process being created. Preferably there are five types of process frames that can be added as follows i Information ii Calibration iii Tweak iv Measurement and v Installation. Multiple frames of each type preferably can be added. A description of the purpose of each frame type follows below while details of the actual usage of each frame will be discussed in the Operator Assembly Tool sections.

The Information frame should prompt the end user running an assembly manufacturing or other process to enter a wide variety of desired information about a workpiece of other three dimensional object that is being assembled otherwise manufactured or processed. For example if a vertical tail for an aircraft is being assembled information such as the aircraft vertical tail serial or other number and assembly information for the object such as date and the like may be entered. This information may be used for example for creating a log preferably of all of the objects that are made whenever a final assembly process is executed using the Operator Assembly Tool.

The Calibration frame may be used to specify the calibration points that are used to perform the software alignment of the imported data so that the projected image of the annotated points correctly line up with the actual points on the projection surface. Preferably a plurality of calibration points are employed for performing a successful calibration with a minimum of eight calibration points being more preferred. The number of calibration points that should be employed may vary be smaller or larger in accordance with a complexity of a 3D projection surface being employed. Calibration points should be chosen so that they are spread out over the entire surface of the object and are not all concentrated in one area. These points should also be selected so that they are not all linear and they should be chosen in such a way as to ensure that depth of the object is adequately covered. Thus on relatively complex surfaces it is entirely possible to have 20 or more calibration points. Typically the more points that are selected the better the calibration will be. Care should be taken to select an appropriate number of calibration points which may readily be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. The actual calibration step which is preferably performed in the Operator Assembly Tool discussed hereinbelow will preferably finish by displaying all of the annotated points after they have been calibrated. At that point if these points align with the actual points satisfactorily then a suitable number of points have been selected. If they do not it may be necessary to come back to the User Interface of the Authoring Tool and select additional calibration points.

The Tweak frame will preferably allow the end user using the Operator Assembly Tool to perform relatively minor adjustments to the projected image by shifting it up down or left right in order to align the projected image of the annotated points to line up with the actual points on the projection surface. The reason that this may be required is that a part locator that is used to hold a part in front of the projector s does not always index in the exact same location each time.

The Measurement Frame is preferably used to guide the user in the measurement process. This frame contains the information regarding which holes should be measured. The holes which require measurement will be identified in this frame for later use in the Operator Tool discussed hereinbelow .

The Final Process frame that is preferably available for use is an Installation Frame. This frame preferably uses data that is collected in the measurement process to guide the user through the installation of the appropriate fasteners.

Along the top of the User Interface of the Authoring Tool is preferably a plurality of buttons including various icons. These buttons preferably provide shortcuts and or additional functionality for the user. The first one shown is the standard File Open windows icon which should display the standard Windows file open dialog box used to open files stored on a disk or otherwise . The second one preferably is a standard Windows save file icon which appears as a computer floppy disk or otherwise . This should save the contents of the currently opened file to disk or otherwise when selected. The third button whose icon preferably is the xyz axis with a part displayed is for showing the geometry screen in the User Interface of the Authoring Tool. The fourth button should display a work instructions screen when selected. The fifth button should display a video screen while the sixth button should display the user interface.

The following nineteen buttons shown in the User Interface of the Authoring Tool are drawing related buttons. The first of these buttons which is shown as the 7button in the row preferably is the standard Windows pointer button which when selected will change the cursor back to the standard Windows arrow shaped pointer used for selecting items on the screen. The second of these buttons the 8th button shown preferably will allow the user to draw a line on the screen where the geometry is displayed. The next two buttons 9and 10buttons shown preferably will draw an outlined and filled rectangle. The following two buttons the 11and 12buttons shown preferably will draw an outlined and filled circle. An outlined or filled triangle preferably is drawn using the next two buttons 13and 14buttons shown and the following two buttons 15and 16buttons shown preferably draw an outlined and filled diamond. The following two buttons 17and 18buttons shown preferably draw outlined and filled hexagons while the following two buttons 19and 20buttons shown preferably draw an outlined and filled polygon.

Additional items that may be placed on the projection surface are preferably made available as buttons next to the shape drawing buttons. For example the 21button shown preferably allows the user to place an image onto the geometric surface and the 22button shown preferably allows a user to place a video onto any one or more of the display screens that are connected with the computer s . The video can for example be placed on the projector screen to get projected onto the object or onto one or more monitor screens. This may be performed by adding the video using this button to one of the frames. When the displays are assigned in the Configurator Assembly Tool discussed below the video will be shown on whatever display was assigned. Usually the Work Instruction or User Interface are assigned to one of the computer monitor displays. Text preferably can be placed onto the projection surface by selecting the 23button shown and calibration points are preferably placed on the projection surface using the 24button shown. A point shape preferably can be placed onto the projection surface using the 25button shown.

The properties for some or all of the foregoing items preferably can be changed once they have been placed onto the projection surface by using for example an Appearance window which in is located in the lower left corner of the User Interface of the Authoring Tool. Parameters that preferably can be changed include fill color text filenames for images video and or the like.

The next seven buttons that are shown in preferably allow the user to choose to display the base geometry on the User Interface of the Authoring Tool. When displayed using for example the first six of these buttons the image is preferably displayed as a 3D object. The first of these buttons the 26in the row shown preferably displays the object as if the user is looking at it from the front. The next button the 27in the row shown preferably displays the object as if viewed from the back. The next button the 28in the row shown preferably shows a view of the object from the right and the next button shown the 29th in the row shown preferably shows a view of the object from the left. Top and bottom 3D views are preferably shown using the next two buttons the 30and 31buttons respectively. The next button 32nd shown preferably displays the 3D object in 2D collapsing it onto a flat plane along the Z Axis.

Along the top of the User Interface of the Authoring Tool preferably are a series of menu options as is shown in . The first menu preferably is the standard Windows File menu which when selected preferably allows the user to perform one or more and preferably all of the following standard set of operations 

The next menu that is preferably available to the user is the Import menu which preferably allows the user to perform one or more and preferably all of the following Import operations 

The following Selection menu option preferably allows the user to identify which of a following list of objects are selectable when they are present on the projection screen. These objects can be placed on the Base Geometry as described using the drawing buttons. Preferably all objects are selectable by default and selection can be disabled by un checking the objects below on the Selection Menu 

The next menu option preferably is Blanking . This menu option preferably give the user an ability to hide i.e. not display the same set of objects that are listed under the Selection menu option. All of these objects preferably are not blanked by default. To blank them the user preferably checks the box to the left of the desired item in the menu.

The next menu option preferably is the standard Windows Help menu which preferably provides the user with one or more and preferably all of the following menu options 

The following menu option is the Simulation option . When selected this screen preferably displays a simulated screen of how the currently selected frame will look in the Operator tool discussed below .

While as is discussed hereinabove there are only five different choices in the Processes frame of the preferred embodiment of the Authoring Tool Info Calibration Tweak Measurement and Install a user of the system may have numerous measurement steps numerous install steps and the like. Thus if a user is employing this system to assemble a vertical stabilizer for an airplane for example the user could make a set of frames that cover those ordered steps that are required for assembling the top half of the vertical stabilizer preferably in the best manner and another set of frames that cover those ordered steps that are required for assembling the bottom half of the stabilizer also preferably in the best manner . Then using the Configurator tool the user could make an assembly process that is for the top of the vertical stabilizer only or make an assembly process that is for the bottom of the vertical stabilizer only or make an assembly process that is for both the top and the bottom of the vertical stabilizer. All of this could be achieved by the user using only the two sets of frames that were originally created in the Authoring tool. In this manner a user can make an assembly process for any object any part thereof or any portion or area of such object or part top portion bottom portion side left or right portion center portion and or the like .

To start the user launches the Configurator Tool by selecting on the main computer screen Start and then All Programs and then Configurator Tool or by using a desktop short cut .

The User Interface for the Configurator Tool show in contains only one menu option along the top of the screen which is File. When the user selects File the user will be provided with four choices by this menu option 

The Open Process Group choice allows a user to open a Process Group file that has been created and exported using the Authoring Tool.

The Publish Process Group choice allows a user to Publish a completed assembly or other process in the form of a file . The resulting published file contains all of the necessary ordered steps that are required to assemble an object or part and can be used by the Operator Tool as is discussed hereinbelow .

The Edit Published File choice provides a user with an option to edit a previously published Process. Changes made to the processed file typically do not get migrated back into the original file that was exported by the Authoring Tool. In order for changes to be included in this original file the user should edit the original exported file using the User Interface of the Configurator and re publish the completed process.

The Exit choice performs a normal Windows style of software exit and terminates the User Interface of the Configurator.

As is shown in four of the main frames that are present on the User Interface of the Configurator are 

The Processes frame located in the upper left area of the User Interface is used to build an assembly or other manufacturing or other process for a particular assembly manufacture or other processing of a particular workpiece object or part using the Process Frames created in the Authoring Tool. When the user clicks on File and then Open Process Group the file exported by the Authoring Tool is then read into the Configurator Tool. All of the frames that were added in the Authoring Tool will typically then be displayed in the Processes frame.

The user should now decide i what order the assembly or other process steps for the workpiece or other object being assembled or processed should follow see Operator Process Steps and ii the particular information that it should contain see Process Elements . Typically an assembly or manufacturing process a sequence of steps in order contains at a minimum the following information Calibration Tweak Measure and Install steps. There are types of steps that can be added in the Authoring Tool Information. Calibration Tweak Measurement and Install. These steps are created inside the Authoring Tool. A user can add as many of these steps as is desired in the Authoring Tool and then only select and use the ones that the user wants when building the Assembly Process in the Configuration Tool. 

To begin to construct the particular assembly or other process series of steps in order the user should select the Add Step button along the bottom of the Operator Process Steps frame on the User Interface of the Configurator Tool. This should result in a step being added to the Operator Process Steps frame. The user should now select for example using a mouse the first frame step to use in the assembly or other process. This frame is then assigned to a step by selecting the desired step in the Operator Process Steps frame and clicking the Copy to Step button between the Process Elements and Operator Process Steps frames. This should copy this process frame to the selected step. If one or a plurality of additional steps are needed or desired the Add Step button should be used to add the next step or the user can right click on Add Step . The user should continue to add steps and assign Process Element frames to these steps until the full assembly or other process all steps in order is complete. The final assembly or other process when executed using the Operator Tool will then execute the steps in the order that they are in on the Operator Process Steps frame.

If needed the user can delete one or a plurality of steps by clicking on the step to be deleted and then selecting the Delete button under the Operator Process Steps frame or by right clicking on Delete . This will remove the step from the Operator Process Steps frame.

Once all of the assembly manufacturing or other process steps have been created and ordered in the Operator Process Steps frame if one or more measurement apparatuses of the invention or otherwise such as one of the grip gages that are discussed herein is going to be employed during the object assembly manufacturing or other process the user should now create one or a plurality of measurement gages in the Gages frame of the User Interface of the Configurator Tool. This can generally be accomplished by selecting the Add button on the Gages frame. The user will then generally be presented with a window used to select a type of gage to add such as a Serial Port gage a USB gage or some other type of a gage. The type of gage selected by the user should match the physical gage that is to be used with the system if one will be used . Further the number of gauges created using the Add button must generally also match the total number of gages that will be used with the system.

Once gages have been added the user should configure the Views that will be used for the particular assembly manufacturing or other process being employed define which graphics output or other part s present on the computer monitor s that the Work Instructions Videos User Interface optical projector s and or the like will be assigned to and or displayed . The graphics output ports may include video card outputs USB ports for video output or the like. This will depend upon the number of optical projectors and computer monitors that are being employed in a particular assembly manufacturing or other process and can be accomplished using the Views frame located in the lower middle area of the User Interface of the Configurator Tool. On the Views frame the user will typically be presented with four items 

To configure which graphics output ports that each of the four above items is assigned to the user should select each one one at a time and then use the Display property located to the right on the Properties frame. This Display property will typically show all of the available graphics output port numbers that can be used in connection with a particular assembly manufacturing or other system depending upon the number of computer monitors and optical projectors that are being employed . Typically for a system using one computer monitor and one optical projector the Work Instructions. Videos and User Interface will be assigned to display number 0 and the Projector will be assigned to display number 1. If more than one projector is needed on the system for each additional projector the user should select Add Projector which will add a projector to the Views list. The user should then select this newly added projector and assign it to one of the unused Displays. For example for a computer that is configured to have up to eight graphics output ports a total of eight optical projectors and monitors may be employed with the computer as follows 

However depending upon the number of graphics card slots that are available inside of the computer additional graphics cards could be added with the upper limit presently only resulting from a Microsoft Windows limitation.

Each time a user assigns a Display value to a View the monitor s and projector s will have their graphics port value s displayed on the Control Panel screen present on the monitor s or projector s for example as a giant 1 2 3 or the like across the entire screen so that the user can verify that the Display value that they assigned is indeed the correct one. If the Projector is set to display 0 and the number 0 gets displayed on the computer monitor s then the user should change the Projector to display 1. If set incorrectly the images that should be sent to the optical projector for projection onto the assembly object will be displayed on the computer monitor instead.

After the user is satisfied that all of the required assembly manufacturing or other steps have been created and created in the correct order all required gages have been added and the necessary Views have been properly assigned the user can now Publish this process by selecting File at the top of the User Interface of the Configurator Tool and then Publish Process. This will typically create the file that will be used by the Operator Tool to guide the particular assembly process. The user can now exit the User Interface by selecting File and then Exit. 

Control Buttons along the bottom of the User Interface screen allow the user to display work Instructions and videos print the measured fastener information or proceed to the next step by selecting instructions. Print Video or Next respectively.

To start the user launches the Operator Tool by selecting on the main computer screen Start and then All Programs and then Operator Tool or by using a desktop short cut . Once the User Interface appears on the computer screen the user will use the menu option File and then Select Process to open the desired assembly manufacturing or other process file out of the typically more than one or many process files present that was published in the Configurator Tool. Once the file has been opened a screen similar to the one shown in will be displayed on the main computer monitor.

At this point the user should enter the information being displayed on the info Frame in the User Interface . For example the tail number for the aircraft and the serial number for the part being assembled part of the aircraft tail are entered in the text fields shown in . Once entered the user should select the Next button to proceed to the next step.

The user will now be presented with a Cal Frame as is shown in which will show all of the points calibration points and non calibration points that will be projected onto the object or part being assembled manufactured or otherwise processed as is also shown in . In the red points indicate calibration points and the yellow points indicate non calibration points. One of the calibration points will generally be flashing on off about once each second. The user will now guide the mouse crosshair plus sign over the object or part thereof being assembled manufactured or processed until the crosshair is directly over the pre drilled hole in the object that corresponds to the flashing point on the screen. At this point the user will click the left mouse button and the next calibration point will begin flashing on the screen. The user will align the crosshair over the next hole in the object or part thereof being assembled manufactured or processed and depress the left mouse button again. These steps will be repeated until there are no longer any flashing red calibration points being displayed on the computer screen. The Next button will then become enabled and the user will select it. This will bring up the Tweak screen shown in .

The system software will use the data collected in the calibration step to calibrate the Annotated Geometry and then display it onto the projected surface. By calibrating the Annotated Geometry using this data the system software adjusts the original Annotated Geometry to compensate for distortions caused by imperfections in the projector lens and the location of the part relative to the projector. The system takes into account the particular orientation of the object being assembled manufactured or processed which is determined by the calibration point mouse clicks that are described in the preceding paragraph and adjusts the internal datasets to compensate for how the object is oriented with respect to the optical projector s . The orientation of the object or part being assembled manufactured or processed versus the optical projector needs to be quantified so that the three dimensional image can be adjusted in the system software to compensate for the fact that the optical projector s may not be pointing directly at the object. An example is the projectors that are typically employed in conference rooms. These projectors only project a proper image when pointed normal perpendicular to a surface. If they are off to one side the image on the screen becomes distorted. The system software of the present invention determines where the projector is with respect to the screen during the calibration step and adjusts the image. Thus the system software distorts the image in a manner that when it is projected by the projector it appears in an undistorted manner on the object or part being assembled or otherwise manufactured.

In addition the system calibrates out the effects of any distortions in the projector lens at this time. The distortions are caused by imperfections in the projector lens which occur during the manufacturing process. Examples of imperfections would be the shape of the lens which may vary from lens to lens misalignments between the lens and the area in the projector generating the image swirling or bubbles in the glass used to make the lens scratches and the like.

The calibrated data sets of all of the fastener hole locations will now be projected as yellow circles onto the object being assembled or manufactured or part thereof as is shown in . When the user is finished calibrating and proceeds to the next step these points will be displayed. So it is a result of the user leaving the calibration step that causes this to occur. If a sufficient number of calibration points were chosen using the Authoring Tool the projected yellow circles should line up directly over the pre drilled or other holes in the object or part thereof being assembled as is shown in a vertical stabilizer tail of an F22 aircraft . If on the other hand the alignment is not sufficient i.e. the projected yellow circles and the holes do not line up closely or exactly the calibration step in the Operator Tool should be re run. If the alignment is still not sufficient then the user should go back to the Authoring Tool and add additional calibration points to the calibration step.

Once the calibrated points data sets are projected onto and displayed on the object or part thereof being assembled or otherwise manufactured as shown in minor adjustments can be made to the left right and up down location of the points. These adjustments are made to ALL the points by selecting the appropriate button on the screen in which corresponds to the direction the points need to be moved left right up or down . The center button in removes any manual adjustments that have been made and places all of the projected points back to the original calibrated position. Once the user is satisfied with the alignment of the calibrated points and the actual fastener holes in the object or part thereof being assembled the Next button should be selected to proceed to the next step.

At this point in the process the Measure Frame screen will be displayed in the User Interface. Since all of the data required by the user will be projected onto the object being assembled this frame on the User Interface screen will have no information displayed thereon as shown in . However there will be a starburst pattern as is shown in displayed on the object in the location of the first hole that needs to be measured using an input or measurement device of the invention or otherwise such as a grip gage or other measurement apparatus as is shown for example in and . The user will take the measurement apparatus and place it into the hole that is illuminated by the starburst pattern as shown in so that the 3 feet are in contact with the objects surface. There are three blunt points that are located near the tip of the grip gage. The feet are preferably spaced an equal distance apart around the grip gun s tip. There is a long probe that is preferably about 1.5 inches long with a blunt hook on the end that goes through the hole and out the back of the hole. The user squeezes the handle of the gun until the hook on the probe is pulled inward and contacts a surface present on the back of the object. Once the handle clicks. the computer reads the circuitry inside the gun to get a thickness reading. If the thickness reading is within the tolerance band the starburst patter advances to the next hole and the gun is moved to that location to measure the skin thickness fastener length . If the measurement was out of tolerance the starburst turns red and does not advance. The user can then push the yellow button or similar structure on the measuring apparatus to repeat the measurement or can press the red button or similar structure not visible but just like the yellow one on the other side of the gun to advance to the next hole. If the user chooses this the hole that was out of tolerance it kept track of by the optical projection assembly system so the user can view all out of tolerance holes at a subsequent time when the user goes to insert or install fasteners into the predrilled or other holes present in the object being assembled. This preferably happens automatically when the user selects the red button on the measuring apparatus and this data is stored internally by the system software or by other computer software .

Once the last hole in the object being assembled or part thereof has been measured using the measuring apparatus or other measurement or input device the Next button on the User Interface of the Operator Tool will become enabled. The user will then select the Next button and the User Interface will now display the Install Frame screen as is shown in .

Preferably listed in the Install Frame screen are the part numbers and quantities for each type of fastener that needs to be installed into pre drilled or other holes present in the object being assembled or otherwise manufactured or part thereof . The part number for the first type of fastener that needs to be installed into the object will also preferably be projected onto the object. In addition each hole currently being displayed that requires one of these fasteners will preferably be illuminated with a yellow circle. The user or another user or worker will now preferably retrieve the required fasteners for example from a parts bin along with their corresponding nuts and manually install these fasteners into all of the illuminated holes. Once all of the illuminated holes have fasteners installed in them the user will preferably select using the mouse the next fastener on the list shown on the User Interface screen in . The user will now preferably repeat the installation process for all these fasteners and so forth.

When all of the fasteners have been installed into the holes present in the object or part the assembly is complete. The user can now exit the Operator Tool by using the File and Exit menu option on the User Interface. The assembled object can be removed from an assembly jig and replaced with the next three dimensional object needing fasteners to be installed therein the same type of object and the user can simply re run the Operator Tool using the corresponding process file. For the next three dimensional object being assembled and all subsequent three dimensional objects of the same type none of the steps prior to the use of the Operator Tool need to be performed as the computer is already all set up and has all required data for the assembly entered therein. As a result and very advantageously the time and labor that are required to perform a second third fourth fifth and subsequent assembly processes of the same object becomes greatly reduced typically by at least about 10 and often by at least about 20 and sometimes by at least about 30 whether being performed by the same user or a new user.

Using the detailed teachings resources and other information that are provided herein those of ordinary skill in the art may readily purchase and or write various computer software programs that function in the manners that are described herein and may properly install them in a computer to produce the measuring apparatuses optical projection assembly systems and other systems of the present invention and to carry out the methods of the present invention.

The optical projection assembly systems of the invention may be operated by a user using the step by step process that is described below which includes all of the steps that the user may need to take in order to create and run a project. The user creates a project by using the Authoring Tool to create assembly manufacturing or other frames by importing the Base Geometry and Annotated Geometry as well as using the Configurator Tool to place the assembly manufacturing or other steps in order as well as assign all the projectors and monitors employed to appropriate or desired graphics ports. The user runs a project by taking the output from the Configurator Tool and using it generally over and over again in the Operator Tool to assemble object parts. 

The following is a step by step description for the set up process that is preferably employed in connection with the optical projection assembly systems and methods of the invention. The steps that are described may be performed in any suitable order and or manner which may be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. Steps that are optional are indicated.

Detailed instructions regarding the operation of the optical projection assembly systems of the invention which preferably include a use of three different assembly software tools Authoring Tool Configurator Tool and Operator Tool have already been described hereinabove. However a specific example of operation is described below in connection with taking grip measurements in pre drilled holes present in the skin of a vertical stabilizer a part of an aircraft using the measurement apparatuses of the invention referred to below as grip gun. .

Grip measurements may be made for example in thousands of pre drilled holes that are present in the skin of a vertical stabilizer and then the correct size fasteners out of thousands of different sizes and types may be inserted therein to properly attach the skin to one or more different components of the vertical stabilizer using the systems and methods of the invention in the following manner. After the system is properly set up using the Authoring Tool Configurator Tool and Operator Tool in the manner described herein for this particular manufacturing process of producing aircraft vertical stabilizers including having a plurality of assembly steps properly ordered for such process an operator clicks a button on the User Interface of the Operator Tool and begins the assembly process created in the Configuration Tool ordered step by step instructions . The operator will first calibrate the system. To do this the individual calibration points are shown as a flashing red dot one at a time on the main computer monitor screen. At this point the user uses his mouse or some other calibration method to place the mouse cursor crosshair over the actual hole in the vertical stabilizer skin. He then clicks the mouse to record the location of this point. The operator proceeds in the same manner for all the calibration points. Once all points are completed the annotated geometry is calibrated using all the data collected from each calibration point. All of the information that is required to perform a first assembly step of the vertical stabilizer taking grip measurements in pre drilled holes of its skin in this example is then rapidly virtually immediately projected as text image and or symbol data sets onto the surface s of the three dimensional vertical stabilizer such as a starburst yellow pattern projected onto a first pre drilled hole to be measured as is shown in . An assembly technician can then insert a grip gun into this first pre drilled hole as is shown in and the hole depth data is then transmitted back to and recorded by a computer that is operably connected with the grip gun and with one or more optical projectors. After the first pre drilled hole is measured a yellow starburst pattern will automatically then be projected onto the next pre drilled hole to be measured. This process is continued until all of the pre drilled holes on the vertical stabilizer skin are measured at which time the system provides a complete parts list such as a list of a variety of different fasteners that should be inserted into the pre drilled holes possibly out of thousands of different fasteners to properly fasten the vertical stabilizer skin to another component of the vertical stabilizer. The system then displays via optical projection a symbol on all of those pre drilled holes in the vertical stabilizer skin that require the same type and length of fastener i.e. the same fastener part number as is shown in or a plurality of such symbols for different required types and lengths of fasteners. The system may for example display 2 3 4 or more such symbols for 2 3 4 or more different types and lengths of fasteners i.e. three other fastener part numbers preferably all in different colors permitting 2 3 4 or more different assembly technicians to work at the same time on the vertical stabilizer skin but at different locations on the skin and with different sized holes and different fasteners. For example one technician could work with a series of holes that all required fastener 1 and all such holes could be illuminated on the vertical stabilizer skin in the color blue along with that fastener part number. A second technician could work with a series of holes that all required fastener 2 and all such holes could be illuminated on the vertical stabilizer skin in the color red along with that fastener part number. A third technician could work with a series of holes that all required fastener 3 and all such holes could be illuminated on the vertical stabilizer in the color yellow along with the fastener part number. A fourth technician could work with a series of holes that all requited fastener 4 and all such holes could be illuminated on the vertical stabilizer skin in the color green along with the fastener part number. The various assembly technicians could then proceed to insert the correct fasteners into the series of pre drilled holes that they are working with to attach the vertical stabilizer skin to one or more other parts of the vertical stabilizer being manufactured. Once this step of the assembly process is completed all of the information that is required to perform a second assembly step for a manufacture of the vertical stabilizer could then be projected onto the vertical stabilizer skin or onto some other part thereof. Then at some subsequent step in the manufacturing process a completed vertical stabilizer could be attached to the rest of the aircraft being manufactured.

Preferred embodiments of the wired and wireless and retraction or plunge style measurement apparatuses of the invention are illustrated in and with illustrating one type of Ethernet cable that may be employed to operably connect one or a plurality of such apparatuses with one or a plurality of computers and and showing exploded views of various portions of these apparatuses. and A B C A and B show layouts of microprocessor boards that may be included internally in such apparatuses which are available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as Delta Sigma Corporation Kennesaw Ga. .

Referring to the drawings the measurement apparatuses that are depicted in and are wired or wireless hand held devices in either a retraction or plunge style that function to perform high precision thickness measurements on various skins and other materials for the purpose of quality assurance as well as for determining fastener hole diameter hole depth countersink depth fastener length and or other measurements. The apparatuses very advantageously provide a single squeeze or trigger motion that will align normal to the surface being measured and then perform the measurement with the resulting measurement data transferred to one or a plurality of computers and or other data collection devices for recording storage manipulation and or some other use. They may have additional switches that allow the apparatuses to become active input devices to a computer program like a keyboard in order to facilitate automated measurements. The apparatuses transfer data to one or more of the computers and or other data collection devices via a wired or wireless connection. This data is read by the microprocessor that is present inside of the apparatus using an optical encoder card and linear strip scale that are also present therein. This linear strip is a linear scale in which the divisions are uniformly spaced along its length and are readable by the optical encoder. The linear strip scale that is shown in for example has 500 divisions on it and the optical encoder card present therein reads 4 counts per division. Therefore each count that the optical encoder card reads is equivalent to 1 2000of an inch giving this measurement apparatus a very high degree of accuracy. However any of a wide variety of other divisions could also be employed. As the handle of a retraction type measurement apparatus is squeezed the linear scale moves past the optical encoder card and this optical encoder card counts the tick marks on the linear scale. The apparatus may be employed in a similar manner to measure countersink depth and or hole diameter. One apparatus may for example include three different removable heads for the probe one for taking hole depth measurements one for taking countersink depth measurements and one for taking hole diameter measurements or may include any combination thereof or additional probe heads.

The operable connection between the apparatus and the computer can be USB Serial Ethernet Power over Ethernet POA wireless or any other means that is suitable for providing a data connection between the computer and the measurement apparatus. In the exploded view of the apparatus that is shown in this connection is an Ethernet connection.

The measurement apparatus also provides users with a way to repeat a gripping measurement and or other measurements and or advance to the next measurement for example to a next hole to be measured. This is performed via a use of the membrane key switches buttons or the like hereinafter referred to as buttons on the side of the apparatus as are shown in or elsewhere top bottom or the like . There are 2 arrows on this keyboard but may be fewer or a plurality thereof. When the left arrow forward arrow or the like is selected by a user the apparatus advances to the next measurement location for example as may be projected onto an object including the measurement location by the optical projection system that is described herein. When the right arrow back arrow or the like is selected this allows the apparatus to re measure the last location or hole that was measured.

The measurement apparatus also provides a method used to perform a calibration of the apparatus. Prior to making a measurement with the measurement apparatus a calibration to a reference plane must typically be made. A calibration device that is a known entity and manufactured to very high precision such as the calibration puck that is shown in may be placed in or with the probe such that the probe body rests upon the reference plane of the calibration device and the probe tip is moved into position via a triggering handle or other activating mechanism in the normal way that the measurement apparatus operates. A momentary contact switch or button present on the side or other area of the device which is preferably labeled calibrate may be briefly or otherwise depressed and the measurement apparatus becomes calibrated.

A calibration disk or puck for example which is shown in may be inserted between the ball point ball pad or other feet and the probe tip shown or at any other desired location or otherwise . The handle of a retraction style of measurement apparatus is squeezed until the calibration disc is held firmly in place and then a calibration membrane key button or the like is pressed. This calibrates the apparatus to the known thickness measurement of the calibration disk. Calibration disks are commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art for example from Delta Sigma Corporation Kennesaw Ga. .

The calibration is a recording of the location of a reader head that is present on an optical encoder card along an etched rail as is described hereinbelow in detail at the moment of the calibration trigger. Host computer software then subtracts this value from the measured position for all subsequent measurements. All measurements from that point on until the measurement apparatus is powered down or off or disconnected from a network will measure the accurate dimension in absolute terms current position minus calibration position . The calibration software for the measurement apparatuses may reside in a host computer s to which it is attached and not inside of the measurement apparatus itself. Therefore if the measurement apparatus is moved between computers a recalibration will typically be necessary. Alternatively the calibration software may reside in the firmware and be processed on the digital circuit card before being transmitted.

Referring now to which show various preferred measurement apparatuses of the invention and exploded views of portions thereof the main structural component of these measurement apparatuses is a frame which establishes a reference system for the measurement apparatus and is preferably located internally and centrally therein. Such frame is present in the measurement apparatus shown in non exploded view and exploded view of same measurement apparatus which is a wireless measurement apparatus of a retraction type or style in the measurement apparatus shown in which is a non wireless Ethernet or Power over Ethernet measurement apparatus of a retraction type or style and in the measurement apparatus shown in which is a wireless measurement apparatus of a plunge type or style which is discussed in detail hereinbelow. The frame is preferably attached centrally to a housing which preferably comprises a plurality of parts and preferably two similar or substantially similar main parts a left hand outer body on one side thereof and a right hand outer body on the other side thereof using means for affixing the same together such as a plurality of fasteners welding pressure pinning riveting epoxies or other adhesives gluing chemical bonding heat sealing or other methods and or devices known by those having ordinary skill in the art. Preferably ten screws are employed.

A reader head not shown that is present on an optical encoder card is preferably rigidly attached to the frame using a plurality of fasteners or other methods or means for doing so and functions to read measurements that are made by the measurement apparatuses by reading one or a plurality of graduations that are present on a linear scale strip each time that a measurement is made. The reader head preferably remains in a fixed position relative to the material skin or three dimensional object or part thereof being measured at all times in all cases. The linear scale strip is a device that is capable of making a plurality of highly accurate linear measurements. The linear strip scale which is preferably mechanically coupled to the movable part of the probe i.e. the tip is typically either pushed in a direction towards the facing surface of the material skin three dimensional object or part thereof being measured or worked on in the case of a plunge type measurement for plunge type measurement apparatuses or pulled towards the back surface thereof such as a surface that is adjacent with a far end of a fastener hole being measured in the case of a retraction type of measurement for a retraction type of measurement apparatus . The reader head the linear scale strip and the optical encoder card are commercially available from sources that are described herein or are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as U.S. Digital Vancouver Wash. . Although resolutions of less than about one micron can be achieved using the linear strip scale a resolution of from about 1 to about 1 000 microns is typical. An optical encoder card or cable is preferably soldered or otherwise joined for example by fastening onto a read head which connects the linear strip scale signal paths to an internal digital circuit or controller card for wireless versions of the measurement apparatuses positioned between the left hand outer body and the frame as is shown in . As is discussed hereinbelow a Power Over Ethernet POE circuit card is used in place of the digital circuit or controller card for measurement apparatuses that are not wireless. The optical encoder card is a set of a plurality of conductors that function to move the signals from one side or area of the measurement apparatus to another other. The digital circuit or controller card which is illustrated schematically in B and C is used to process the data and or information resulting or procured from one or a plurality of measurements or other activities performed by the measurement apparatuses and transmit or otherwise transfer them to one or a plurality of computers and or data collection devices for recording storage manipulation and or some other type of a use as is discussed herein. The digital circuit or controller card may be mounted or securely affixed to a side or area of the frame such as a side at its aft end as is shown in or a side in a central area as is shown in with one or a plurality of fasteners. shows a set of four screws being used for this purpose as well as a series of corresponding insulating spacers that function to electrically isolate circuit card from the mechanical structure.

Bushings and or sleeve bearings or other similarly functioning components that are preferable press fit but may be otherwise preferably positioned internally at or near the forward end and the aft end of the frame provide preferably precision passage for a slidable or otherwise moveable shaft partially or fully through the frame in a forward manner towards the forward end of the measurement apparatus and or in a backwards manner towards the aft end of the measurement apparatus preferably both and at or near a central area of the frame .

The measurement apparatuses include a removably attached or other probe including a body A A A and preferably extending outwardly from the forward end of the frame centrally or substantially centrally which preferably remains stationary and establishes a reference plane from which a measurement is taken. The probe and body may be present in any one or more of several different forms as is shown in and may be specific to a particular measurement application that is to be performed by an operator with the measurement apparatus . The probe and body are both preferably relatively long the length of which may vary widely and may be any length desired or required for a particular application. The probe preferably ranges from about 1 to about 10 inches in length and more preferably ranges from about 1 to about 4 inches in length and more preferably is about 1.5 inches in length. As is shown in FIGS. and the body of the probe often includes one or a plurality of ball pads forming a part of the probe body or affixed to it preferably located at its forward end or between its forward end or tip and its aft end and preferably centrally or substantially centrally. The ball pads are preferably spaced an equidistant apart from each other but may be spaced in any other manner desired or required and that may come into contact with or rest upon and become normalized with one or a plurality of exteriors or other surfaces of a workpiece or other three dimensional object or part thereof . The ball pads may be selected specifically for a particular application but are commonly hemispheres or any other desired shape and or size that function to provide a steady reliable plane for a measurement when resting on a surface of a three dimensional or other object. show a variety of different styles of removably attached bodies and probe tips that may be employed with the measurement apparatuses and which are interchangeable i.e. each of the different bodies and others and tips and others may be removably attached to the foreward end or other portion of the measurement apparatuses thereby enabling an operator to make a variety of different types of fastener hole thickness grip length or other measurements using the same measurement apparatus wired wireless retraction style plunge style and or the like with different probes bodies and others and tips and others . The probe and tip thereof act as an interface to a surface material workpiece or three dimensional object or part thereof being measured so that a variety of different types of measurements can be made using one common device. shows a body having three ball pads at its forward end which is typically used to make a variety of different measurements in a variety of different locations as are described herein or otherwise . shows a body style having two ball pads at its forward end which may facilitate making measurements in specific locations having tight or narrow radius surfaces. shows a body having no ball pads which may also facilitate making measurements in specific locations having tight or narrow radius surfaces. shows a tip of a probe that may be employed for example to measure a through hole in a retraction type measurement apparatus configuration. shows a tip of a probe having a plunge style that may be employed for example for measuring holes having a bottom such as a nut plate. shows a tip of a probe having a countersink style that may be employed for example in a plunge type of a configuration to measure the depth of a countersink cut. Other probes bodies and tips and a variety of different types and or styles thereof which may be procured from sources that are described herein or that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art may also be removably affixed to the measurement apparatuses . The tip of the probe typically is movable rather than stationary and functions to make a measurement through on against in or in some other manner interacting with a skin material hole workpiece or other three dimensional object or part thereof to be measured and can be used or designed in various forms that optimize it in connection with a particular application. A selection of a tip having a correct diameter for a particular measurement application is important and may readily be performed by those having ordinary skill in the art using the information and drawings that are provided in great detail herein. The diameter of any tip must generally be smaller than the diameter of a hole or other structure or area into which the tip may be inserted. Some tips have a configuration of a fish hook which can be passed fully through a fastener or other hole and hook onto a surface of a workpiece or other object or part thereof that it adjacent with the rear side of a hole. Further probe and body styles such as those shown in may be used to establish a reference line rather than a reference plane. A reference line is often preferable when measuring surfaces with a significant contour whereas a reference plane is often preferable when the measured area is flat or substantially flat i.e. having little or no contour. The probe and body and other components may be precision machined and removably attached to the forward or other end of the frame of the measurement apparatuses using any of a variety of different means or methods such as using a plurality of fasteners. shows a series of four screws used for this purpose. The forward end or tip of the probe may be pressed by an operator against an object or part or surface thereof to be measured such as partially or fully through a pre drilled fastener hole to make a hole depth countersink depth or diameter measurement or a grip length or thickness measurement. The body is preferably hollow to allow the shaft to slide or otherwise pass or extend partially or fully through its interior centrally or substantially centrally. Various tips or others may be removable attached to the forward or other end of the shaft by means for attaching the two together such as one or a plurality of fasteners or screwing the tips into a threaded end of the shaft . The tip is selected based on the type of measurement desired and may be secured to the shaft using a fastener or other means such as the probe nut shown in .

An internal grip clip or device having a similar function that is preferably employed in the measuring apparatuses of the invention is shown in in exploded views as well as in . This grip clip is preferably located centrally or substantially centrally within the frame and preferably abutting one or a plurality of interior surfaces of the frame such as are present at the forward and lower ends as is shown in . The grip clip slides or otherwise moves in a forwards and or backwards direction whenever a probe tip is retracted drawn in a backwards manner or compressed extended in a forward manner . The displacement between the grip clip and the frame is the desired linear measurement. The grip clip allows the shaft to pass or extend through the frame via a plurality of adjacent pressed fit or other bushings . Two such bushings are shown in . Initially the grip clip and the shaft are preferably tightly coupled to each other as a result of a compression force being applied thereon by an internal compression spring positioned forward of the grip clip as is shown in B B and B . The compression spring has an ability to apply a force preferably ranging from about 1 to about 5 pounds and more preferably ranging from about 2 to about 4 pounds and most preferably about 3 pounds to the grip clip and the shaft which causes them to remain tightly coupled. Compression springs and the various screws sleeve bearings switches inserts and ball pads that are described and or illustrated herein are commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as McMaster Carr Elmhurst Ill. . Unless otherwise indicated all of the other components of the measurement apparatuses that are described and or illustrated herein are commercially available from Delta Sigma Corporation Kennesaw Ga. or from other sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art.

An extension spring is preferably located near adjacent with or substantially adjacent with one side or other area of the frame as is shown in . The extension spring has an ability to apply a force preferably ranging from about 0.5 to about 3 pounds and more preferably ranging from about 0.5 to about 2 pounds and most preferably about 1 pound between the grip clip and the frame which causes the shaft and thus the probe tip to extend outwards in a forward direction from the frame i.e. towards the forward end of the measurement apparatus and thus also causes the shaft and probe tip to do the same. Such an amount of force is preferably less than the amount of force applied to the grip clip and shaft by the compression spring i.e. the amount of force applied by the compression spring to the grip clip and shaft is greater than the amount of force applied by the extension spring to the grip clip . The compression spring should be somewhat stronger and preferably significantly stronger than the extension spring . These two springs and with one being stronger than the other provide a means for making and procuring rapid and accurate measurements and automatic triggering for data transfer from the measurement apparatus to one or a plurality of host or other computers and or data collection devices. When the common grip handle is retracted in the case of a retraction configuration or the probe tip is pushed back in the case of the plunge configuration the weaker extension spring generally always yields first which causes the linear scale strip to pass through the read head of the optical encoder card . When a mechanical interference impedes the movement of the probe tip or this impediment supplies a reactive force that is sufficient to overcome its compressive force of the stronger compression spring to release the actuator on the compression trigger switch . This is an important feature of the measurement apparatuses of the invention and enables an operator to apply an amount of force to the handle area common grip of a retraction type of measurement apparatus or to a plunge end cap in a plunge type of measurement apparatus that is sufficient to overcome the amount of force being applied by the compression spring between the grip clip and the frame . This is a trigger type of action that may be activated by an operator in only one single action and using only one hand and or one or a plurality of fingers on that one hand for example by squeezing it which causes the compression trigger switch to separate from the encoder clip thus initiating the sequence of capturing the linear displacement data and transmitting it to the host computer. When the operator applies such force to the handle area common grip of the measurement apparatus this has an effect of pushing the compression trigger switch discussed in detail below away from the encoder clip also discussed below and trigger screw which in turn causes the measurement apparatus to simultaneously or substantially simultaneously and instantaneously or substantially instantaneously perform all three of the following actions i normalize its probe relative to a surface or hole present in the material skin workpiece or other three dimensional object or part thereof being worked on by the force applied by reacting the extension spring against the outer surface of the same and once the probe tip is mechanically impeded the additional force of the compression spring further aids the operator in normalizing the probe ii make a measurement material thickness fastener hole depth diameter or countersink depth grip length or the like and iii transmit resulting or procured measurement data and or information to one or a plurality or host or other computers and or data collection devices. The above components and forces also function to prevent the measurement apparatuses from mistakenly being activated i.e. being activated when not wanting them to become activated . Extension springs are commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as Lee Spring Greensboro N.C. .

In some embodiments of the measurement apparatuses of the invention such as those shown in and which have a grip or trigger style an operator activates the measurement apparatus to make a measurement by squeezing or otherwise applying pressure to an external common grip preferably located towards the lower portion and aft end of the measurement apparatus which is operably connected with an internal slidable T foot or similarly functioning component affixed to the underside of the bottom of the frame preferably centrally substantially centrally or towards the forward end of the frame by one or a plurality of fasteners . See A and A. The T foot slides in a forwards and or backwards direction within a slot not shown present in the bottom of the frame which provides a stroke length that is usable measurement length preferably ranging from about 0.1 to about 10 inches and more preferably ranging from about 1 to about 3 inches and most preferably about one inch. The stroke length may be increased or decreased to any desired or required length based upon the requirements of a particular application or upon the needs or desires of an operator. A grip clip that functions to guide the encoder clip is connected with the top side of the T foot with a portion of the lower part of the frame between the two by means for attaching such components together such as a plurality of fasteners. shows the use of two screws for this purpose. As is shown in B A and B an encoder clip that functions to generate the trigger action is positioned within the frame preferably near or adjacent with the aft end of the grip clip and is affixed with a side or other area of the shaft by a means for affixing the two together such as with a plurality of fasteners. B A and B show a use of two screws for bolting these two parts together and also for mounting an internal linear strip scale which forms a part of the measurement apparatus and is present on the optical encoder card onto the encoder clip . The linear strip scale is preferably a magnetically etched rail having a series of readable graduations and functions in the manner discussed hereinbelow.

Compressing the common grip which may be performed by an application of pressure by one hand of an operator or by one or a plurality of fingers on that one hand applies tension to the extension spring while simultaneously or substantially simultaneously sliding the linear scale strip present on the optical encoder card through the reader head not shown of the optical encoder card and pulling the probe tip toward the body of the probe via the slidable shaft which moves towards the aft end of the measurement apparatus . As the measurement mechanism moves backwards graduations not shown that are present on the linear scale strip pass through the optical encoder card which is operably wired using an electrical wire harness to an encoder input circuit of the digital circuit or controller card to make one or a plurality of linear measurements. See B and B. Such graduations may be any sized graduations required for a particular application or required or desired by an operator but generally range from about 1 to about 1 000 microns in length such as about 1 2 3 4 or 5 microns. The encoder electronics present on the digital circuit or controller card which for example may be those that are illustrated in B C A have an ability to continuously capture or read the current position of the linear strip scale and count the graduations in an up and or down direction as it moves over the magnetic graduations as the quadrature signals from the liner strip scale are passed to it.

When a hook shown in that is present at the forward end of a probe tip engages a back surface of a skin workpiece or other three dimensional object or part thereof such as when it passes fully through a fastener hole and hooks onto or otherwise comes into contact with a surface that is at the far end of the hole the entire sliding measurement mechanism preferably stops moving as a result of this mechanical impediment. Continuing to squeeze the common grip or trigger handle the now added force provided by the trigger compression spring of at least about 2 pounds of force and preferably of at least about 3 pounds of force will typically normalize the probe body on the facing surface of the part being measured i.e. the surface facing the operator and move the compression trigger switch off the encoder clip . By normalizing in this context is meant that the probe is in alignment with the surface of the part being measured. An adjustment screw shown in B A B A B A and B or a similar mechanism is preferably used to set or establish how far the common grip or trigger handle must be pulled to generate a trigger action after the encoder clip has stopped moving. This is typically set to about 0.02 inches but is adjustable to user preference and may vary widely for example from about 0.00.1 to about 0.1 inches. The compression trigger switch transition from closed to open preferably generates an electrical trigger signal that is wired to the digital circuit or controller card to capture procure a measurement reading from the optical encoder card at the moment of such transition.

The trigger mechanism is shown in B A B A B A and B and also in . show the measurement mechanism in an extended position while show it in a fully 100 retracted position. Both retraction and compression may range from just above about 0 to 100 . The position of the encoder clip in is quite different from its position in . In the compression spring has not been overcome by the force applied between the common grip and the probe tip as a result of mechanical impediment. Additionally a compression trigger switch which functions to indicate that the measurement position has been reached and which is preferably positioned within the frame near or adjacent with the aft end of the encoder clip and at near or at the aft end of the compression clip is still in a closed position. It is located centrally or substantially centrally within the frame . In contrast in the trigger mechanism has been fully retracted and the compression trigger switch is now transitioned to an open position as the compression trigger switch and the encoder clip have moved away from the adjustment screw in a direction towards the aft end of the frame . This is accomplished by overcoming the amount of the force that was applied on the encoder clip by the compression spring by squeezing the common grip . The compression trigger switch may be attached to the grip clip by any means for attaching these two components together such as a plurality of fasteners. B A and B show a use of two screws for this purpose. An electrical wire harness is soldered or otherwise affixed to the compression trigger switch leads and preferably has a connector to plug into the digital circuit or controller card .

The housing or body of the measurement apparatus is preferably made of a plastic material preferably acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS but may be made of any other suitable plastic or other material i.e. a material that enables it to function in the manner described herein . It may be made by fused deposition modeling FDM injection molding or other suitable methods which may be determined by those having ordinary skill in the art. One or a plurality of inserts as are shown in may optionally be pressed or otherwise inserted into the housing left hand outer body and or right hand outer body to provide a high quality or strong thread to any fasteners that are used to assemble the measurement apparatus .

On one or a plurality of sides or areas of the housing of the measurement apparatus such as on the left hand outer body as is shown in or on the right hand outer body a membrane switch panel or set of one or more buttons or other means for providing an operator with program or other control of the measurement apparatus such as forward or reverse is preferably affixed thereto by for example one or a plurality of fasteners such as glue or other adhesives. The membrane switch panel or similar mechanism or device preferably includes one or a plurality of switches that provides an operator of the measurement apparatuses with partial or full preferably full program control thereof. Program control allows the operator to manipulate various portion of software that is running in a host or other computer and or data collection device via the measurement apparatus . This is say that it has the ability to handle the exceptional cases that occasionally occur when taking many thousands of measurements. Key switches included with the measurement apparatus allow the operator to make choices to cause various software routines to operate that enhance the functionality of the device in handling the exception events. Preferably the membrane switch panel has at least three switches i.e. devices for making breaking and or changing one or a plurality of connections in an electrical circuit i one that causes or activates the measurement apparatus to perform a new measurement or other activity such as a forward arrow ii one that causes or activates the measurement apparatus to repeat a measurement already taken or an activity already performed such as a reverse arrow and iii one that causes or activates the measurement apparatus to perform a calibration such as a calibrate switch. Additionally it preferably includes a light emitting diode that indicates that a particular calibration is current. A calibration puck such as the one shown in at the forward end of the measurement apparatus in front or forward of the probe tip is preferably used in conjunction with the calibration switch on the membrane switch panel or similar device to calibrate the measurement apparatus with a particular probe tip that is being used. The puck should have a known precision thickness which is preferably coded into calibration firmware that is present on the digital circuit or controller card .

One or a plurality of fasteners or other means may be used to securely affix the left hand outer body and the right hand outer body together at one or a plurality of different locations. shows a use of about twelve screws being used for this purpose six with the left hand outer body and six with the right hand outer body .

An internal or external rechargeable or non rechargeable battery that is preferably removable from the measurement apparatus such as an AA lithium ion battery or an Ultra Fire AA battery may be used to provide power to measurement apparatuses that for example are wireless. Such batteries are commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as Shenzhen Zhangyang Technology Co. Ltd. Shenzhen City China . shows such a battery being present and stored in the handle portion bottom portion at the aft end of the measurement apparatus of the left hand outer body . A standard USB connector or similar means for charging the battery is preferably a part of the digital circuit or controller card and may be employed to charge the battery. It is preferably removably positioned in a convenient side or area of the housing such as the left hand outer body than enables the battery to be easily charged and may be covered by an optional battery compartment cover as is shown in . Preferably it may also be removed and replaced for instant restart by removing the battery compartment cover . A battery charge typically will last for a period of about 8 hours but may be longer or shorter as is known by those having ordinary skill in the art.

Some of the discussion above relates only to the retraction or pistol type or style of a measurement apparatus of the invention either wireless or non wireless . There are a few configuration changes for the plunge type or style of the measurement apparatus of the invention wireless and non wireless . First the pistol type grip style and preferred shape of the left hand outer body and right hand outer body of the retraction type apparatuses as are shown in and are preferably replaced a barrel style and shape of plastic or other left hand outer body and right hand outer body as is shown in . Second shows an internal mechanism of the plunge configuration measurement apparatus . Comparing with the differences in the configurations can be readily discerned. Most notably the compression trigger switch has been moved from the rear or aft end of the frame to the forward end of the frame . When the probe tip is inserted into a fastener or other hole the tip and shaft and grip clip all push back in a backwards direction towards the aft end of the frame and measurement apparatus preferably as one unit identically or substantially identically to the manner done by the retraction style measurement apparatus thereby overcoming the force applied by the extension spring . The trigger switch is again tightly coupled to the encoder clip via the screw or similar mechanism or device and the compression spring is much stronger than the tension spring . When the ball pads touch or otherwise come into contact with a surface of a material workpiece or other three dimensional object or part thereof the linear scale strip will typically be positioned in a manner to accurately measure the depth of the hole as is shown in . The functionality for countersink fastener flushness and step measurements is identical with only a change of the probe tip. A plunge end cap that is preferably the size and shape or substantially so as the aft end of the plunge style measurement apparatus as is shown in is preferably attached to the aft end of the plunge T foot as is shown in . The operator pushes the end cap or otherwise applies force thereto with one hand which pushes the compression trigger switch away from the encoder clip and trigger screw as is shown in . The trigger action causes the measurement apparatus to simultaneously or substantially simultaneously and instantaneously or substantially instantaneously perform the three functions that are described above in connection with a pistol or retraction type of measurement apparatus . A linear scale strip value will be read into the digital circuit or controller card for wireless measurement apparatuses or Power Over Ethernet POE circuit card for non wireless measurement apparatuses which is subsequently transmitted to the host computer.

The Power Over Ethernet wired embodiments of the measurement apparatuses of the invention i.e. those that are not wireless such as the retraction or plunge type measurement apparatus are structurally and functionally identical or substantially identical to the wireless embodiments of the measurement apparatuses of the invention such as the retraction or plunge type of measurement apparatus except for the following exceptions which relate to the connection to the outer body and the placement of the data trigger switch. First a Power Over Ethernet POE circuit or controller card is used in place of the wireless digital circuit or controller card . The POE circuit card preferably includes a standard RJ 45 Ethernet connection and lacks a battery connection J on . The data and or information that is transferred thereto is the same in both cases but the circuit that handles the data interface to the host computer s and or other data collection devices is different. Second the Power Over Ethernet wired embodiments of the measurement apparatuses of the invention preferably will not have a battery compartment present or build into their handle area or other areas as no need for a battery in such embodiments exists. For example the plastic or other body parts shown in left hand outer body and right hand outer body preferably replace the left hand outer body and the right hand outer body that are shown in . Other than the foregoing all structure and functionality are generally identical or substantially identical.

All of the wired and wireless measurement apparatuses that are described herein preferably have the following common important components or features 

The internal mechanism and electronics present in the measurement apparatuses of the present invention can be configured in any one or more of a variety of different ways to accomplish one or more different tasks.

As explained above numerous types of depths and other dimensional measurements may be made using the measurement apparatuses of the disclosed embodiments. This flexibility is attributable primarily to the measurement apparatuses using the same or essentially the same signal processing operations for each type of depth measurement. These operations mainly involve counting or otherwise keeping track of the number of graduations or divisions or tick marks on a linear scale or strip or possibly a quadrature or rotary scale depending on the implementation that are displaced when a probe or a measurement apparatus passes into or out of a hole or opening being measured. These graduations or divisions as described earlier are uniformly spaced at known predefined intervals e.g. a few microns to allow extremely accurate distance or length measurements for most applications. The measurement apparatuses thereafter calculate or otherwise convert the number of graduations or divisions that are displaced by the movement of a probe into a value that corresponds to the depth of the hole or opening being measured.

The displacement value used by the measurement apparatuses to calculate the depth values may represent displacement in one direction typically into the hole or opening being measured or out of the hole or opening being measured depending on the type of depth measurement made. It is also possible however for the measurement apparatuses to use a net total displacement value that is the displacement in one direction e.g. into the hole being measured minus the displacement in the other direction e.g. out of the hole being measured . These various measurement operations may be performed by the digital circuit or control card or board within the measurement apparatuses such as the card or discussed above. In some implementations however it may be desirable to configure the digital circuit or control card or to simply acquire or otherwise count the number of graduations or divisions that have been displaced then transmit that information to an external application for performing the depth value calculations.

Although they are designed to be used in different ways both the digital circuit or control cards and as well as other control cards that may be used with the measurement apparatuses discussed herein have a number of common features or functional components. These functional components may be seen in which illustrates an example of a control board like the control cards and in terms of the main functionality provided by the board. As can be seen the control board may include a controller module a DC power supply module one or more internal system interfaces an optical decoder one or more human operator interfaces and one or more external system interfaces . Also shown for reference purposes are one or more internal system components of the measurement apparatuses denoted generally at that may be electrically connected to the control board as well as one or more external computer systems denoted generally at that may be communicatively coupled to the measurement apparatuses.

It should be noted that although the functional components in are illustrated as individual blocks those having ordinary skill in the art will understand that any individual block may be divided into several constituent blocks each representing one or more functional sub components without departing from the disclosed embodiments. In addition any two or more of the blocks shown and possibly all of the blocks shown in some implementations may be combined into a single super block representing a highly integrated functional component without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments. Moreover other blocks representing other functional components besides the blocks shown may be added to the controller module board as needed or one or more of the blocks shown may be removed from the controller module board as needed without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments. Each of the functional components is discussed in more detail below.

In general the controller module provides overall control of the operation of the measurement apparatuses. The main responsibility of the controller module is reading or otherwise acquiring the number of displaced graduations or divisions for a given depth measurement then calculating depth values based on the number of displaced graduations or divisions. In addition the controller module monitors and processes various inputs received by the control board both from the internal system components as well as the external computer systems . The controller module also controls the transmission of certain data such as the depth values that have been calculated and optionally the date and or time information therefor to and from the external computer systems . Conversely the controller module may called upon to execute or carry out any commands or instructions it receives from the external computer systems including calibration commands keypad or control key assignment definitions and the like. The controller module may also need to generate various outputs for the measurement apparatuses including status indicators warnings or alarms signals and the like. An exemplary computer program listing reflecting one specific implementation of the controller module is provided herewith as a computer program listing appendix which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The DC direct current power supply module as the label suggests provides power to the various components of the control board . In general the power supply module receives power from a power source and depending on the particular implementation provides that power at multiple different voltage levels to the various components. For example some components on the control board may require a 5 volt V DC power supply other components may require a 3.3 V DC power supply while still other components may require a 1.5 V DC power supply and so forth. The DC power supply module is therefore responsible for converting e.g. by either stepping down or stepping up the input voltage it receives to one or more voltage levels required by the various components of the control board . Multiple conversion stages may be needed depending on the requirements of the particular implementation. The power source that feeds the power supply module may be an external power source such as an AC power line or it may be an internal power source such as a battery battery pack backup battery and the like attached to or residing within the measurement apparatuses or on the control board . In alternative embodiments power may be fed to the power supply module over an Ethernet connection using the Power Over Ethernet POE protocol or other similar protocols where power is transmitted over a data line.

The internal system interfaces generally provide a way for the control board to communicate with one or more internal system components of the measurement apparatuses. In some implementations the internal system interfaces may take the form of one or more connectors jumpers sockets and the like or various combinations thereof. Electrical wires traces lines and other pathways may be provided to carry electrically signals to from the internal system components from to these internal system interfaces and hence to the control board for processing.

The optical decoder processes input typically but not necessarily electrical pulses representing the graduations or divisions that are received by the control board . These electrical pulses or other input may be provided by a separate optical encoder as discussed above including the optical encoder shown in . Such optical encoders are well known in the art and are capable of optically detecting the presence of a graduation or division or the passing of one and generating an output representing that graduation or division. Generally speaking the optical decoder is designed to output one or more signals corresponding to the electrical pulses or other input received from the optical encoder but having the appropriate voltage levels shape and timing needed by the controller module . This allows the controller module to focus its processing capacity on counting or tracking how many graduations or divisions were displaced using the signals from the optical decoder . However depending on the particular embodiment a discrete decoder may not be needed as the controller module may be capable of performing i.e. may have sufficient processing power to perform this function. And while an optical encoder is the one mainly discussed herein it may be desirable in some implementations to use a magnetic encoder instead.

The operator interface functions mainly to receive input from and provide output to a human operator. To this end the operator interface may take the form of one or more mechanical and or solid state switches relays contacts drivers and the like or various combinations thereof. This allows the human operator to interact with and otherwise use the measurement apparatuses including initiating calibration taking a depth measurement selecting an operational mode and so forth by actuating a trigger pressing a button scrolling a wheel touching a touchscreen and the like. When the human operator performs one or more of these tasks the operator interface conveys a signal corresponding to the performed task to the controller module of the control board . The operator interface may also facilitate one or more signals from the controller module to external indicators for indicating e.g. via light emitting diodes LEDs or otherwise displaying e.g. via a liquid crystal or other type of display the status of the measurement apparatuses depth values that were measured panel as well as various warning and or alert messages.

As for the external system interfaces these interfaces allow the control board to communicate with the external computer systems . Such communication may take place wirelessly using for example ZygBee Bluetooth Wi Fi WPAN Wireless Personal Area Network and other IEEE 802 compatible wireless protocols. The communication may also occur over wired connections using for example Ethernet USB Universal Serial Bus RS 232 serial communication FireWire or other wired communication protocols. The specific communication protocol used however is not functionally important for successful implementation of the measurement apparatuses disclosed herein as the decision regarding a particular protocol may be informed by other factors and is not strictly limited to functionality. The external system interfaces may be implemented using one or more dedicated modules that are designed to carry out the particular communication protocol adopted. In some embodiments however the functionality of the external system interfaces may be partially or entirely incorporated into the controller module .

The above embodiments of the control board provides a number of advantages. In addition to automatically accurately and quickly taking a depth measurement the control board allows the measurement apparatuses to make various different types of depth measurements without altering or making any changes to the control board . These different types of depth measurements may include for example retraction type grip gage plunger type grip gage step gage gap gage countersink depth gage fastener flushness gage diameter gage and other depth measurements known to those having ordinary skill in the art. The specific type of depth measurement may be made simply by attaching an appropriate probe selected from a plurality of probes designed for that type of depth measurement. The overall method of calculating the depth values however does not need to be changed with each different type of depth measurement. This overall method is discussed in further details below in the form of one or more flowcharts.

Referring now to a flowchart is shown representing one exemplary method of taking a depth measurement that may be performed by the measurement apparatuses. It should be noted that the steps of the flowchart like the functional components of are shown in discrete blocks. As such those having ordinary skill in the art will understand that two or more blocks may be combined into a single block and that any individual block may be divided into several constituent blocks without departing from the disclosed embodiments. And although the blocks of the flowchart have been arranged in a particular sequence those having ordinary skill in the art will understand that one or more blocks may be rearranged in a different sequence within the flowchart without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments.

As can be seen the flowchart begins generally at block where a determination is made whether calibration has been selected on the measurement apparatuses. Such calibration may be selected manually by a human operator by manipulating an appropriate control such as by pressing a calibration key button or switch on the measurement apparatuses. In addition or alternatively calibration may be automatically selected by a software application running on an external computer system connected to the measurement apparatuses. In either case if the answer at block is no then the flowchart proceeds to block where a check is made to see whether a data acquisition start event such as a trigger being actuated has occurred. At block a determination is made as to whether the data acquisition start event has occurred. If the answer at block is no then the flowchart returns to the previous step and performs another check.

If the answer at block is yes then the flowchart proceeds to block where raw data representing the number of displaced graduations or divisions is acquired. As mentioned above this data may be obtained in one exemplary implementation by using an optical encoder to optically or magnetically detect graduations or divisions passing by the encoder the movement of the measurement apparatus probe into or out of the hole being measured drives the linear scale or strip and hence the graduations or divisions thereon . In an alternative implementation where a linear scale or strip is used as opposed to a rotary scale it is possible to secure the linear strip in place while moving the optical encoder with the measurement apparatus probe. The output of the optical encoder in either case may then be processed by an optical decoder to generate one or more output signals representing the graduations or divisions that were displaced during the movement of the probe.

The flowchart thereafter proceeds to block where the raw data representing the displaced graduations or divisions is processed. This processing may involve for example counting or otherwise tracking the number of graduations or divisions that were displaced. In some implementations the counting may be performed for a preset time interval that is sufficiently long to ensure that the probe has been returned to its starting position and thus no additional graduations or divisions may be expected. In other implementations rather than using a preset time interval the counting may be performed until no additional graduations or divisions are counted i.e. the counter is not incremented for predefined amount of time. Such counting may occur in both an increasing direction as well as a decreasing direction or a combination of both depending on the particular implementation.

Once the counting has stopped the count of the graduations or divisions that have been displaced is used to calculate a depth value at block . In one embodiment the depth value may be calculated by multiplying the displaced graduations or divisions by the predefined interval between each graduation or division. In the case of a linear interval no additional calculations are necessary to determine the depth value. In the case of an angular interval where a rotary scale is used the angular value may be converted to a linear value using mathematical techniques known to those having ordinary skill in the art. As an optional step the calculated depth value may be transmitted to an external application on an external computer system to be used as needed at block . Such external transmission may be initiated automatically by the measurement apparatuses as soon as the depth value calculations are completed or it may be initiated manually by a human operator. In the latter case if the human operator does not feel like the depth value was measured or taken properly for some reason or if the depth value displayed by the measurement apparatuses is obviously in error he or she may decline to forward such value to the external application.

Referring back to block if the answer here is yes then at block an indicator or other signal is provided to indicate that the next depth measurement taken is to be designated as a calibration measurement. The calibration measurement itself however proceeds as described above with respect to blocks except that the measurement is performed on a calibration disk or puck . As explained earlier the calibration disk or puck is placed against the probe of the measurement apparatus so that the foot thereof rests on the reference plane or surface of the calibration device or disk and a measurement is taken with the probe thus arranged. The depth value measured is then subtracted from or added to all subsequent depth measurements during the depth value calculation block .

In the above implementation calibration and the subsequent use of the calibration measurement to adjust subsequent depth values may occur locally within the measurement apparatuses. In some implementations however rather than perform the adjustment of subsequent measurements locally within the measurement apparatuses the calibration value may be sent to an external computer system connected to the measurement apparatuses where an external application may perform the adjustments. If a measurement apparatus is disconnected from the external computer system and moved to another external computer system then calibration will need to be repeated for the second external computer system.

In some arrangements the depth value calculations themselves may also be performed by the external application on the external computer system rather than locally. An example of such an arrangement is illustrated in via a flowchart . As can be seen the flowchart is otherwise similar to the flowchart of except that after the raw data representing displaced graduations or divisions is processed at block the processed data is sent to the external application at block . Both the depth value calculations and any calibrations are then performed by the external application at block .

Turning now to and exemplary implementations of the control board discussed above are shown in the form of circuit diagrams. As can be seen the circuit diagrams depict specific electrical components including transformers transistors diodes capacitors conductors resistors and integrated circuits electrically connected together typically on a printed circuit board. However not all of these components may be needed for every implementation and or alternative components may be substituted in some cases. A listing of exemplary manufacturers part numbers and component values where applicable for each component is provided in Table 1 and Table 2 below. Those having ordinary skill in the art may obtain a detailed understanding of the operation of the circuit diagrams by considering the component information in Tables 1 and 2 in view of the connections shown in the and A B. Accordingly only a high level description of the functionality embodied by the circuit diagrams is offered herein. Also to better view the circuit diagrams most of the and A B have been spread over two pages so that actually refers to and A . actually refers to and A and so forth.

Referring first to an exemplary implementation of a control board for the measurement apparatuses that uses wireless communication to connect to an external computer system is shown. This implementation of the control board which may correspond to the wireless digital circuit or control card derives operational power from a battery and thus several circuits relating to battery power management and charging are shown. As can be seen in the exemplary control board may include a USB input circuit shown generally at which may include a standard USB connector for allowing the control board to communicate with an external computer system over a USB cable. The USB input circuit may also be used to charge the battery of the control board via the USB cable.

Because the USB communication circuit is only needed when the control board is connected to an external computer system power for the USB communication circuit may be derived over the USB cable from the external computer system. As such a USB voltage regulator circuit may be provided including a voltage level translator Part No. SN74LVClT45 from Texas Instruments Inc. to bring the voltage from the external computer system down to the level required by the USB communication circuit which is 3.3 V in the present instance.

Following are Tables 1 and 2 that list among other things exemplary manufacturers part numbers and component values where applicable for each component in and .

All of the components that are present in the measurement apparatuses of the present invention are commercially available from sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art such as ProjectionWorks Inc. Kennesaw Ga. Delta Sigma Corporation Kennesaw Ga. other sources that are described herein and other sources that are known by those having ordinary skill in the art.

The following example describes and illustrates the systems and methods of the present invention. This example is intended to be merely illustrative of the present invention and not limiting thereof in either scope or spirit. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that many variations of certain of the devices components materials ingredients computer software conditions and or steps employed in the systems and procedures described in the example and otherwise described herein can be employed.

In order to test the invention in an actual assembly environment rather than in a laboratory environment which is not employed for assembly operations an experiment was performed at an aircraft manufacturer facility under the terms of a confidentiality agreement and under the control of the inventors to test the theory that optically projected work instructions would be helpful to assembly technicians in terms of saving time labor blueprints plans instruction manuals computer screens and the like .

A particular wire harness was selected for this experiment. Abundant data from many years of cost tracking for this particular assembly was available to the inventors. A person that was skilled at making this particular wire harness averaged making it in 21 hours whereas a person skilled at making wire harnesses in general but not this particular wire harness averaged making it in 28 hours.

Assembly data was input into a programmable computer as it was gathered from a technician who had built this particular assembly wire harness dozens of times taking him 21 hours to construct the wire harness in his usual manual manner of construction.

About a month later the same technician built the same wire harness using the assembly data that was input into the programmable computer and optically projected assembly instructions projected onto the wire harness . He was able to build the wire harness this time in 19 hours which was his personal record for that harness and a savings of 2 hours of time for just this one wire harness and an increase of efficiency of the assembly of about 10 . If he were to construct several of these wire harnesses the time savings would be even greater i.e. two hours times the number of wire harnesses being constructed. 

The next month a technician that had never built this particular wire harness built it using the same optically projected assembly instructions and also built the wire harness in 19 hours even though she had never built it before .

Comments received from both technicians were very favorable reporting that the optically projected assembly instructions had a definite positive impact on their assembly work or relatively complex objects. Further both wire harness assemblies were completed with no errors.

In addition to demonstrating the time reduction in assembly that results from optically projected assembly instructions onto an object being assembled this test also demonstrates how the knowledge from the most experienced technicians may easily be transferred to lesser experienced or inexperienced workers when using optically projected assembly instructions resulting in a higher throughput with fewer errors. This in turn results in significantly lower production costs.

The knowledge transfer using three dimensional optical projection technology is vastly more efficient than traditional methods of training because the exact information that is needed for the single step that is presently being worked on in a particular assembly is displayed precisely where it is needed in full scale three dimensional color text pictures and or symbols directly on the assembly in an undistorted manner at the precise moment that it is needed. Three dimensional optical projection technology allows an assembly manufacturing or other business to record its best practices i.e. the best ordered sequence of assembly manufacturing or other steps so that there is an assurance that every worker knows the best way to perform any task assembly manufacture or other process any time that task is being done even if the worker has never done this task before.

While the test above showed cost savings of about 10 and 30 for experienced and inexperienced assemblers a wire harness is not a very complex assembly. The more complexity there is in an assembly process the greater the savings will typically be. Cost savings well in excess of about 50 will not be rare and from about 30 to about 50 will be very common. Savings of this magnitude will take millions of dollars out of the cost of assembling each very complex object such as an airplane. Other applications of the technology will have proportional effects.

While the apparatuses systems and methods of the present invention have been described herein with specificity and with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize numerous variations modifications and substitutions of that which has been described which can be made and which are within the scope and spirit of the invention which is pioneering. It is intended that all of these modifications and variations be within the scope of the present invention us it is described and claimed herein and that the invention be limited only by the scope of the claims which follow and that such claims be interpreted as broadly as is reasonable for a pioneering invention.
