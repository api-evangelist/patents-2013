Power utilities all over the world are heavily investing and deploying Smart Meters to enable two way meter reading. As an extension of automatic meter infrastructure AMI power utilities are investing in home area network HAN solutions that will enable them to increase the awareness of energy usage among its customers in an effort to be able to charge its customers Time of Use TOU rates and manage its loads to prevent rolling black outs or brown outs due to peak usage. Wireless is currently the technology of choice among power utilities as the connectivity solution from under the glass of the Smart Meter to the HAN devices in the home. Although wireless is sufficient in most single family homes it becomes more challenging due to range and interferences in various environments such as multi dwellings buildings rural areas where the Smart Meter is far from the house as well as homes that are built with cement or steel frame.

As background conventional Smart Meter technology allows for a wireless connection to a home area network using ZigBee. Each conventional Smart Meter has a digital certificate commonly called elliptical curve certification or ECC. In typical cases a HAN device is configured to only a single Smart Meter with associated ECC.

After configuring the joining parameters the data concentrator will attempt to join the wireless network starting with the first meter. If the data concentrator is not able to join to the first meter B then the data concentrator will configure to join the next meter C. The data concentrator will continue to configure to join the X number of meters until it is able to join one. Upon success to join a meter A the data concentrator will synchronize time with the meter . Then the meter will check for usage from the meter .

Millions of Smart Meters have already been deployed around the world. But they are fast becoming outdated and it presents a troublesome and expensive burden for Power Utilities to have to replace the meters again having just spent billions in upgrade costs. The Present Advanced Meter Extension Solution AMES was developed specifically to help Power Utilities to bridge the meter to the home area network HAN whilst minimizing cost and resources to do so. See for example .

AMES is a revolutionary patent pending ZigBee and HomePlugPower line bridging solution. It converts a ZigBee Smart Energy Profile SEP 1.1 2.0 signal from the meter injects it over the existing electrical wires of a building using HomePlugPower line technology and then converts that signal back into a ZigBee SEP 1.1 2.0 signal. It offers a secure reliable and no wires communication link between the meter and the HAN. Although there is technically only one electrical wiring scheme in a given building each apartment dwelling is segregated from the others through advanced 128 bit AES encryption so security and privacy is maintained between apartment dwellers.

AMES is designed to be an add on adapter solution to the existing Smart Meters that are currently being rolled out. It can be used with any third party meter that embeds ZigBee SEP 1.1 2.0 as the communication link to the HAN. AMES does not rely on any changes or modification to the existing Smart Meter. It includes a 3G backhaul to a Utility Management Platform UMP .

AMES can also function as a SEP 1.0 1.1 to 2.0 bridge for Power Utilities that have already deployed ZigBee SEP 1.0 1.1 and need a way to connect to emerging HAN devices that are SEP 2.0 enabled. AMES consists of three basic components 1 Concentrator 2 Bridge and 3 UMP.

The Concentrator is a utility grade single phase meter concentrator that can be installed in the meter closet. It is capable of connecting up to eight 8 ZigBee based Smart Meters converting the signal to a HomePlugPower line signal and then injecting it into the existing electrical wires. The Concentrator also connects to the UMP for network and device management. There are two forms of Meter Concentrators One for the ANSI North American market and the other for the IEC worldwide market. The technology is the same and the only differentiation is the form factor suited to each market. The ANSI version is housed in a socket base compartment that installs between the meter socket and the Smart Meter making installation a snap. The IEC version is mounted below the meter terminal cover.

The Bridge is a device to be installed inside a home and converts the signal from HomePowerPower line back to a ZigBee wireless signal. The Bridge appears in different form factors. The basic form is that of an Appliance Module a wall module that also functions as a Smart Plug for direct response programs. A more advanced Bridge is an energy management gateway that not only performs bridging from HomePlugPower line to ZigBee but also acts as the home energy management gateway connecting to the broadband network.

UMP is the network and device management server software for AMES. It provides an overview of all devices on the network details current device network status and allows for firmware upgrades to AMES and other HAN devices connected to AMES. UMP can be a fully managed to be deployed in a Power Utility s own data center. Integration to a utility back office can be easily achieved through standardized REST API in XML and JSON formats.

These IHD PCT devices can interact with the one or more smart meters via a gateway interface. The smart meters can be connected to a cloud interface or the Internet via a wired wireless 3G or other electronic communication means. One or more of the smart meters can also be coupled to computer processing units connected in series parallel or a combination of both. These computer processing units can be which can be configured to respond to various input output signals such as those represented by Phase A Phase B Phase C etc.

A check information event can also be performed for the power meter numbered . This check can include retrieving information related to any messages price demand response and load DRLC and other related information to energy power use. For example once the ZigBee transceiver of the remote data collection device is connected to a smart meter device it can send a Get Last Message Get Scheduled Event Get Last Price command to the smart meter device. The smart meter device can be configured to respond with the appropriate responses to these commands. If these information events are available they can be stored and forwarding to a corresponding home device. These home devices can include personal computers hand held computer devices home area network HAN devices and the like.
