Implementations for determining body measurements are described. In various implementations a system receives images associated with a subject user. The system then generates a 3 dimensional composition of the subject user based on the images. The system then determines one or more body measurements associated with the subject user based on the 3 dimensional composition.

In some implementations to determine the one or more body measurements the system determines one or more initial body measurements based on one or more known reference dimensions and then modifies the initial body measurements based on one or more modifying criteria. The modifying criteria may include for example historical body measurement criteria age criteria geographic location criteria etc.

In some implementations the system may provide a recommendation for an article of clothing based on the one or more body measurements and based on clothing preferences of the subject user. In some implementations the subject user may provide the clothing preferences to the system. In some implementations the clothing preferences may be based on historical data associated with the subject user input of clothing preferences.

For ease of illustration shows one block for each of system server device and social network database and shows four blocks for client devices and . Blocks and may represent multiple systems server devices and social network databases. Also there may be any number of client devices. In other implementations network environment may not have all of the components shown and or may have other elements including other types of elements instead of or in addition to those shown herein.

In various implementations users U U U and U may communicate with each other using respective client devices and . Users U U U and U may also interact with system using respective client devices and .

In the various implementations described herein processor not shown of system causes various elements described herein e.g. measurement summaries clothing recommendations etc. to be displayed to a given user in a user interface on a display screen.

In various implementations system may utilize a recognition algorithm to facilitate in determining body measurements. Example implementations of recognition algorithms are described in more detail below.

In block system generates a 3 dimensional composition of the subject user based on the images. System may then use all of the images in which the subject user is tagged and or recognized for instance by a facial recognition algorithm which could include hundreds of images to build or stitch a 3 dimensional composite of the subject user using the amalgamated set of images. Such images may include full shots of the subject user partial shots from waist and above head shots e.g. neck and above peripheral shots e.g. back and or side etc.

In some implementations system may combine or stitch together matching points in the images in order to create a 3d object of the subject user. In some implementations system may extract information such as metadata from tags in the images.

In some implementations system may select which images to use for the 3 dimensional composition based on timestamps associated with each image. For example system may select the most recent images in order to generate one 3 dimensional composition that more closely matches the subject user s current size and shape.

In block system determines one or more initial body measurements based on the 3 dimensional composition and based on one or more known reference dimensions. In various implementations the one or more known reference dimensions are based on one or more objects in the images.

In various scenarios one or more objects in a given image may have known dimensions. Such objects may include any variety of objects such as soda cans wine bottles cars etc. even another person with associated known dimensions or measurements where system may determine the dimensions of each object. For example soda can of may be identifiable with a logo. System may determine the height and diameter of soda can or any other objects in a given image e.g. via product specifications or other product information available in a database or via any suitable search etc. . System may then use one or more objects having know reference dimensions as frames of reference to ascertain one or more body measurements of the subject user. For example system may determine the height of the subject user head circumference shoulder width etc. For ease of illustration shows a single view point front side of subject user U and shows a several measurements. As indicated herein in various implementations system determines body dimensions using a 3 dimensional composition which may include numerous viewpoints angles distances objects etc. System may also determine numerous other body dimensions such as chest size waist size pant length etc.

System may already have current body measurements of another person standing next to the subject user. Because many images of people in social networks have multiple people tagged in groups system may use various people as frames of reference for height and depth perception.

Such dimensions may be stored in any suitable database accessible by system and system may utilize such dimensions as points of reference to determine the body measurements of the subject user. In various implementations system may determine relative distances between the subject user and particular objects in order to adjust relative sizing.

In block system modifies the one or more initial body measurements based on one or more modifying criteria. In some scenarios system may not have any or enough current photos to accurately determine the subject user s current body measurements. Also even current images may not precisely indicate the subject user s actual body measurements due to various image qualities distortions etc. As described in more detail below system may modify one or more body measurements of the subject user based on various factors such as age geographic location time of year.

In various implementations the one or more modifying criteria includes historical body measurement criteria. For example system may determine from collected images that the subject user tends to fluctuate in size over the year and such fluctuations may follow seasonal cycles. For example the subject user may be bigger in the winter and thinner in the summer e.g. from more physical activity etc. . In another example system may determine that the subject user has been getting thinner or getting bigger over time based on images of the subject user.

As such in some implementations if the 3 dimensional composition indicates one or more body measurements that do not match or that deviate by a predetermined amount from the historical pattern e.g. cycle trend etc. system may adjust one or more initial body measurements toward the historical pattern.

In some implementations system may predict one or more body measurements into the future based on historical patterns. In an example scenario the subject user may shop for summer clothing during the winter season to get sale prices . System may predict body measurements several months into the future or follow historical cycles and or trends for the subject user and make recommendations accordingly.

In various implementations the one or more modifying criteria includes age criteria. System may determine overall trends in body measurements based on age. For example men and women may tend to gain weight and get bigger as they get older and the particular age that one s body measurements change will depend on the particular individual.

System may determine age information associated with the subject user from a social network system. For example the subject user may have stored his or her birthday in the social network. Based on the time stamp of each image system may determine the age of the subject user.

In some implementations system may determine if and when a new trend in body measurements occurs with the subject user based on collected images of the subject user. System may also correlate the pattern change with the age of the subject user. For example system may determine that a particular male subject user has gotten bigger around the waist over a several year period and that the subject user is 40. The correlation of the age with the historical pattern may trigger system to adjust one or more initial body measurements toward the historical pattern.

As indicated above in some implementations system may predict one or more body measurements into the future based on historical patterns. As such system may predict body measurements several months into the future or follow historical cycles and or trends for the subject user and may make recommendations accordingly.

In various implementations the one or more modifying criteria includes geographic location criteria. System may determine overall trends in body measurements based on geographic data. For example body measurements of people certain countries and or climates may tend to follow a general pattern. System may determine geographic information associated with the subject user from a social network system. For example the subject user may have stored the geographic location where he or she resides in the social network. Based on the geographic location information system may determine the country climate etc.

In some implementations system may determine if and when a new trend in body measurements occurs with the subject user based on collected images of the subject user. System may also correlate the pattern change with the geographic location of the subject user. The correlation of the age with the geographic location may trigger system to adjust one or more initial body measurements toward the historical pattern.

As indicated above in some implementations system may predict one or more body measurements into the future based on historical patterns. As such system may predict body measurements several months into the future or follow historical cycles and or trends for the subject user and make recommendations accordingly. Also geographic data and time of year may be considered together to yield appropriate seasonal attire especially when combined with the age and gender of the subject user.

While implementations have been described in the context of history age geographic location other contexts and criteria are possible depending on the particular implementation. For example other factors may include ethnicity lifestyle life events e.g. having children etc.

In some implementations system may be used as an application programming interface API . For example the subject user may be browsing through sweaters on a particular online clothing retailer and may use a widget to log in to their social network account associated with system . In some implementations this may initiate an application associated with a social network to determine the body measurements thereby enabling the subject user to automatically get sized for clothing.

In various implementations the resulting body measurements may used to provide tailored sizing information e.g. clothing shape and sizes for users and e commerce retailers such as clothing and apparel retailers. For example in some implementations system provides one or more recommendations for articles of clothing based on the one or more body measurements.

In various implementations system enables the subject user to provide clothing preferences to system . Clothing preferences may include color style liked brands etc. Clothing preferences may also include fit. For example some people may prefer looser fitting clothes. Some people may prefer tighter fitting closes. System may by default recommend a particular size for the subject user yet determine that the subject user prefers a particular fit e.g. looser tighter etc. . As such system may recommend a particular clothing item and multiple sizes e.g. a well fit size and a loose tight size depending on the preference .

While some implementations are described in the context of clothing these same implementations may also apply to any apparel including jewelry accessories etc.

System may enable and or prompt the subject user to manually input his or her clothing preferences. System may provide a series of prompts and or entry fields to guide the subject user in providing his or her clothing preferences. For example system may show the subject user a particular article of clothing and ask the subject user if he or she likes or dislikes the clothing item. In some implementations system may provide scale rating selection e.g. 1 5 stars for each clothing item. System may then ascertain preferences from the collected data.

In various implementations the clothing preferences may be based on historical data associated subject user input of clothing preferences. For example the subject user s preferences e.g. taste may change over time or may be seasonal. As such system may continually adjust the clothing preferences over time. Implementations eliminate or minimize sizing issues by dynamically and intelligently determining the subject users body measurements.

In some implementations system may determine clothing preferences and sizes based on past purchase and or returns. For example system may store and analyze information associated with what the subject user has bought or returned in terms of styles and sizes. If the subject user exchanged a clothing item system may determine the new size whether it went up or down etc.

In some implementations system may store style and size information based on brand. For example some brands may favor particular colors color combinations cuts etc. Some brands may run large some small etc. System may recommend clothing items accordingly based on brand styles and sizing.

In some implementations system may utilize the one or more body measurements for proactive advertising. For example system may display or recommend particular clothing items from particular retailers and or brands in a portion of a social network page. Such advertising may advertise clothes with no need for the subject user to visit a particular retailer or brand website.

In various implementations system may provide advertising to users using similar principles described herein in association with recommendations. For example system may provide advertising based on body measurements that have been modified based on historical body measurement criteria age criteria geographic location criteria etc.

In some implementations system may show clothes on a graphic depiction of the subject user where the clothes selected for advertising may be based on what the subject user has viewed and or purchased in the past. The clothes may also be clothes that the subject user has never seen but that are similar in style to clothes that the subject user has viewed and or purchased in the past. The selection of clothes advertised may be based on the preferences determined for the subject user as described herein. In some implementations system may show clothes on a model who looks like or has similar features to the subject user. Such images may make it easier for the subject user to visualize himself or herself wearing such clothes.

Although some implementations have been described in the context of online shopping these implementations may also apply to other contexts for example. Implementations may apply to video games where system generates a 3 dimensional composition based on images modifies images based on modifying criteria described herein. System may then recommend and or enable the subject user to select clothing and other apparel for video game avatars. Implementations my also apply to a portion of a subject user s body. For example a head shot of the subject user may be useful for showing the subject user depicted in glasses hats or other head gear.

With respect to particular embodiments thereof these particular embodiments are merely illustrative and not restrictive. Concepts illustrated in the examples may be applied to other examples and implementations. For example some implementations are described herein in the context of a social network system. However the implementations described herein may apply in contexts other than a social network. For example implementations may apply locally for an individual user.

Although the steps operations or computations may be presented in a specific order the order may be changed in particular implementations. Other orderings of the steps are possible depending on the particular implementation. In some particular implementations multiple steps shown as sequential in this specification may be performed at the same time. Also some implementations may not have all of the steps shown and or may have other steps instead of or in addition to those shown herein.

While system is described as performing the steps as described in the implementations herein any suitable component or combination of components of system or any suitable processor or processors associated with system may perform the steps described.

In various implementations system may utilize a variety of recognition algorithms to recognize faces landmarks objects etc. in images. Such recognition algorithms may be integral to system . System may also access recognition algorithms provided by software that is external to system and that system accesses.

In various implementations system enables users of the social network system to specify and or consent to the use of personal information which may include system using their faces in images or using their identity information in recognizing people identified in images. For example system may provide users with multiple selections directed to specifying and or consenting to the use of personal information. For example selections with regard to specifying and or consenting may be associated with individual images all images individual photo albums all photo albums etc. The selections may be implemented in a variety of ways. For example system may cause buttons or check boxes to be displayed next to various selections. In some implementations system enables users of the social network to specify and or consent to the use of using their images for facial recognition in general. Example implementations for recognizing faces and other objects are described in more detail below.

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

In various implementations system obtains reference images of users of the social network system where each reference image includes an image of a face that is associated with a known user. The user is known in that system has the user s identity information such as the user s name and other profile information. In some implementations a reference image may be for example a profile image that the user has uploaded. In some implementations a reference image may be based on a composite of a group of reference images.

In some implementations to recognize a face in an image system may compare the face e.g. image of the face and match the face to reference images of users of the social network system. Note that the term face and the phrase image of the face are used interchangeably. For ease of illustration the recognition of one face is described in some of the example implementations described herein. These implementations may also apply to each face of multiple faces to be recognized.

In some implementations system may search reference images in order to identify any one or more reference images that are similar to the face in the image. In some implementations for a given reference image system may extract features from the image of the face in an image for analysis and then compare those features to those of one or more reference images. For example system may analyze the relative position size and or shape of facial features such as eyes nose cheekbones mouth jaw etc. In some implementations system may use data gathered from the analysis to match the face in the image to one more reference images with matching or similar features. In some implementations system may normalize multiple reference images and compress face data from those images into a composite representation having information e.g. facial feature data and then compare the face in the image to the composite representation for facial recognition.

In some scenarios the face in the image may be similar to multiple reference images associated with the same user. As such there would be a high probability that the person associated with the face in the image is the same person associated with the reference images.

In some scenarios the face in the image may be similar to multiple reference images associated with different users. As such there would be a moderately high yet decreased probability that the person in the image matches any given person associated with the reference images. To handle such a situation system may use various types of facial recognition algorithms to narrow the possibilities ideally down to one best candidate.

For example in some implementations to facilitate in facial recognition system may use geometric facial recognition algorithms which are based on feature discrimination. System may also use photometric algorithms which are based on a statistical approach that distills a facial feature into values for comparison. A combination of the geometric and photometric approaches could also be used when comparing the face in the image to one or more references.

Other facial recognition algorithms may be used. For example system may use facial recognition algorithms that use one or more of principal component analysis linear discriminate analysis elastic bunch graph matching hidden Markov models and dynamic link matching. It will be appreciated that system may use other known or later developed facial recognition algorithms techniques and or systems.

In some implementations system may generate an output indicating a likelihood or probability that the face in the image matches a given reference image. In some implementations the output may be represented as a metric or numerical value such as a percentage associated with the confidence that the face in the image matches a given reference image. For example a value of 1.0 may represent 100 confidence of a match. This could occur for example when compared images are identical or nearly identical. The value could be lower for example 0.5 when there is a 50 chance of a match. Other types of outputs are possible. For example in some implementations the output may be a confidence score for matching.

For ease of illustration some example implementations described above have been described in the context of a facial recognition algorithm. Other similar recognition algorithms and or visual search systems may be used to recognize objects such as landmarks logos entities events etc. in order to implement implementations described herein.

Implementations described herein provide various benefits. For example implementations eliminate or minimize sizing issues and enables users to purchase clothing without needing to try on the clothes on before buying. Implementations greatly simplify clothes sizing.

For ease of illustration shows one block for each of processor operating system memory I O interface social network engine and media application . These blocks and may represent multiple processors operating systems memories I O interfaces social network engines and media applications. In other implementations server device may not have all of the components shown and or may have other elements including other types of elements instead of or in addition to those shown herein.

Although the description has been described with respect to particular embodiments thereof these particular embodiments are merely illustrative and not restrictive. Concepts illustrated in the examples may be applied to other examples and implementations. For example some implementations are described herein in the context of a social network system. However the implementations described herein may apply in contexts other than a social network. For example implementations may apply locally for an individual user.

Any suitable programming languages and programming techniques may be used to implement the routines of particular embodiments. Different programming techniques may be employed such as procedural or object oriented. The routines may execute on a single processing device or multiple processors. Although the steps operations or computations may be presented in a specific order the order may be changed in different particular embodiments. In some particular embodiments multiple steps shown as sequential in this specification may be performed at the same time.
