This application is based on and claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 210547 filed Sep. 25 2012.

Hitherto cleaning blades have been used as cleaners for removing a toner and the like remaining on a surface of an image holding member such as a photoreceptor in electrophotographic copiers printers fax machines and the like.

According to an aspect of the invention there is provided an image forming apparatus including an image holding member a developing device which accommodates a toner which contains at least one type of external additive having an average particle size of 0.02 m or greater selected from metallic soap particles and inorganic particles having an oil treated surface and toner particles having a surface with the external additive externally added thereto and forms an image developed with the toner on a surface of the image holding member a transfer device which transfers the developed image formed on the image holding member onto a recording medium and a cleaning device which is provided with a cleaning blade constituted by a member in which at least a part which is brought into contact with the image holding member has a dynamic micro hardness of from 0.25 to 0.65 in which a maximum length of an area which is brought into contact with the image holding member in a driving direction of the image holding member is from 1 m to 300 m and brings the cleaning blade into contact with the surface of the image holding member after transfer of the developed image by the transfer device to perform cleaning.

Hereinafter exemplary embodiments of an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge of the invention will be described in detail.

An image forming apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment is provided with an image holding member a developing device a transfer device and a cleaning device.

The developing device accommodates a toner and forms an image developed with the toner on a surface of the image holding member. The toner contains at least one type of external additive having an average particle size of 0.02 m or greater selected from metallic soap particles and inorganic particles having an oil treated surface and toner particles having a surface with the external additive externally added thereto.

The transfer device transfers the developed image formed on the image holding member onto a recording medium.

The cleaning device performs cleaning by bringing a cleaning blade into contact with the surface of the image holding member after transfer of the developed image by the transfer device. The cleaning blade is constituted by a member in which at least a part which is brought into contact with the image holding member has a dynamic micro hardness of from 0.25 to 0.65 and the maximum length hereinafter also simply referred to as tuck amount of the area which is brought into contact with the image holding member in a driving direction of the image holding member is from 1 m to 300 m.

In addition the process cartridge according to the exemplary embodiment is detachable from the image forming apparatus and is provided with the image holding member the developing device and the cleaning device.

Hitherto in cleaning blades which clean surfaces of image holding members in image forming apparatuses in some cases chips have occurred in a part which is brought into contact with the image holding member and slipping of materials such as a toner adhering to the surface of the image holding member have occurred at positions at which the chips have occurred. Therefore it is preferable to suppress the occurrence of chips in the cleaning blade.

On the other hand in the exemplary embodiment a part of the cleaning blade which is brought into contact with the image holding member is constituted by a member having a dynamic micro hardness in the above range and the tuck amount is adjusted in the above range. Here tuck amount represents a maximum length of the area which is brought into contact with the image holding member in the driving direction in a state in which kinetic friction occurs in the part in which the cleaning blade and the image holding member are brought into contact with each other when the image holding member is driven and the cleaning blade rolls in the driving direction due to the kinetic friction. The tuck amount is a hardness of the part of the cleaning blade which is brought into contact with the image holding member and a numerical value varying due to the frictional force between the cleaning blade and the image holding member to be described in detail and the like.

When the cleaning blade satisfies the requirements for the hardness and the tuck amount the size the maximum size of a hole when viewed in the driving direction of the image holding member of chips occurring in the cleaning blade is suppressed. Specifically the size is suppressed to from 10 m to 50 m.

However in some cases even when the size of the chips in the cleaning blade is suppressed in the above range toner slipping occurs due to the reason that toner particles having a particle size smaller than the size of the chips are used smaller debris are generated due to breaking of toner particles or the like. Therefore it is preferable for the image forming apparatus to suppress toner slipping.

On the other hand in the exemplary embodiment as a toner which is accommodated in the developing device a toner to which an external additive having an average particle size in the above range and selected from metallic soap particles and inorganic particles having an oil treated surface is externally added is used. When an external additive which satisfies the above requirements is applied with respect to chips having a size suppressed in the above range toner slipping resulting from the chips of the cleaning blade is effectively suppressed and favorable cleaning performance is obtained.

The reason that the above described effects are obtained is not clear but presumed that the external additive isolated from the toner particles is accumulated and forms a dam on the upstream side of the part in which the cleaning blade and the image holding member are brought into contact with each other and the dam effectively fills a chip when the size of the chip is in the above range and thus toner slipping is suppressed.

In addition the cleaning blade is directly fixed to the frame member in the cleaning device in but not limited thereto. The cleaning blade may be fixed to the frame member with a spring member interposed therebetween.

The cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment is constituted by a member in which a part which is brought into contact with at least the photoreceptor drum image holding member has a dynamic micro hardness of from 0.25 to 0.65 and the tuck amount is from 1 m to 300 m.

In this description apart of the cleaning blade which is brought into contact with a member to be cleaned will be referred to as contact member . That is the cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment may be formed only of the contact member.

In addition when the cleaning blade is constituted so that materials of the contact member and an area other than the contact member are different from each other a member constituting the area other than the contact member will be referred to as non contact member . The non contact member may be made of one type of material or constituted by two or more types of members made of different materials.

Here the configuration of the cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment will be described in detail using the drawings. is a schematic diagram showing a cleaning blade according to a first exemplary embodiment and shows a state in which the cleaning blade is brought into contact with the surface of the photoreceptor drum. In addition is a diagram showing a cleaning blade according to a second exemplary embodiment and is a diagram showing a state in which a cleaning blade according to a third exemplary embodiment is brought into contact with the surface of the photoreceptor drum.

Here in regarding respective parts of the cleaning blade an angular part which is brought into contact with the photoreceptor drum which is driven in the direction of the arrow A to clean a surface of the photoreceptor drum will be referred to as a contact angular part A a surface one side of which is constituted by the contact angular part A which faces the upstream side in the driving direction direction of the arrow A will be referred to as a tip end surface B a surface one side of which is constituted by the contact angular part A which faces the downstream side in the driving direction direction of the arrow A will be referred to as a ventral surface C and a surface one side of which is shared with the tip end surface B which is opposed to the ventral surface C will be referred to as a rear surface D. In addition a direction parallel to the contact angular part A that is a direction from the front toward the inside in will be referred to as a depth direction a direction from the contact angular part A toward a side on which the tip end surface B is formed will be referred to as a thickness direction and a direction from the contact angular part A toward a side on which the ventral surface C is formed will be referred to as a width direction.

In addition to a part which is brought into contact with the photoreceptor drum that is the contact angular part A the entire cleaning blade A according to the first exemplary embodiment shown in is made of a single material i.e. formed only of a contact member.

The cleaning blade B according to the exemplary embodiment may have a two layer configuration in which a first layer B which is formed over the entire surface of the ventral surface C and is formed of a contact member with a part which is brought into contact with the photoreceptor drum that is the contact angular part A included therein and a second layer B which is formed closer to the rear surface D than the first layer and acts as a rear layer made of a material different from that of the contact member are provided as in the second exemplary embodiment shown in .

Furthermore the cleaning blade C according to the exemplary embodiment may have a configuration provided with a contact member edge member C formed of a contact member which has a shape in which a cylinder cut into a quarter extends in the depth direction with a part which is brought into contact with the photoreceptor drum that is the contact angular part A included therein and in which the right angular part of the shape forms the contact angular part A and a rear member C which covers the rear surface D in the thickness direction of the contact member C and the opposite side to the tip end surface B in the width direction that is constitutes a part other than the contact member C and is made of a material different from that of the contact member as in the third exemplary embodiment shown in .

In the cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment the maximum length tuck amount of the area which is brought into contact with the image holding member in the driving direction of the image holding member is from 1 m to 300 m.

As shown in tuck amount represents a maximum length T in of the area which is brought into contact with the photoreceptor drum in the driving direction in a state in which kinetic friction occurs in the part in which the cleaning blade and the photoreceptor drum are brought into contact with each other when the photoreceptor drum image holding member is driven and the cleaning blade rolls in the driving direction due to the kinetic friction.

When the tuck amount exceeds the above upper limit value the size of chips occurring in the cleaning blade is not suppressed and chips having a size exceeding 50 m may occur. On the other hand it is disadvantageous that the tuck amount is less than the above lower limit value because a sufficient adhesion property may not be obtained and cleaning errors occur.

The image forming apparatus is driven until a scratch is formed on the surface of the image holding member by the cleaning blade and the width of the scratch is measured to measure the tuck amount.

The method of controlling the tuck amount is not particularly limited but examples thereof include the following method.

For example there is a tendency that the lower the hardness of the part which is brought into contact with the image holding member of the cleaning blade the greater the tuck amount.

In addition there is a tendency that the greater the frictional force between the cleaning blade and the image holding member the greater the tuck amount.

The frictional force is adjusted with the material of a part of the cleaning blade which is brought into contact with the image holding member the type and amount of a lubricant lubricant as an external additive which is added to the toner present on the surface of the image holding member the pressing force of the cleaning blade against the image holding member the hardness and roughness of the image holding member and the like.

In addition the pressing force is adjusted with a length of the cleaning blade digging deeply into the image holding member an angle W A Working Angle at the part in which the cleaning blade and the image holding member are brought into contact with each other the impact resilience of the entire cleaning blade the Young s modulus and the like.

The dynamic micro hardness of the contact member of the cleaning blade is from 0.25 to 0.65. When the dynamic micro hardness is less than the above lower limit value the hardness of the contact member is insufficient whereby the size of chips occurring in the cleaning blade is not suppressed and chips having a size exceeding 50 m may occur. On the other hand when the dynamic micro hardness exceeds the above upper limit value the contact member becomes too hard whereby the cleaning blade does not follow a member to be cleaned which is driven and a favorable cleaning property may not be obtained.

In addition the dynamic micro hardness of the contact member of the cleaning blade is a hardness which is calculated by the following expression from a test load P mN and a push in depth D m when advancing an indenter into a sample at a constant push in speed mN s . Expression 

The dynamic micro hardness is measured by a dynamic micro hardness meter DUH W201S manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation . The dynamic micro hardness is obtained by measuring a push in depth D when advancing a diamond triangular pyramid indenter angle between edges 115 3.8584 at a push in speed of 0.047399 mN s with a test load of 4.0 mN under the environment of 23 C. through soft material measurement.

Generally a part of the cleaning blade which is brought into contact with a member to be cleaned is an angular part. Therefore from the viewpoint of performing the measurement at a position in which the triangular pyramid indenter is pushed actual measurement positions are deviated from the angular part by 0.5 mm on a surface ventral surface one side of which is constituted by the angular part which faces the downstream side in the driving direction in a state in which the angular part is brought into contact with a member to be cleaned. In addition the measurement is performed at arbitrary five positions of the above measurement positions to set an average value thereof as a dynamic micro hardness.

The method of controlling the dynamic micro hardness of the contact member is not particularly limited but examples thereof include the following method.

For example when the material of the contact member of the cleaning blade is polyurethane there is a tendency that the dynamic micro hardness increases by increasing the crystalline property of the polyurethane.

In addition there is a tendency that the dynamic micro hardness increases by increasing a chemical crosslink increasing a crosslink point .

Furthermore there is a tendency that the dynamic micro hardness increases by increasing a hard segment amount.

A composition of the contact member constituting a part which is brought into contact with at least a member to be cleaned in the cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment will be described.

The contact member of the cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment is not particularly limited as long as the above described dynamic micro hardness is satisfied. Examples of the material of the contact member include polyurethane rubber silicon rubber fluororubber propylene rubber butadiene rubber and the like. From the viewpoint of satisfying the requirement for the dynamic micro hardness polyurethane rubber is preferable and particularly highly crystallized polyurethane rubber is more preferable.

Examples of the method of increasing the crystalline property of polyurethane include a method of growing hard segment aggregates in the polyurethane. Specifically adjustment is performed so that a physical crosslink a crosslink by a hydrogen bond between hard segments more efficiently proceeds than a chemical crosslink a crosslink by a crosslinking agent in the formation of a crosslinked structure of the polyurethane whereby an environment is formed in which the hard segment aggregates are more easily grown. In addition in the polymerization of polyurethane the lower the polymerization temperature is set the aging time increases and as a result there is a tendency that the physical crosslink more significantly proceeds.

Examples of the indicator of the crystalline property include an endothermic peak top temperature melting temperature . In the cleaning blade according to the exemplary embodiment an endothermic peak top temperature melting temperature which is obtained by differential scanning calorimetry DSC is preferably 180 C. or higher more preferably 185 C. or higher and even more preferably 190 C. or higher. The upper limit value thereof is preferably 220 C. or lower more preferably 215 C. or lower and even more preferably 210 C. or lower.

The endothermic peak top temperature melting temperature is measured by differential scanning calorimetry DSC according to ASTMD 3418 99. Diamond DSC manufactured by PerkinElmer Co. Ltd. is used in the measurement melting temperatures of indium and zinc are used in the correction of the temperature of the device detector and melting heat of indium is used in the correction of the calorific value. A pan made of aluminum is used as a measurement sample and a hollow pan is set for comparison to perform the measurement.

In addition in the exemplary embodiment polyurethane rubber has hard segments and soft segments and an average particle size of aggregates of the hard segments is preferably from 5 m to 20 m.

When the average particle size of the aggregates of the hard segments is 5 m or greater the crystal area on the blade surface increases and there is an advantage in that the sliding property is improved. When the average particle size of the aggregates of the hard segments is 20 m or less the friction is maintained low and there is an advantage in that toughness chipping resistant property is not lost.

The above average particle size is more preferably from 5 m to 15 m and even more preferably from 5 m to 10 m.

In addition the particle size distribution standard deviation of the aggregates of the hard segments is preferably 2 or greater.

The fact that the particle size distribution standard deviation of the aggregates of the hard segments is 2 or greater indicates that particles having various particle sizes are mixed. A high hardness effect which is generated due to an increase in contact area with the soft segments is obtained due to small aggregates and a sliding property improving effect is obtained due to large aggregates.

The particle size distribution standard deviation a is more preferably from 2 to 5 and even more preferably from 2 to 3.

The average particle size and the particle size distribution of the hard segment aggregates are measured by the following method. An image is taken at 20 fold magnification using a polarization microscope BX51 P manufactured by Olympus Corporation and subjected to an image process to binarize the image and particle sizes are measured at five points per one cleaning blade five aggregates are measured per one point and the measurement is performed on twenty cleaning blades. The average particle size is calculated from total 500 aggregates.

Regarding the image binarization thresholds of a hue a saturation and an intensity are adjusted using image process software OLYMPUS Stream essentials manufactured by Olympus Corporation so that crystal parts become black and amorphous parts become white.

In addition the particle size distribution standard deviation is calculated by the following expression from the measured 500 particle sizes. Standard Deviation 1 2 . . . 500 500

The method of controlling the particle size and the particle size distribution standard deviation a of the hard segment aggregates in the above range is not particularly limited but examples thereof include reaction control by a catalyst three dimensional network control by a crosslinking agent crystal growth control by aging conditions and the like.

Generally polyurethane rubber is synthesized by polymerizing polyisocyanate and polyol. In addition a resin having a functional group which may react with an isocyanate group other than polyol may be used. Polyurethane rubber preferably has hard segments and soft segments.

Here hard segments and soft segments mean segments in which in a polyurethane rubber material a material constituting the former is relatively harder than a material constituting the latter and the material constituting the latter is relatively softer than the material constituting the former.

The combination of the material hard segment material constituting the hard segments and the material soft segment material constituting the soft segments is not particularly limited and the materials may be selected from known resin materials so that one material is relatively harder than the other material and the other material is relatively softer than the one material. However in the exemplary embodiment the following combination is preferable.

First examples of polyols as the soft segment material include polyester polyols which are obtained by dehydration condensation of diols and dibasic acids polycarbonate polyols which are obtained by the reaction of diols and alkyl carbonates polycaprolactone polyols polyether polyols and the like. Examples of commercialized products of the polyols which are used as the soft segment material include PLACCEL 205 PLACCEL 240 and the like manufactured by Daicel Corporation.

In addition as the hard segment material a resin having a functional group which may react with an isocyanate group is preferably used. In addition the hard segment material is preferably a flexible resin and more preferably an aliphatic resin having a straight chain structure from the viewpoint of flexibility. As a specific example thereof an acrylic resin including two or more hydroxyl groups a polybutadiene resin including two or more hydroxyl groups an epoxy resin having two or more epoxy groups or the like is preferably used.

Examples of commercialized products of the acrylic resin including two or more hydroxyl groups include Actflow grade UMB 20058 UMB 2005P UMB 2005 UME 2005 and the like manufactured by Soken Chemical Engineering Co. Ltd.

Examples of commercialized products of the polybutadiene resin including two or more hydroxyl groups include R 45HT manufactured by Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd. and the like.

The epoxy resin having two or more epoxy groups is preferably not hard and fragile as in the cases of general epoxy resins in the related art but more flexible and tougher than epoxy resins in the related art. For example as for the molecular structure the epoxy resin preferably has a structure flexible skeleton in which in a main chain structure thereof mobility of a main chain may be increased. Examples of the flexible skeleton include an alkylene skeleton a cycloalkane skeleton a polyoxyalkylene skeleton and the like and particularly a polyoxyalkylene skeleton is preferable.

In addition as for the physical property the epoxy resin having a low viscosity in proportion to the molecular weight is more preferable than epoxy resins in the related art. Specifically the weight average molecular weight is in the range of 900 100 and the viscosity at 25 C. is preferably in the range of 15000 5000 mPa s and more preferably in the range of 15000 3000 mPa s. Examples of commercialized products of the epoxy resin having this characteristic include EPLICON EXA 4850 150 manufactured by DIC and the like.

When the hard segment material and the soft segment material are used the weight ratio hereinafter referred to as hard segment material ratio of the material constituting the hard segments with respect to the total amount of the hard segment material and the soft segment material is preferably from 10 wt to 30 wt more preferably from 13 wt to 23 wt and even more preferably from 15 wt to 20 wt .

When the hard segment material ratio is 10 wt or greater an abrasion resistant property is obtained and a favorable cleaning property is maintained over a long period of time. When the hard segment material ratio is 30 wt or less the material does not become too hard thus flexibility and extensibility are obtained and occurrence of chips is suppressed. Thus a favorable cleaning property is maintained over a long period of time.

Examples of polyisocyanate which is used in synthesis of polyurethane rubber include 4 4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI 2 6 toluene diisocyanate TDI 1 6 hexane diisocyanate HDI 1 5 naphthalene diisocyanate NDI 3 3 dimethylphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate TODI and the like.

From the viewpoint of ease of the formation of hard segment aggregates having a desired size particle size 4 4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI 1 5 naphthalene diisocyanate NDI hexanemethylene diisocyanate HDI are preferable as polyisocyanate.

The blending amount of polyisocyanate with respect to 100 parts by weight of a resin having a functional group which may react with an isocyanate group is preferably from 20 parts by weight to 40 parts by weight more preferably from 20 parts by weight to 35 parts by weight and even more preferably from 20 parts by weight to 30 parts by weight.

When the blending amount is 20 parts by weight or greater a large urethane bonding amount is secured and thus hard segments grow and a desired hardness is obtained. When the blending amount is 40 parts by weight or less the size of hard segments does not excessively increase extensibility is obtained and occurrence of chips in the cleaning blade is suppressed.

Examples of the crosslinking agent include dios bifunctional triols trifunctional tetraols tetrafunctional and the like. In addition amine based compounds may be used as the crosslinking agent. In addition a tri or more functional crosslinking agent is preferably used for crosslinking. Examples of trifunctional crosslinking agents include trimethylolpropane glycerin triisopropanolamine and the like.

The blending amount of the crosslinking agent with respect to 100 parts by weight of a resin having a functional group which may react with an isocyanate group is preferably 2 parts by weight or less. When the blending amount is 2 parts by weight or less hard segments derived from the urethane bond by aging grow very much without molecular movement restrained by a chemical crosslink and a desired hardness is easily obtained.

For manufacturing a polyurethane rubber member constituting the contact member according to the exemplary embodiment a general polyurethane manufacturing method such as a prepolymer method or a one shot method is used. In the exemplary embodiment the prepolymer method is preferable because polyurethane having an excellent strength and an excellent abrasion resistant property is obtained. However the invention is not limited to the manufacturing method.

As the method of controlling the endothermic peak top temperature melting temperature in the contact member in the above range a method of increasing and controlling the crystalline property of the polyurethane member in an appropriate range is exemplified and examples thereof include a method of growing hard segment aggregates in polyurethane. Specific examples thereof include a method of performing adjustment polyurethane so that a physical crosslink a crosslink by a hydrogen bond between hard segments more efficiently proceeds than a chemical crosslink a crosslink by a crosslinking agent in the formation of a crosslinked structure of polyurethane. In the polymerization of polyurethane the lower the polymerization temperature is set the aging time increases and as a result there is a tendency that the physical crosslink more significantly proceeds.

An isocyanate compound a crosslinking agent and the like are blended with the above described polyol to mold the polyurethane rubber member under molding conditions in which unevenness in molecular arrangement may be suppressed.

Specifically when adjusting a polyurethane composition the temperature of polyol or prepolymer or the temperature of hardening molding is reduced to perform the adjustment so that the crosslinking slowly proceeds. When these temperatures temperature of polyol or prepolymer and temperature of hardening molding are set to be low and the reactivity is thus lowered the urethane bonding part aggregates and crystals of hard segments are obtained. Thus the temperature is adjusted so that the particle size of the hard segment aggregates becomes a desired crystal size.

In the case of the thermoplastic resin examples thereof include polyolefin based resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene polyvinyl and polyvinylidene based resins such as polystyrene an acrylic resin polyacrylonitrile polyvinyl acetate polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl butyral polyvinyl chloride polyvinyl carbazol polyvinyl ether and polyvinyl ketone vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymers styrene acrylic acid copolymers straight silicon resins constituted with an organosiloxane bond or modified products thereof fluoride resins such as polytetrafluoroethylene polyvinyl fluoride polyvinylidene fluoride and polychlorotrifluoroethylene polyester polycarbonate and the like.

Examples of the thermosetting resin include a phenol resin amino resins such as a urea formaldehyde resin a melamine resin a benzoguanamine resin a urea resin and a polyamide resin an epoxy resin and the like.

The average thickness of the resin covering layer is preferably from 0.1 m to 5 m more preferably from 0.3 m to 3.0 m and even more preferably from 0.3 m to 2.0 m.

The method of manufacturing the carrier is not particularly limited and known carrier manufacturing methods in the related art are used. However the following manufacturing methods are preferable.

That is examples thereof include a dipping method in which a resin covering layer forming solution solution including a matrix resin which forms the resin covering layer and as necessary conductive particles resin particles for charging control and the like is prepared and a core is dipped in the resin covering layer forming solution a spraying method of spraying a resin covering layer forming solution to a surface of a core a fluid bed method of spraying a resin covering layer forming solution in a state in which a core floats by flowing air a kneader coater method in which a core and a resin covering layer forming solution are mixed in a kneader coater and then a solvent is removed and the like. However the method is not particularly limited to using a solution. For example depending on the type of the core of the carrier a powder application method in which a core and a resin powder are heated and mixed together or the like may be employed. Furthermore after formation of the resin covering layer a heat treatment may be performed by a device such as an electric furnace a kiln or the like.

In addition the solvent which is used in the resin covering layer forming solution for forming the resin covering layer is not particularly limited as long as it dissolves the resin. Examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene and toluene ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane halides such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride and the like.

The volume average particle size of the carrier is preferably from 25 m to 100 m more preferably from 25 m to 80 m and even more preferably from 25 m to 60 m.

Here the volume average particle size of the carrier indicates a value measured using a laser diffraction scattering type particle size distribution measuring device LS Particle Size Analyzer LS13 320 manufactured by BECKMAN COULTER . A volume cumulative distribution is drawn from the smallest particle diameter side with respect to particle size ranges channels divided on the obtained particle size distribution and the particle size corresponding to an accumulation of 50 of all the nuclei is defined as a volume average particle size D.
