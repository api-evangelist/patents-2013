Preparation of ABT 869 and its utility as a PTK inhibitor is described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7 297 709.

The following examples are presented to provide what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of procedures and conceptual aspects of this invention.

A mixture of ABT 869 hydrochloride in ethyl acetate and ethanol in which the ABT 869 hydrochloride was completely soluble was mixed with dibasic sodium phosphate. The organic layer was separated treated with decolorizing carbon and filtered. A small quantity of L ascorbic acid was added and the solution was concentrated. The ethyl acetate was removed by azeotropic distillation with ethanol. Additional ethanol may be added and the solution heated to dissolve any solid that forms. The solution was cooled to 25 C. and diluted with water causing ABT 869 Ethanolate Crystalline Form 1 to crystallize. The product was isolated washed with water and dried under reduced pressure while monitoring residual ethyl acetate and ethanol by gas chromatography GC and water by Karl Fischer KF . A yield of 92 is typical.

Following the neutralization with dibasic sodium phosphate decolorizing carbon treatment and the removal of ethyl acetate as described in EXAMPLE 1 the mixture of ABT 869 in ethanol was gradually mixed with water at 25 C. with vigorous agitation. ABT 869.HO Crystalline Form 1 was isolated washed with water and dried under reduced pressure while monitoring residual ethyl acetate and ethanol by GC and water by KF . The dried material may be delumped milled to control particle size. A yield of 76 is typical.

This process was modified from the current process by adding a cosolvent to reduce the volume of the crystallization process.

Currently the process uses a solution of ABT 869 dissolved in ethanol. This solution is slowly added to water. The current process requires a final volume of 220 ml solvent g ABT 869.

By adding acetic acid to the ethanol ABT 869 solution a more concentrated solution of ABT 869 can be made reducing the final solvent volume to 60 80 ml solvent g ABT 869. Because of equipment constraints the more concentrated solution of ABT 869 allows for better mixing as well which helps to ensure the desired crystal formation.

100 g of ABT 869 was dissolved in a mixture of 590 g ethanol 200 proof and 771 g of glacial acetic acid. 575 mg of ascorbic acid was added to avoid degradation of the product. The solution was stirred until all the solids dissolve. If necessary slight heating not more than 30 oC for 30 min can be used to assist dissolution. The solution was cooled to 25 oC.

4430 g of water was added to a glass lined jacketed reactor fitted with a retreat curve impeller. Additional baffling can be used to help mixing efficiency. The reactor was fitted with an addition tube with an outlet located above the surface of the liquid. The addition tube was situated so liquid will freely fall to the surface of the water and not drip down the sides of the reactor or the shaft of the impeller . The tip of the addition tube should not be subsurface at any point during the addition. Reactor temperature was maintained at 25 C. 5 C.

A diaphragm pump or syringe pump was used to slowly add the solution of ABT 869 to the reactor. The solution was added through an inline filter to prevent addition of undissolved solids. The addition was completed at a constant addition rate over the course of not less than two hours. It is critical that the agitation in the reactor be high 500 rpm in a 250 ml to be safe reactor. If the agitation is too low or the rate of addition is too high it is possible to nucleate a different crystal form. 

White solid appeared as soon as the ABT 869 solution contacts the water. Through the course of addition the slurry thickens During the addition samples can be taken to check the crystal form by x ray.

To ensure desupersaturation the mixture was stirred for not less than 1 hr. Samples can be taken to ensure the concentration in the liquors is correct.

Different solvents or solvent mixtures can be used to make the ABT 896 solution including ethanol N methylpyrrolidone NMP dimethylformamide DMF ethanol NMP ethanol acetic acid ethanol ethyl acetate and ethanol DMF as are commercially available through Sigma Aldrich. Suitable solvents used in the process are any that do not phase separate with water and does not degrade ABT 869. Depending on the solvent used the amount of water used in the process may have to be adjusted. Currently the process requires that the final solvent composition be 75 water in order to ensure that the correct crystal form be nucleated.

This process started with a solid ABT 869 sample. If ABT 869 is coming from a solution then a solvent switch into ethanol acetic acid is necessary.

Powder X ray diffraction PXRD analysis of samples was conducted in the following manner. Samples were prepared by spreading the sample powder in a thin layer on an aluminum sample holder and gently flattening the sample with a microscope slide. Diffraction patterns were collected at ambient temperature and environmental conditions using an Inel G3000 diffractometer equipped with an incident beam germanium monochromator to provide Cu Kradiation. The X ray generator was operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The Inel G3000 is equipped with a position sensitive detector that monitors all diffraction data simultaneously. The detector was calibrated by collecting the attenuated direct beam for seven seconds in 1 degree intervals across a 90 degree two theta range. The calibration was checked against a silicon line position reference standard NIST 640c .

It is meant to be understood that relative intensities of peak heights and or peak positions in a PXRD pattern may vary and will be dependent on variables such as the temperature size of crystal size or morphology sample preparation or sample height in the analysis well of the X ray diffractometer.

It is also meant to be understood that peak positions may vary when measured with different radiation sources. For example Cu K Mo K Co K and Fe K radiation having wavelengths of 1.54060 0.7107 1.7902 and 1.9373 respectively may provide peak positions which differ from those measured with Cu K radiation which has a wavelength of 1.5478 .

The term about preceding a series of peak positions means that all of the peaks of the group which it precedes are reported in terms of angular positions two theta with an allowable variability of 0.1 as specified by the U.S. Pharmacopeia pages 1843 1884 1995 . The variability of 0.1 is intended to be used when comparing two powder X ray diffraction patterns. In practice if a diffraction pattern peak from one pattern is assigned a range of angular positions two theta which is the measured peak position 0.1 and if those ranges of peak positions overlap then the two peaks are considered to have the same angular position. For example if a peak from one pattern is determined to have a position of 11.0 for comparison purposes the allowable variability allows the peak to be assigned a position in the range of 10.9. 11.1 .

Accordingly for example the phrase about 6.2 12.0 12.4 12.8 13.4 14.2 15.2 15.6 16.2 and 19.7 as used herein means about 6.2 about 12.0 about 12.4 about 12.8 about 13.4 about 14.2 about 15.2 about 15.6 about 16.2 and about 19.7 which in turn means 6.2 0.1 12.0 0.1 12.4 0.1 12.8 0.1 13.4 0.1 14.2 0.1 15.2 0.1 15.6 0.1 16.2 0.1 and 19.7 0.1 .

The term about preceding a temperature means the given temperature 2 C. For example about 25 C. means 25 C. 2 C. or 23 C. 27 C.

Heat flow was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter model 2920 with Thermal Advantage version 1. 1A operating software TA Instruments New Castle Del. . A sample 1 4 mg was weighed into an aluminum pan and the pan was covered with and aluminum lid containing a pinhole to allow vapor to escape. The partially sealed pan was placed in the furnace and heated in an open pan at a rate of 10 C. min. Indium standards were used for temperature and heat of fusion calibration. Data analysis was performed using separate software Universal Analysis for Windows 2000 XP version 4.2E TA Instruments New Castle Del. .

Thermogravimetric analysis TGA data show that the solid loses 2.9 weight below 70 C. The weight loss from the solid corresponds to a broad endotherm in the differential scanning calorimetry DSC thermogram. The solid has an apparent melting endotherm with an extrapolated onset of 182.1 C.

The foregoing is meant to be illustrative of the invention and not intended to limit it to the disclosed embodiments. Variations and changes obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope and nature of the invention as defined in the claims.
