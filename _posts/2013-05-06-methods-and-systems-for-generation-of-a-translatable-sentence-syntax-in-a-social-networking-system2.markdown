Various embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to providing users with social networking experiences and in particular to generate social expressions in a social networking system.

The majority of people around the globe are now connected online through social networking systems. A networking system may generate and maintain a social graph that comprises a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node represents an object e.g. place movie etc. in the social networking system. The object may include a user object. Each of the plurality of edges represents a specific kind of connection between two nodes.

This structured data can be useful for rendering a meaningful experience for users of the networking system. Developers can publish new content to the social graph to extend structured data and link the objects with edges in the social graph. Users can query and generate graph searches within the structured data.

There are more than 6 000 living languages spoken in the world today. However the dominant language of many popular social networking sites is still English. Not all languages have a single word to word or phrase to phrase translation that maps with English or other languages. When third party developers create applications that publish new content to the social graph machine generated translations of these applications expressions used to render the structured social graph data in feed stories search results and other types of experiences may lead to awkward or inaccurately translated sentences and experiences.

Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a variety of methods and systems for customizing translations of sentences for representing relationships or actions performed by actors through an application running on a social networking system. The sentences are published by applications to the social graph. These sentences can appear in news feed stories search results profile stories or in other experiences that occur on or off a social network system. In one embodiment actors may be represented as objects in a social network system and actions or relationships may be represented as edges. Typically a default sentence structure includes an actor the edge the target that the actor interacted with and the application that published the sentence on the social network system on behalf of the actor. For example the following story may be published to the social network system Nair finished reading The Name of the Wind on MyReader. In this example the actor is Nair the edge is finished reading the target is The Name of the Wind a book and the application is MyReader. 

In certain circumstances a translation of the default sentence structure may not be accurately translated into another language without further information about the actor edge target application or any combination thereof. For example a person may indicate in English that she greeted Sam the published sentence in English thus may be Naya greeted Sam. In this example Naya is the actor greeted is the edge and Sam is the target. However when this sentence is translated into other languages information such as the age and or gender of the actor may be necessary. For example the verb form of greeted may be different depending on the gender of the actor. In other examples translation into other languages may require information such as the relative ages between the actor and the target. Additional words may need to be added when the actor e.g. Naya is younger than Sam .

An internationalization system as described herein includes a platform having a developer interface for customizing the syntax of a sentence for translation into another language when the sentence is published by the social networking system. The translatable sentence syntax is described herein as an internationalized sentence syntax. The developer interface enables developers to customize these internationalized sentence syntaxes for specific applications interfacing with the social graph. The developer interface may provide options for the developer to define an internationalized sentence syntax and translate expressions through the internationalized sentence syntax into one or more languages. The application developer can select on the developer interface one or more languages including a primary language associated with the specific application.

The application developer can define an actor edge and or target of the internationalized sentence syntax as tokens by typing the tokens into corresponding text boxes. In some embodiments the application can select a specific sentence from published information detail page or posted comments by graying out the corresponding texts. The internationalization system may analyze the grammar of the selected sentence to extract actor edge and or target of the specific sentence.

In some embodiments the developer interface provides a language token for the developer to specify the languages to publish the internationalized sentence syntax. The language token may include a check box list a select language drop down menu a selection list a list of buttons multiple layered menu levels or any combination thereof. Languages in the language token can be presented in the alphabetical order of the languages first letters. In some embodiments the languages are presented in hierarchy of their relevancy to the application developer or the application itself.

In some embodiments a gender token is provided for the developer to define the gender of an actor of the internationalized sentence syntax. The internationalized sentence syntax can be translated based on an actor s specific gender.

In some embodiments a target token is provided for the developer to determine whether a target of the sentence is possessive or nominative. In some languages the actual name of a person possessing a target may change depending on whether the target is possessive or nominative.

Depending on the user selected languages a viewer token may be provided for the developer to select the gender and or seniority of the targeted viewers. The translations of the internationalized sentence syntax may be tailored to the targeted viewers.

In some embodiments a number token is provided for each number that is recited in the internationalized sentence syntax. The number token enables the developer to select a plural type of the number. Numbers may have different plural types in some languages. In some embodiments the developer interface can automatically detect the plural type of numbers in the internationalized sentence syntax based on the languages selected by the developer.

In some embodiments the social networking system stores published sentences and their corresponding translations in other languages in a cache storage. When the internationalized sentence syntax is defined by the developer the social networking system can search the cache storage for translations of the internationalized sentence syntax and its variations. The search results can then be presented on the social networking system based on their relevance to a viewer user the application or to the developer.

In some embodiments translations stored in the social networking system can be dynamically expanded. A raw sentence that corresponds to the internationalized sentence syntax can be generated by the social networking system and provided to a third party for translations into other languages. Upon completion the translations of the raw sentence can then be provided back to the social networking system. In some embodiments translations from the third party are provided through a bulk hash that allows the third party to continue adding variations of the translations.

In some embodiments the application may be configured to automatically detect a primary language of a viewer of the translated sentence based on browser setup the viewer profile activities of the viewer in the social networking system etc.

While multiple embodiments are disclosed still other embodiments of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. As will be realized the invention is capable of modifications in various aspects all without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.

The drawings have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be expanded or reduced to help improve the understanding of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Similarly some components and or operations may be separated into different blocks or combined into a single block for the purposes of discussion of some of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Moreover while the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. The intention however is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to providing users with social networking experiences. More specifically various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for providing a developer interface to define an internationalized sentence syntax for one or more languages and publishing a translated sentence using the internationalized sentence syntax through an application on a social networking system.

The developer interface may include various options including a plurality of tokens for the developer to define for the internationalized sentence syntax. Each token may correspond to a supported language of the one or more languages. The token allows for run time selection of word variations based on attributes of an actor an edge a target or a viewer of the internationalized sentence syntax. The plurality of tokens may include but not limited to a language token a gender token a target token a number token a viewer token or any combination thereof.

While examples described herein refer to a networking system the descriptions should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present disclosure. Various alternatives modifications and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without varying from the spirit of the invention. For example generation of a translatable sentence syntax may be implemented on any user device in publishing an application and or posting a comment or any computing system for providing a service to users. For another example the generation of these syntaxes may be implemented in any computing system having a web server system. The web server system may include a database management system DBMS such as HBase MySQL FoxPro IBM DB2 Linter Microsoft SQL Server Oracle PostgreSQL and SQLite etc.

One or more methods operating the social networking system to generate internationalized sentence syntaxes may be implemented by modules and stores described below. The modules may be implemented as hardware components software modules or any combination thereof. For example the modules described can be software modules implemented as instructions on a non transitory memory capable of being executed by a processor or a controller on a machine.

Each of the modules may operate individually and independently of other modules. Some or all of the modules may be executed on the same host device or on separate devices. The separate devices can be coupled via a communication module to coordinate its operations. Some or all of the modules may be combined as one module. A single module may also be divided into sub modules each sub module performing separate method step or method steps of the single module. The modules can share access to a memory space. One module may access data accessed by or transformed by another module. The modules may be considered coupled to one another if they share a physical connection or a virtual connection directly or indirectly allowing data accessed or modified from one module to be accessed in another module. The social networking system may include additional fewer or different modules for various applications.

The storages or stores described below are hardware components or portions of hardware components for storing digital data such as by running a network accessible database. Each of the storage can be a single physical entity or distributed through multiple physical devices. Each of the storage can be on separate physical device or share the same physical device or devices. Each of the stores can allocate specific storage spaces for run time applications.

The social networking system may include an internationalization system . The internationalization system assists a developer of a social networking application that may run on the social networking system . The social networking application may also run as an external module on a separate server system as the social networking system . The social networking application may then communicate with the social networking system via a graph application programming interface API server of the social networking system as described below. The social networking application is a module that provides additional features for the users of the social networking system . Part of the social networking application may be to interact with users by publishing sentences describing the evolution of the social graph within the social networking system .

The internationalization system includes a developer interface module that generates and provides a developer interface for configuring internationalized sentence syntaxes on a developer device such as a computer system or an electronic device with computer functionalities. For example the developer interface enables a developer to generate an internationalized sentence syntax that may be used to generate and publish translated sentences by the social networking application . For example the developer interface enables the developer to insert tokens associated with actors such as the actor edges such as the edge targets such as the target additional constant or variable text templates or any combination thereof into the internationalized sentence syntax . The configuration of the internationalized sentence syntax may be stored as part of the social networking application on the internationalization system or both. The configuration of the internationalized sentence syntax may be based on sentence template store containing pre configured internationalized sentence syntaxes.

The developer interface further enables associating any germane attributes to any token within the internationalized sentence syntax . For example a particular language may require different phrasing of a natural language expression based on whether a token is a single item a pair of items or 3 items. In this example the developer interface enables the token to be tagged with a social graph attribute stating that the token can take on a value of 1 2 or 3 . Through the developer interface the developer can then specify how to phrase the internationalized sentence syntax for each case e.g. 1 2 or 3 .

The internationalization system further includes a sentence rendition module that renders run time instances of the internationalized sentence syntax . When the social networking application is executed the internationalized sentence syntax is used to render expressions of the social graph on behalf of the social networking application such as posting a news feed story or generating a mobile notification.

The internationalized sentence syntax may be organized by edge configurations. Each internationalized sentence syntax may be specific to an edge configuration. For example the social networking application can detect an actor based on a particular user logged on the social networking system that subscribes to or runs the social networking application . The actor may be the particular user friends of the particular user or any other actors relevant to the particular user as decided by the social networking system . Edges that fit the edge configuration of internationalized sentence syntax may be rendered into a rendered instance of an internationalized sentence syntax. In one embodiment the sentence rendition module is part of the social networking application .

The developer interface further enables the definition of multiple sentence configurations in the internationalized sentence syntax for different circumstances. The multiple sentence configurations allow for different renditions of the internationalized sentence syntax under different circumstances when rendered by the sentence rendition module . For example the different circumstances include when the internationalized sentence syntax is being rendered for a news feed is being rendered for a personal timeline or is being rendered as a search result. Aside from different forums another scenario where multiple sentence configurations may be used is in the context of aggregations of user edges. For example when a user has completed more than one hike in a week vs. when the user has hiked only once. The different circumstances can further include difference in timing of the edge configuration. For example the circumstances include when the edge denotes a relationship that has happened in the past e.g. Joe hiked Mt. Diablo trail when the edge denotes a relationship that is happening e.g. Joe started hiking Mt. Tam. or when the edge denotes a relationship is happening in the future e.g. Joe plans to travel to Italy in May .

The sentence rendition module can receive a request to render an expression of the edge of the social graph . The sentence rendition module can then select a supported language of the internationalized sentence syntax corresponding to a primary language of the viewer user. Then the sentence rendition module renders a natural language expression in the supported language based on an attribute of the edge or the objects e.g. the actor or the target connected to the edge . The rendering of the natural language expression includes matching the attribute to at least a token structure in the internationalized sentence syntax defined for the attribute by the developer. The sentence rendition module can then send the natural language expression for publishing in a forum of the social networking system.

An internationalization system can be utilized in any data sharing system. Particularly the internationalization system can be utilized in the social networking system such as a social networking system . Social networking systems commonly provide mechanisms allowing users to interact with objects and other users both within and external to the context of the social networking system. A social networking system user may be an individual or any other entity such as a business or other non person entity. The social networking system may utilize a web based interface comprising a series of inter connected pages displaying and allowing users to interact with social networking system objects and information. For example a social networking system may display a page for each social networking system user comprising objects and information entered by or related to the social networking system user e.g. the user s profile . Social networking systems may also contain pages containing pictures or videos dedicated to concepts dedicated to users with similar interests groups or containing communications or social networking system activity to from or by other users. Social networking system pages may contain links to other social networking system pages and may include additional capabilities such as search real time communication content item uploading purchasing advertising and any other web based technology or ability. It should be noted that a social networking system interface may be accessible from a web browser or a non web browser application such as a dedicated social networking system mobile device or computer application. Page as used herein may be a web page an application interface or display a widget displayed over a web page or application a box or other graphical interface an overlay window on another page whether within or outside the context of a social networking system or a web page external to the social networking system with a social networking system plug in or integration capabilities.

As discussed above a social graph includes a set of nodes representing social networking system objects also known as social objects interconnected by edges representing interactions activity or relatedness . Each node in the social graph may represent something that can act on and or be acted upon by another node. A social networking system object may be a social networking system user nonperson entity content item group social networking system page location application subject concept or other social networking system object such as a movie a band or a book. Content items include anything that a social networking system user or other object may create upload edit or interact with such as messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS short message service messages comment messages messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique an HTTP link HTML files images videos audio clips documents document edits calendar entries or events and other computer related files. Subjects and concepts in the context of a social graph comprise nodes that represent any person place thing or abstract idea. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the two nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node or which otherwise describes a relationship between the nodes objects.

A social networking system may allow a user to enter and display information related to the user s interests education and work experience contact information and other biographical information in the user s profile page. Each school employer interest for example music books movies television shows games political views philosophy religion groups or fan pages geographical location network or any other information contained in a profile page may be represented by a node in the social graph. A social networking system may allow a user to upload or create pictures videos documents songs or other content items and may allow a user to create and schedule events. Content items and events may be represented by nodes in the social graph.

A social networking system may provide a variety of means to interact with nonperson objects within the social networking system. For example a user may form or join groups or become a fan of a fan page within the social networking system. In addition a user may create download view upload link to tag edit or play a social networking system object. A user may interact with social networking system objects outside of the context of the social networking system. For example an article on a news web site might have a like button that users can click. In each of these instances the interaction between the user and the object may be represented by an edge in the social graph connecting the node of the user to the node of the object. A user may use location detection functionality such as a GPS receiver on a mobile device to check in to a particular location and an edge may connect the user s node with the location s node in the social graph.

Social networking systems allow users to associate themselves and establish connections with other users of the social networking system. When two users explicitly establish a connection in the social networking system they become friends or connections within the context of the social networking system. Being friends in a social networking system may allow users access to more information about each other than would otherwise be available to unconnected users. For instance being friends may allow a user to view another user s profile to see another user s friends or to view pictures of another user. Likewise becoming friends within a social networking system may allow a user greater access to communicate with another user such as by email internal and external to the social networking system instant message text message phone or any other communicative interface. Being friends may allow a user access to view comment on download endorse or otherwise interact with another user s uploaded content items. Establishing connections accessing user information communicating and interacting within the context of the social networking system may be represented by an edge between the nodes representing two social networking system users.

In addition to explicitly establishing a connection in the social networking system users with common characteristics may be considered connected such as a soft or implicit connection for the purposes of determining social context for use in determining the topic of communications. In one embodiment users who belong to a common network are considered connected. For example users who attend a common school work for a common company or belong to a common social networking system group may be considered connected. In one embodiment users with common biographical characteristics are considered connected. For example the geographic region users were born in or live in the age of users the gender of users and the relationship status of users may be used to determine whether users are connected. In one embodiment users with common interests are considered connected. For example users movie preferences music preferences political views religious views or any other interest may be used to determine whether users are connected. In one embodiment users who have taken a common action within the social networking system are considered connected. For example users who endorse or recommend a common object who comment on a common content item or who RSVP to a common event may be considered connected. A social networking system may utilize a social graph to determine users who are connected with a particular user in order to determine or evaluate the social context of the communications of the particular user as will be described below in greater detail.

A social networking system may provide a variety of communication channels to users. For example a social networking system may allow a user to email instant message or text SMS message one or more other users may allow a user to post a message to the user s wall or profile or another user s wall or profile may allow a user to post a message to a group or a fan page or may allow a user to comment on an image wall post or other content item created or uploaded by the user or another user. In one embodiment a user posts a status message to the user s profile indicating a current event state of mind thought feeling activity or any other present time relevant communication. A social networking system may allow users to communicate both within and external to the social networking system. For example a first user may send a second user a message within the social networking system an email through the social networking system an email external to but originating from the social networking system an instant message within the social networking system and an instant message external to but originating from the social networking system. Further a first user may comment on the profile page of a second user or may comment on objects associated with a second user such as content items uploaded by the second user.

Referring now to therein is shown a high level block diagram of a system environment suitable for a social networking system according to one embodiment. The system environment shown in includes the social networking system a client device A and a network channel . The system environment can include other client devices as well such as a client device B and a client device C. For example the client devices may include the developer device of . In other embodiments the system environment may include different and or additional components than those shown by . The social networking system can be the social networking system of .

The social networking system further described below comprises one or more computing devices storing user profiles associated with users and or other objects as well as connections between users and other users and or objects. In use users join the social networking system and then add connections to other users or objects of the social networking system to which they desire to be connected. As further described below in conjunction with users of the social networking system may be individuals or entities such as businesses organizations universities manufacturers. The social networking system allows its users to interact with each other as well as with other objects maintained by the social networking system . In some embodiments the social networking system allows users to interact with third party websites and a financial account provider.

Based on stored data about users objects and connections between users and or objects the social networking system generates and maintains a social graph comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph represents an object or user that can act on another node and or that can be acted on by another node. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the two nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. For example when a user identifies an additional user as a friend an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and an additional node representing the additional user. The generated edge has a connection type indicating that the users are friends. As various nodes interact with each other the social networking system adds and or modifies edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the interactions.

The client device A is a computing device capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network channel . In one embodiment the client device A is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or laptop computer. In another embodiment the client device A may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA mobile telephone a tablet a smart phone or similar device. In yet another embodiment the client device A can be a virtualized desktop running on a cloud computing service. The client device A is configured to communicate with the social networking system and or the financial account provider via the network channel . In one embodiment the client device A executes an application allowing a user of the client device A to interact with the social networking system . For example the client device A executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device A and the social networking system via the network channel . In another embodiment a the client device A interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API that runs on the native operating system of the client device A such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client device A is configured to communicate via the network channel which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network channel uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. Thus the network channel may include links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Similarly the networking protocols used on the network channel may include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP User Datagram Protocol UDP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network channel may be represented using technologies and or formats including hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In addition all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS and Internet Protocol security IPsec .

The social networking system shown by includes a profile store a content store an action logger an action log an edge store a financial account store an internationalization system a web server a message server and an API request server . In other embodiments the social networking system may include additional fewer or different modules for various applications. Conventional components such as network interfaces security mechanisms load balancers failover servers management and network operations consoles and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system architecture.

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each data field describing one or more attributes of the corresponding user of the social networking system . The user profile information stored in the profile store describes the users of the social networking system including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with identification information of users of the social networking system displayed in an image. A user profile in the profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the edge store .

As further described below a user profile may be associated with one or more financial accounts allowing the user profile to include data retrieved from or derived from a financial account. A user may specify one or more privacy settings which are stored in the user profile that limit information from a financial account that the social networking system is permitted to access. For example a privacy setting limits the social networking system to accessing the transaction history of the financial account and not the current account balance. As another example a privacy setting limits the social networking system to a subset of the transaction history of the financial account allowing the social networking system to access transactions within a specified time range transactions involving less than a threshold transaction amounts transactions associated with specified vendor identifiers transactions associated with vendor identifiers other than specified vendor identifiers or any suitable criteria limiting information from a financial account identified by a user that is accessible by the social networking system . In one embodiment information from the financial account is stored in the profile store . In other embodiments it may be stored in the financial account store .

The content store stores content items associated with a user profile such as images videos or audio files. Content items from the content store may be displayed when a user profile is viewed or when other content associated with the user profile is viewed. For example displayed content items may show images or video associated with a user profile or show text describing a user s status. Additionally other content items may facilitate user engagement by encouraging a user to expand his connections to other users to invite new users to the system or to increase interaction with the social network system by displaying content related to users objects activities or functionalities of the social networking system . Examples of social networking content items include suggested connections or suggestions to perform other actions media provided to or maintained by the social networking system e.g. pictures or videos status messages or links posted by users to the social networking system events groups pages e.g. representing an organization or commercial entity and any other content provided by or accessible via the social networking system.

The content store also includes one or more pages associated with entities having user profiles in the profile store . An entity is a non individual user of the social networking system such as a business a vendor an organization or a university. A page includes content associated with an entity and instructions for presenting the content to a social networking system user. For example a page identifies content associated with the entity s user profile as well as information describing how to present the content to users viewing the brand page. Vendors may be associated with pages in the content store allowing social networking system users to more easily interact with the vendor via the social networking system . A vendor identifier is associated with a vendor s page allowing the social networking system to identify the vendor and or to retrieve additional information about the vendor from the profile store the action log or from any other suitable source using the vendor identifier. In some embodiments the content store may also store one or more targeting criteria associated with stored objects and identifying one or more characteristics of a user to which the object is eligible to be presented.

The action logger receives communications about user actions on and or off the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Such actions may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user among others. In some embodiments the action logger receives subject to one or more privacy settings transaction information from a financial account associated with a user and identifies user actions from the transaction information. For example the action logger retrieves vendor identifiers from the financial account s transaction history and identifies an object such as a page in the social networking system associated with the vendor identifier. This allows the action logger to identify a user s purchases of products or services that are associated with a page or another object in the content store . In addition a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well. These actions are stored in the action log .

In accordance with various embodiments the action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about user actions on and or off the social networking system . The action logger populates the action log with information about user actions to track them. This information may be subject to privacy settings associated with the user. Any action that a particular user takes with respect to another user is associated with each user s profile through information maintained in a database or other data repository such as the action log . Such actions may include for example adding a connection to the other user sending a message to the other user reading a message from the other user viewing content associated with the other user attending an event posted by another user being tagged in photos with another user liking an entity etc.

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as external website that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system including commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items in a sequence or other interactions. Information describing these actions is stored in the action log . Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communications between users becoming a fan of a musician adding an event to a calendar joining a groups becoming a fan of a brand page creating an event authorizing an application using an application and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log records a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of the user augmenting the interests included in the user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

Further user actions that happened in particular context such as when the user was shown or was seen accessing particular content on the social networking system are captured along with the particular context and logged. For example a particular user could be shown not shown information regarding candidate users every time the particular user accessed the social networking system for a fixed period of time. Any actions taken by the user during this period of time are logged along with the context information i.e. candidate users were provided not provided to the particular user and are recorded in the action log . In addition a number of actions described below in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well.

The action log may also store user actions taken on external websites and or determined from a financial account associated with the user. For example an e commerce website that primarily sells sporting equipment at bargain prices may recognize a user of the social networking system through social plug ins that enable the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as this sporting equipment retailer may use the information about these users as they visit their websites. The action log records data about these users including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying. Actions identified by the action logger from the transaction history of a financial account associated with the user allow the action log to record further information about additional types of user actions.

In one embodiment the edge store stores the information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system in edge objects. The edge store can store the social graph described above such as the social graph of . Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system. The edge store stores edge objects that include information about the edge such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Multiple interactions of the same type between a user and a specific target may be stored in one edge object in the edge store in one embodiment. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the profile store or the profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users. Users may select from predefined types of connections or define their own connection types as needed.

The web server links the social networking system via a network to one or more client devices the web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java Flash XML and so forth. The web server may communicate with the message server that provides the functionality of receiving and routing messages between the social networking system and client devices. The messages processed by the message server can be instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS short message service messages or any other suitable messaging technique. In some embodiments a message sent by a user to another can be viewed by other users of the social networking system for example by the connections of the user receiving the message. An example of a type of message that can be viewed by other users of the social networking system besides the recipient of the message is a wall post. In some embodiments a user can send a private message to another user that can only be retrieved by the other user.

The API request server allows external systems to access information from the social networking system by calling APIs. The information provided by the social network may include user profile information or the connection information of users as determined by their individual privacy settings. For example a system interested in predicting the probability of users forming a connection within a social networking system may send an API request to the social networking system via a network. The API request is received at the social networking system by the API request server . The API request server processes the request by determining the appropriate response which is then communicated back to the requesting system via a network.

The social networking system also includes the internationalization system . The internationalization system can be the internationalization system of . The internationalization system can access the stores and modules of the social networking system in order to develop internationalized sentence syntaxes and generate translated sentences for an application running on the social networking system . As internationalized sentence syntaxes are developed the internationalization system can also work with other modules and stores of the social networking system to display the translated sentences to the client device A based on configurations of the internationalized sentence syntax.

The social networking system includes a graph API server such as the graph API server to interact with a user device such as the user device of . The graph API server may facilitate recording of user profiles and activities in the social networking system . In some embodiments the user profiles and activities can be stored in the profile store and action log respectively. The user profiles may include but are not limited to a particular user s name or user identifier UID profile picture gender birthday networks friend list location language country likes favorite brands news outlets restaurants any information the particular user chooses to share with everyone or any combination thereof.

An application developed by a developer may utilize a social graph stored on the social networking system to interact with the social networking system . For example the application may access the edge store of through the graph API server. illustrates a specific developer interface in configuring the application to express information from the social graph through the application based on the internationalized sentence syntaxes.

The social networking system may generate a developer interface such as the developer interface generated by the developer interface module of instantiated on a device such as the client device of . The developer interface allows the developer to configure the internationalized sentence syntax for an application such as the internationalized sentence syntax of for the social networking application of . The internationalized sentence syntax is used by the application to interpret actions performed by user accounts on the social networking system and to express those actions in a meaningful way. The interpreted actions may be accessed from the action log or from the edge store through the graph API server. The developer interface can communicate directly with the social networking system or indirectly through the graph API server.

The developer can select a primary language for an application on the developer interface for expressions associated with the application. In some embodiments the application may be configured to automatically detect a primary viewer language based on the viewer user s profile on the social networking system the viewer user s browser setup and or the viewer user s activities in the social networking system .

The developer interface provides multiple options for the developer to define an internationalized sentence syntax and select preferred languages. The internationalized sentence syntax may be translated into a language specific syntax for each of the preferred languages. The preferred languages are languages supported by the internationalized sentence syntax. Ultimately one or more of the internationalized sentence syntax or language specific syntaxes are used to translate a sentence from one language into another language.

The developer can start by typing an internationalized sentence syntax or build the internationalized sentence syntax from published texts. To select the internationalized sentence syntax from published texts the particular user can gray out the corresponding texts in the published information detail page or posted comments.

The developer can define grammar i.e. actor action and target of an internationalized sentence syntax by typing actor action and target into their corresponding text boxes. For example the developer can define actor by typing actor of the internationalized sentence syntax into the actor text box. In some embodiments the actor text box is pre filled with the name of the particular user using the application associated with the internationalized sentence syntax created by the developer. In some examples of the application either the application or the particular user can modify the actor to other names or add other friends as an actor.

Based on the developer s selection of edge the developer interface may provide a plurality of verb tense options for the developer to select. The developer can select a specific tense and preview the internationalized sentence syntax with the selected tense. The tense options may include for example past tense plural past tense present tense plural present tense continuous tense perfect tense perfect continuous tense and imperative tense. In the absence of the user s selection the action can be displayed in the past tense by default.

When an edge is defined the developer interface may provide a plurality of sentences with connected targets for the developer to select. The plurality of sentences can be listed in the reverse order of their corresponding percentage of coverage. The percentage of coverage of a specific sentence is determined by impressions that the specific sentence has been viewed by users in the social networking system over a given time frame. The sentence with the highest percentage of coverage is listed first or pops up in a window or in bold and large font as the most important.

If the specific sentence is selected from the published information detail page or posted comments the social networking system may analyze the grammar of the specific sentence to generate a normalized representation of the text and pre fill the actor action and or target text boxes corresponding to the specific sentence. The developer can modify actor action and or target of the internationalized sentence syntax by editing their corresponding text boxes.

The developer interface may provide a language token for the developer to select preferred languages to publish a sentence. The language token may include but not limited to options such as a check box list a select language drop down menu a selection list a list of buttons multiple layered menu levels or any combination thereof. For example the language token may include a checkbox for each preferred language selected by users in the social networking system . In some implementations the language token may include all native languages shared by two or more users in the social networking system for example German Dutch French Chinese etc.

Languages in the language token can be presented in the alphabetical order of languages first letters. In some embodiments the languages are presented in hierarchy of their relevance to the developer. For example high relevant languages such as language preferences currently or previously selected by the developer and or primary and preferred languages of friends e.g. friends in the actor box and or from the application user s friend list etc. may be provided on top of a language checklist.

Based on the primary language and other language preferences selected by the developer the developer interface prompts one or more tokens for the developer to further define syntax translations of the internationalized sentence syntax. The tokens may include a gender token a target token a viewer token a number token or any combination thereof.

A gender token can be provided for the developer to select gender of actor of the internationalized sentence syntax. The gender token may include but not limited to options such as a check box a radio button a drop down menu a selection list or any combination thereof. For example the developer can define the actor as male female or neutral. The internationalized sentence syntax can be translated into the user s preferred languages based on the specific gender of actor. 

A target token can be provided for the developer to determine if the target of the internationalized sentence syntax is possessive or nominative. The target token may include but not limited to options such as a check box a radio button a drop down menu a selection list or any combination thereof. In some languages for example Romanian language etc. the actual name of a person possessing a target may change depending on whether the target is possessive or nominative.

In some embodiments a viewer token is provided for the developer to determine gender and or seniority of target viewers. The viewer token may include but not limited to options such as a check box list a radio button a drop down menu a selection list a list of buttons multiple layered menu levels or any combination thereof. The syntax translations of the internationalized sentence syntax may depend on the gender or seniority of the targeted viewers. For example the internationalized sentence syntax can be translated differently for male viewers versus female viewers in some languages. For another example syntax translations for senior viewers can be different from those for junior viewers in some languages.

In some embodiments for each number in the internationalized sentence syntax a number token is provided for the developer to select a plural type of the corresponding number. The plural can have many variations for numbers in some languages. For example there are seven types of plurals for numbers in the Arabic language. In some embodiments plural types of numbers in the internationalized sentence syntax can be automatically detected by the social networking system .

The social networking system may store published sentences and their corresponding translations in its database. When an internationalized sentence syntax is defined by the developer the social networking system can search its database for syntax translations of the internationalized sentence syntax and variations of the internationalized sentence syntax. The search results are then presented to the developer based on their relevance to the internationalized sentence syntax. In some implementations a search result with a higher percentage of impressions may be listed closer to the top of the search results. From the search results the developer can select suitable syntax translations of the internationalized sentence syntax which are used to translate a sentence and publish the translated sentence.

In some embodiments the social networking system may automatically detect language setup on the client user device using the application. For example browsers on the particular client user device may have a language setup with a particular language. If the particular language is different from that of the primary language of the internationalized sentence syntax the social networking system can search its databases for translations in the particular language and if a match can be found present the translations for the developer to review.

In some embodiments a raw sentence corresponding to the internationalized sentence syntax in the social networking system can be generated and provided to a third party for translations into users preferred languages. The database of the social networking system can be dynamically expanded by receiving the translations of the raw sentence and variations of the raw sentence from the third party. In some embodiments the translations are received through a bulk hash which allows the third party to continue adding variations of the translations.

In some embodiments the target sports and 5 other activities can be a variable. The social networking system can search its database for translations to the internationalized sentence syntax and variations of the internationalized sentence syntax. The translations to variations of the internationalized sentence syntax can also be presented to the developer for review. For example one variation of the internationalized sentence syntax John likes sports is John likes games which can be translated to John graag games in Dutch. In operation a translation of the internationalized sentence syntax described herein as syntax translation is used to actually translate a sentence from one language e.g. primary language to another language e.g. preferred language . In another embodiment the variations of the internationalized sentence syntax may be used.

As illustrated in a gender token is provided to translate an English sentence John read Hamlet and 5 other books . The words John read and Hamlet correspond to actor edge and target of the English sentence respectively. The developer can select the actor s gender i.e. male female or neutral with the Gender token. In response to the user s selection the social network system provides syntax translations with variations of actor s gender for the developer to select. For example translations are provided for a male actor John and a female actor Jane respectively.

In some embodiments space is provided in front of a number in a translated sentence. For example the English word other actually may be placed in front of a number in some languages. The English sentence in the previous paragraph can be translated to John leggere Amleto e altri 5 libri in Italian. The Italian word altri i.e. other in English is placed in front of 5. 

The social networking system provides a developer interface to define an internationalized sentence syntax for an application on a social networking system in step . The internationalized sentence syntax is used to translate a natural language expression of a social graph edge of the social networking system from one language into another.

The social networking system then provides a sentence option on the developer interface to define the grammar of the internationalized sentence syntax in step . A token structure is generated at step . The token structure includes a language token to assist translation of the internationalized sentence syntax into a language specific syntax as indicated by the language token. The token structure is customizable via the developer interface to configure translation options.

Based on the developer s inputs the developer interface associates a social graph attribute with a first token of the token structure in step . Once the internationalized sentence syntax is configured the sentence option and the token structure along with the internationalized structure is stored on the social networking system to facilitate run time translation of sentences in at least the preferred language in step .
