The invention relates to improved and or patient adapted e.g. patient specific and or patient engineered orthopedic implants and guide tools as well as related methods designs and models.

Generally a diseased injured or defective joint such as for example a joint exhibiting osteoarthritis has been repaired using standard off the shelf implants and other surgical devices. Specific off the shelf implant designs have been altered over the years to address particular issues. For example several existing designs include implant components having rotating parts to enhance joint motion. Ries et al. describes design changes to the distal or posterior condyles of a femoral implant component to enhance axial rotation of the implant component during flexion. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 549 688 and 5 824 105. Andriacchi et al. describes a design change to the heights of the posterior condyles to enhance high flexion motion. See U.S. Pat. No. 6 770 099. However in altering a design to address a particular issue historical design changes frequently have created one or more additional issues for future designs to address. Collectively many of these issues have arisen from one or more differences between a patient s existing or healthy joint anatomy and the corresponding features of an implant component.

Historically joint implants have employed a one size fits all or a few sizes fit all approach to implant design that has resulted in significant differences between a patient s existing or healthy biological structures and the resulting implant component features in the patient s joint. Accordingly advanced implant designs and related devices and methods that address the needs of individual patient s are needed.

The embodiments described herein include advancements in or arise out of the area of patient adapted articular implants that are tailored to address the needs of individual single patients. Such patient adapted articular implants offer advantages over the traditional one size fits all approach or a few sizes fit all approach. The advantages include for example better fit more natural movement of the joint reduction in the amount of bone removed during surgery and a less invasive procedure. Such patient adapted articular implants can be created from images of the patient s joint. Based on the images patient adapted implant components can be selected and or designed to include features e.g. surface contours curvatures widths lengths thicknesses and other features that match existing features in the single individual patient s joint as well as features that approximate an ideal and or healthy feature that may not exist in the patient prior to a procedure. Moreover by altering the design approach to address several design implant issues several non traditional design approaches have been identified that offer improvements over traditional implant designs.

Patient adapted features can include patient specific and or patient engineered. Patient specific or patient matched implant component or guide tool features can include features adapted to match one or more of the patient s biological features for example one or more biological anatomical structures alignments kinematics and or soft tissue impingements. Patient engineered or patient derived features of an implant component can be designed and or manufactured e.g. preoperatively designed and manufactured based on patient specific data to substantially enhance or improve one or more of the patient s anatomical and or biological features.

The patient adapted e.g. patient specific and or patient engineered implant components and guide tools described herein can be selected e.g. from a library designed e.g. preoperatively designed including optionally manufacturing the components or tools and or selected and designed e.g. by selecting a blank component or tool having certain blank features and then altering the blank features to be patient adapted . Moreover related methods such as designs and strategies for resectioning a patient s biological structure also can be selected and or designed. For example an implant component bone facing surface and a resectioning strategy for the corresponding bone facing surface can be selected and or designed together so that an implant component s bone facing surface matches the resected surface. In addition one or more guide tools optionally can be selected and or designed to facilitate the resection cuts that are predetermined in accordance with resectioning strategy and implant component selection and or design.

In certain embodiments patient adapted features of an implant component guide tool or related method can be achieved by analyzing imaging test data and selecting and or designing e.g. preoperatively selecting from a library and or designing an implant component a guide tool and or a procedure having a feature that is matched and or optimized for the particular patient s biology. The imaging test data can include data from the patient s joint for example data generated from an image of the joint such as x ray imaging cone beam CT digital tomosynthesis and ultrasound a MRI or CT scan or a PET or SPECT scan is processed to generate a varied or corrected version of the joint or of portions of the joint or of surfaces within the joint. Certain embodiments provide method and devices to create a desired model of a joint or of portions or surfaces of a joint based on data derived from the existing joint. For example the data can also be used to create a model that can be used to analyze the patient s joint and to devise and evaluate a course of corrective action. The data and or model also can be used to design an implant component having one or more patient specific features such as a surface or curvature.

In one aspect embodiments described herein provide a pre primary articular implant component that includes a an outer joint facing surface and an inner bone facing surface. The outer joint facing surface can include a bearing surface. The inner joint facing surface can include one or more patient engineered bone cuts selected and or designed from patient specific data. In certain embodiments the patient engineered bone cuts can be selected and or designed from patient specific data to minimize the amount of bone resected in one or more corresponding predetermined resection cuts. In certain embodiments the patient engineered bone cuts substantially negatively match one or more predetermined resection cuts. The predetermined resection cuts can be made at a first depth that allows in a subsequent procedure removal of additional bone to a second depth required for a traditional primary implant component. In addition the pre primary articular implant component can be a knee joint implant component a hip joint implant component a shoulder joint implant component or a spinal implant component. For example the pre primary articular implant component can be a knee joint implant component such as a femoral implant component. Moreover the pre primary articular implant component can include six or more e.g. six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen or more patient engineered bone cuts on its bone facing surface.

In certain embodiments the pre primary articular implant component can include an implant component thickness in one or more regions that is selected and or designed from patient specific data to minimize the amount of bone resected. The one or more regions comprises the implant component thickness perpendicular to a planar bone cut and between the planar bone cut and the joint surface of the implant component.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide methods for minimizing resected bone from and or methods for making an articular implant for a single patient in need of an articular implant replacement procedure. These methods can include a identifying unwanted tissue from one or more images of the patient s joint b identifying a combination of resection cuts and implant component features that remove the unwanted tissue and also provide maximum bone preservation and c selecting and or designing for the patient a combination of resection cuts and implant component features that provide removal of the unwanted tissue and maximum bone preservation. In certain embodiments the unwanted tissue is diseased tissue or deformed tissue.

In certain embodiments step c can include designing for the single patient a combination of resection cuts and implant component features that provide removal of the unwanted tissue and maximum bone preservation. Designing can include manufacturing. Moreover the implant component features in step c can include one or more of the features selected from the group consisting of implant thickness bone cut number bone cut angles and or bone cut orientations.

In certain embodiments a measure of bone preservation can include total volume of bone resected volume of bone resected from one or more resection cuts volume of bone resected to fit one or more implant component bone cuts average thickness of bone resected average thickness of bone resected from one or more resection cuts average thickness of bone resected to fit one or more implant component bone cuts maximum thickness of bone resected maximum thickness of bone resected from one or more resection cuts maximum thickness of bone resected to fit one or more implant component bone cuts.

In certain embodiments a minimum implant component also can be established. For example step a also can include identifying a minimum implant component thickness for the single patient. Step b also can include identifying a combination of resection cuts and or implant component features that provide a minimum implant thickness determined for the single patient. Step c also can include selecting and or designing the combination of resection cuts and or implant component features that provides at least a minimum implant thickness for the single patient. The minimum implant component thickness is based on one or more of femur and or condyle size or patient weight.

The articular implant component can be a knee joint implant component a hip joint implant component a shoulder joint implant component or a spinal implant component. For example the pre primary articular implant component can be a knee joint implant component such as a femoral implant component.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising a bearing surface portion and b a bone facing surface comprising six or more bone cuts.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising a bearing surface portion and b a bone facing surface comprising a distal bone cut having two or more planar facets or portions that are non coplanar with each other.

The first of the two or more facets or portions can be on a lateral condyle bone facing surface and the second can be on a medial condyle bone facing surface.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising a bearing surface portion and b a bone facing surface comprising an anterior bone cut having two or more planar facets or portions that are non coplanar with each other.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising a bearing surface portion and b a bone facing surface comprising a posterior bone cut having two or more facets or portions that are non parallel with each other. In certain embodiments the first of the two or more facets or portions can be on a lateral condyle bone facing surface and the second can be on a medial condyle bone facing surface.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising a bearing surface portion and b a bone facing surface comprising an anterior chamfer bone cut having two or more planar facets or portions that are non coplanar with each other. In certain embodiments the two or more planar facets or portions are non parallel with each other. The first of the two or more facets or portions can be on a lateral condyle bone facing surface and the second can be on a medial condyle bone facing surface.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising a bearing surface portion and b a bone facing surface comprising a posterior chamfer bone cut having two or more facets or portions that are non parallel with each other. In certain embodiments the first of the two or more facets or portions can be on a lateral condyle bone facing surface and the second can be on a medial condyle bone facing surface.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a joint facing surface comprising lateral and medial condylar surface portions and b a bone facing surface comprising an anterior bone cut wherein the distance between the anterior bone cut and the lateral condylar surface portion is different from the distance between the anterior bone cut and the medial condylar surface portion. In certain embodiments the two or more facets or portions are substantially non parallel.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a a lateral and medial condylar portions and b a bone facing surface comprising a distal bone cut facet that is asymmetric about its center line in a sagittal plane. In certain embodiments the asymmetric distal bone cut facet lies on the bone facing surface of the lateral condyle. In certain embodiments the femoral implant component of claim wherein the asymmetric distal bone cut facet lies on the bone facing surface of the medial condyle.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide a femoral implant component that includes a femoral implant component having a bone facing surface comprising one or more bone cuts wherein at least one of the one or more bone cuts comprises two planar bone cut facets separated by at least one step cut. In certain embodiments the step cut is substantially perpendicular to at least one of the bone cut facets. In certain embodiments the step cut can rise or fall at about 30 degrees or more from at least one of the bone cut facet planes.

In another aspect embodiments described herein provide implant components having an inner bone facing surface designed to negatively match a bone surface that was cut for example based on pre determined geometries or based on patient specific geometries. In certain embodiments an outer joint facing surface includes at least in a portion that substantially negatively matches a feature of the patient s anatomy and or an opposing outer joint facing surface of a second implant component. In certain embodiments by creating negatively matching component surfaces at a joint interface the opposing surfaces may not have an anatomic or near anatomic shape but instead may be negatively matching or near negatively matching to each other. This can have various advantages such as reducing implant and joint wear and providing more predictable joint movement.

It is to be understood that the features of the various embodiments described herein are not mutually exclusive and may exist in various combinations and permutations.

When a surgeon uses a traditional off the shelf implant to replace a patient s joint for example a knee joint hip joint or shoulder joint certain features of the implant typically do not match the particular patient s biological features. These mismatches can cause various complications during and after surgery. For example surgeons may need to extend the surgery time and apply estimates and rules of thumb during surgery to address the mismatches. For the patient complications associated with these mismatches can include pain discomfort soft tissue impingement and an unnatural feeling of the joint during motion e.g. so called mid flexion instability as well as an altered range of movement and an increased likelihood of implant failure. In order to fit a traditional implant component to a patient s articular bone surgeons typically remove substantially more of the patient s bone than is necessary to merely clear diseased bone from the site. This removal of substantial portions of the patient s bone frequently diminishes the patient s bone stock to the point that only one subsequent revision implant is possible.

Certain embodiments of the implants guide tools and related methods of designing e.g. designing and making and using the implants and guide tools described herein can be applied to any joint including without limitation a spine spinal articulations an intervertebral disk a facet joint a shoulder an elbow a wrist a hand a finger a hip a knee an ankle a foot or a toe joint. Furthermore various embodiments described herein can apply to methods and procedures and the design of methods and procedures for resectioning the patient s anatomy in order to implant the implant components described herein and or to using the guide tools described herein.

Certain embodiments relate to patient adapted implants guide tools and related methods. Patient adapted features of an implant component guide tool or related implantation method can be achieved by analyzing imaging test data and selecting and or designing e.g. preoperatively selecting from a library and or preoperatively designing an implant component a guide tool and or a procedure having a feature that is matched and or optimized for the particular patient s anatomy and or biology. Accordingly the patient adapted implant components guide tools and or methods include one or more patient adapted features. Patient adapted features can include patient specific features and or patient engineered features.

Certain embodiments relate to patient specific implants guide tools and related methods. For example some embodiments relate to articular implant components having one or more patient specific features adapted to match one or more of the patient s biological features such as one or more of biological anatomical structures alignments kinematics and or soft tissue impingements. Accordingly the one or more patient specific features of an implant component can include but are not limited to one or more implant component surfaces such as surface contours or angles and one or more implant component dimensions such as thickness width depth or length. The patient specific feature s of an implant component can be designed based on patient specific data to substantially match one or more of the patient s biological features i.e. anatomical and or biological features . In various embodiments described herein the act of designing an implant component can include manufacturing the implant component having the related design features. For example designing an implant component can include preoperatively establishing a design of one or more features of an implant component for example using a CAD computer program on a computer system specialized operated for such use and having one or more user interfaces and instructing the transfer of that design data for example from a CAD computer program or computer system to a CAM computer aided manufacturing computer program or computer system. Optionally in certain embodiments designing the implant can further include instructing the initiation of manufacturing the physical implant and or manufacturing the implant.

Alternatively patient specific feature s of an implant component or guide tool can be achieved by analyzing imaging test data and selecting e.g. preoperatively selecting from a library of implant components the implant component that best fits one or more pre determined patient specific parameters that are derived from the imaging test.

Moreover an implant component or guide tool can include a patient specific feature that is both selected and designed. For example an implant component initially can be selected e.g. preoperatively selected from a library of implants to have a feature with a standard or blank dimension or with a larger or smaller dimension than the predetermined patient specific dimension. Then the implant component can be machined if selected from an actual library of implant components or manufactured if selected from a virtual library of implant components so that the standard dimension or blank dimension or larger dimensioned or smaller dimensioned implant feature is altered to have the patient specific dimension.

In addition or alternatively certain embodiments relate to patient engineered implants guide tools and related methods. Some embodiments relate to articular implant components having one or more patient engineered features optimized from patient specific data to meet one or more parameters to enhance one or more of the patient s biological features such as one or more biological anatomical structures alignments kinematics and or soft tissue impingements. Accordingly the one or more patient engineered features of an implant component can include but are not limited to one or more implant component surfaces such as surface contours angles or bone cuts and dimensions such as thickness width depth or length of one or more aspects of the implant component. The patient engineered feature s of an implant component can be designed and or manufactured e.g. preoperatively designed and manufactured based on patient specific data to substantially enhance or improve one or more of the patient s anatomical and or biological features. Methods for preparing certain patient engineered features are described for example in U.S. Ser. No. 12 712 072 entitled Automated Systems For Manufacturing Patient Specific Orthopedic Implants And Instrumentation filed Feb. 24 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference.

As with the patient specific feature s of an implant component or guide tool the patient engineered features of an implant component or guide tool can be designed e.g. preoperatively designed and manufactured or they can be selected for example by selecting an implant component that best meets the one or more predetermined parameters that enhance one or more features of the patient s biology.

Moreover an implant component or guide tool can include a patient engineered feature that is both selected and designed. For example an implant component initially can be selected e.g. preoperatively selected from a library of implants to have a feature with a larger or smaller dimension than the desired patient engineered dimension. Then the implant component can be machined if selected from an actual library of implant components or manufactured if selected from a virtual library of implant components so that the larger dimensioned or smaller dimensioned implant feature is altered to have the desired patient engineered dimension.

A single implant component guide tool and or related method can include one or more patient specific features one or more patient engineered features and or one or more standard e.g. off the shelf features . The standard off the shelf features can be selected to best fit with one or more of the patient specific and or patient engineered features. For example in a knee joint a metal backed tibial component can include a standard locking mechanism and a patient adapted i.e. patient specific or patient engineered perimeter of the tibial component. A patient specific perimeter of the tibial component can be achieved for example by cutting the perimeter of a selected tibial component to match the patient s cortical bone perimeter in one or more dimensions of one more sections. Similarly a polyethylene insert can be chosen that includes a standard locking mechanism while the perimeter is adapted for better support to the patient s tibial bone perimeter or the perimeter of the metal backing.

In certain aspects an implant guide tool and or related method can include one or more patient adapted features and one or more standard features. For example the joint facing surface of an implant component can include a patient specific feature e.g. curvature in the axis or axes of motion and one or more standard features in other axes. Using a curvature in the direction of motion that is matched to the patient s curvature patient specific or that is optimized based on the patient s curvature patient engineered can help to maintain and or improve the biomechanical aspects of the patient s joint.

As one illustrative example in certain embodiments the joint facing surface of a condylar portion of a femoral implant component and or a corresponding groove in the bearing surface of a tibial implant component can include a patient specific sagittal curvature e.g. having one or more patient specific radii of curvature and a standard coronal curvature or radii of curvature. Coronal radii of curvature also can be patient derived but an average or an optimum can be derived across the articular surface that is constant along the extent of the articular surface in the coronal plane. The patient specific sagittal curvature or radii of curvature can be designed from patient specific data to match an existing feature of the patient s biology or it can be patient engineered from patient specific data to improve an existing feature of the patient s biology.

In certain embodiments implant components and or related methods described herein can include a combination of patient specific and patient engineered features. For example patient specific data collected preoperatively can be used to engineer one or more optimized surgical cuts to the patient s bone and to design or select a corresponding implant component having or more bone facing surfaces or facets i.e. bone cuts that specifically match one or more of the patient s resected bone surfaces. The surgical cuts to the patient s bone can be optimized i.e. patient engineered to enhance one or more parameters such as 1 deformity correction and limb alignment 2 maximizing preservation of bone cartilage or ligaments 3 maximizing preservation and or optimization of other features of the patient s anatomy such as trochlea and trochlear shape 4 restoration and or optimization of joint kinematics or biomechanics 5 restoration or optimization of joint line location and or joint gap width 6 and or addressing one or more other parameters. Based on the optimized surgical cuts and optionally on other desired features of the implant component the implant component s bone facing surface can be designed or selected to at least in part negatively match the shape of the patient s resected bone surface.

Optionally the implant component can include other patient adapted features. For example the joint facing surface can be designed to at least in part substantially negatively match an opposing surface at the joint cavity e.g. the surface of the patient s biological structure native or resected or the surface of an opposing implant component. In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of the implant component can include patient adapted features such as a patient specific sagittal curvature and a patient engineered coronal curvature or a patient specific sagittal curvature and a patient specific coronal curvature. These curvatures can be patient specific in at least a portion or the entire joint facing surface of the implant. Alternatively or in addition one or more of these curvatures can be patient adapted in one condyle but not patient adapted in the other condyle. Moreover the shape e.g. curvature of a first condyle can be used for example to generate a shape e.g. curvature for the second condyle.

An implant i.e. an implant system can include one or more implant components which as described above can each include one or more patient specific features one or more patient engineered features and one or more standard e.g. off the shelf features. Moreover an implant system can include one or more patient adapted e.g. patient specific and or patient engineered implant components and one or more standard implant components.

For example a knee implant can include a femoral implant component having one or more patient adapted and standard features and an off the shelf tibial implant component having only standard features. In this example the entire tibial implant component can be off the shelf. Alternatively a metal backed implant component or portion of an implant component can be patient specific e.g. matched in the A P dimension or the M L dimension to the patient s tibial cortical bone while the corresponding plastic insert implant component or corresponding portion of the implant component can include a standard off the shelf configuration.

Off the shelf configuration can mean that the tibial insert has fixed standard dimensions to fit for example into a standard tibial tray. Off the shelf configuration also can mean that the tibial insert has a fixed standard dimension or distance between two tibial dishes or curvatures to accommodate the femoral bearing surface. The latter configuration is particularly applicable in an implant system that uses a femoral implant component that is patient specifically matched in the M L dimension to the distal femur of the patient s bone but uses a standardized intercondylar notch width on the femoral component to achieve optimal mating with a corresponding tibial insert. For example show schematic representations in a coronal plane of a patient s distal femur and a femoral implant component . As shown in the figures the implant component M L dimension e.g. epicondylar M L dimension patient specifically matches the corresponding M L dimension of the patient s femur . However the intercondylar M L dimension i.e. notch width of the implant component can be standard which in this figure is shorter than the patient s intercondylar M L dimension . In this way the epicondylar M L dimension of the implant component is patient specific while the intercondylar M L dimension i.e. notch width is designed to be a standard length for example so that is can properly engage during joint motion a tibial insert having a standard distance between its dishes or curvatures that engage the condyles of the femoral implant component.

Certain embodiments are directed to implants guide tools and or related methods that can be used to provide to a patient a pre primary procedure and or a pre primary implant such that a subsequent replacement implant can be performed with a second and optionally a third and optionally a fourth patient adapted pre primary implant or with a traditional primary implant. In certain embodiments the pre primary implant procedure can include 3 4 5 6 7 or more resection or surgical cuts to the patient s bone and the pre primary implant can include on its corresponding bone facing surface a matching number and orientation of bone cut facets or surfaces.

In one illustrative embodiment a first pre primary joint replacement procedure includes a patient adapted implant component guide tool and or related method. The patient adapted implant component guide tool and or related method can be preoperatively selected and or designed from patient specific data such as one or more images of the patient s joint to include one or more features that are patient specific or patient engineered. The features e.g. dimensions shape surface contours of the first pre primary implant and optionally patient specific data e.g. features of the patient s resected bone surfaces and features of the patient s contralateral joint can be stored in a database. When the first pre primary implant fails for example due to bone loss or osteolysis or aseptic loosening at a later point in time e.g. 15 years after the original implantation a second implant can be implanted. For the second implant procedure the amount of diseased bone can be assessed. If the amount of diseased bone to be resected is minimal the patient specific data can be used to select and or design a second pre primary procedure and or a pre primary implant. If the amount of diseased bone to be resected is substantial a traditional primary procedure and a traditional implant can be employed.

Alternatively certain embodiments are directed to implants guide tools and or related methods that can be used to provide to a patient a primary procedure and or a primary implant such that a subsequent replacement implant can be used as part of a traditional revision procedure. Certain embodiments are directed to implants guide tools and or related methods that can be used to provide a patient adapted revision implant. For example following a traditional implant a subsequent revision can include a patient adapted procedure and or a patient adapted implant component as described herein.

The steps described in are similar to those described above for a first pre primary implant see however in the second implant process the database information collected and stored in the first implant process can be used as part of the process for the second implant. In addition to the database information from the first implant process additional measurements of the target joint optionally can be obtained and used together with the database information from the first implant process as a basis for selecting and or designing a second implant. This step can be repeated multiple times as desired. Optionally a virtual model of the joint can be generated with our without a model of the first implant for example to determine proper joint alignment corresponding resection cuts and optionally patient adapted implant component features based on the determined proper alignment. This information can be collected and stored as new or additional database information . Once the database information from the first implant process and optionally new measurements of the target joint and first implant are obtained and analyzed the implant component s for the second implant can be selected e.g. selected from a virtual library and optionally manufactured without further design alteration or selected from a physical library of implant components or selected from among traditional implant components . Alternatively or in addition one or more implant components with best fitting and or optimized features can be selected e.g. from a library and then further designed e.g. designed and manufactured . Alternatively or in addition one or more implant components with best fitting and or optimized features can be designed e.g. designed and manufactured without an initial selection from a library. Using a virtual model to assess the selected or designed implant component this process also can be repeated as desired e.g. before one or more physical components are selected and or generated . The information regarding the selected and or designed implant components for the second implant can be collected and stored in a database . Once a desired implant component or set of implant components is obtained for the second implant a surgeon can prepare the implantation site including removing the first implant and install the second implant . The information regarding preparation of the implantation site and second implant installation can be collected and stored in a database .

The second implant can have standard attachment mechanisms e.g. a stem and or pegs or other attachment means known in the art. Alternatively the attachment mechanisms can be patient specific by deriving shape information on the residual bone e.g. of a femur and acetabulum or of a femur and a tibia or of a humerus and a glenoid using image data e.g. CT or MRI data. One or more dimensions or shapes or joint facing surfaces of the second implant can be adapted to include at least in part information reflective of the corresponding dimension s or shape s or joint facing surface s of the first implant. In this manner a better functional result can be achieved with the revision implant by maintaining patient specific shapes and or geometry in the revision implant by accessing data in the patient database.

Accordingly certain embodiments described herein are directed to implants implant components guide tools and related methods that address many of the problems associated with traditional implants such as mismatches between an implant component and a patient s biological features e.g. a feature of a biological structure a distance or space between two biological structures and or a feature associated with anatomical function and substantial bone removal that limits subsequent revisions following a traditional primary implant.

The concepts described herein can be embodied in various types of articular implants including but not limited to knee joint implants hip joint implants shoulder joint implants and spinal implants e.g. intervertebral implants and facet joint implants as well as related surgical tools e.g. guide tools and methods.

In certain embodiments described herein an implant or implant system can include one two three four or more components having one or more patient specific features that substantially match one or more of the patient s biological features for example one or more dimensions and or measurements of an anatomical biological structure such as bone cartilage tendon or muscle a distance or space between two or more aspects of a biological structure and or between two or more different biological structures and a biomechanical or kinematic quality or measurement of the patient s biology. In addition or alternatively an implant component can include one or more features that are engineered to optimize or enhance one or more of the patient s biological features for example 1 deformity correction and limb alignment 2 preserving bone cartilage and or ligaments 3 preserving and or optimizing other features of the patient s anatomy such as trochlea and trochlear shape 4 restoring and or optimizing joint kinematics or biomechanics and or 5 restoring and or optimizing joint line location and or joint gap width. In addition an implant component can be designed and or manufactured to include one or more standard i.e. non patient adapted features.

Exemplary patient adapted i.e. patient specific and or patient engineered features of the implant components described herein are identified in Table 1. One or more of these implant component features can be selected and or designed based on patient specific data such as image data.

The patient adapted features described in Table 1 also can be applied to patient adapted guide tools described herein.

The patient adapted implant components and guide tools described herein can include any number of patient specific features patient engineered features and or standard features. Illustrative combinations of patient specific patient engineered and standard features of an implant component are provided in Table 2. Specifically the table illustrates an implant or implant component having at least thirteen different features. Each feature can be patient specific P patient engineered PE or standard St . As shown there are 105 unique combinations in which each of thirteen is either patient specific patient engineered or standard features.

The term implant component as used herein can include i one of two or more devices that work together in an implant or implant system or ii a complete implant or implant system for example in embodiments in which an implant is a single unitary device. The term match as used herein is envisioned to include one or both of a negative match as a convex surface fits a concave surface and a positive match as one surface is identical to another surface.

Three illustrative embodiments of implants and or implant components are schematically represented in . In the illustrative implant component includes an inner bone facing surface and an outer joint facing surface . The inner bone facing surface engages a first articular surface of a first biological structure such as bone or cartilage at a first interface . The articular surface can be a native surface a resected surface or a combination of the two. The outer joint facing surface opposes a second articular surface of a second biological structure at a joint interface . The dashed line across each figure illustrates a patient s joint line. In certain embodiments one or more features of the implant component for example an M L A P or S I dimension a feature of the inner bone facing surface and or a feature of the outer joint facing surface are patient adapted i.e. include one or more patient specific and or patient engineered features .

The illustrative embodiment shown in includes two implant components . Each implant component includes an inner bone facing surface and an outer joint facing surface . The first inner bone facing surface engages a first articular surface of a first biological structure e.g. bone or cartilage at a first interface . The first articular surface can be a native surface a cut surface or a combination of the two. The second bone facing surface engages a second articular surface of a second biological structure at a second interface . The second articular surface can be a native surface a resected surface or a combination of the two. In addition an outer joint facing surface on the first component opposes a second outer joint facing surface on the second component at the joint interface . In certain embodiments one or more features of the implant component for example one or both of the inner bone facing surfaces and or one or both of the outer joint facing surfaces are patient adapted i.e. include one or more patient specific and or patient engineered features .

The illustrative embodiment represented in includes the two implant components the two biological structures the two interfaces and the joint interface as well as the corresponding surfaces as described for the embodiment illustrated in . However also includes structure which can be an implant component in certain embodiments or a biological structure in certain embodiments. Accordingly the presence of a third structural surface in the joint creates a second joint interface and possibly a third in addition to joint interface . Alternatively or in addition to the patient adapted features described above for components and the components can include one or more features such as surface features at the additional joint interface s as well as other dimensions e.g. height width depth contours and other dimensions that are patient adapted in whole or in part. Moreover structure when it is an implant component also can have one or more patient adapted features such as one or more patient adapted surfaces and dimensions.

Traditional implants and implant components can have surfaces and dimensions that are a poor match to a particular patient s biological feature s . The patient adapted implants guide tools and related methods described herein improve upon these deficiencies. The following two subsections describe two particular improvements with respect to the bone facing surface and the joint facing surface of an implant component however the principles described herein are applicable to any aspect of an implant component.

In certain embodiments the bone facing surface of an implant can be designed to substantially negatively match one more bone surfaces. For example in certain embodiments at least a portion of the bone facing surface of a patient adapted implant component can be designed to substantially negatively match the shape of subchondral bone cortical bone endosteal bone and or bone marrow. A portion of the implant also can be designed for resurfacing for example by negatively matching portions of a bone facing surface of the implant component to the subchondral bone or cartilage. Accordingly in certain embodiments the bone facing surface of an implant component can include one or more portions designed to engage resurfaced bone for example by having a surface that negatively matches uncut subchondral bone or cartilage and one or more portions designed to engage cut bone for example by having a surface that negatively matches a cut subchondral bone.

In certain embodiments the bone facing surface of an implant component includes multiple surfaces also referred to herein as bone cuts. One or more of the bone cuts on the bone facing surface of the implant component can be selected and or designed to substantially negatively match one or more surfaces of the patient s bone. The surface s of the patient s bone can include bone cartilage or other biological surfaces. For example in certain embodiments one or more of the bone cuts on the bone facing surface of the implant component can be designed to substantially negatively match e.g. the number depth and or angles of cut one or more resected surfaces of the patient s bone. The bone facing surface of the implant component can include any number of bone cuts for example two three four less than five five more than five six seven eight nine or more bone cuts. In certain embodiments the bone cuts of the implant component and or the resection cuts to the patient s bone can include one or more facets on corresponding portions of an implant component. For example the facets can be separated by a space or by a step cut connecting two corresponding facets that reside on parallel or non parallel planes. These bone facing surface features can be applied to various joint implants including knee hip spine and shoulder joint implants.

Any one or more bone cuts can include one or more facets. For example the implant components exemplified in and depict corresponding condylar facets for each of the distal bone cut posterior bone cut first posterior chamfer bone cut and second posterior chamfer bone cut. In distal bone cut facets on lateral and medial condyles are identified by and respectively. Facets of a bone cut can be separated by a space between corresponding regions of an implant component as exemplified by the condylar facets separated by the intercondylar space in and . Alternatively or in addition facets of a bone cut can be separated by a step cut for example a vertical or angled cut connecting two non coplanar or non facets of a bone cut. As shown by the implant components exemplified in each of and each bone cut and or bone cut facet can be substantially planar. Two substantially planar facets of the same bone cut can be non coplanar i.e. not lying in the same cut plane and or non parallel i.e. not lying in the same cut plane and not lying in a substantially parallel cut plane .

In certain embodiments one or more bone cut facets bone cuts and or the entire bone facing surface of an implant can be non planar for example substantially curvilinear. illustrates a femoral implant component having two planar bone cuts and one curvilinear bone cut . In the figure the femoral implant component is shown attached to resected surfaces of a femur .

In certain embodiments corresponding sections of an implant component can include different thicknesses i.e. distance between the component s bone facing surface and joint facing surface surface features bone cut features section volumes and or other features. For example as shown in the corresponding distal lateral and medial sections of the implant identified by and on their respective bone cut facets include different thicknesses section volumes bone cut angles and bone cut surface areas. As this example illustrates one or more of the thicknesses section volumes bone cut angles bone cut surface areas bone cut curvatures numbers of bone cuts peg placements peg angles and other features may vary between two or more sections e.g. corresponding sections on lateral and medial condyles of an implant component. Alternatively or in addition one more or all of these features can be the same in corresponding sections of an implant component. An implant design that allows for independent features on different sections of an implant allows various options for achieving one or more goals including for example 1 deformity correction and limb alignment 2 preserving bone cartilage and or ligaments 3 preserving and or optimizing other features of the patient s anatomy such as trochlea and trochlear shape 4 restoring and or optimizing joint kinematics or biomechanics and or 5 restoring and or optimizing joint line location and or joint gap width.

In certain embodiments it can be advantageous to maintain certain features across different portions of an implant component while varying certain other features. For example two or more corresponding sections of an implant component can include the same implant thickness es . As a specific example with a femoral implant component corresponding medial and lateral sections of the implant s condyles e.g. distal medial and lateral condyle and or posterior medial and lateral condyles can be designed to include the same thickness or at least a threshold thickness particularly the bone cut intersections. Alternatively or in addition every section on the medial and lateral condyles can be designed to include the same thickness or at least a threshold thickness. This approach is particularly useful when the corresponding implant sections are exposed to similar stress forces and therefore require similar minimum thicknesses in response to those stresses. Alternatively or in addition an implant design can include a rule such that a quantifiable feature of one section is always greater than greater than or equal to less than or less than or equal to the same feature of another section of the implant component. For example in certain embodiments an implant design can include a lateral distal and or posterior condylar portion that is thicker than or equal in thickness to the corresponding medial distal and or posterior condylar portion. Similarly in certain embodiments an implant design can include a lateral distal posterior condyle height that is higher than or equal to the corresponding medial posterior condylar height.

In certain embodiments one or more of an implant component s bone cut or bone cut facet features e.g. thickness section volume cut angle surface area and or other features can be patient adapted. For example as described more fully below patient specific data such as imaging data of a patient s joint can be used to select and or design an implant component and optionally a corresponding surgical procedure and or surgical tool that matches a patient s anatomy and or optimizes a parameter of that patient s anatomy. Alternatively or in addition one or more aspects of an implant component for example one or more bone cuts can be selected and or designed to match predetermined resection cuts. Predetermined as used herein includes for example preoperatively determined e.g. preoperatively selected and or designed . For example predetermined resection cuts can include resection cuts determined preoperatively optionally as part of the selection and or design of one or more implant components and or one or more guide tools. Similarly a surgical guide tool can be selected and or designed to guide the predetermined resection cuts. For example the resection cuts and matching component bone cuts and optionally a guide tool can be selected and or designed for example to remove diseased or malformed tissue and or to optimize a desired anatomical and or kinematic parameter such as maximizing bone preservation correcting a joint and or alignment deformity enhancing joint kinematics enhancing or preserving joint line location and or other parameter s described herein.

In various embodiments described herein the outer joint facing surface of an implant component includes one or more patient adapted e.g. patient specific and or patient engineered features . For example in certain embodiments the joint facing surface of an implant component can be designed to match the shape of the patient s biological structure. The joint facing surface can include for example the bearing surface portion of the implant component that engages an opposing biological structure or implant component in the joint to facilitate typical movement of the joint. The patient s biological structure can include for example cartilage bone and or one or more other biological structures.

For example in certain embodiments the joint facing surface of an implant component is designed to match the shape of the patient s articular cartilage. For example the joint facing surface can substantially positively match one or more features of the patient s existing cartilage surface and or healthy cartilage surface and or a calculated cartilage surface on the articular surface that the component replaces. Alternatively it can substantially negatively match one or more features of the patient s existing cartilage surface and or healthy cartilage surface and or a calculated cartilage surface on the opposing articular surface in the joint. As described below corrections can be performed to the shape of diseased cartilage by designing surgical steps and optionally patient adapted surgical tools to re establish a normal or near normal cartilage shape that can then be incorporated into the shape of the joint facing surface of the component. These corrections can be implemented and optionally tested in virtual two dimensional and three dimensional models. The corrections and testing can include kinematic analysis and or surgical steps.

In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of an implant component can be designed to positively match the shape of subchondral bone. For example the joint facing surface of an implant component can substantially positively match one or more features of the patient s existing subchondral bone surface and or healthy subchondral bone surface and or a calculated subchondral bone surface on the articular surface that the component attaches to on its bone facing surface. Alternatively it can substantially negatively match one or more features of the patient s existing subchondral bone surface and or healthy subchondral bone surface and or a calculated subchondral bone surface on the opposing articular surface in the joint. Corrections can be performed to the shape of subchondral bone to re establish a normal or near normal articular shape that can be incorporated into the shape of the component s joint facing surface. A standard thickness can be added to the joint facing surface for example to reflect an average cartilage thickness. Alternatively a variable thickness can be applied to the component. The variable thickness can be selected to reflect a patient s actual or healthy cartilage thickness for example as measured in the individual patient or selected from a standard reference database.

In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of an implant component can include one or more standard features. The standard shape of the joint facing surface of the component can reflect at least in part the shape of typical healthy subchondral bone or cartilage. For example the joint facing surface of an implant component can include a curvature having standard radii or curvature of in one or more directions. Alternatively or in addition an implant component can have a standard thickness or a standard minimum thickness in select areas. Standard thickness es can be added to one or more sections of the joint facing surface of the component or alternatively a variable thickness can be applied to the implant component.

Certain embodiments such as those illustrated by include in addition to a first implant component a second implant component having an opposing joint facing surface. The second implant component s bone facing surface and or joint facing surface can be designed as described above. Moreover in certain embodiments the joint facing surface of the second component can be designed at least in part to match e.g. substantially negatively match the joint facing surface of the first component. Designing the joint facing surface of the second component to complement the joint facing surface of the first component can help reduce implant wear and optimize kinematics. Thus in certain embodiments the joint facing surfaces of the first and second implant components can include features that do not match the patient s existing anatomy but instead negatively match or nearly negatively match the joint facing surface of the opposing implant component.

However when a first implant component s joint facing surface includes a feature adapted to a patient s biological feature a second implant component having a feature designed to match that feature of the first implant component also is adapted to the patient s same biological feature. By way of illustration when a joint facing surface of a first component is adapted to a portion of the patient s cartilage shape the opposing joint facing surface of the second component designed to match that feature of the first implant component also is adapted to the patient s cartilage shape. When the joint facing surface of the first component is adapted to a portion of a patient s subchondral bone shape the opposing joint facing surface of the second component designed to match that feature of the first implant component also is adapted to the patient s subchondral bone shape. When the joint facing surface of the first component is adapted to a portion of a patient s cortical bone the joint facing surface of the second component designed to match that feature of the first implant component also is adapted to the patient s cortical bone shape. When the joint facing surface of the first component is adapted to a portion of a patient s endosteal bone shape the opposing joint facing surface of the second component designed to match that feature of the first implant component also is adapted to the patient s endosteal bone shape. When the joint facing surface of the first component is adapted to a portion of a patient s bone marrow shape the opposing joint facing surface of the second component designed to match that feature of the first implant component also is adapted to the patient s bone marrow shape.

The opposing joint facing surface of a second component can substantially negatively match the joint facing surface of the first component in one plane or dimension in two planes or dimensions in three planes or dimensions or in several planes or dimensions. For example the opposing joint facing surface of the second component can substantially negatively match the joint facing surface of the first component in the coronal plane only in the sagittal plane only or in both the coronal and sagittal planes.

In creating a substantially negatively matching contour on an opposing joint facing surface of a second component geometric considerations can improve wear between the first and second components. For example the radii of a concave curvature on the opposing joint facing surface of the second component can be selected to match or to be slightly larger in one or more dimensions than the radii of a convex curvature on the joint facing surface of the first component. Similarly the radii of a convex curvature on the opposing joint facing surface of the second component can be selected to match or to be slightly smaller in one or more dimensions than the radii of a concave curvature on the joint facing surface of the first component. In this way contact surface area can be maximized between articulating convex and concave curvatures on the respective surfaces of first and second implant components.

The bone facing surface of the second component can be designed to negatively match at least in part the shape of articular cartilage subchondral bone cortical bone endosteal bone or bone marrow e.g. surface contour angle or perimeter shape of a resected or native biological structure . It can have any of the features described above for the bone facing surface of the first component such as having one or more patient adapted bone cuts to match one or more predetermined resection cuts.

Many combinations of first component and second component bone facing surfaces and joint facing surfaces are possible. Table 3 provides illustrative combinations that may be employed.

The implants and implant systems described herein include any number of patient adapted implant components and any number of non patient adapted implant components. An illustrative implant or implant system is depicted in . Specifically shows a photograph of a patient adapted knee replacement implant system that includes a patient specific bicompartmental implant component and patient specific unicompartmental implant component . Both components are patient specific on both their bone facing surfaces and on their joint facing surfaces. show x ray images showing the implant of in the coronal plane and the sagittal plane .

In certain embodiments the implants and implant systems described herein can include a combination of implant components such as a traditional unicompartmental device with a patient specific bicompartmental device or a combination of a patient specific unicompartmental device with standard bicompartmental device. Such implant combinations allow for a flexible design of an implant or implant system that includes both standard and patient specific features and components. This flexibility and level of patient specificity allows for various engineered optimizations such as retention of alignments maximization of bone preservation and or restoration of normal or near normal patient kinematics.

In certain embodiments an implant component is designed and installed as one or more pieces. For example illustrates a femoral implant component that can be installed in two pieces.

Embodiments described herein can be applied to partial or total joint replacement systems. Bone cuts or changes to an implant component dimension described herein can be applied to a portion of the dimension or to the entire dimension.

As mentioned above certain embodiments include implant components designed and made using patient specific data that is collected preoperatively. The patient specific data can include points surfaces and or landmarks collectively referred to herein as reference points. In certain embodiments the reference points can be selected and used to derive a varied or altered surface such as without limitation an ideal surface or structure. For example the reference points can be used to create a model of the patient s relevant biological feature s and or one or more patient adapted surgical steps tools and implant components. For example the reference points can be used to design a patient adapted implant component having at least one patient specific or patient engineered feature such as a surface dimension or other feature.

Sets of reference points can be grouped to form reference structures used to create a model of a joint and or an implant design. Designed implant surfaces can be derived from single reference points triangles polygons or more complex surfaces such as parametric or subdivision surfaces or models of joint material such as for example articular cartilage subchondral bone cortical bone endosteal bone or bone marrow. Various reference points and reference structures can be selected and manipulated to derive a varied or altered surface such as without limitation an ideal surface or structure.

The reference points can be located on or in the joint that will receive the patient specific implant. For example the reference points can include weight bearing surfaces or locations in or on the joint a cortex in the joint and or an endosteal surface of the joint. The reference points also can include surfaces or locations outside of but related to the joint. Specifically reference points can include surfaces or locations functionally related to the joint. For example in embodiments directed to the knee joint reference points can include one or more locations ranging from the hip down to the ankle or foot. The reference points also can include surfaces or locations homologous to the joint receiving the implant. For example in embodiments directed to a knee a hip or a shoulder joint reference points can include one or more surfaces or locations from the contralateral knee hip or shoulder joint.

Reference points and or data for obtaining measurements of a patient s joint for example relative position measurements length or distance measurements curvature measurements surface contour measurements thickness measurements in one location or across a surface volume measurements filled or empty volume density measurements and other measurements can be obtained using any suitable technique. For example one dimensional two dimensional and or three dimensional measurements can be obtained using data collected from mechanical means laser devices electromagnetic or optical tracking systems molds materials applied to the articular surface that harden as a negative match of the surface contour and or one or more imaging techniques described above and or known in the art. Data and measurements can be obtained non invasively and or preoperatively. Alternatively measurements can be obtained intraoperatively for example using a probe or other surgical device during surgery.

In certain embodiments an imaging data collected from the patient for example imaging data from one or more of x ray imaging digital tomosynthesis cone beam CT non spiral or spiral CT non isotropic or isotropic MRI SPECT PET ultrasound laser imaging photo acoustic imaging is used to qualitatively and or quantitatively measure one or more of a patient s biological features one or more of normal cartilage diseased cartilage a cartilage defect an area of denuded cartilage subchondral bone cortical bone endosteal bone bone marrow a ligament a ligament attachment or origin menisci labrum a joint capsule articular structures and or voids or spaces between or within any of these structures. The qualitatively and or quantitatively measured biological features can include but are not limited to one or more of length width height depth and or thickness curvature for example curvature in two dimensions e.g. curvature in or projected onto a plane curvature in three dimensions and or a radius or radii of curvature shape for example two dimensional shape or three dimensional shape area for example surface area and or surface contour perimeter shape and or volume of for example the patient s cartilage bone subchondral bone cortical bone endosteal bone and or other bone ligament and or voids or spaces between them.

In certain embodiments measurements of biological features can include any one or more of the illustrative measurements identified in Table 4.

Depending on the clinical application a single or any combination or all of the measurements described in Table 4 and or known in the art can be used. Additional patient specific measurements and information that be used in the evaluation can include for example joint kinematic measurements bone density measurements bone porosity measurements identification of damaged or deformed tissues or structures and patient information such as patient age weight gender ethnicity activity level and overall health status.

The patient specific measurements selected for the evaluation then can be used to select e.g. from a library to design or to select and design an implant component having one or more measurements corresponding to or derived from the one or more of the assessed patient specific measurements. For example the implant component can include one or more patient specific measurements and or one or more patient engineered measurements. Optionally one or more patient specific models one or more patient adapted surgical steps and or one or more patient adapted surgical guide tools also can be selected and or designed to include one or more measurements corresponding to or derived from the one or more of these patient specific measurements.

In certain embodiments one or more models of at least a portion of a patient s joint can be generated. Specifically the patient specific data and or measurements described above can be used to generate a model that includes at least a portion of the patient s joint. Optionally one or more patient engineered resection cuts one or more drill holes one or more patient adapted guide tools and or one or more patient adapted implant components can be included in a model. In certain embodiments a model of at least part of a patient s joint can be used to directly generate a patient engineered resection cut strategy a patient adapted guide tool design and or a patient adapted implant component design for a surgical procedure i.e. without the model itself including one or more resection cuts one or more drill holes one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components . In certain embodiments the model that includes at least a portion of the patient s joint also can include or display as part of the model one or more resection cuts one or more drill holes e.g. on a model of the patient s femur one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components that have been designed for the particular patient using the model. Moreover one or more resection cuts one or more drill holes one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components can be modeled and selected and or designed separate from a model of a particular patient s biological feature.

Various methods can be used to generate a model. As illustrated in in certain embodiments the method of generating a model of a patient s joint and or a resection cut drill hole guide tool and or implant component can include one or more of the steps of obtaining image data of a patient s biological structure segmenting the image data combining the segmented data and presenting the data as part of a model .

Image data can be obtained from near or within the patient s biological structure of interest. For example pixel or voxel data from one or more radiographic or tomographic images of a patient s joint can be obtained for example using computed or magnetic resonance tomography. In this or a subsequent step one or more of the pixels or voxels can be converted into one or a set of values. For example a single pixel voxel or a group of pixel voxels can be converted to coordinate values e.g. a point in a 2D or 3D coordinate system. The set of values also can include a value corresponding to the pixel voxel intensity or relative grayscale color. Moreover the set of values can include information about neighboring pixels or voxels for example information corresponding to relative intensity or grayscale color and or information corresponding to relative position.

Then the image data can be segmented to identify those data corresponding to a particular biological feature of interest. Optionally the segmented data can be combined. For example in a single image segmented and selected reference points e.g. derived from pixels or voxels and or other data can be combined to create a line representing the surface outline of a biological structure. Moreover the segmented and selected data from multiple images can be combined to create a 3D representation of the biological structure. Alternatively the images can be combined to form a 3D data set from which the 3D representation of the biological structure can be derived directly using a 3D segmentation technique for example an active surface or active shape model algorithm or other model based or surface fitting algorithm.

Optionally the 3D representation of the biological structure can be generated or manipulated for example smoothed or corrected for example by employing a 3D polygon surface a subdivision surface or parametric surface for example a non uniform rational B spline NURBS surface. For a description of various parametric surface representations see for example Foley J. D. et al. Computer Graphics Principles and Practice in C Addison Wesley 2nd edition 1995 . Various methods are available for creating a parametric surface. For example the 3D representation can be converted directly into a parametric surface for example by connecting data points to create a surface of polygons and applying rules for polygon curvatures surface curvatures and other features. Alternatively a parametric surface can be best fit to the 3D representation for example using publicly available software such as Geomagic software Research Triangle Park N.C. .

Then the data can be presented as part of a model for example a patient specific virtual model that includes the biological feature of interest. Optionally the data associated with one or more biological features can be transferred to one or more resection cuts drill holes guide tools and or implant components which also can be included as part of the same model or in a different model. The virtual model s can be used to generate one or more patient adapted guide tools and or implant components for surgical use for example using computer aided design CAD software and or one or more of the several manufacturing techniques described below optionally in conjunction with computer aided manufacturing CAM software.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art one or more of these steps can be repeated as often as desired to achieve the desired result. Moreover the steps can be repeated reiteratively . Moreover the practitioner can proceed directly from the step of segmenting image data to presenting the data as part of a model . Data models and or any related guide tools or implant components can be collected in one or more libraries for subsequent use for the same patient or for a different patient e.g. a different patient with similar data .

In certain embodiments the reference points and or measurements described above can be processed using mathematical functions to derive virtual corrected features which may represent a restored ideal or desired feature from which a patient adapted implant component can be designed. For example one or more features such as surfaces or dimensions of a biological structure can be modeled altered added to changed deformed eliminated corrected and or otherwise manipulated collectively referred to herein as variation of an existing surface or structure within the joint .

Variation of the joint or portions of the joint can include without limitation variation of one or more external surfaces internal surfaces joint facing surfaces uncut surfaces cut surfaces altered surfaces and or partial surfaces as well as osteophytes subchondral cysts geodes or areas of eburnation joint flattening contour irregularity and loss of normal shape. The surface or structure can be or reflect any surface or structure in the joint including without limitation bone surfaces ridges plateaus cartilage surfaces ligament surfaces or other surfaces or structures. The surface or structure derived can be an approximation of a healthy joint surface or structure or can be another variation. The surface or structure can be made to include pathological alterations of the joint. The surface or structure also can be made whereby the pathological joint changes are virtually removed in whole or in part.

Once one or more reference points measurements structures surfaces models or combinations thereof have been selected or derived the resultant shape can be varied deformed or corrected. In certain embodiments the variation can be used to select and or design an implant component having an ideal or optimized feature or shape e.g. corresponding to the deformed or corrected joint feature or shape. For example in one application of this embodiment the ideal or optimized implant shape reflects the shape of the patient s joint before he or she developed arthritis.

Alternatively or in addition the variation can be used to select and or design a patient adapted surgical procedure to address the deformity or abnormality. For example the variation can include surgical alterations to the joint such as virtual resection cuts virtua drill holes virtual removal of osteophytes and or virtual building of structural support in the joint deemed necessary or beneficial to a desired final outcome for a patient.

Corrections can be used to address osteophytes subchondral voids and other patient specific defects or abnormalities. In the case of osteophytes a design for the bone facing surface of an implant component or guide tool can be selected and or designed after the osteophyte has been virtually removed. Alternatively the osteophyte can be integrated into the shape of the bone facing surface of the implant component or guide tool. are exemplary drawings of an end of a femur having an osteophyte . In the selection and or design of an implant component for a particular patient an image or model of the patient s bone that includes the osteophyte can be transformed such that the osteophyte is virtually removed as shown in at removed osteophyte to produce as shown in an implant component based on a smooth surface at the end of femur . Alternatively as shown in an implant component can be selected and or designed to conform to the shape of the osteophyte . In the case of building additional or improved structure additional features of the implant component then can be derived after bone facing surface correction is modeled. Optionally a surgical strategy and or one or more guide tools can be selected and or designed to reflect the correction and correspond to the implant component.

Similarly to address a subchondral void a selection and or design for the bone facing surface of an implant component can be derived after the void has been virtually removed e.g. filled . Alternatively the subchondral void can be integrated into the shape of the bone facing surface of the implant component. are exemplary drawings of an end of a femur having a subchondral void . During development of an implant an image or model of the patient s bone that includes the void can be transformed such that the void is virtually removed as shown in at removed void to produce as shown in an implant component based on a smooth surface at the end of femur . Alternatively implant can be selected and or designed to conform to the shape of void as shown in . Note that while virtually conforming to void implant may not practically be able to be inserted into the void. Therefore in an certain embodiments the implant may only partially protrude into a void in the bone. Optionally a surgical strategy and or one or more guide tools can be selected and or designed to reflect the correction and correspond to the implant component.

In addition to osteophytes and subchondral voids the methods surgical strategies guide tools and implant components described herein can be used to address various other patient specific joint defects or phenomena. In certain embodiments correction can include the virtual removal of tissue for example to address an articular defect to remove subchondral cysts and or to remove diseased or damaged tissue e.g. cartilage bone or other types of tissue such as osteochondritic tissue necrotic tissue and or torn tissue. In such embodiments the correction can include the virtual removal of the tissue e.g. the tissue corresponding to the defect cyst disease or damage and the bone facing surface of the implant component can be derived after the tissue has been virtually removed. In certain embodiments the implant component can be selected and or designed to include a thickness or other features that substantially matches the removed tissue and or optimizes one or more parameters of the joint. Optionally a surgical strategy and or one or more guide tools can be selected and or designed to reflect the correction and correspond to the implant component.

In certain embodiments a correction can include the virtual addition of tissue or material for example to address an articular defect loss of ligament stability and or a bone stock deficiency such as a flattened articular surface that should be round. In certain embodiments the additional material may be virtually added and optionally then added in surgery using filler materials such as bone cement bone graft material and or other bone fillers. Alternatively or in addition the additional material may be virtually added as part of the implant component for example by using a bone facing surface and or component thickness that match the correction or by otherwise integrating the correction into the shape of the implant component. Then the joint facing and or other features of the implant can be derived. This correction can be designed to re establish a near normal shape for the patient. Alternatively the correction can be designed to establish a standardized shape or surface for the patient.

In certain embodiments the patient s abnormal or flattened articular surface can be integrated into the shape of the implant component for example the bone facing surface of the implant component can be designed to substantially negatively match the abnormal or flattened surface at least in part and the thickness of the implant can be designed to establish the patient s healthy or an optimum position of the patient s structure in the joint. Moreover the joint facing surface of the implant component also can be designed to re establish a near normal anatomic shape reflecting for example at least in part the shape of normal cartilage or subchondral bone. Alternatively it can be designed to establish a standardized shape.

In certain embodiments models can be generated to show defects of interest in a patient s joint. For example a model or set of models of a patient s joint can be generated showing defects of interest and optionally another model or set of models can be generated showing no defects e.g. as defect and reference or before and after models . Alternatively or in addition the same or additional models can be generated with and or without resection cuts guide tools and or implant components positioned in the model. Moreover the same or additional models can be generated to show defects of interest that interfere with one or more resection cuts guide tools and or implant components. Such models showing defects of interest resection cuts guide tools implant components and or interfering defects of interest can be particularly useful as a reference or guide to a surgeon or clinician prior to and or during surgery for example in identifying proper placement of a guide tool or implant component at one or more steps in a surgery and or in identifying features of a patient s anatomy that he or she may want to alter during one or more steps in a surgery. Accordingly such models that provide for example patient specific renderings of implant assemblies and defects of interest e.g. osteophyte structures together with bone models are useful in aiding surgeons and clinicians in surgery planning and or during surgery.

In certain embodiments a model or set of models of a patient s biological structure are obtained and or generated to show one or more defects of interest one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools one or more implant components and or a combination of any of these. For models that include defects of interest the defects can be categorized and differentiated into various groups and displayed on the model or set of models in any way that conveys the appropriate information to a surgeon or clinician. For example two or more defects can be differentiated into categories based on defect type defect location severity of the defect potential interference with a guide tool or implant component and or any one or more other useful categories.

In certain embodiments one or more additional models or set of models of the patient s biological structure also can be generated and conveyed to the surgeon or clinician to show an additional presence or absence of one or more defects of interest one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components or any combination of these. illustrate models for one particular patient receiving a single compartment knee implant having both femoral and tibial implant components. In a first set of models illustrated in the top panel shows two perspectives of a patient s distal femur and the bottom panel shows two images of the patient s proximal tibia without left image and with right image a patient adapted guide tool. In both the top and bottom panels defects osteophytes in this example are categorized and differentiated into two colors beige and red. The light colored osteophytes depict osteophytes that do not interfere with placement of the guide tools or implant components. The dark colored osteophytes depict osteophytes that will interfere with placement of a guide tool or an implant component. Accordingly the categorization of the osteophytes serve as a guide or reference to the surgeon or clinician in determining which osteophytes should be removed prior to placement of the guide tools or implant components.

In a second set of models illustrated in the top panel shows two images of a patient s distal femur with a patient adapted guide tool left image and with a patient adapted unicompartmental femoral implant component right image . The bottom panel shows two images of the patient s proximal tibia with a patient adapted guide tool left image and with a patient adapted unicompartmental tibial implant component right image . The images in this figure show no osteophytes. Instead these images show how each guide tool and implant component engages the patient s biological structure. In addition the images showing the guide tools also show corresponding resection planes and the patient s tibial mechanical axis . Accordingly these images can serve as a guide or reference to the surgeon or clinician in planning and or determining the surgical placement of the guide tools implant components and related resection cuts.

Computer software programs to generate models of patient specific renderings of implant assembly and defects e.g. osteophyte structures together with bone models to aid in surgery planning can be developed using various publicly available programming environments and languages for example Matlab 7.3 and Matlab Compiler 4.5 C or Java. In certain embodiments the computer software program can have a user interface that includes one or more of the components identified in . Alternatively one or more off the shelf applications can be used to generate the models such as SolidWorks Rhinoceros 3D Slicer or Amira.

An illustrative flow chart of the high level processes of an exemplary computer software program is shown in . Briefly a data path associated with one or more patient folders that include data files for example patient specific CT images solid models and segmentation images is selected. The data files associated with the data path can be checked for example using file filters to confirm that all data files are present. For example in generating models for a knee implant a data path can confirm the presence of one several or all coronal CT data files sagittal CT data files a femoral solid model data file a tibial solid model data file a femoral guide tool model a tibial guide tool model a femoral coronal segmentation model a femoral sagittal segmentation model a tibial coronal segmentation model and a tibial sagittal segmentation model. If the filter check identifies a missing file the user can be notified. In certain instances for example if a tibial or femoral guide tool model file is unavailable the user may elect to continue the process without certain steps for example without guide tool defect e.g. osteophyte interference analysis.

Next a patient specific bone surface model is obtained and or rendered. The bone surface model provides basic patient specific features of the patient s biological structure and serves as a reference for comparison against a model or value that includes the defect s of interest. As an illustrative example previously generated patient specific files for example STL files exported from SOLID IGES files in SolidWorks can be loaded for example as triangulation points with sequence indices and normal vectors. The triangles then can be rendered e.g. using Matlab TRISURF function to supply or generate the bone surface model. The bone surface model can include corrections of defects such as osteophytes removed from the bone. In a similar fashion one or more guide tool models can be obtained and or rendered.

Next a patient specific model or values of the patient s biological feature that include the defect of interest can be obtained and or rendered. For example patient specific defects such as osteophytes can be identified from analysis of the patient s segmentation images and corresponding CT scan images. The transformation matrix of scanner coordinate space to image matrix space can be calculated from image slice positions e.g. the first and last image slice positions . Then patient specific segmentation images for the corresponding scan direction can be assessed along with CT image slices that correspond to the loaded segmentation images. Images can be processed slice by slice and using selected threshold values e.g. intensity thresholds Hounsfield unit thresholds or neighboring pixel voxel value thresholds pixels and or voxels corresponding to the defects of interest e.g. osteophytes can be identified. The identified voxels can provide a binary bone surface volume that includes the defects of interest as part of the surface of the patient s biological structure. Various masks can be employed to mask out features that are not of interest for example an adjacent biological surface. In some instances masking can generate apparent unattached portions of an osteophyte defect for example when a mask covers a portion of an osteophyte extension.

Next the defects of interest are isolated by comparing the model that does not include the defects of interest e.g. bone surface model with the model or value that does include the defects of interest e.g. the binary bone surface volume . For example the triangulation points of the bone surface model can be transformed onto an image volume space to obtain a binary representation of the model. This volume binary can be dilated and thinned to obtain a binary bone model. The binary bone model then can serve as a mask to the binary bone surface volume to identify defect volume separate from the binary bone surface volume. For example for osteophyte detection the osteophyte volume e.g. osteophyte binary volume as well as the osteophyte position and attachment surface area can be distinguished from the patient s biological structure using this comparative analysis. Various thresholds and filters can be applied to remove noise and or enhance defect detection in this step. For example structures that have less than a minimum voxel volume e.g. less than 100 voxels can be removed. Alternatively or in addition rules can be added to reattach any portion of an osteophyte defect that appears unattached e.g. due to a masking step.

In an alternative approach surface data can be used instead of voxel or volume data when comparing the bone surface model with corrected defects and the patient s actual bone surface. The bone surface model for example can be loaded as a mesh surface e.g. in an STL file or a parametric surface e.g. in an IGES file without conversion to volumetric voxel data. The patient s natural bone surface can be derived from the medical image data e.g. CT data using for example a marching cubes or isosurface algorithm resulting in a second surface data set. The bone surface model and the natural bone surface can be compared for example by calculating intersection between the two surfaces.

Next optionally the models can be used to detect interference between any defect volume and the placement of one or more guide tools and or implant components. For example guide tool model triangulation points can be transformed onto an image volume space to obtain a binary representation of the guide tool. The binary structure then can be manipulated e.g. dilated and eroded using voxel balls having pre set diameters to obtain a solid field mask. The solid field mask can be compared against the defect volume for example the osteophyte binary volume to identify interfering defect volume for example interfering osteophyte binary volume. In this way interfering defect volume and non interfering defect volume can be determined e.g. using Matlab ISOSURFACE function for example using representative colors or some other distinguishing features in a model. See e.g. . The resulting model image can be rendered on a virtual rendering canvas e.g. using Matlab GETFRAME function and saved onto a computer readable medium.

Finally optionally as exemplified by and A B one or more combinations of model features can be combined into one or models or sets of models that convey desired information to the surgeon or clinician. For example patient specific bone models can be combined with any number of defects or defect types any number of resection cuts any number of drill holes any number of axes any number of guide tools and or any number of implant components to convey as much information as desired to the surgeon or clinician. The patient specific bone model can model any biological structure for example any one or more or portion of a femoral head and or an acetabulum a distal femur one or both femoral condyle s and or a tibial plateau a trochlea and or a patella a glenoid and or a humeral head a talar dome and or a tibial plafond a distal humerus a radial head and or an ulna and a radius and or a scaphoid. Defects that can be combined with a patient specific bone model can include for example osteophytes voids subchondral cysts articular shape defects e.g. rounded or flattened articular surfaces or surface portions varus or valgus deformities or any other deformities known to those in the art.

The models can include virtual corrections reflecting a surgical plan such as one or more of removed osteophytes cut planes drill holes realignments of mechanical or anatomical axes. The models can include comparison views demonstrating the anatomical situation before and after applying the planned correction. The individual steps of the surgical plan can also be illustrated in a series of step by step images wherein each image shows a different step of the surgical procedure.

The models can be presented to the surgeon as a printed or digital set of images. In another embodiment the models are transmitted to the surgeon as a digital file which the surgeon can display on a local computer. The digital file can contain image renderings of the models. Alternatively the models can be displayed in an animation or video. The models can also be presented as a 3D model that is interactively rendered on the surgeon s computer. The models can for example be rotated to be viewed from different angles. Different components of the models such as bone surfaces defects resection cuts axes guide tools or implants can be turned on and off collectively or individually to illustrate or simulate the individual patient s surgical plan. The 3D model can be transmitted to the surgeon in a variety of formats for example in Adobe 3D PDF or as a SolidWorks eDrawing.

Proper joint and limb function depend on correct limb alignment. For example in repairing a knee joint with one or more knee implant components optimal functioning of the new knee depends on the correct alignment of the anatomical and or mechanical axes of the lower extremity. Accordingly an important consideration in designing and or replacing a natural joint with one or more implant components is proper limb alignment or when the malfunctioning joint contributes to a misalignment proper realignment of the limb.

Certain embodiments described herein include collecting and using data from imaging tests to virtually determine in one or more planes one or more of an anatomic axis and a mechanical axis and the related misalignment of a patient s limb. The misalignment of a limb joint relative to the axis can identify the degree of deformity for example varus or valgus deformity in the coronal plane or genu antecurvatum or recurvatum deformity in the sagittal plane. Then one or more of the patient specific implant components and or the implant procedure steps such as bone resection can be designed to help correct the misalignment.

The imaging tests that can be used to virtually determine a patient s axis and misalignment can include one or more of such as x ray imaging digital tomosynthesis cone beam CT non spiral or spiral CT non isotropic or isotropic MRI SPECT PET ultrasound laser imaging and photoacoustic imaging including studies utilizing contrast agents. Data from these tests can be used to determine anatomic reference points or limb alignment including alignment angles within the same and between different joints or to simulate normal limb alignment. Any anatomic features related to the misalignment can be selected and imaged. For example in certain embodiments such as for a knee or hip implant the imaging test can include data from at least one of or several of a hip joint knee joint and ankle joint. The imaging test can be obtained in lying prone supine or standing position. The imaging test can include only the target joint or both the target joint and also selected data through one or more adjoining joints.

Using the image data one or more mechanical or anatomical axes angles planes or combinations thereof can be determined. In certain embodiments such axes angles and or planes can include or be derived from one or more of a Whiteside s line Blumensaat s line transepicondylar line femoral shaft axis femoral neck axis acetabular angle lines tangent to the superior and inferior acetabular margin lines tangent to the anterior or posterior acetabular margin femoral shaft axis tibial shaft axis transmalleolar axis posterior condylar line tangent s to the trochlea of the knee joint tangents to the medial or lateral patellar facet lines tangent or perpendicular to the medial and lateral posterior condyles lines tangent or perpendicular to a central weight bearing zone of the medial and lateral femoral condyles lines transecting the medial and lateral posterior condyles for example through their respective centerpoints lines tangent or perpendicular to the tibial tuberosity lines vertical or at an angle to any of the aforementioned lines and or lines tangent to or intersecting the cortical bone of any bone adjacent to or enclosed in a joint. Moreover estimating a mechanical axis an angle or plane also can be performed using image data obtained through two or more joints such as the knee and ankle joint for example by using the femoral shaft axis and a centerpoint or other point in the ankle such as a point between the malleoli.

As one example if surgery of the knee or hip is contemplated the imaging test can include acquiring data through at least one of or several of a hip joint knee joint or ankle joint. As another example if surgery of the knee joint is contemplated a mechanical axis can be determined. For example the centerpoint of the hip knee and ankle can be determined. By connecting the centerpoint of the hip with that of the ankle a mechanical axis can be determined in the coronal plane. The position of the knee relative to said mechanical axis can be a reflection of the degree of varus or valgus deformity. The same determinations can be made in the sagittal plane for example to determine the degree of genu antecurvatum or recurvatum. Similarly any of these determinations can be made in any other desired planes in two or three dimensions.

Exemplary methods for virtually aligning a patient s lower extremity are described below in Example 9. In particular Example 9 illustrates methods for determining a patient s tibial mechanical axis femoral mechanical axis and the sagittal and coronal planes for each axis. However any current and future method for determining limb alignment and simulating normal knee alignment can be used.

Once the proper alignment of the patient s extremity has been determined virtually one or more surgical steps e.g. resection cuts surgical tools e.g. tools to guide the resection cuts and or implant components e.g. components having variable thicknesses to address misalignment .

Cartilage loss in one compartment can lead to progressive joint deformity. For example cartilage loss in a medial compartment of the knee can lead to varus deformity. In certain embodiments cartilage loss can be estimated in the affected compartments. The estimation of cartilage loss can be done using an ultrasound MRI or CT scan or other imaging modality optionally with intravenous or intra articular contrast. The estimation of cartilage loss can be as simple as measuring or estimating the amount of joint space loss seen on x rays. For the latter typically standing x rays are preferred. If cartilage loss is measured from x rays using joint space loss cartilage loss on one or two opposing articular surfaces can be estimated by for example dividing the measured or estimated joint space loss by two to reflect the cartilage loss on one articular surface. Other ratios or calculations are applicable depending on the joint or the location within the joint. Subsequently a normal cartilage thickness can be virtually established on one or more articular surfaces by simulating normal cartilage thickness. In this manner a normal or near normal cartilage surface can be derived. Normal cartilage thickness can be virtually simulated using a computer for example based on computer models for example using the thickness of adjacent normal cartilage cartilage in a contralateral joint or other anatomic information including subchondral bone shape or other articular geometries. Cartilage models and estimates of cartilage thickness can also be derived from anatomic reference databases that can be matched for example to a patient s weight sex height race gender or articular geometry ies .

In certain embodiments a patient s limb alignment can be virtually corrected by realigning the knee after establishing a normal cartilage thickness or shape in the affected compartment by moving the joint bodies for example femur and tibia so that the opposing cartilage surfaces including any augmented or derived or virtual cartilage surface touch each other typically in the preferred contact areas. These contact areas can be simulated for various degrees of flexion or extension.

The patient adapted implants e.g. implants having one or more patient specific and or patient engineered features of certain embodiments can be designed based on patient specific data to optimize one or more parameters including but not limited to 1 deformity correction and limb alignment 2 maximum preservation of bone cartilage or ligaments 3 preservation and or optimization of features of the patient s biology such as trochlea and trochlear shape 4 restoration and or optimization of joint kinematics and 5 restoration or optimization of joint line location and or joint gap width. Various features of an implant component that can be designed or engineered based on the patient specific data to help meet any number of user defined thresholds for these parameters. The features of an implant that can be designed and or engineered patient specifically can include but are not limited to a implant shape external and internal b implant size c and implant thickness.

There are several advantages that a patient specific implant designed and or engineered to meet or improve one of more of these parameters can have over a traditional implant. These advantages can include for example improved mechanical stability of the extremity opportunity for a pre primary or additional revision implant improved fit with existing or modified biological features improved motion and kinematics and other advantages.

Information regarding the misalignment and the proper mechanical alignment of a patient s limb for example as illustrated in Example 9 can be used to preoperatively design and or select one or more features of a joint implant and or implant procedure. For example based on the difference between the patient s misalignment and the proper mechanical axis a knee implant and implant procedure can be designed and or selected preoperatively to include implant and or resection dimensions that substantially realign the patient s limb to correct or improve a patient s alignment deformity. In addition the process can include selecting and or designing one or more surgical tools e.g. guide tools or cutting jigs to direct the clinician in resectioning the patient s bone in accordance with the preoperatively designed and or selected resection dimensions.

In certain embodiments the degree of deformity correction that is necessary to establish a desired limb alignment is calculated based on information from the alignment of a virtual model of a patient s limb. The virtual model can be generated from patient specific data such 2D and or 3D imaging data of the patient s limb. The deformity correction can correct varus or valgus alignment or antecurvatum or recurvatum alignment. In a preferred embodiment the desired deformity correction returns the leg to normal alignment for example a zero degree biomechanical axis in the coronal plane and absence of genu antecurvatum and recurvatum in the sagittal plane.

The preoperatively designed and or selected implant or implant component resection dimension s and or cutting jig s can be employed to correct a patient s alignment deformity in a single plane for example in the coronal plane or in the sagittal plane in multiple planes for example in the coronal and sagittal planes and or in three dimensions. For example Example 9 describes a virtual model of a patient s misaligned lower limb and virtually corrected limb. In particular the patient s lower limb is misaligned in the coronal plane for example a valgus or varus deformity. The deformity correction can be achieved by designing and or selecting one or more of a resection dimension an implant component thickness and an implant component surface curvature that adjusts the mechanical axis or axes into alignment in one or more planes. For example a lower limb misalignment can be corrected in a knee replacement by designing or selecting one or more of a femoral resection dimension a femoral implant component thickness a femoral implant component surface curvature a tibial resection dimension a tibial implant component thickness a tibial implant component insert thickness and a tibial implant component surface curvature to adjust the femoral mechanical axis and tibial mechanical axis into alignment in the coronal plane.

Alternatively or in addition certain implant features such as different implant thicknesses and or surface curvatures across two different sides of the plane in which the mechanical axes are misaligned also can aid correcting limb alignment. For example depicts a coronal plane of the knee shown with femoral implant medial and lateral condyles having different thicknesses to help to correct limb alignment. These features can be used in combination with any of the resection cut described above and or in combination with different thicknesses on the corresponding portions of the tibial component. As described more fully below independent tibial implant components and or independent tibial inserts on medial and lateral sides of the tibial implant component can be used enhance alignment at a patient s knee joint. An implant component can include constant yet different thicknesses in two or more portions of the implant e.g. a constant medial condyle thickness different from a constant lateral condyle thickness a gradually increasing thickness across the implant or a portion of the implant or a combination of constant and gradually increasing thicknesses.

In certain embodiments an implant component that is preoperatively designed and or selected to correct a patient s alignment also can be designed or selected to include additional patient specific or patient engineered features. For example the bone facing surface of an implant or implant component can be designed and or selected to substantially negatively match the resected bone surface. As depicted in the perimeters and areas of two bone surface areas is different for two different bone resection cut depths . Similarly depicts a distal view of the femur in which two different resection cuts are applied. As shown the resected perimeters and surface areas for two distal facet resection depths are different for each of the medial condyle distal cut facet and the lateral condyle distal cut facet .

If resection dimensions are angled for example in the coronal plane and or in the sagittal plane various features of the implant component for example the component bone facing surface can be designed and or selected based on an angled orientation into the joint rather than on a perpendicular orientation For example the perimeter of tibial implant or implant component that substantially positively matches the perimeter of the patient s cut tibial bone has a different shape depending on the angle of the cut. Similarly with a femoral implant component the depth or angle of the distal condyle resection on the medial and or lateral condyle can be designed and or selected to correct a patient alignment deformity. However in so doing one or more of the implant or implant component condyle width length curvature and angle of impact against the tibia can be altered. Accordingly in certain embodiments one or more implant or implant component features such as implant perimeter condyle length condyle width curvature and angle is designed and or selected relative to the a sloping and or non coplanar resection cut.

Traditional orthopedic implants incorporate bone cuts. These bone cuts achieve two objectives they establish a shape of the bone that is adapted to the implant and they help achieve a normal or near normal axis alignment. For example bone cuts can be used with a knee implant to correct an underlying varus of valgus deformity and to shape the articular surface of the bone to fit a standard bone facing surface of a traditional implant component. With a traditional implant multiple bone cuts are placed. However since traditional implants are manufactured off the shelf without use of patient specific information these bone cuts are pre set for a given implant without taking into consideration the unique shape of the patient. Thus by cutting the patient s bone to fit the traditional implant more bone is discarded than is necessary with an implant designed to address the particularly patient s structures and deficiencies.

In certain embodiments resection cuts are optimized to preserve the maximum amount of bone for each individual patient based on a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation of the patient s articular anatomy and geometry and the desired limb alignment and or desired deformity correction. Resection cuts on two opposing articular surfaces can be optimized to achieve the minimum amount of bone resected from one or both articular surfaces.

By adapting resection cuts in the series of two dimensional images or the three dimensional representation on two opposing articular surfaces such as for example a femoral head and an acetabulum one or both femoral condyle s and a tibial plateau a trochlea and a patella a glenoid and a humeral head a talar dome and a tibial plafond a distal humerus and a radial head and or an ulna or a radius and a scaphoid certain embodiments allow for patient individualized bone preserving implant designs that can assist with proper ligament balancing and that can help avoid overstuffing of the joint while achieving optimal bone preservation on one or more articular surfaces in each patient.

The resection cuts also can be designed to meet or exceed a certain minimum material thickness for example the minimum amount of thickness required to ensure biomechanical stability and durability of the implant. In certain embodiments the limiting minimum implant thickness can be defined at the intersection of two adjoining bone cuts on the inner bone facing surface of an implant component. For example in the femoral implant component shown in the minimum thickness of the implant component appears at one or more intersections . In certain embodiments of a femoral implant component the minimum implant thickness can be less than 10 mm less than 9 mm less than 8 mm less than 7 mm and or less than 6 mm.

These optimizations can be performed for one two or three opposing articular surfaces for example in a knee they can be performed on a tibia a femur and a patella.

In a knee different resection cuts can be planned for a medial and lateral femoral condyle. In certain embodiments a single bone cut can be optimized in a patient to maximize bone preservation in that select area for example a posterior condyle. Alternatively multiple or all resection cuts can be optimized. Since a patient s medial and lateral femoral condyles typically have different geometries including for example width length and radii of curvature in multiple planes for example the coronal and the sagittal plane then one or more resection cuts can be optimized in the femur individually for each condyle resulting in resection cuts placed at a different depths angles and or orientations in one condyle relative to the other condyle. For example a horizontal cut in a medial condyle may be anatomically placed more inferior relative to the limb than a horizontal cut in a lateral condyle. The distance of the horizontal cut from the subchondral bone may be the same in each condyle or it can be different in each condyle. Chamfer cuts in the medial and lateral condyle may be placed in different planes rather than the same plane in order to optimize bone preservation. Moreover chamfer cuts in the medial and lateral condyle may be placed at a different angle in order to maximize bone preservation. Posterior cuts may be placed in a different plane parallel or non parallel in a medial and a lateral femoral condyle in order to maximize bone preservation. A medial condyle may include more bone cut facets than a lateral condyle in order to enhance bone preservation or vice versa.

In certain embodiments a measure of bone preservation can include total volume of bone resected volume of bone resected from one or more resection cuts volume of bone resected to fit one or more implant component bone cuts average thickness of bone resected average thickness of bone resected from one or more resection cuts average thickness of bone resected to fit one or more implant component bone cuts maximum thickness of bone resected maximum thickness of bone resected from one or more resection cuts maximum thickness of bone resected to fit one or more implant component bone cuts.

Certain embodiments of femoral implant components described herein include more than five bone cuts for example six seven eight nine or more bone cuts on the inner bone facing surface of the implant component. These bone cuts can be standard in whole or in part or patient adapted in whole or in part. Alternatively certain embodiments include five bone cuts that are patient adapted based on one or more images of the patient s knee. A femoral implant component with greater than five bone cuts of and or with patient adapted bone cuts can allow for enhanced bone preservation over a traditional femoral implant with five standard bone cuts and therefore can perform as a pre primary implant.

A patient specific implant having bone cuts that are non parallel to the cuts of a subsequent primary can result in the primary implant having small gaps between the bone and the inner bone facing surface of the primary implant. These small gaps can result misalignment intersects between the pre primary implant and the subsequent primary implant. For example as shown in the bone cuts shown in red for a pre primary implant component having a flex cut can retain bone as compared to a traditional primary implant shown in outline but a small gap also can be created by the pre primary cut. Any such small gaps can be filled with bone cement when fitting a subsequent primary implant.

In addition to optimizing bone preservation another factor in determining the depth number and or orientation of resection cuts and or implant component bone cuts is desired implant thickness. A minimum implant thickness can be included as part of the resection cut and or bone cut design to ensure a threshold strength for the implant in the face of the stresses and forces associated with joint motion such as standing walking and running Table 5 shows the results of a finite element analysis FEA assessment for femoral implant components of various sizes and with various bone cut numbers and orientations. The maximum principal stress observed in FEA analysis can be used to establish an acceptable minimum implant thickness for an implant component having a particular size and optionally for a particular patient e.g. having a particular weight age activity level etc . Before during and or after establishing a minimum implant component thickness the optimum depth of the resection cuts and the optimum number and orientation of the resection cuts and bone cuts for example for maximum bone preservation can designed.

In certain embodiments an implant component design or selection can depend at least in part on a threshold minimum implant component thickness. In turn the threshold minimum implant component thickness can depend at least in part on patient specific data such as condylar width femoral transepicondylar axis length and or the patient s specific weight. In this way the threshold implant thickness and or any implant component feature can be adapted to a particular patient based on a combination of patient specific geometric data and on patient specific anthropometric data. This approach can apply to any implant component feature for any joint for example the knee the hip or the shoulder.

A weighting optionally can be applied to each bone with regard to the degree of bone preservation achieved. For example if the maximum of bone preservation is desired on a tibia or a sub segment of a tibia femoral bone cuts can be adapted and moved accordingly to ensure proper implant alignment and ligament balancing. Conversely if maximum bone preservation is desired on a femoral condyle a tibial bone cut can be adjusted accordingly. If maximum bone preservation is desired on a patella a resection cut on the opposing trochlea can be adjusted accordingly to ensure maximal patellar bone preservation without inducing any extension deficits. If maximum bone preservation is desired on a trochlea a resection cut on the opposing patella can be adjusted accordingly to ensure maximal patellar bone preservation without inducing any extension deficits. Any combination is possible and different weightings can be applied. The weightings can be applied using mathematical models or for example data derived from patient reference databases.

Implant design and modeling also can be used to achieve ligament sparing for example with regard to the PCL and or the ACL. An imaging test can be utilized to identify for example the origin and or the insertion of the PCL and the ACL on the femur and tibia. The origin and the insertion can be identified by visualizing for example the ligaments directly as is possible with MRI or spiral CT arthrography or by visualizing bony landmarks known to be the origin or insertion of the ligament such as the medial and lateral tibial spines.

An implant system can then be selected or designed based on the image data so that for example the femoral component preserves the ACL and or PCL origin and the tibial component preserves the ACL and or PCL attachment. The implant can be selected or designed so that bone cuts adjacent to the ACL or PCL attachment or origin do not weaken the bone to induce a potential fracture.

For ACL preservation the implant can have two unicompartmental tibial components that can be selected or designed and placed using the image data. Alternatively the implant can have an anterior bridge component. The width of the anterior bridge in AP dimension its thickness in the superoinferior dimension or its length in mediolateral dimension can be selected or designed using the imaging data and specifically the known insertion of the ACL and or PCL.

As can be seen in the posterior margin of an implant component e.g. a polyethylene or metal backed tray with polyethylene inserts can be selected and or designed using the imaging data or shapes derived from the imaging data so that the implant component will not interfere with and stay clear of the PCL. This can be achieved for example by including concavities in the outline of the implant that are specifically designed or selected or adapted to avoid the ligament insertion.

Any implant component can be selected and or adapted in shape so that it stays clear of important ligament structures. Imaging data can help identify or derive shape or location information on such ligamentous structures. For example the lateral femoral condyle of a unicompartmental bicompartmental or total knee system can include a concavity or divet to avoid the popliteus tendon. In a shoulder the glenoid component can include a shape or concavity or divet to avoid a subscapularis tendon or a biceps tendon. In a hip the femoral component can be selected or designed to avoid an iliopsoas or adductor tendons.

In certain embodiments bone cuts and implant shape including at least one of a bone facing or a joint facing surface of the implant can be designed or selected to achieve normal joint kinematics.

In certain embodiments a computer program simulating biomotion of one or more joints such as for example a knee joint or a knee and ankle joint or a hip knee and or ankle joint can be utilized. In certain embodiments patient specific imaging data can be fed into this computer program. For example a series of two dimensional images of a patient s knee joint or a three dimensional representation of a patient s knee joint can be entered into the program. Additionally two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation of the patient s ankle joint and or hip joint may be added.

Alternatively patient specific kinematic data for example obtained in a gait lab can be fed into the computer program. Alternatively patient specific navigation data for example generated using a surgical navigation system image guided or non image guided can be fed into the computer program. This kinematic or navigation data can for example be generated by applying optical or RF markers to the limb and by registering the markers and then measuring limb movements for example flexion extension abduction adduction rotation and other limb movements.

Optionally other data including anthropometric data may be added for each patient. These data can include but are not limited to the patient s age gender weight height size body mass index and race. Desired limb alignment and or deformity correction can be added into the model. The position of bone cuts on one or more articular surfaces as well as the intended location of implant bearing surfaces on one or more articular surfaces can be entered into the model.

A patient specific biomotion model can be derived that includes combinations of parameters listed above. The biomotion model can simulate various activities of daily life including normal gait stair climbing descending stairs running kneeling squatting sitting and any other physical activity. The biomotion model can start out with standardized activities typically derived from reference databases. These reference databases can be for example generated using biomotion measurements using force plates and motion trackers using radiofrequency or optical markers and video equipment.

The biomotion model can then be individualized with use of patient specific information including at least one of but not limited to the patient s age gender weight height body mass index and race the desired limb alignment or deformity correction and the patient s imaging data for example a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation of the joint for which surgery is contemplated.

An implant shape including associated bone cuts generated in the preceding optimizations for example limb alignment deformity correction bone preservation on one or more articular surfaces can be introduced into the model. Table 6 includes an exemplary list of parameters that can be measured in a patient specific biomotion model.

The above list is not meant to be exhaustive but only exemplary. Any other biomechanical parameter known in the art can be included in the analysis.

The resultant biomotion data can be used to further optimize the implant design with the objective to establish normal or near normal kinematics. The implant optimizations can include one or multiple implant components. Implant optimizations based on patient specific data including image based biomotion data include but are not limited to 

Any single one or combinations of the above or all of the above on at least one articular surface or implant component or multiple articular surfaces or implant components.

When changes are made on multiple articular surfaces or implant components these can be made in reference to or linked to each other. For example in the knee a change made to a femoral bone cut based on patient specific biomotion data can be referenced to or linked with a concomitant change to a bone cut on an opposing tibial surface for example if less femoral bone is resected the computer program may elect to resect more tibial bone.

Similarly if a femoral implant shape is changed for example on an external surface this can be accompanied by a change in the tibial component shape. This is for example particularly applicable when at least portions of the tibial bearing surface negatively match the femoral joint facing surface.

Similarly if the footprint of a femoral implant is broadened this can be accompanied by a widening of the bearing surface of a tibial component. Similarly if a tibial implant shape is changed for example on an external surface this can be accompanied by a change in the femoral component shape. This is for example particularly applicable when at least portions of the femoral bearing surface negatively match the tibial joint facing surface.

Similarly if a patellar component radius is widened this can be accompanied by a widening of an opposing trochlear bearing surface radius or vice versa.

These linked changes also can apply for hip and or shoulder implants. For example in a hip if a femoral implant shape is changed for example on an external surface this can be accompanied by a change in an acetabular component shape. This is for example particularly applicable when at least portions of the acetabular bearing surface negatively match the femoral joint facing surface. In a shoulder if a glenoid implant shape is changed for example on an external surface this can be accompanied by a change in a humeral component shape. This is for example particularly applicable when at least portions of the humeral bearing surface negatively match the glenoid joint facing surface or vice versa.

Any combination is possible as it pertains to the shape orientation and size of implant components on two or more opposing surfaces.

By optimizing implant shape in this manner it is possible to establish normal or near normal kinematics. Moreover it is possible to avoid implant related complications including but not limited to anterior notching notch impingement posterior femoral component impingement in high flexion and other complications associated with existing implant designs. For example certain designs of the femoral components of traditional knee implants have attempted to address limitations associated with traditional knee implants in high flexion by altering the thickness of the distal and or posterior condyles of the femoral implant component or by altering the height of the posterior condyles of the femoral implant component. Since such traditional implants follow a one size fits all approach they are limited to altering only one or two aspects of an implant design. However with the design approaches described herein various features of an implant component can be designed for an individual to address multiple issues including issues associated with high flexion motion. For example designs as described herein can alter an implant component s bone facing surface for example number angle and orientation of bone cuts joint facing surface for example surface contour and curvatures and other features for example implant height width and other features to address issues with high flexion together with other issues.

Biomotion models for a particular patient can be supplemented with patient specific finite element modeling or other biomechanical models known in the art. Resultant forces in the knee joint can be calculated for each component for each specific patient. The implant can be engineered to the patient s load and force demands. For instance a 125 lb. patient may not need a tibial plateau as thick as a patient with 280 lbs. Similarly the polyethylene can be adjusted in shape thickness and material properties for each patient. For example a 3 mm polyethylene insert can be used in a light patient with low force and a heavier or more active patient may need an 8 mm polymer insert or similar device.

Traditional implants frequently can alter the location of a patient s existing or natural joint line. For example with a traditional implant a patient s joint line can be offset proximally or distally as compared to the corresponding joint line on the corresponding limb. This can cause mechanical asymmetry between the limbs and result in uneven movement or mechanical instability when the limbs are used together. An offset joint line with a traditional implant also can cause the patient s body to appear symmetrical.

Traditional implants frequently alter the location of a patient s existing or natural joint line because they have a standard thickness that is thicker or thinner than the bone and or cartilage that they are replacing. For example a schematic of a traditional implant component is shown in . In the figure the dashed line represents the patient s existing or natural joint line and the dotted line represents the offset joint line following insertion of the traditional implant component . As shown in the traditional implant component with a standard thickness replaces a resected piece of a first biological structure at an articulation between the first biological structure and a second biological structure . The resected piece of the biological structure can include for example bone and or cartilage and the biological structure can include bone and or cartilage. In the figure the standard thickness of the traditional implant component differs from the thickness of the resected piece . Therefore as shown in the replacement of the resected piece with the traditional implant component creates a wider joint gap and or an offset joint line. Surgeons can address the widened joint gap by pulling the second biological structure toward the first biological structure and tightening the ligaments associated with the joint. However while this alteration restores some of the mechanical instability created by a widened joint gap it also exacerbates the displacement of the joint line.

Certain embodiments are directed to implant components and related designs and methods having one or more features that are engineered from patient specific data to restore or optimize the particular patient s joint line location. In addition or alternatively certain patient specific implant components and related designs and methods can have one or more features that are engineered from patient specific data to restore or optimize the particular patient s joint gap width.

In certain embodiments an implant component can be designed based on patient specific data to include a thickness profile between its joint facing surface and its bone facing surface to restore and or optimize the particular patient s joint line location. For example as schematically depicted in the thickness profile shown as A of the patient specific implant component can be designed to at least in part substantially positively match the distance from the patient s existing or natural joint line to the articular surface of the biological structure that the implant engages. In the schematic depicted in the figure the patient joint gap width also is retained.

The matching thickness profile can be designed based on one or more of the following considerations the thickness shown as A in of a resected piece of biological structure that the implant replaces the thickness of absent or decayed biological structure that the implant replaces the relative compressibility of the implant material s and the biological material s that the implant replaces and the thickness of the saw blade s used for resectioning and or material lost in removing a resected piece.

For embodiments directed to an implant component thickness that is engineered based on patient specific data to optimize joint line location and or other parameters such as preserving bone the minimum acceptable thickness of the implant can be a significant consideration. Minimal acceptable thickness can be determined based on any criteria such as a minimum mechanical strength for example as determined by FEA. Accordingly in certain embodiments an implant or implant design includes an implant component having a minimal thickness profile. For example in certain embodiments a pre primary or primary femoral implant component can include a thickness between the joint facing surface and the bone facing surface of the implant component that is less than 5 mm less than 4 mm less than 3 mm and or less than 2 mm.

In certain embodiments the implant component thickness can range from about 2 mm to about 3 mm. Therefore for patients that require only minimal bone resectioning of no more than 2 3 mm depth from the joint line an implant component designed with a thickness to substantially positively match the 2 3 mm bone resectioning can maintain the joint line location. Moreover a subsequent traditional primary implant for example of 5 mm or greater thickness can be applied later with an additional cut depth of 3 2 mm or greater for a total 5 mm cut depth . This can allow for maintenance of the joint line with the subsequent traditional primary as well.

Certain embodiments directed to implants or implant designs optimized to achieve minimal implant thickness can include a higher number of bone cuts for example six seven eight nine or more bone cuts on the inner bone facing surface of the implant. The bone cuts can be oriented in various dimensions for example in a flexed orientation. Moreover certain embodiments can include on the inner bone facing surface any combination of straight cuts and curvilinear cuts. One or more curvilinear cuts can be designed to substantially positively match the patient s uncut articular surface such as a subchondral bone surface exposed by resurfacing. Alternatively one or more curvilinear cuts can be designed to substantially positively match a cut surface of the patient s bone for example a cut curvilinear surface. Example 5 describes an example of an implant and implant design that includes a straight anterior cut a straight posterior cut and a curvilinear cut in between. Moreover as depicted in an implant can include a planar distal cut a straight anterior cut a straight posterior cut and curvilinear chamfer cuts in between to substantially negatively match corresponding resected surface s of the femur . Example 6 describes an example of an implant or implant design that includes on the inner bone facing surface one or no straight cuts and portions that substantially positively match an uncut articular bone surface.

The inner bone facing surface of the implant component can be designed to substantially negatively match the cut bone surface both curved and straight portions. The curved cuts to the bone can be performed with a router saw as described in Example 5. Any number of the cuts can have a depth of 2 3 mm and the implant component thickness can be designed to positively match the cut depth across a portion of the implant or across the entire implant.

By positively matching the implant component thickness profile with the cut depth profile and by negatively matching the component bone facing surface with the resected articular surface of the biological structure certain features of the component joint facing surface can positively match the corresponding biological features that it replaces. For example if the component bone facing surface and thickness match the corresponding features of the biological structure the component joint facing curvature such as a j curve also can match the corresponding surface curvature of the patient s biological structure.

In certain embodiments one or more implant components can be designed based on patient specific data to include a thickness profile that retains restores and or optimizes the particular patient s joint gap width. For example as schematically depicted in the patient specific implant components can be designed to at least in part substantially positively match the patient s existing or natural joint gap . In the figure the dashed line represents the patient s existing or natural joint line . The patient specific implant components do not have thicknesses that match the corresponding resected pieces of biological structures . However as shown in the implant components are designed to retain the patient s specific gap width .

If the thickness of an implant component is greater than the depth of the corresponding bone cut then the thicker implant component can shift the joint line down. However as shown in the joint gap width can be retained by designing a second implant component to offset the greater thickness of the first implant component. For example in total knee replacements that include both a femoral implant component and a tibial implant component if the femoral implant component is thicker than the depth of the corresponding bone cut more tibial bone can be cut and or a thinner tibial implant can be used.

One or more components of a tibial implant can be designed thinner to retain restore and or optimize a patient s joint line and or joint gap width. For example one or both of a tibial tray and a tibial tray insert e.g. a poly insert can be designed and or selected e.g. preoperatively selected to be thinner in one or more locations in order to address joint line and or joint gap issues for a particular patient. In certain embodiments a tibial bone cut and or the thickness of a corresponding portion of a tibial implant component may be less than about 6 mm less than about 5 mm less than about 4 mm less than about 3 mm and or less than about 2 mm.

In certain embodiments one or more implant components can designed based on patient specific data to include a thickness profile that retains or alters a particular patient s joint gap width to retain or correct another patient specific feature. For example the patient specific data can include data regarding the length of the patient s corresponding limbs e.g. left and right limbs and the implant component s can be designed to at least in part alter the length of one limb to better match the length of the corresponding limb.

5. Selecting and or Designing an Implant Component and Optionally Related Surgical Steps and Guide Tools

Any combination of one or more of the above identified parameters and or one or more additional parameters can be used in the design and or selection of a patient adapted e.g. patient specific and or patient engineered implant component and in certain embodiments in the design and or selection of corresponding patient adapted resection cuts and or patient adapted guide tools. In particular assessments a patient s biological features and feature measurements are used to select and or design one or more implant component features and feature measurements resection cut features and feature measurements and or guide tool features and feature measurements.

In certain embodiments the assessment process includes selecting and or designing one or more features and or feature measurements of an implant component and optionally of a corresponding resection cut strategy and or guide tool that is adapted e.g. patient adapted based on one or more of a particular patient s biological features and or feature measurements to achieve or address at least in part one or more of the following parameters for the particular patient 1 correction of a joint deformity 2 correction of a limb alignment deformity 3 preservation of bone cartilage and or ligaments at the joint 4 preservation restoration or enhancement of one or more features of the patient s biology for example trochlea and trochlear shape 5 preservation restoration or enhancement of joint kinematics including for example ligament function and implant impingement 6 preservation restoration or enhancement of the patient s joint line location and or joint gap width and 7 preservation restoration or enhancement of other target features.

Correcting a joint deformity and or a limb alignment deformity can include for example generating a virtual model of the patient s joint limb and or other relevant biological structure s virtually correcting the deformity and or aligning the limb and selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components to physically perform and or accommodate the correction.

Preserving restoring or enhancing bone cartilage and or ligaments can include for example identifying diseased tissue from one or more images of the patient s joint identifying a minimum implant thickness for the patient based on for example femur and or condyle size and patient weight virtually assessing combinations of resection cuts and implant component features such as variable implant thickness bone cut numbers bone cut angles and or bone cut orientations identifying a combination of resection cuts and or implant component features that for example remove diseased tissue and also provide maximum bone preservation i.e. minimum amount of resected bone and at least the minimum implant thickness for the particular patient and selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components to provide the resection cuts and or implant component features that provide removal of the diseased tissue maximum bone preservation and at least the minimum implant thickness for the particular patient.

Preserving or restoring one or more features of a patient s biology can include for example selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components so that one or more of the patient s postoperative implant features substantially match the patient s preoperative biological features or the patient s healthy biological features e.g. as identified from a previous image of the patient s joint when it was healthy or from an image the patient s contralateral healthy joint .

Enhancing one or more features of a patient s biology can include for example selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components so that the implant component once implanted includes features that approximate one or more features of a healthy biological feature for the particular patient.

Preservation or restoration of the patient s joint kinematics can include for example selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components so that the patient s post operative joint kinematics substantially match the patient s pre operative joint kinematics and or substantially match the patient s healthy joint kinematics e.g. as identified from previous images of the patient s joint when it was healthy or from an image the patient s contralateral healthy joint .

Enhancing the patient s joint kinematics can include for example selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components that provide healthy joint kinematics estimated for the particular patient and or that provide proper joint kinematics to the patient. Optimization of joint kinematics also can include optimizing ligament loading or ligament function during motion.

Preservation or restoration of the patient s joint line location and or joint gap width can include for example selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components so that the patient s joint line and or joint gap width substantially match the patient s existing joint line and or joint gap width or the patient s healthy joint line and or joint gap width e.g. as identified from previous images of the patient s joint when it was healthy or from an image the patient s contralateral healthy joint .

Enhancing the patient s joint line location and or joint gap width can include for example selecting and or designing one or more surgical steps e.g. one or more resection cuts one or more guide tools and or one or more implant components that provide a healthy joint line location and or joint gap width and or estimated for the particular patient and or that provide proper kinematics to the patient.

Assessment of the above identified parameters optionally with one or more additional parameters can be conducted using various formats. For example the assessment of one or more parameters can be performed in series in parallel or in a combination of serial and parallel steps optionally with a software directed computer. For example one or more selected implant component features and feature measurements optionally with one or more selected resection cut features and feature measurements and one or more selected guide tool features and feature measurements can be altered and assessed in series in parallel or in a combination format to assess the fit between selected parameter thresholds and the selected features and feature measurements. Any one or more of the parameters and features and or feature measurements can be the first to be selected and or designed. Alternatively one or more or all of the parameters and or features can be assessed simultaneously.

The assessment process can be iterative in nature. For example one or more first parameters can be assessed and the related implant component and or resection cut features and feature measurements tentatively or conditionally can be determined. Next one or more second parameters can be assessed and optionally one or more features and or feature measurements determined. Then the tentative or conditional features and or feature measurements for the first assessed parameter s optionally can be altered based on the assessment and optional determinations for the second assessed parameters. The assessment process can be fully automated or it can be partially automated allowing for user interaction. User interaction can be particularly useful for quality assurance purposes.

In the assessment different weighting can be applied to any of the parameters or parameter thresholds for example based on the patient s age the surgeon s preference or the patient s preference. Feedback mechanisms can be used to show the user or the software the effect that certain feature and or feature measurement changes can have on desired changes to parameters values e.g. relative to selected parameter thresholds. For example a feedback mechanism can be used to determine the effect that changes in features intended to maximize bone preservation e.g. implant component thickness es bone cut number cut angles cut orientations and related resection cut number angles and orientations have on other parameters such as limb alignment deformity correction and or joint kinematic parameters for example relative to selected parameter thresholds. Accordingly implant component features and or feature measurements and optionally resection cut and guide tool features and or feature measurements can be modeled virtually and modified reiteratively to achieve an optimum solution for a particular patient.

The obtained patient s biological features and feature measurements implant component features and feature measurements and optionally resection cut and or guide tool features and or feature measurements then can be assessed to determine the optimum implant component features and or feature measurements and optionally resection cut and or guide tool features and or feature measurements that achieve one or more target or threshold values for parameters of interest e.g. by maintaining or restoring a patient s healthy joint feature . As noted parameters of interest can include for example one or more of 1 joint deformity correction 2 limb alignment correction 3 bone cartilage and or ligaments preservation at the joint 4 preservation restoration or enhancement of one or more features of the patient s biology for example trochlea and trochlear shape 5 preservation restoration or enhancement of joint kinematics including for example ligament function and implant impingement 6 preservation restoration or enhancement of the patient s joint line location and or joint gap width and 7 preservation restoration or enhancement of other target features. This step can be repeated as desired. For example the assessment step can be reiteratively repeated after obtaining various feature and feature measurement information .

Once the one or more optimum implant component features and or feature measurements are determined the implant component s can be selected designed or selected and designed . For example an implant component having some optimum features and or feature measurements can be designed using one or more CAD software programs or other specialized software to optimize additional features or feature measurements of the implant component. One or more manufacturing techniques described herein or known in the art can be used in the design step to produce the additional optimized features and or feature measurements. This process can be repeated as desired.

Optionally one or more resection cut features and or feature measurements can be selected designed or selected and further designed . For example a resection cut strategy selected to have some optimum features and or feature measurements can be designed further using one or more CAD software programs or other specialized software to optimize additional features or measurements of the resection cuts for example so that the resected surfaces substantially match optimized bone facing surfaces of the selected and designed implant component. This process can be repeated as desired.

Moreover optionally one or more guide tool features and or feature measurements can be selected designed or selected and further designed. For example a guide tool having some optimum features and or feature measurements can be designed further using one or more CAD software programs or other specialized software to optimize additional features or feature measurements of the guide tool. One or more manufacturing techniques described herein or known in the art can be used in the design step to produce the additional optimized features and or feature measurements for example to facilitate one or more resection cuts that optionally substantially match one or more optimized bone facing surfaces of a selected and designed implant component. This process can be repeated as desired.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the process of selecting and or designing an implant component feature and or feature measurement resection cut feature and or feature measurement and or guide tool feature and or feature measurement can be tested against the information obtained regarding the patient s biological features for example from one or more MRI or CT or x ray images from the patient to ensure that the features and or feature measurements are optimum with respect to the selected parameter targets or thresholds. Testing can be accomplished by for example superimposing the implant image over the image for the patient s joint. Once optimum features and or feature measurements for the implant component and optionally for the resection cuts and or guide tools have been selected and or designed the implant site can be prepared for example by removing cartilage and or resectioning bone from the joint surface and the implant component can be implanted into the joint .

The joint implant component bone facing surface and optionally the resection cuts and guide tools can be selected and or designed to include one or more features that achieve an anatomic or near anatomic fit with the existing surface or with a resected surface of the joint. Moreover the joint implant component joint facing surface and optionally the resection cuts and guide tools can be selected and or designed for example to replicate the patient s existing joint anatomy to replicate the patient s healthy joint anatomy to enhance the patient s joint anatomy and or to optimize fit with an opposing implant component. Accordingly both the existing surface of the joint and the desired resulting surface of the joint can be assessed. This technique can be particularly useful for implants that are not anchored into the bone.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the physician or other person can obtain a measurement of a biological feature e.g. a target joint and then directly select design or select and design a joint implant component having desired patient adapted features and or feature measurements. Designing can include for example design and manufacturing.

As described herein certain embodiments can apply modeling for example virtual modeling and or mathematical modeling to identify optimum implant component features and measurements and optionally resection features and measurements to achieve or advance one or more parameter targets or thresholds. For example a model of patient s joint or limb can be used to identify select and or design one or more optimum features and or feature measurements relative to selected parameters for an implant component and optionally for corresponding resection cuts and or guide tools. In certain embodiments a physician clinician or other user can select one or more parameters parameter thresholds or targets and or relative weightings for the parameters included in the model. Alternatively or in addition clinical data for example obtained from clinical trials or intraoperative data can be included in selecting parameter targets or thresholds and or in determining optimum features and or feature measurements for an implant component resection cut and or guide tool.

Certain embodiments described herein include generating and or using a model for example a virtual model of the patient s joint that includes selected parameters and or parameter measurements and virtually selecting and or designing one or more implant components and optionally resection cuts and or guide tools to fit the virtual model in accordance with the selected parameters and or parameter measurements. This approach allows for iterative selection and or design improvement and can include steps to virtually assess fit relative to the selected parameters and or parameter measurements such as 1 correction of a joint deformity 2 correction of a limb alignment deformity 3 preservation of bone cartilage and or ligaments at the joint 4 preservation restoration or enhancement of one or more features of the patient s biology for example trochlea and trochlear shape 5 preservation restoration or enhancement of joint kinematics including for example ligament function and implant impingement 6 preservation restoration or enhancement of the patient s joint line location and or joint gap width and 7 preservation restoration or enhancement of other target features.

One or more parametric thresholds and or weightings can be applied for the selection and or designing process. Different parameters can have the same weighting or they can have different weightings. A parameter can include one or more thresholds for selecting one or more implants. The thresholds can include one or more minimum threshold values e.g. with different weightings for example 80 greater than 80 85 greater than 85 90 greater than 90 95 greater than 95 97 greater than 97 98 greater than 98 99 greater than 99 100 and or greater than 100 a target value such as minimum implant coverage of a certain surface on the patient s anatomical structure. Alternatively or in addition the thresholds can include one or more maximum threshold values e.g. with different weightings such as 105 less than 105 103 less than 103 102 less than 102 101 less than 101 100 and or less than 100 a target value such as maximum implant coverage of a certain surface on the patient s anatomical structure.

One or more parameter thresholds can be absolute for example by selecting and or designing for only implants that meet the threshold for example a threshold for a particular patient of 95 mediolateral femoral condyle coverage all around the condyle s . An example of a selection and or design process having multiple absolute thresholds is a process that selects and or designs femoral implant components that must meet both a minimum threshold for a particular patient of 95 mediolateral femoral condyle coverage in the central weight bearing region and a minimum threshold of greater than 80 mediolateral femoral condyle coverage outside the weight bearing area.

Alternatively or in addition one or more parameter thresholds can be contingent on one or more other factors. In particular a selection and or designing process can successively search a library for implants based on contingent thresholds. For example femoral implant components meeting a minimum threshold of 99 mediolateral femoral condyle coverage initially can be selected. If no implant meets the threshold or if some implants meet the threshold but do not meet other parameter thresholds then a second selection round can include implants meeting a minimum threshold of 98 mediolateral femoral condyle coverage. The process can continue to use additional contingent thresholds until an implant with the selected parameter thresholds is identified.

Different thresholds can be defined in different anatomic regions and for different parameters. For example in certain embodiments of a knee implant design the amount of mediolateral tibial implant component coverage can be set at 90 while the amount of anteroposterior tibial implant component coverage can be set at 85 . In another illustrative example the congruency in intercondylar notch shape can be set at 80 required while the required mediolateral condylar coverage can be set at 95 .

Any of the methods described herein can be performed at least in part using a computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon which when executed by one or more processors causes the one or more processors to perform one or more operations corresponding to one or more steps in the method. Any of the methods can include the steps of receiving input from a device or user and producing an output for a user for example a physician clinician technician or other user. Executed instructions on the computer readable medium i.e. a software program can be used for example to receive as input patient specific information e.g. images of a patient s biological structure and provide as output a virtual model of the patient s biological structure. Similarly executed instructions on a computer readable medium can be used to receive as input patient specific information and user selected and or weighted parameters and then provide as output to a user values or ranges of values for those parameters and or for resection cut features guide tool features and or implant component features. For example in certain embodiments patient specific information can be input into a computer software program for selecting and or designing one or more resection cuts guide tools and or implant components and one or more of the following parameters can be optimization in the design process 1 correction of joint deformity 2 correction of a limb alignment deformity 3 preservation of bone cartilage and or ligaments at the joint 4 preservation restoration or enhancement of one or more features of the patient s biology for example trochlea and trochlear shape 5 preservation restoration or enhancement of joint kinematics including for example ligament function and implant impingement 6 preservation restoration or enhancement of the patient s joint line location and or joint gap width and 7 preservation restoration or enhancement of other target features.

Optimization of multiple parameters may result in conflicting constraints for example optimizing one parameter may cause an undesired deviation to one or more other parameters. In cases where not all constraints can be achieved at the same time parameters can be assigned a priority or weight in the software program. The priority or weighting can be automated e.g. part of the computer program and or it can be selected by a user depending on the user s desired design goals for example minimization of bone loss or retention of existing joint line to preserve kinematics or combination to accommodate both parameters in overall design. As an illustrative example in certain embodiments selection and or design of a knee implant can include obtaining patient specific information e.g. from radiographic images or CT images of a patient s knee and inputting that information into the computer program to model features such as minimum thickness of femoral component to minimize resected bone on femur tibial resection cut height to minimize resected bone on tibia and joint line position preferably to preserve for natural kinematics . These features can be modeled and analyzed relative to a weighting of parameters such as preserving bone and preserving joint kinematics. As output one or more resection cut features guide tool features and or implant component features that optimize the identified parameters relative to the selective weightings can be provided.

In any automated process or process step performed by the computer system constraints pertaining to a specific implant model to a group of patients or to the individual patient may be taken into account. For example the maximum implant thickness or allowable positions of implant anchors can depend on the type of implant. The minimum allowable implant thickness can depend on the patient s bone quality.

Any one or more steps of the assessment selection and or design may be partially or fully automated for example using a computer run software program and or one or more robots. For example processing of the patient data the assessment of biological features and or feature measurements the assessment of implant component features and or feature measurements the optional assessment of resection cut and or guide tool features and or feature measurements the selection and or design of one or more features of a patient adapted implant component and or the implantation procedure s may be partially or wholly automated. For example patient data with optional user defined parameters may be inputted or transferred by a user and or by electronic transfer into a software directed computer system that can identify variable implant component features and or feature measurements and perform operations to generate one or more virtual models and or implant design specifications for example in accordance with one or more target or threshold parameters. Implant selection and or design data with optional user defined parameters may be inputted or transferred by a user and or by electronic transfer into a software directed computer system that performs a series of operations to transform the data and optional parameters into one or more implant manufacturing specifications. Implant design data or implant manufacturing data optionally with user defined parameters may be inputted or transferred by a user and or by electronic transfer into a software directed computer system that directs one or more manufacturing instruments to produce one or more implant components from a starting material such as a raw material or starting blank material. Implant design data implant manufacturing data or implant data optionally with user defined parameters may be inputted or transferred by a user and or by electronic transfer into a software directed computer system that performs a series of operations to transform the data and optional parameters into one or more surgical procedure specifications or instructions. Implant design data implant manufacturing data implant data or surgical procedure data optionally with user defined parameters may be inputted or transferred by a user and or by electronic transfer into a software directed computer system that directs one or more automated surgical instruments for example a robot to perform one or more surgical steps. In certain embodiments one or more of these actions can be performed as steps in a single process by one or more software directed computer systems.

In certain embodiments the implant component includes one or more bone cuts on its bone facing surface. Features of these bone cuts and optionally features of corresponding resection cuts can be optimized by a computer system based on patient specific data. For example the bone cut number and one or more bone cut planes angles or depths as well as the corresponding resection cut number and one or more resection cut planes angles or depths can be optimized for example to preserve the maximum amount of bone for each individual patient based on a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation of the articular anatomy and geometry and or on a target limb alignment and or deformity correction. Optionally one or more of the bone cut features and or resection cut features can be adjusted by the operator.

The computer system also can construct the implant surfaces. Surfaces may be composed of different elements. In certain embodiments elements of the surfaces can conform to the patient s anatomy. In these situations the computer system can build a surface using the patient s anatomical model for example by constructing a surface that is identical with or mostly parallel to the patient s anatomical surface. In certain embodiments the computer system can use geometric elements such as arcs or planes to construct a surface. Transitions between surfaces can be smoothed using tapers or fillets. Additionally the computer system may take into account constraints such as a minimum or maximum threshold thickness or length or curvature of parts or features of the implant component when constructing the surfaces.

In another embodiment the computer system can automatically or semi automatically add other features to the implant design. For example the computer system can add pegs or anchors or other attachment mechanisms. The system can place the features using anatomical landmarks. Constraints can be used to restrict the placement of the features. Examples of constraints for placement of pegs are the distance between pegs and from the pegs to the edge of the implant the height of the pegs that results from their position on the implant and forcing the pegs to be located on the center line. Optionally the system can allow the user to fine tune the peg placement with or without enforcing the constraints.

Using patient specific features and feature measurements and selected parameters and parameter thresholds an implant component resection cut strategy and or guide tool can be selected e.g. from a library and or designed e.g. virtually designed and manufactured to have one or more patient adapted features. In certain embodiments one or more features of an implant component and optionally one or more features of a resection cut strategy and or guide tool are selected for a particular patient based on patient specific data and desired parameter targets or thresholds. For example an implant component or implant component features can be selected from a virtual library of implant components and or component features to include one or more patient specific features and or optimized features for a particular patient. Alternatively or in addition an implant component can be selected from an actual library of implant components to include one or more patient specific features and or optimized features for the particular patient.

In certain embodiments one or more features of an implant component and optionally one or more features of a resection cut strategy and or guide tool can be designed e.g. designed and manufactured to include one or more patient specific features and or optimized features for a particular patient. In certain embodiments one or more features of an implant component and optionally one or more features of a resection cut strategy and or guide tool can be both selected and designed e.g. designed and manufactured to include one or more patient specific features and or optimized features for the particular patient. For example an implant component having features that achieve certain parameter thresholds but having other features that do not achieve other parameter thresholds e.g. a blank feature or a smaller or larger feature can be selected for example from a library of implant components. The selected component then can be further designed e.g. virtually designed and machined to alter the blank or smaller or larger feature to be achieve the selected parameter for example a patient specific or patient engineered feature or feature measurement.

An implant component can include one or more selected features and one or more designed features. Alternatively or in addition an implant component can include one or more features that are selected and designed or altered to be patient specific or patient engineered. Moreover an implant component can include any number of selected and or designed features derived from any number of patient specific measurements including one or more of the exemplary measurements described above in Table 4. Depending on the clinical application a single or any combination or all of the measurements described in Table 4 and or known in the art can be used. Additional patient specific measurements and information that be used in the evaluation can include for example joint kinematic measurements bone density measurements bone porosity measurements identification of damaged or deformed tissues or structures and patient information such as patient age weight gender ethnicity activity level and overall health status.

The patient specific measurements selected for the evaluation can be used to select and or design any selected implant features including one or more of the exemplary features described in Table 1. The features can be selected and or designed to be either patient specific and or patient engineered.

For example one or more of an M L measurement an A P measurement and an S I measurement of a patient s joint can be obtained from the subject preoperatively for example from one or more images of the subject s joint. Then based on the one or more measurements an implant or implant component for the subject s joint can be selected and or designed preoperatively to include an M L A P and or S I measurement that is selected from a library to match the patient s M L A P and or S I measurement.

The process can include generating and or using a model for example a virtual model of the patient s joint that includes the selected measurements and virtually fitting one or more selected and or designed implants into the virtual model. This approach allows for iterative selection and or design improvement and can include steps to virtually assess the fit such as virtual kinematics assessment.

In another embodiment the process of selecting an implant component also includes selecting one or more component features that optimizes fit with another implant component. In particular for an implant that includes a first implant component and a second implant component that engage for example at a joint interface selection of the second implant component can include selecting a component having a surface that provides best fit to the engaging surface of the first implant component. For example for a knee implant that includes a femoral implant component and a tibial implant component one or both of components can be selected based at least in part on the fit of the outer joint facing surface with the outer joint facing surface of the other component. The fit assessment can include for example selecting one or both of the medial and lateral tibial grooves on the tibial component and or one or both of the medial and lateral condyles on the femoral component that substantially negatively matches the fit or optimizes engagement in one or more dimensions for example in the coronal and or sagittal dimensions. For example a surface shape of a non metallic component that best matches the dimensions and shape of an opposing metallic or ceramic or other hard material suitable for an implant component. By performing this component matching component wear can be reduced.

For example if a metal backed tibial component is used with a polyethylene insert or if an all polyethylene tibial component is used the polyethylene will typically have one or two curved portions typically designed to mate with the femoral component in a low friction form. This mating can be optimized by selecting a polyethylene insert that is optimized or achieves an optimal fit with regard to one or more of depth of the concavity width of the concavity length of the concavity radius or radii of curvature of the concavity and or distance between two e.g. medial and lateral concavities. For example the distance between a medial tibial concavity and a lateral tibial concavity can be selected so that it matches or approximates the distance between a medial and a lateral implant condyle component.

Not only the distance between two concavities but also the radius radii of curvature can be selected or designed so that it best matches the radius radii of curvature on the femoral component. A medial and a lateral femoral condyle and opposite tibial component s can have a single radius of curvature in one or more dimensions e.g. a coronal plane. They can also have multiple radii of curvature. The radius or radii of curvature on the medial condyle and or lateral tibial component can be different from that those on a lateral condyle and or lateral tibial component.

Similar matching of polyethylene or other plastic shape to opposing metal or ceramic component shape can be performed in the shoulder e.g. with a glenoid component or in a hip e.g. with an acetabular cup or in an ankle e.g. with a talar component.

After the model representation of the joint is generated the practitioner optionally can generate a projected model representation of the target joint in a corrected condition e.g. based on a previous image of the patient s joint when it was healthy based on an image of the patient s contralateral healthy joint based on a projected image of a surface that negatively matches the opposing surface or a combination thereof. This step can be repeated as necessary or as desired. Using the difference between the topographical condition of the joint and the projected image of the joint the practitioner can then select a joint implant that is suitable to achieve the corrected joint anatomy. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the selection and or design process can be repeated as often as desired to achieve the desired result. Additionally it is contemplated that a practitioner can obtain a measurement of a target joint by obtaining for example an x ray and then selects a suitable joint replacement implant .

One or more of these steps can be repeated reiteratively . Moreover the practitioner can proceed directly from the step of generating a model representation of the target joint to the step of selecting a suitable joint implant component . Additionally following selection and or design of the suitable joint implant component the steps of obtaining measurement of a target joint generating model representation of target joint and generating projected model can be repeated in series or parallel as shown by the flow .

As described herein implants of various sizes shapes curvatures and thicknesses with various types and locations and orientations and number of bone cuts can be selected and or designed and manufactured. The implant designs and or implant components can be selected from catalogued in and or stored in a library. The library can be a virtual library of implants or components or component features that can be combined and or altered to create a final implant. The library can include a catalogue of physical implant components. In certain embodiments physical implant components can be identified and selected using the library. The library can include previously generated implant components having one or more patient adapted features and or components with standard or blank features that can be altered to be patient adapted. Accordingly implants and or implant features can be selected from the library.

As can be seen in C and D implants can be selected or designed to match a variable trochlea width and depth. For this purpose 2D or 3D measurements or surfaces can be used for example in order to select the best fitting implant or design an implant for a desired optionally corrected for deformity trochlear shape depth width thickness .

As can be seen in E and F at least one of a medial or a lateral condyle width and length can be selected or designed to substantially match at least one of a medial or lateral width and length of the patient s uncut femoral condyle or cut femoral condyle for one or more resection levels for one or more cuts.

Thus in a standard off the shelf implant in considering a medial tibiofemoral contact area excluding any areas of overlapping patellofemoral contact area and excluding any posterior rounding or taper of the condylar portion of the implant in the area of the posterior cut surface a standard implant will show a constant width. A patient selected or designed implant however can have a variable width substantially matched for example using an imaging test to the patient s condylar width for the uncut femoral condyle or cut femoral condyle for one or more resection levels for one or more cuts in the region of the medial tibiofemoral contact area in addition to a variable width in any areas of overlapping patellofemoral contact area and a variable width related to any posterior rounding or taper of the condylar portion of the implant in the area of the posterior cut surface .

In a standard off the shelf implant in considering a lateral tibiofemoral contact area excluding any areas of overlapping patellofemoral contact area and excluding any posterior rounding or taper of the condylar portion of the implant in the area of the posterior cut surface a standard implant will show a constant width. A patient selected or designed implant however can have a variable width substantially matched for example using an imaging test to the patient s condylar width for the uncut femoral condyle or cut femoral condyle for one or more resection levels for one or more cuts in the region of the lateral tibiofemoral contact area in addition to a variable width in any areas of overlapping patellofemoral contact area and a variable width related to any posterior rounding or taper of the condylar portion of the implant in the area of the posterior cut surface .

In a standard off the shelf implant in considering a medial and a lateral tibiofemoral contact area excluding any areas of overlapping patellofemoral contact area and excluding any posterior rounding or taper of the condylar portion of the implant in the area of the posterior cut surface a standard implant will show a constant distance between a medial and the lateral condyle. A patient selected or designed implant however can have a variable distance between a medial and the lateral condyle substantially matched for example using an imaging test to the patient s condylar width for the uncut femoral condyle or cut femoral condyle for one or more resection levels for one or more cuts in the region of the medial and the lateral tibiofemoral contact area in addition to a variable distance in any areas of overlapping patellofemoral contact area and a variable distance related to any posterior rounding or taper of the condylar portion of the implant in the areas of the posterior cut surface .

A patient selected implant selected from a library of implants can have a variable length that can be substantially matched for example using imaging data to the patient s condylar length for the uncut femoral condyle or cut femoral condyle for one or more resection levels for one or more cuts medially and or laterally.

A patient designed implant can have a variable length that can be substantially matched for example using imaging data to the patient s condylar length for the uncut femoral condyle or cut femoral condyle for one or more resection levels for one or more cuts medially and or laterally.

A virtual or physical implant component can be selected from the library based on similarity to prior or baseline parameter optimizations such as one or more of 1 deformity correction and limb alignment 2 maximum preservation of bone cartilage or ligaments 3 preservation and or optimization of other features of the patient s biology such as trochlea and trochlear shape 4 restoration and or optimization of joint kinematics and 5 restoration or optimization of joint line location and or joint gap width. Accordingly one or more implant component features such as a component shape external and or internal b component size and or c component thickness can be determined precisely and or determined within a range from the library selection. Then the selected implant component can be designed or engineered further to include one or more patient specific features. For example a joint can be assessed in a particular subject and a pre existing implant design having the closest shape and size and performance characteristics can be selected from the library for further manipulation e.g. shaping and manufacturing prior to implantation. For a library including physical implant components the selected physical component can be altered to include a patient specific feature by adding material e.g. laser sintering and or subtracting material e.g. machining .

Accordingly in certain embodiments an implant can include one or more features designed patient specifically and one or more features selected from one or more library sources. For example in designing an implant for a total knee replacement comprising a femoral component and a tibial component one component can include one or more patient specific features and the other component can be selected from a library. Table 7 includes an exemplary list of possible combinations.

In certain embodiments a library can be generated to include images from a particular patient at one or more ages prior to the time that the patient needs a joint implant. For example a method can include identifying patients eliciting one or more risk factors for a joint problem such as low bone mineral density score and collecting one or more images of the patient s joints into a library. In certain embodiments all patients below a certain age for example all patients below 40 years of age can be scanned to collect one or more images of the patient s joint. The images and data collected from the patient can be banked or stored in a patient specific database. For example the articular shape of the patient s joint or joints can be stored in an electronic database until the time when the patient needs an implant. Then the images and data in the patient specific database can be accessed and a patient specific and or patient engineered partial or total joint replacement implant using the patient s originally anatomy not affected by arthritic deformity yet can be generated. This process results is a more functional and more anatomic implant.

The articular repair systems e.g. resection cut strategy guide tools and implant components described herein can be formed or selected to achieve various parameters including a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage subchondral bone menisci and or other tissue. The shape of the repair system can be based on the analysis of an electronic image e.g. MRI CT digital tomosynthesis optical coherence tomography or the like . If the articular repair system is intended to replace an area of diseased cartilage or lost cartilage the near anatomic fit can be achieved using a method that provides a virtual reconstruction of the shape of healthy cartilage in an electronic image.

In one embodiments a near normal cartilage surface at the position of the cartilage defect can be reconstructed by interpolating the healthy cartilage surface across the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage. This can for example be achieved by describing the healthy cartilage by means of a parametric surface e.g. a B spline surface for which the control points are placed such that the parametric surface follows the contour of the healthy cartilage and bridges the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage. The continuity properties of the parametric surface will provide a smooth integration of the part that bridges the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage with the contour of the surrounding healthy cartilage. The part of the parametric surface over the area of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage can be used to determine the shape or part of the shape of the articular repair system to match with the surrounding cartilage.

In another embodiment a near normal cartilage surface at the position of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage can be reconstructed using morphological image processing. In a first step the cartilage can be extracted from the electronic image using manual semi automated and or automated segmentation techniques e.g. manual tracing region growing live wire model based segmentation resulting in a binary image. Defects in the cartilage appear as indentations that can be filled with a morphological closing operation performed in 2 D or 3 D with an appropriately selected structuring element. The closing operation is typically defined as a dilation followed by an erosion. A dilation operator sets the current pixel in the output image to 1 if at least one pixel of the structuring element lies inside a region in the source image. An erosion operator sets the current pixel in the output image to 1 if the whole structuring element lies inside a region in the source image. The filling of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage creates a new surface over the area of the cartilage defect or area of diseased cartilage that can be used to determine the shape or part of the shape of the articular repair system to match with the surrounding cartilage or subchondral bone.

As described above the articular repair system can be formed or selected from a library or database of systems of various sizes including various medio lateral ML anteroposterior AP and supero inferior SI dimensions curvatures and thicknesses so that it achieves a near anatomic fit or match with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site. These systems can be pre made or made to order for an individual patient. In order to control the fit or match of the articular repair system with the surrounding or adjacent cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site or menisci and other tissues preoperatively a software program can be used that projects the articular repair system over the anatomic position where it will be implanted. Suitable software is commercially available and or readily modified or designed by a skilled programmer.

In yet another embodiment the articular surface repair system can be projected over the implantation site prior to during or after planning or simulating the surgery virtually using one or more 3 D images. The cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site and other anatomic structures are extracted from a 3 D electronic image such as an MRI or a CT using manual semi automated and or automated segmentation techniques. In select embodiments segmentation is not necessary and data are directly displayed using the grayscale image information.

Optionally a 3 D representation of the cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site and other anatomic structures as well as the articular repair system is generated for example using a polygon or non uniform rational B spline NURBS surface or other parametric surface representation. For a description of various parametric surface representations see for example Foley J. D. et al. Computer Graphics Principles and Practice in C Addison Wesley 2nd edition 1995 .

The 3D representations of the cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site and other anatomic structures and the articular repair system can be merged into a common coordinate system. The articular repair system can then be placed at the desired implantation site. The representations of the cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site menisci and other anatomic structures and the articular repair system are rendered into a 3 D image for example application programming interfaces APIs OpenGL standard library of advanced 3 D graphics functions developed by SG Inc. available as part of the drivers for PC based video cards for example from www.nvidia.com for NVIDIA video cards or www.3dlabs.com for 3Dlabs products or as part of the system software for Unix workstations or DirectX multimedia API for Microsoft Windows based PC systems available from www.microsoft.com . The 3 D image can be rendered showing the cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site menisci or other anatomic objects and the articular repair system from varying angles e.g. by rotating or moving them interactively or non interactively in real time or non real time.

The software can be designed so that the articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments with the best fit relative to the cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site is automatically selected for example using some of the techniques described above. Alternatively the operator can select an articular repair system including surgical tools and instruments and project it or drag it onto the implantation site using suitable tools and techniques. The operator can move and rotate the articular repair system in three dimensions relative to the implantation site cut or uncut and can perform a visual inspection of the fit between the articular repair system and the implantation site cut or uncut. The visual inspection can be computer assisted. The procedure can be repeated until a satisfactory fit has been achieved. The procedure can be performed manually by the operator or it can be computer assisted in whole or part. For example the software can select a first trial implant that the operator can test. The operator can evaluate the fit. The software can be designed and used to highlight areas of poor alignment between the implant and the surrounding cartilage or subchondral bone or menisci or other tissues. Based on this information the software or the operator can then select another implant and test its alignment. One of skill in the art will readily be able to select modify and or create suitable computer programs for the purposes described herein.

In another embodiment the implantation site can be visualized using one or more cross sectional 2D images. Typically a series of 2D cross sectional images will be used. The 2D images can be generated with imaging tests such as CT MRI digital tomosynthesis ultrasound or optical coherence tomography using methods and tools known to those of skill in the art. The articular repair system can then be superimposed onto one or more of these 2 D images. The 2 D cross sectional images can be reconstructed in other planes e.g. from sagittal to coronal etc. Isotropic data sets e.g. data sets where the slice thickness is the same or nearly the same as the in plane resolution or near isotropic data sets can also be used. Multiple planes can be displayed simultaneously for example using a split screen display. The operator can also scroll through the 2D images in any desired orientation in real time or near real time the operator can rotate the imaged tissue volume while doing this. The articular repair system can be displayed in cross section utilizing different display planes e.g. sagittal coronal or axial typically matching those of the 2 D images demonstrating the cartilage cortical bone trabecular bone subchondral bone as well as cut bone before or after preparing an implantation site menisci or other tissue. Alternatively or in addition a three dimensional display can be used for the articular repair system. The 2D electronic image and the 2D or 3 D representation of the articular repair system can be merged into a common coordinate system. The articular repair system can then be placed at the desired implantation site. The series of 2D cross sections of the anatomic structures the implantation site and the articular repair system can be displayed interactively e.g. the operator can scroll through a series of slices or noninteractively e.g. as an animation that moves through the series of slices in real time or non real time.

In another embodiment the fit between the implant and the implantation site is evaluated. The implant can be available in a range of different dimensions sizes shapes and thicknesses. Different dimensions sizes shapes and thicknesses can be available for a medial condyle a lateral condyle a trochlea a medial tibia a lateral tibia the entire tibia a medial patella a lateral patella an entire patella a medial trochlea a central trochlea a lateral trochlea a portion of a femoral head an entire femoral head a portion of an acetabulum an entire acetabulum a portion of a glenoid an entire glenoid a portion of a humeral head an entire humeral head a portion of an ankle joint an entire ankle joint a portion or an entire elbow wrist hand finger spine facet joint.

In certain embodiment a combination of parameters can be selected. For example one or more of an M L measurement an A P measurement and an S I measurement a patient s joint can be obtained from the subject preoperatively for example from one or more images of the subject s joint. Then based on the one or measurements an implant or implant component for the subject s joint can be designed or selected preoperatively.

The following subsections describe aspects of certain embodiments of models implant designs implants and implant components related to a knee replacement. While the sections particularly describe embodiments of total knee implants it is understood that the teachings are applicable to other embodiments including but not limited to unicompartmental knee implants bicompartmental knee implants and other articular implants such as shoulder implants hip implants and spinal facet implants.

A traditional femoral implant component used in a primary total knee arthroplasty TKA includes an outer joint facing surface i.e. inferior surface having a standard topography an inner bone facing surface i.e. superior surface that includes five standard bone cuts and a standard implant thickness between the joint facing surface and the bone facing surface. shows a coronal view of a patient s femoral bone and in dashed lines the five standard resection cuts used to remove portions of the subject s distal femur in order to fit the traditional femoral implant component. As shown by the dashed lines in the figure a traditional resection performed in a TKA includes a horizontal resection cut an anterior resection cut a posterior resection cut an anterior chamfer resection cut and a posterior chamfer resection cut . The anterior and posterior resection cuts typically are placed in a substantially coronal plane. With a traditional implant the five standard resection cuts are performed so that the patient s distal femur approximately negatively matches the standard five bone cuts on the inner bone facing surface of the traditional femoral implant component. In other words the patient s bone is resected to fit the shape of the traditional femoral implant component.

Dissimilarly in various embodiments described herein one or more features of an implant component and or implant procedure are designed and or selected to provide a patient adapted implant component. For example in certain embodiments one or more features of an implant component and or implant procedure are designed and or selected preoperatively based on patient specific data to substantially match e.g. substantially negatively match and or substantially positively match one or more of the patient s biological structures or a predetermined percentage thereof. For example in certain embodiments a femoral implant component can include an outer joint facing surface i.e. inferior surface having a sagittal or j curve on one or both condyles that at least in part positively matches the corresponding bone or cartilage curvature on the patient s uncut femur. This patient specific implant component feature can be preoperatively selected and or designed based on the patient s joint dimensions as seen for example on a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation generated for example from a CT scan or MRI scan.

Alternatively or in addition one or more features of an implant component and or implant procedure can be preoperatively derived from patient specific data to provide a patient engineered feature for example to optimize one or more parameters such as one or more of the parameters described above. For example in certain embodiments a bone preserving femoral implant component can include an inner bone facing surface i.e. superior surface having one or bone cuts that at least in part are patient derived optionally together with matching patient derived resection cuts to minimize the amount of resected bone and maximize the amount of retained bone for example on the patient s femur. This patient engineered implant component feature can be preoperatively selected and or designed based on the patient s joint dimensions as seen for example on a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation generated for example from a CT scan or MRI scan.

In certain embodiments the size of an implant component can be designed and or selected to substantially match the size of a patient s corresponding biological structure or a predetermined percentage thereof. For example the ML and or AP and or proximal distal dimensions of one or more sections of a femoral implant component can be preoperatively designed and or selected to substantially match the corresponding dimension s of a patient s distal femur as determined for example from one or more images of the patient s joint. In certain embodiments the size of the femoral implant component can be designed and or selected based on one or more patient specific dimensions such as the length of the patient s epicondylar axis which can be determined from preoperatively collected patient data such as image data.

In certain embodiments an area measurement on the implant component can be designed and or selected preoperatively to match in whole or in part a corresponding area measurement on the patient s femur or a predetermined percentage thereof. For example as shown in the surface area of all or part of the bone facing surface of the implant component can be designed and or selected from patient specific data in conjunction with a preoperatively designed resection strategy to substantially match the corresponding resected surface area of the patient s femur. As shown in the figures the surface area of the implant component is a close fit to the resected surface area. In certain embodiments the implant component substantially covers the resected surface area for example by covering up to 100 and at least 90 greater than 90 at least 95 greater than 95 at least 97 greater than 97 at least 98 greater than 98 at least 99 and or greater than 99 of the resected surface area of the patient s distal femur.

In other embodiments an implant can be selected or designed so that not only one but multiple patient specific resection surfaces will achieve a desired percentage coverage relative to the cut surface e.g. 80 85 90 95 98 99 100 . This is applicable to any joint that requires alteration of the articular surface for placement of an implant using for example cutting milling drilling reaming etc. including a hip a knee an ankle a foot a toe a shoulder an elbow a wrist a hand a finger a spinal joint including an intervertebral disk space or a vertebral body.

In certain embodiments the thickness of one or portions of an implant component can be designed and or selected to match the corresponding dimension of the patient s biological structure. For example the implant component thickness can be designed and or selected to substantially match in one or more sections the thickness of the patient s cartilage the thickness of the patient s resected bone the total thickness of the patient s cartilage and resected bone or an optimized thickness based on one or more of the parameters described above. In certain embodiments the additive thickness of two or more implant components for example femoral and tibial implant components can be designed and or selected together to substantially match in one or more sections the patient s joint gap distance for example the distance between the patient s femoral and tibial bone surfaces uncut or resected.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the thickness of any implant component described herein can vary between different locations across its surface depending upon the patient s anatomy and or the depth of the damage to the cartilage and or bone to be corrected at any particular location on the patient s articular surface.

In certain embodiments the implant component design and or selection can include a thickness a minimum implant thickness and or a maximum implant thickness that is engineered from patient specific data to provide to the patient an optimized implant fit with respect to one or more parameters. Moreover the additive thickness of two or more implant components can be engineered from patient specific data to optimize the implant thickness for meeting one or more of the parameters described above. For example the femoral and or tibial implant thicknesses can be engineered from patient specific data to optimize or correct the patient s joint gap distance. The patient specific data that may be used to engineer a minimum implant thickness can include for example one or more of patient height patient weight patient age patient activity level patient joint size e.g. epicondylar distance or condylar width and other patient specific data.

In preferred embodiments the minimum implant component thickness can be engineered based on or together with other patient engineered dimensions or features of the implant component for example one or more of implant component size implant component condyle width and one or more implant component surface curvatures. For example as shown in the thinnest part of a femoral implant component frequently appears at the intersection of the implant component s distal bone cut and a posterior bone cut . This portion of an implant component also frequently shows the highest stress load as exemplified by the FEA analysis results shown in . Accordingly the minimum implant component thickness for this or any portion of the implant component can be engineered based on one or more factors related to stress load for example the size of the patient the size of the patient s femur the size of the patient s condyle the size of the patient engineered implant component the size of the implant component condyle and the implant component s joint facing surface curvature in the region that is opposite the intersection of the distal bone cut and posterior bone cut. In this way a patient specific minimum implant thickness can be engineered from patient specific data such as image data and designed into the patient adapted implant. This allows for minimal bone to be resected in the implant procedure and thereby can help to maximize bone preservation for any particular patient. Preservation of bone can allow for a subsequent knee implant to be a primary knee implant procedure rather than a revision procedure.

In addition or alternatively the implant component can be designed to include a standard minimum thickness and or a standard maximum thickness in one or more locations. For example in certain embodiments the implant component can include a minimum implant thickness of 9 mm less than 9 mm 8 mm less than 8 mm 7 mm less than 7 mm 6 mm less than 6 mm 5 mm and or less than 5 mm.

In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component includes one or more patient specific dimensions that positively or negatively match the patient s biological structure or that are engineered from patient specific data to provide to the patient an optimized implant fit with respect to one or more parameters for example as described above. For example a femoral implant component can be designed and or selected to include a joint facing surface that substantially positively matches one or more dimensions of the patient s femoral joint facing surface for example as determined by preoperatively collected data such as image data. The patient s femoral joint facing surface that is included in the image data can include for example one or more of the cartilage surface and the bone surface of the patient s femur.

The joint facing surface of a femoral implant component includes bearing surfaces that contact one or more opposing surfaces during proper joint function. In a total knee implant the bearing surfaces include one or more portions of the medial and lateral condyles of the femoral component and also the corresponding surfaces on the tibial component. Bearing surfaces also can include the trochlear area of a femoral implant component and the corresponding surface of a patella or patella implant component. In certain embodiments the femoral implant component can be designed and or selected to include a joint facing surface that substantially negatively matches one or more dimensions of an opposing surface such as a tibial surface or a patellar surface of the patient s biological structure or of another implant component such as a tibial implant component or a patellar implant component.

The primary load bearing surfaces of the femoral implant component include the joint facing surfaces of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. In particular these condylar surfaces engage the tibia or a tibial implant component during knee joint motion. Accordingly the design of these condyles can affect various parameters for example as described above such as kinematics and implant wear particularly the proper motion of the implant at the joint.

In certain embodiments one or more dimensions or features of one or both implant component condyles is designed and or selected preoperatively to be patient specific e.g. to substantially match the patient s condyle or condyles in one or more dimensions or features . In addition or alternatively one or more dimensions or features of one or both implant component condyles can be designed and or selected preoperatively to be patient engineered e.g. engineered from patient specific data to provide to the patient and optimized fit . The patient specific data used to design and or select the patient adapted e.g. patient specific or patient engineered dimensions or features can include one or more images of at least in part one or both of the patient s femoral condyles. Accordingly the manufactured femoral implant component generated from this design and or selection includes a condyle having one or more patient adapted dimensions or features.

The one or more patient adapted dimensions or features of one or both condyles can include for example width in one or more locations height in one or more locations intercondylar distance in one or more locations and one or more curvatures of at least a portion of the joint facing surface of the condyle. The curvatures can include for example one or more of a sagittal curvature on the medial condyle a coronal curvature on the lateral condyle a sagittal curvature on the lateral condyle and a coronal curvature on the lateral condyle. The dimensions or features on the medial and lateral condyles of the implant component can be designed and or selected independently of the corresponding dimensions on the other condyle provided that patient specific data e.g. image data is available for the appropriate condyle.

Any implant component dimensions or features that are not patient adapted can have a standard dimension or feature. In addition an implant design can include applying a standard dimension or feature if patient specific data exceeds or fails to meet a certain threshold value. For example in certain embodiments intercondylar distance can be patient specific however if the patient specific data shows that the patient s intercondylar distance does not exceed a minimum intercondylar distance such as 40 mm a standard intercondylar distance of 40 mm can be included in the femoral implant component.

In certain embodiments one or more of the condylar width area and height of an implant component can be designed and or selected preoperatively to be patient adapted in one or more locations along one or both condyles.

For example the width of one or both implant component condyles can be designed and or selected from patient specific data to substantially match the corresponding width of the patient s resected condyle surface. Similarly the two dimensional area of a portion of the bone facing surface of one or both implant component condyles can be designed and or selected from patient specific data to substantially match the corresponding area of the patient s resected condyle. In this way the implant component can include one or both condyles that at least in part substantially covers the width and or area of resected bone surface on the condyle for example by covering up to 100 and at least 90 greater than 90 at least 95 greater than 95 at least 97 greater than 97 at least 98 greater than 98 at least 99 and or greater than 99 of the width and or area of the patient s resected condyle surface.

In addition or alternatively the height of a portion of one or both implant component condyles can be designed and or selected from patient specific data to substantially match the corresponding height of the patient s condyle for example the height of the corresponding resected portion of the patients condyle.

In certain embodiments one or both of the intercondylar distance and the intercondylar angle of the implant component can be designed and or selected preoperatively to be patient specific in one or more locations. For example the distance and or angle between the implant component condyles can be designed and or selected from patient specific data to substantially match the corresponding distance and or angle of the patient s condyles at one or more locations.

The intercondylar distance can be measured from any point on the medial condyle to any point on the lateral condyle. For example the intercondylar distance can be measured as the distance between the outside edges of the condyles e.g. from the medial edge of the medial condyle to lateral edge of the lateral condyle as the distance between the inside edges of the condyles e.g. from the lateral edge of the medial condyle to the medial edge of the lateral condyle or as the distance from the sagittal crest of the medial condyle i.e. the J curve of the medial condyle to the sagittal crest of the lateral condyle i.e. the J curve of the lateral condyle .

The intercondylar angle can be measured as the angle between a line on the medial condyle and a line on the lateral condyle. For example the intercondylar angle can be measured as the angle between a tangent line to any point on the medial condyle and a tangent line to any point on the lateral condyle. One or each tangent line can be defined by a point on the outside edge of a respective condyle by a point on the inside edge of a respective condyle or by a point on the J curve of a respective condyle. Alternatively one or both lines used to measure the angle can be defined by any two or more points on the same condyle rather than as a tangent line. In particular in certain embodiments the implant component includes a patient adapted e.g. patient specific or patient adapted intercondylar angle at the trochlear notch.

In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component can be designed and or selected to include one or more of a patient specific curvature at least in part a patient engineered curvature at least in part and a standard curvature at least in part. Various exemplary combinations of implant components having patient adapted e.g. patient specific or patient engineered and standard coronal and sagittal condylar curvatures are shown in Table 8.

In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of the femoral implant component can be designed and or selected to include a patient specific curvature at least in part. For example any one or more of a coronal curvature of the medial condyle a sagittal curvature of the medial condyle a coronal curvature of the lateral condyle and a sagittal curvature of the lateral condyle can be designed and or selected preoperatively to substantially match the patient s corresponding curvature e.g. subchondral bone or cartilage at least in part or can be derived from the patient s corresponding curvature e.g. of subchondral bone or cartilage at least in part.

In certain embodiments the load bearing portion of one or both implant condyles that contacts the tibial plateau during a normal range of motion e.g. from the distal portion to the posterior portion of the implant component s joint facing condyle surfaces can be designed and or selected to include one or more patient specific curvatures. show exemplary load bearing surfaces of a femur in coronal view and in sagittal view . As indicated by the figures the load bearing surface on each of the medial and lateral condyles includes a coronal curvature and a sagittal curvature . Non patient specific curvatures can include standard curvatures e.g. selected from a family of standard curvatures for example a family of 3 4 5 6 7 or more standard curvatures and or engineered curvatures e.g. engineered from patient specific data to optimize one or more parameters for example as described above . For example a femoral implant component can include a medial condyle having a patient specific sagittal curvature at least in part and a standard coronal curvature and a lateral condyle having standard coronal and sagittal curvatures.

In certain embodiments the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component can be designed and or selected to include at least in part a patient engineered curvature. For example the joint facing surface can be designed and or selected to include a patient engineered curvature at least in part for any one or more of a medial condyle coronal curvature a medial condyle sagittal curvature a lateral condyle coronal curvature and a lateral condyle sagittal curvature. In certain embodiments one or more load bearing portions of the condylar sagittal and or coronal curvature is designed and or selected to be patient engineered. Non patient engineered curvatures can include standard curvatures and or patient specific curvatures.

In certain embodiments an implant component curvature can be preoperatively engineered based on patient specific data to correct or optimize the patient s condyle curvature. The procedure can use a model or a mathematical formula to engineer a corrected or optimized condyle curvature and or shape. The model or mathematical formula can be based on one or more patient specific dimensions. For example in certain embodiments the implant component can include one or more curvatures that have been smoothed to address minor imperfections in the patient s corresponding curvature. In certain embodiments one condyle can be engineered to have a curvature relative to the corresponding curvature in the patient s other condyle. For example an implant component can be engineered to have a lateral sagittal J curve engineered based on the patient s medial sagittal J curve. The lateral J curve can be engineered to have one or more radii of curvature that are shorter for example 5 10 15 20 10 15 and or 0 20 shorter than the corresponding radii of curvature of the patient s medial J curve. In certain embodiments the implant component can be designed to have a lateral J curve shape that substantially positively matches the patient s medial J curve shape.

In patients in need of knee replacement the lateral condyle is sometimes deformed or hypoplastic which can contribute to a valgus deformity. In fact hypoplastic lateral condyles may be present in 20 of patients that require knee replacement. An implant that is engineered from patient specific data to address this deformity by correcting or optimizing the lateral condyle can include one or more expanded curvatures in one or more locations on the lateral condyle relative to the patient s corresponding uncut medial or lateral condyle. Accordingly the implant is engineered to include additional material on the outer joint facing surface of the implant component s lateral condyle. The expanded curvature s and or material on the outside of the condyle can be used to design a material savings on the inside of the corresponding section of the implant component for example by maintaining a minimum material implant thickness from the outside joint facing surface to the inside bone facing surface of the implant component. In this way by adding material to the external contour of the implant component and maintaining a minimum material thickness of the implant component bone preservation can be maximized. Specifically with more material on the joint facing surface of the implant and less material on the inner bone facing surface of the implant the resection cuts are made closer to the surface of the bone. Accordingly this approach uses the patient adapted design of the implant component to both correct a condyle shape abnormality such as a lateral condyle abnormality such as hypoplasia and to maximize bone preservation.

In certain embodiments one or more curvatures on one or both condyles can be engineered from patient specific data for example in order to optimize joint kinematics. For example the medial condyle in the trochlear region of the implant component can be engineered to be 5 mm lateral relative to the patient s condyle which can help lateralize the patella.

Different curvatures can be selected on the medial condyle and the lateral condyle of an implant component. Moreover one or more curvatures of one condyle can be patient specific in whole or in part while one or more curvatures on the same condyle or on the other condyle can be patient engineered in whole or in part or standard in whole or in part.

The one or more patient adapted i.e. patient specific or patient engineered curvatures and standard curvatures on the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component can be combined in a condyle to take on any overall shape. illustrate exemplary types of curvatures for one or more condylar coronal or sagittal curvatures. An implant component condyle can include a surface curvature corresponding to a section of any one or more geometric shapes such as a circle a parabola a hyperbola an ellipsoid and any other geometric shape optionally standard or patient adapted or patient derived. The curvature also can include in part a substantially straight line portion as illustrated by the curvature in . Different portions of a condyle such as the anterior portion the distal portion the posterior portion the load bearing portion and or the non load bearing portion each can include a different curvature than one or more other portions in a sagittal plane or in a coronal plane or in an axial plane in a trochlea for example. For example in certain embodiments the load bearing portion of the medial condyle can include a different curvature than the non load bearing portions of the same condyle and optionally than any or all sections of the lateral condyle. Similarly in certain embodiments the load bearing portion of the lateral condyle can include a different curvature than the non load bearing portions of the same condyle and optionally than any or all sections of the medial condyle. These curvature features also can apply to the curved portion on one or both of the lateral and medial surfaces of the proximal tibia that engage the lateral and medial femoral condyles during normal motion.

The curvature in corresponds to a section of a circle and accordingly can be defined by a single radius of curvature across its entire curvature. Two exemplary radii of curvature are shown as dotted lines in . However the curvatures in each correspond to a section of a non circular geometric shape and therefore each include radii having different lengths across their curvatures. Moreover the straight line portion of the curvature illustrated in includes no radius of curvature. Accordingly as exemplified by the circular curvature shown in a curvature or a portion of a curvature of an implant component for example a condylar coronal or sagittal curvature on the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component can include a single radius of curvature. Alternatively or in addition as exemplified by the non circular curvatures shown in a curvature or a portion of a curvature of an implant component for example a condylar coronal or sagittal curvature on the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component can include multiple radii of curvature and optionally no radii of curvature e.g. for a straight line portion of a curvature .

Moreover in certain embodiments a curvature or a portion of a curvature of an implant component for example a condylar coronal or sagittal curvature on the joint facing surface of a femoral implant component can include a combination of patient specific radii of curvature patient engineered radii of curvature and or standard radii of curvature. In other words a curvature can include a portion that is patient specific a portion that is patient engineered and or a portion that is standard. These can be present in the same plane or dimension e.g. a sagittal dimension a coronal dimension or an axial dimension or these can be present in different dimensions. For example at least a portion of a sagittal curvature of the implant can be patient specific or patient engineered while at least a portion of a coronal curvature can be standard or constant patient engineered. For example illustrate a design for a femoral implant component having a J curve that is patient specific in part and patient engineered in part. Specifically as shown in the figure the J curve is designed to be patient specific except for a distal portion and a posterior portion of the curvature. In the distal portion the J curve is smoothed relative to the patient s J curve. In the posterior portion the J curve is tapered out 1 2 mm relative to the patient s J curve.

One or more radii of a condylar curvature of a femoral implant component can be engineered from patient data to optimize or correct any one or more parameters for example any one or more parameters described above. For example with reference to the distal load bearing portion of the J curve frequently has the flattest surface . In certain embodiments this portion of the J curve can be engineered to shift the flattest portion anteriorly or posteriorly to correct or optimize the patient s biomechanics joint alignment implant load pattern and or implant wear pattern. In the flattest portion of the J curve in the top implant component appears at the distal portion of the implant. However the bottom implant is engineered to include the flattest portion of the J curve further posterior to the distal position. In certain embodiments an implant component s entire condylar sagittal curvature can be flexed e.g. rotated anteriorly or posteriorly for example about the femoral mechanical axis or the sagittal axis in an implant relative to the patient s corresponding curvature in order to correct or optimize the patient s biomechanics and or alignment.

In certain preferred embodiments the femoral implant component is preoperatively designed and or selected to include one or both condylar bearing surfaces having a sagittal curvature e.g. a J curve that at least in part substantially positively matches or is derived from the corresponding sagittal curvature of the patient s condyle e.g. portions of cartilage or subchondral bone or combinations thereof as determined from patient specific data including for example image data. In addition the coronal curvature of the implant component can include a standard curvature for example selected by choosing from among a family of 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 implants or implant blanks the one that includes a coronal curvature that is most similar to the patient s coronal curvature in one or more locations on the curvature. Alternatively an implant component condyle curvature can be selected by choosing from among a family of implants or implant blanks the one that as compared to the patient s curvature includes longer and or shorter radii of curvature at a load bearing portion of the curvature in order to achieve a less constraining or a more constraining biomechanical situation during knee motion. illustrates the use of a coronal curvature having a longer radius of curvature e.g. 40 mm radius of curvature versus a coronal curvature having shorter radius of curvature e.g. 20 mm radius of curvature .

The radii of curvature of a human femoral condyle coronal curvature typically range from 20 to 30 mm. In certain embodiments one or both femoral implant component condyles and or the corresponding curvature of the bearing surface on the tibial implant component include a coronal curvature that matches a particular patient s coronal curvature. In certain embodiments one or both femoral implant component condyles and or the corresponding curvature of the bearing surface on the tibial implant component include a standard coronal curvature within the range of typical human coronal curvatures for example from about 20 mm to about 30 mm. In certain embodiments one or both femoral implant component condyles and or the corresponding curvature of the bearing surface on the tibial implant component include a standard coronal curvature outside of the range of typical human coronal curvatures for example less than 20 mm about 15 mm less than 15 mm greater than 30 mm 35 mm greater than 35 mm between about 30 mm and about 40 mm 40 mm and or greater than 40 mm. The tibial implant component can be designed to match or reflect at least one of a sagittal femoral curvature or a coronal femoral curvature. The corresponding radii on the tibial implant component can be applied or derived from the femur in a ratio e.g. 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 8 1 10 1 15 1 20 in at least one of a sagittal dimension or a coronal dimension or combinations thereof medially only laterally only or both. For example in certain embodiments at least a portion of the femoral implant s coronal curvature e.g. the center portion of the condyle and or the corresponding portion of the tibial implant component curvature can correspond to a section of a circle having a radius of curvature less than 20 mm less than 15 mm 15 mm greater than 30 mm 35 mm greater than 35 mm 40 mm and or greater than 40 mm.

Using longer radii of curvature e.g. greater than 30 mm 35 mm greater than 35 mm 40 mm and or 40 mm for a femoral implant s condylar coronal curvature can provide certain advantages. For example show coronal cross sections of two femoral implant component condyles. As shown each condyle includes an outer joint facing surface coronal curvature having a constant radius of curvature at least in part depicted as radius R1 and radius R2 respectively . In addition as shown the two condyles have the same maximum component thickness with the condyle in having a longer radius of curvature than the condyle in . As can be seen from a comparison of figures where the width and maximum component thickness are the same for the two components the component with the longer radius of curvature allows for more material at the edge of the component and therefore can be less likely to fail in this area of the femoral implant component. In certain embodiments the one or more condylar curvatures e.g. one or more coronal curvatures and or sagittal curvatures and or component width can be engineered from patient specific data to be as close to the patient specific curvature and or width as possible after a threshold minimum thickness and or minimum edge thickness or minimum chamfer cut thickness is achieved. For example a threshold minimum thickness and or minimum edge thickness and or minimum chamfer cut thickness can be set initially e.g. predetermined . Material properties of the implant component and or loading conditions or biomechanical modeling including finite element modeling can assist in determining the threshold minimum thickness and or minimum edge thickness. Subsequently one or more patient specific curvatures or widths or shapes are derived for example by determining the curvature or width or shape of subchondral bone or cartilage. These curvatures can be used to derive a shape or curvature or width of one or more bearing surfaces of the implant component e.g. in a coronal plane sagittal plane or axial plane. The shape or curvature or width of the one or more bearing surfaces of the implant component then can be altered in order to achieve the predetermined minimum thickness or minimum edge thickness or minimum chamfer cut thickness criterion. This alteration can be performed using computerized methods as well as manual e.g. operator selected methods.

Similarly a maximum thickness and or maximum edge thickness and or maximum chamfer cut thickness and or maximum bone cut thickness can be predetermined. The shape or curvature or width of the one or more bearing surfaces of the implant then can be altered in order to achieve the predetermined maximum thickness and or maximum edge thickness and or maximum chamfer cut thickness and or maximum bone cut thickness criterion. By optimizing against a maximum bone cut thickness the implant can be selected or designed so that it is sufficiently bone preserving to be a pre primary implant e.g. where for example a distal bone cut is distal to the bone cut with a standard of the shelf femoral component implant thereby enabling later revision to a standard total knee system.

Various dimensions and features of a patient s condyles such as width area height intercondylar distance intercondylar angle and surface contour and curvatures e.g. of the patient s cartilage or subchondral bone or combinations thereof including normal or diseased cartilage can be determined from one or more images of the patient s knee joint. In certain embodiments a dimension or feature of the patient s condyles can be assessed to include cartilage on the patient s distal femur. In certain embodiments a dimension or feature can be assessed based on the patient s bone for example subchondral bone on the patient s distal femur. If subchondral bone is used to assess the patient s condylar curvature optionally a standard cartilage thickness e.g. 2 mm or an approximate cartilage thickness derived from patient specific data e.g. age joint size contralateral joint measurements and or other data can be used as part of the preoperative implant design for example to correct or address for joint line movement associated with lost cartilage. Alternatively the cartilage thickness can be measured directly in or more regions.

The sagittal and or coronal curvatures of a patient s condyle can be determined from image data by assessing the surface of the condyle in a substantially sagittal or coronal plane. Alternatively or in addition the curvature s also can be assessed in an axial plane for example for a patella a trochlea a glenoid or an acetabulum. For example as shown in a patient s J curve can be determined independently for lateral and medial condyles. Then one or both of the patient s lateral and medial condylar J curves can be applied to one or more sections of a femoral implant component s medial and or lateral J curves. For example the distal point of the lateral condyle through a range of motion and the distal point of the medial condyle through a range of motion can independently be applied respectively to a lateral sagittal plane defined by the patient s epicondylar axis and to a medial sagittal plane defined by the patient s epicondylar axis to yield independent lateral and medial J curves that are applied to the patient specific implant component. In certain embodiments as shown in a model of a patient s femur can be generated from images of the patient s femur. The images can include for example x ray cone beam CT digital tomosynthesis ultrasound laser imaging MRI CT PET SPECT and or other images and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments as shown in the patient s J curve can be transferred onto a single plane e.g. a substantially sagittal plane and then that planar curvature or a portion thereof can be transferred into the design of the femoral implant component as a single planar curvature. In certain embodiments the patient s J curve can lie in more than one plane and more than one plane can be used to transfer and apply the J curve to the implant component for example such that the J curve lies in one plane for a portion and then angles away from that plane for a portion. Moreover in certain embodiments one or both of the implant component s condylar J curves or portions thereof can match the patient s J curve planar orientation. For example corresponding medial and lateral planes that include portions of the patient s medial and lateral J curves respectively can be non parallel to each other e.g. angled toward each other anteriorly or otherwise angled relative to an anatomical feature e.g. the epicondylar axis femoral mechanical axis trochlear J curve and or some other feature . The corresponding J curve portions of the femoral implant component and optionally the tibial implant component can be designed to match this planar orientation. For example the J curve or portions thereof e.g. the distal and or posterior load bearing portions can match the patient s J curve in a sagittal direction or in both a sagittal and coronal direction.

In one embodiment the medial or lateral femoral condyle can have a constant coronal curvature which can be standard or patient derived or selected. The constant coronal curvature can be the same on the medial and the lateral condyle or it can be different. The constant coronal curvature can be combined with a patient specific or patient derived at least in part sagittal curvature on one or both condyles.

In a different embodiment the same condyle can have two areas with different constant coronal curvatures. For example the central distal load bearing portion of one or both femoral condyles can have a different constant coronal curvature than the high posterior portion of one or both condyles. The use of two different constant coronal curvatures in these different areas of the condyle can for example be advantageous in select high flexion designs whereby one or more constant coronal curvatures are adapted or selected to maximize tibiofemoral contact area and minimize tibiofemoral contact stress and resultant wear for one or more flexion angles. More than two constant coronal curvatures are possible on a condyle. The transition between a first area of constant coronal curvature and a second and optionally third or fourth area of constant coronal curvature can be selected or designed to coincide with certain anatomic features e.g. a sulcus line. The transition between a first area of constant coronal curvature and a second and optionally third or fourth area of constant coronal curvature can be selected or designed to include one or two or multiple coronal radii that allow for a smooth transition from a first to a second area of constant coronal curvature.

Coronal curvatures can be engineered or patient derived e.g. one or more averages . A condyle can have more than one engineered or patient derived constant coronal radius and similarly the tibial plateau for example a condyle can have an engineered or patient derived coronal radius in an anterior region that is different from that in a central region or from that in a posterior region. Such combinations of engineered or patient derived coronal radii are possible for example in the presence of a sagittal patient specific or derived curvature. A medial condyle can have one or more engineered or patient derived coronal curvatures that are different from one or more more engineered or patient derived coronal curvatures of a lateral condyle.

In select high flexion designs one or more of the posterior condyle curvature implant thickness edge thickness bone cut orientation and bone cut depth can be adapted to maximize flexion. For example the posterior bone cut can be offset more anteriorly for a given minimum thickness of the implant. This anterior offsetting of the posterior cut can be combined with a taper of the posterior implant bearing surface. Other strategies to enhance a patient s deep knee flexion include adding or extending the implant component posteriorly at the end bearing surface in high flexion. By extending the bearing surface the knee can be flexed more deeply. Accordingly in certain embodiments the posterior edge and or posterior bearing surface is patient engineered to enhance deep knee flexion for the particular patient.

Patellar revision can be very challenging and bone preservation is preferred in the patella. In certain embodiments two or more patellar resection facets and two or more patellar implant component bone cuts are employed to preserve patellar bone stock. One or both of the two or more patellar facets can be substantially tangent or parallel to the medial and or lateral uncut patellar surfaces. Optionally particularly with more than two patellar resection facets facets can be substantially tangent or parallel to uncut patellar superior and or inferior surfaces. In certain embodiments the patellar facing surface of an implant component can be patient specific i.e. designed to match the patient s normal trochlear groove or patellar shape e.g. patellar cartilage or subchondral bone . Alternatively the patellar facing surface of the implant component can be engineered from patient specific data to optimize one or more parameters for example kinematics or wear between component surfaces. A method for designing a patient adapted implant to optimize tracking of the patella along the trochlear groove of a femoral implant component is described below in Example 8. Specifically the exemplary implant design in Example 8 uses a patient specific sagittal curvature at least in part and an engineered coronal curvature at least in part to allow the patella component to track properly in the trochlear groove. In certain other embodiments the coronal curvature additionally can be patient specific. In certain embodiments the coronal curvature is patient specific and the sagittal curvature is standard or engineered.

In certain embodiments one or more trochlear groove features e.g. trochlear J curve sulcus displacement and or other features and corresponding patella features articular surface contour and or curvature ML SI and or AP shape can be patient specific patient engineered and or standard in part or in whole. For example shows the line of a trochlear J curve defined anteriorly by the lowermost point of the patient s trochlear groove i.e. sulcus and superimposed on the patient s distal femur. As indicated by the figure an implant s trochlear J curve can substantially or partially match the patient s trochlear J curve e.g. curve of sulcus viewed in the sagittal plane in one or more locations for example in the anterior portion of the trochlear J curve. The substantially matching trochlear J curve can include portions that are smoothed relative to the patient s curvature. The partially matching trochlear J curve can include portions that are engineered or patient derived and smoothed or constant relative to the patient s curvature. At the same time the trochlear J curve and or sulcus position e.g. shift in the trochlear J curve in the ML direction of the implant can be engineered in part or in whole from the patient s anatomy e.g. to improve kinematics. For example as shown in the distal portion of the trochlear J curve is tapered out 1 2 mm relative to the patient s trochlear J curve. As discussed in detail below the patellar implant component can include be selected and or designed to include one or more features that correspond to one or more trochlear features of the femoral implant component.

In preferred embodiments the implant s trochlear groove is slightly larger e.g. a curvature that is wider in the ML dimension and or having a deeper sulcus than the corresponding engaging surface of the patella and or slightly larger than the patient s corresponding trochlear groove. For example in certain embodiments the implant component includes a trochlear groove coronal curvature that is engineered to be slightly wider and or deeper than the patient s trochlear groove coronal curvature.

Moreover the implant component can include a trochlear groove and or sulcus that are shifted and or angled in part or in whole for example in order to optimize the biomechanical situation during knee motion. For example the implant component s trochlear groove and or sulcus can be offset by 2 5 mm medially by 2 5 mm laterally by about 2 mm medially by about 2 mm laterally by 1 2 mm medially by 1 2 mm laterally by less than 1 mm medially or by less than 1 mm laterally for example relative to the patient s trochlear groove and or sulcus and or relative to one or both of the medial and or lateral condyles. For example as shown in in certain embodiments a line intersecting the sulcus of the implant component and perpendicular to a baseline connecting the lowermost points of the medial and lateral condyles can be medial to the point on the baseline that bisects the lowermost points of the medial and lateral condyles. Alternatively or in addition the implant component s trochlear groove and or sulcus can be angled relative to the patient s trochlear groove and or sulcus. For example in certain embodiments the trochlear groove or sulcus of the implant component can be positioned to include the patient s posterior aspect of the femoral trochlear notch or sulcus but then angle away anteriorly e.g. by less than 10 degree such as by 5 7 degrees from the patient s trochlear groove or sulcus either in the medial direction or in the lateral direction.

In certain embodiments the trochlear articulating surface of the femoral implant component can include an overall shape that substantially positively matches the shape of the patient s trochlear articulating surface as shown in . In particular depicts an axial view of a particular patient s femoral shape with the trochlear groove lateral anterior sulcus and medial anterior sulcus indicated by dashed lines. depicts an overlay of an implant component s articulating surface dash dot line and the particular patient femoral shape solid line . In this figure the shape of the implant component from the axial view is patient specific such that it substantially positively matches the particular patient s femoral shape from the axial view . Alternatively or in addition one or more aspects of the implant component s shape can be patient engineered e.g. derived from patient specific data and optimized relative to the shape of the patient s femur . For example as shown in the implant component s trochlear articulating surface includes an overhanging flange or extension at the intercondylar notch . As shown in the figure the overhanging flange or extension extends from the lateral aspect of the intercondylar notch however in certain embodiments it can extend from the lateral or medial aspect or both of the intercondylar notch. This overhanging feature can be beneficial in patients with a wider intercondylar notch distance in particular if a standard patellar button i.e. patellar implant component is used that could for example be less wide than the intercondylar distance in select patients. The extension or flange can assist to help avoid patellar clicking or capture for example if a smaller patellar button may fall into the intercondylar notch region during motion of the knee.

In certain embodiments the implant component can substantially match one or more of the patient s femoral or femoral condyle dimensions or surface shapes e.g. the shape of the patient s femoral bone or cartilage on the joint facing surface e.g. at the bearing surface that engages the tibia and optionally also on the bone facing surface. At the same time the trochlear s outer articulating shape can however be partially matched to the patient s articular surface or instead patient engineered from patient data but not designed to match the patient s surface feature. For example as shown in the implant component can include a shallower trochlear groove than the patient s trochlear groove . In the figure the trochlear groove curvatures are shown above the axial view of the femur and implant component . This shallower trochlear groove can be engineered by using a shallower lateral side of the trochlear surface and or a shallower medial side of the trochlea for example relative to the patient s lateral and medial sides. A shallower lateral shape of the implant component s trochlea surface can for example assist in achieving more normal patellofemoral motion in select patellofemoral tracking abnormalities. For example as shown in a shallower lateral shape of the implant component s trochlea surface can be used to correct a patient s tracking abnormality relating to the patient s lateral trochlear shape . A shallower medial shape of the implant component s trochlea surface can for example assist in achieving more normal patellofemoral motion in select patellofemoral tracking abnormalities.

The partially e.g. coronal plane only or lateral trochlear surface only or completely engineered e.g. coronal plane and sagittal plane or medial and lateral trochlear surface trochlear surface of the implant component can be at least in part anterior to the patient s native uncut bone or it can be at least in part posterior to the patient s native uncut bone or both. For example as shown in the implant component surface can be anterior to the patient s uncut medial trochlear bone surface but posterior to the patient s uncut lateral trochlear bone . As shown in the implant component surface can be anterior to the patient s uncut medial trochlear bone surface but posterior to the patient s uncut lateral trochlear bone . The most posterior point of the partially or completely engineered trochlear articulating surface of the implant can be anterior to coincident with or co planar with or posterior to the most posterior point of the patient s native uncut trochlear in any location of the trochlea e.g. superior central or inferior.

The coronal curvature also can be non patient matched or derived or engineered or constant. Each of depict an exemplary implant component surface having a constant trochlear coronal curvature that does not follow the patient s trochlear coronal curvature. However as shown by the figures other implant component features e.g. surface outline are patient specific with respect e.g. with respect to the patient s femoral surface outline .

The trochlear articular surface can be patient specific in all dimensions and aspects patient engineered in all dimensions or aspects partially patient specific and partially patient engineered partially patient specific and partially standard partially patient engineered and partially standard or partially patient specific partially patient engineered and partially standard. Combinations include for example those described in Table 9.

Of note an engineered surface can still include patient derived parameters. For example the patient s trochlear coronal curvature can be measured in multiple locations and an average can be derived. The average or constant coronal curvature can then be applied to the articulating surface of the implant. Optionally a matching patellar implant component can be selected or designed.

The trochlear groove location can be patient derived e.g. derived from the location of the patient s uncut trochlear groove determined from an imaging test. A desired trochlear groove location can be derived based on these measurements for example by calculating a straight line intersecting the patient s curved trochlear groove. Mathematical or kinematic modeling can be used to derive the patient derived engineered trochlear groove location.

The sagittal curvature of the articulating trochlear surface of the femoral component can be matched to the patient s sagittal trochlear shape in one or more locations e.g. trochlear groove medial trochlea or lateral trochlea or combinations thereof 

The trochlear groove curvature and or location can be patient specific on the implant articulating surface i.e. replicating the location of the patient s native uncut trochlear groove for example as it extends from superior to inferior. For example depicts an implant component trochlear groove that is patient specific to substantially match the patient s trochlear groove curvature and position. The trochlear groove location can be patient engineered e.g. to include one or more straight curved straight oblique and or curved oblique sections that may deviate from the patient s trochlear groove. The trochlear groove can be a combination of patient specific and patient engineered. For example depicts an implant component trochlear groove that is patient specific in its shape to substantially positively match the shape of the patient s trochlear groove curvature however the implant component trochlear groove is offset laterally in its location relative to the patient s trochlear groove curvature . Moreover is a blown up image of the trochlear groove depicted in depict an implant component trochlear groove that is a patient derived to be patient specific in part and patient engineered in part to yield a straight trochlear groove . In particular the location and curvature of the patient s trochlear groove is measured and then in the implant component the trochlear groove is patient specific where the patient s groove is straight and patient engineered where the patient s groove curves. Alternatively a patient engineered straight trochlear groove can be derived as an average straight line based on the patient s groove. Alternative the patient engineered line can be forced to follow an oblique line rather than a straight line.

Alternatively the implant component trochlear groove can be a standard straight line or oblique line as shown in respectively.

As noted above with traditional knee implants the patient s bone is resected to fit the standard shape of the bone facing surface of the traditional femoral implant component. On its bone facing surface the traditional femoral implant component includes five standard bone cuts as exemplified by the implant shown in . Specifically a traditional total knee implant includes a distal or horizontal cut an anterior cut a posterior cut along each femoral condyle an anterior chamfer cut and a posterior chamfer cut .

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the bone facing surface of the femoral implant are designed based on patient specific data to substantially negatively match the uncut surface of the patient s femur for example the subchondral bone surface of the femur. In such embodiments the surgical procedure includes resurfacing i.e. removing cartilage at least in part while substantially retaining the surface of subchondral bone i.e. cutting away bone the joint facing surface of the patient s femur. In certain embodiments the bone facing surface s of the implant component are designed and or selected preoperatively based on patient specific data to optimize one or more parameters such as bone preservation e.g. minimizing the amount of bone that is resected during the implant procedure .

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the bone facing surface of the femoral implant includes two or more bone cuts for example two three four five six seven eight nine or more bone cuts. For example a femoral implant component can include less than or greater than five bone cuts. In a preferred embodiment the femoral implant includes six bone cuts as shown in . In another preferred embodiment the femoral implant includes seven bone cuts as shown in . One or more of the implant bone cuts can be curvilinear or the entire bone facing surface of the implant component can be curvilinear bone cut.

In certain embodiments one or more portions of the bone facing surface of the femoral implant includes two or more bone cuts for example two three four five six seven eight nine or more bone cuts. For example a femoral implant component can include less than or greater than five bone cuts. In a preferred embodiment the femoral implant includes six bone cuts. In another preferred embodiment the femoral implant includes seven bone cuts. One or more of the implant bone cuts can be curvilinear or the entire bone facing surface of the implant component can be curvilinear bone cut. In certain embodiments the femoral implant and design can include bone cuts that are rotated or oriented based on a certain flexion angle of the knee e.g. rotated in the sagittal plane. Any number of bone cuts can be included in an implant device designed with flexed fit cuts. For example two three four five six seven eight nine or more cut planes can be included in a flexed fit design. One or more of the cuts can be curvilinear or the entire bone facing surface can be curvilinear. Moreover any one or more bone cuts can include two or more non coplanar facets as described below. The cuts can be oriented at any rotation for example at 5 greater than 5 10 greater than 10 15 greater than 15 20 greater than 20 25 or greater than 25 degrees flexion.

In certain embodiments the femoral implant component can include one or more bone cuts oriented in one or more dimensions e.g. not only in the sagittal plane but also in the coronal plane and or in the axial plane. show exemplary cross sections of femoral implant components with bone cuts shown as dashed lines. show exemplary cross sections of femoral implant components with bone cuts shown as dashed lines. show traditional bone cuts. show bone cuts rotated e.g. in the sagittal plane as in . shows a traditional distal bone cut while shows a rotated bone cut in the coronal plane. C shows traditional anterior and posterior bone cuts in a distal end view of a femur as compared to that shows bone cuts rotated in the axial plane. Such bone cut rotations can help to further optimize bone preservation and many variations and combinations are possible in the present invention.

In certain embodiments the femoral implant component can include one or more bone cuts oriented one or more dimensions e.g. not only in the sagittal plane but also in the coronal plane and or in the axial plane. show exemplary cross sections of femoral implant components with bone cuts shown as dashed lines. show an implant component with traditional bone cuts as compared to an implant component with bone cuts rotated in the sagittal plane . show an implant component with traditional bone cuts as compared to an implant component with bone cuts rotated in the coronal plane . show an implant component with traditional bone cuts as compared to an implant component with bone cuts rotated in the axial plane . Such bone cut rotations can help to further optimize bone preservation.

As shown in in certain embodiments an implant component bone cut can include one or more non parallel and non coplanar facets. As shown the implant component in includes six bone cuts while the implant component in includes an extra posterior chamfer bone cut for a total of seven bone cuts. Non coplanar facets can include facets that lie in parallel but different planes and or facets that lie in non parallel planes. As exemplified by the implant component shown in and by the implant component shown in the medial and lateral facets of a bone cut can be non parallel and non coplanar for one or more bone cuts for example for one or more of the distal bone cut the posterior bone cut the first posterior chamfer bone cut and the second posterior chamfer bone cut . Alternatively or in addition one or more corresponding facets of a bone cut can include different thicknesses. For example the implant component shown in includes a maximum distal medial facet thickness of 6.2 mm and a maximum distal lateral facet thickness of 6.3 mm. The independent and optionally patient derived thicknesses on corresponding bone cut facets can apply to one or more thickness measurements for example one or more of maximum thicknesses minimum thickness and an average thickness for example to match or optimize the particular patient s anatomy. Moreover a single bone cut or bone cut facet can include a variable thickness e.g. a variable thickness profile across its M L and or A P dimensions. For example a bone cut or bone cut facet can include a thickness profile in one or more dimensions that is patient derived e.g. to match or optimize the patient s anatomy . The implant component in includes an anterior chamfer with an 11 mm thickness on the medial side which includes the medial implant component peg or post and a different thickness on the lateral side. As shown the implant component in was selected and or designed to have a flex fit e.g. having bone cuts rotated posteriorly about the transepicondylar axis which can enhance implant component coverage of the posterior portion of the femur and provide the patient with deeper knee flexion with the implant.

Alternatively or in addition one or more corresponding facets of a bone cut can include different surface areas or volumes. For bone cuts having facets separated by the intercondylar space and asymmetric with respect to the A P plane bisecting the implant component the asymmetric facets appear dissimilar in shape and or size e.g. two dimensional area . For example the implant components shown in include one or more corresponding facets e.g. distal medial and lateral facets posterior medial and lateral facets and or posterior chamfer medial and lateral facets having different medial facet and lateral facet bone facing surface areas joint facing surface areas and or volumes in between the two surfaces. In particular as shown in and in A the medial and lateral facets of the distal bone cut are asymmetric and appear dissimilar in both shape e.g. surface area perimeter shape and size e.g. volume under the surface area . The independent facet surface areas and or volumes optionally can be patient derived e.g. to match or optimize the patient s anatomy .

As shown in non coplanar facets can be separated by an intercondylar space and or by a step cut . For example as shown in the figure the distal bone cut includes non coplanar medial and lateral facets that are separated in part by the intercondylar space and in part by a step cut .

In certain embodiments one or more resection cuts can be selected and or designed to so that one or more resected cut or facet surfaces substantially matches one or more corresponding bone cuts or bone cut facets. For example shows six resection cut facets that substantially match the corresponding implant component bone cut facets shown in . shows seven resection cut facets that substantially match the corresponding implant component bone cut facets of the medial side of the implant component shown in . The portion represents additional bone conserved on the lateral side of the of the femur corresponding to the bone cut intersection between the lateral distal bone cut facet and the adjacent anterior chamfer bone cut .

In certain embodiments a bone cut facet and or a resection cut facet can span the intercondylar space and be separated from another facet by a step cut. For example as exemplified in predetermined resection cuts can be selected and or designed to include a facet or part of a facet separated from one or more corresponding facets by an intercondylar space and or by a step cut .

In addition or alternatively in certain embodiments a single implant bone cut facet and or corresponding resection cut facet can be asymmetric for example asymmetric with respect to an A P plane an M L plane and or an axial plane bisecting the facet. For example as shown in the anterior chamfer bone cut is asymmetric with respect to an A P plane bisecting the bone cut facet. In addition in both figures the lateral distal bone cut facet is asymmetric with respect to an A P plane bisecting that facet.

The bone cut designs described above for example an implant component bone facing surface having various numbers of bone cuts flexed bone cuts non coplanar bone cut facets step cuts used to separate facets and asymmetric bone cuts and bone cut facets can be employed on a bone facing surface of a femoral implant component to save substantial portions of bone.

Table 10 shows the different amounts of bone to be resected from a patient for fitting an implant component with bone cuts shown in an implant component with bone cuts shown in and a traditional implant component with traditional bone cuts. As compared to the traditional implant component the implant component shown in saves 44 of resected patient bone and the implant component shown in saves 38 of resected patient bone. However the implant component in is flexed which can provide enhanced deep knee flexion for the patient. In certain embodiments the surgeon or operator can select or apply a weighting to these two parameters bone preservation and kinematics and optionally other parameters to identify an optimum patient adapted implant component and optionally a corresponding resection cut strategy that meets the desired parameters and or parameter weightings for the particular patient.

In traditional femoral implant components the anterior or trochlear bone cut is located substantially in the coronal plane and is parallel to the posterior condylar bone cut as indicated by the dashed anterior resection cut and dashed posterior resection cut shown in . This can result in a substantial amount of bone lost from those portions of the patient s femur . However in certain embodiments described herein the implant s anterior or trochlear bone cut is substantially non parallel to the coronal plane as shown by the dashed and straight line in . For example the implant s anterior or trochlear bone cut can substantially match the patient s resected trochlear surface which can be selected and or designed to be parallel to a tangent through the corresponding peak and an uncut trochlear surface portion of the patient s trochlea as shown in . By placing the implant bone cut and the resected surface at an angle relative to the patient s coronal plane for example parallel to a tangent of one or both medial and lateral trochlear peak and or the adjacent trochlear surface a substantial amount of bone can be preserved.

In certain embodiments the implant component can include a trochlear bone cut with two or more non coplanar facets as shown by the intersecting solid lines in . For example one of the two or more facets and the patient s corresponding resected surface can be substantially parallel to the patient s lateral uncut trochlear peak and or the adjacent uncut trochlear surface. A second facet and the patient s corresponding resected surface can be substantially parallel to the patient s medial uncut trochlear peak and or the adjacent uncut trochlear surface. This can further enhance the degree of bone preservation.

In certain embodiments two or more trochlear bone cut facets can be substantially tangent to the lateral and medial patellar surfaces of the patient s uncut bone. In addition or alternatively two or more trochlear bone cuts can be substantially tangent or parallel to the superior and inferior patellar facets in particular when more than two implant trochlear bone cut facets are used. In certain embodiments one or more trochlear bone cut facets can be curvilinear.

In a traditional femoral implant component the posterior bone cut includes portions on the medial and lateral condyles that are in the same plane and parallel to each other and substantially parallel to the anterior cut. However in certain embodiments described herein the implant component can include posterior condylar bone cut facets on the medial and lateral condyles respectively that are non coplanar . Alternatively or additionally the implant component can include one or more posterior condylar facets that are substantially non parallel with one or more facts of the anterior bone cut.

In certain preferred embodiments the posterior condylar bone cut includes a facet on the medial condyle that is substantially perpendicular to the long axis of the medial condyle. Optionally the facet on the lateral condyle can be perpendicular to the long axis of the lateral condyle. As depicted in in certain embodiments the anterior bone cut and corresponding resection cut and posterior bone cut can be substantially non parallel to the coronal plane in the superoinferior orientation.

In certain embodiments the posterior bone cut medial and lateral facets of an implant component can be asymmetric with respect to an A P plane bisecting the implant component. Moreover one or more posterior bone cut facets can be curvilinear.

In certain embodiments the distal bone cut of a femoral implant component includes medial and lateral condylar facets that are in the same plane as each other and or are substantially parallel to each other. The facets can be separated by the intercondylar space and or by a step cut. In certain embodiments the implant component can include a distal bone cut having medial and lateral condylar facets that are non coplanar and or non parallel.

In certain embodiments the distal bone cut or bone cut facets is are asymmetric with respect to an A P plane bisecting the implant component. Moreover the distal bone cut and or one or more distal bone cut facets can be curvilinear.

Traditional femoral implant components include one anterior chamfer bone cut and one posterior chamfer bone cut. However in certain embodiments described herein additional chamfer bone cuts can be included. By increasing the number of chamfer bone cuts on the implant and placing the cuts in close proximity to the tangent of the articular surface additional bone can be preserved. One or more additional chamfer bone cuts can be substantially tangent to the articular surface. For example in certain embodiments the implant component can include one or more additional anterior chamfer cuts and or one or more additional posterior chamfer cuts.

In certain embodiments the implant component can include a posterior chamfer bone cut that includes medial and lateral condylar facets that are non coplanar and or non parallel. In certain embodiments a posterior chamfer bone cut of the implant component can include facets that are asymmetric with respect to an A P plane bisecting the implant component. Moreover one or more posterior chamfer bone cuts and or one or more posterior chamfer bone cut facets can be curvilinear.

In certain embodiments the implant component can include an anterior chamfer bone cut that includes medial and lateral condylar facets that are non coplanar and or non parallel. In certain embodiments an anterior chamfer bone cut of the implant component can be asymmetric and or can include facets that are asymmetric with respect to an anterior posterior A P plane bisecting the implant component. Moreover one or more anterior chamfer bone cuts and or bone cut facets can be curvilinear.

In certain embodiments the cut plane for one or more bone cuts of the implant component for example the distal bone cut and or one or more of the anterior chamfer bone cuts can be defined in part by the extent of the trochlear gap in the patient s joint. Specifically one or more of these bone cuts can be designed based on patient specific data to include a perimeter that matches the contour of the patient s trochlear notch. In certain embodiments the implant component is patient adapted so that there is no exposed implant surface on the bone facing side of the implant component at the trochlear gap. Moreover one or more of these bone cuts can be designed so that there is no or minimally exposed resected bone surface at the trochlear notch.

Computer software can be used that calculates the closest location possible for resected surfaces and resected cuts relative to the articular surface of the uncut bone e.g. so that all intersects of adjoining resected surfaces are just within the bone rather than outside the articular surface. The software can move the cuts progressively closer to the articular surface. When all intersects of the resected cuts reach the endosteal bone level the subchondral bone level and or an established threshold implant thickness the maximum exterior placement of the resected surfaces is achieved and with that the maximum amount of bone preservation.

In addition to the implant component features described above certain embodiments can include features and designs for cruciate substitution. These features and designs can include for example an intercondylar housing sometimes referred to as a box as shown in and or one or more intercondylar bars as shown in as a receptacle for a tibial post or projection. The intercondylar housing receptacle and or bars can be used in conjunction with a projection or post on a tibial component as a substitute for a patient s posterior cruciate ligament PCL which may be sacrificed during the implant procedure. Specifically as shown in the intercondylar housing receptacle or bars engage the projection or post on the tibial component to stabilize the joint during flexion particular during high flexion.

In certain embodiments the femoral implant component can be designed and manufactured to include the housing receptacle and or bars as a permanently integrated feature of the implant component. However in certain embodiments the housing receptacle and or bars can be modular. For example the housing receptacle and or bars can be designed and or manufactured separate from the femoral implant component and optionally joined with the component either prior to e.g. preoperatively or during the implant procedure. Methods for joining the modular intercondylar housing to an implant component are described in the art for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 950 298. As shown in modular bars and or a modular box can be joined to an implant component at the option of the surgeon or practitioner for example using spring loaded pins at one or both ends of the modular bars. The spring loaded pins can slideably engage corresponding holes or depressions in the femoral implant component.

The portion of the femoral component that will accommodate the housing receptacle or bar can be standard i.e. not patient matched. In this manner a stock of housings receptacles or bars can be available in the operating room and added in case the surgeon sacrifices the PCL. In that case the tibial insert can be exchanged for a tibial insert with a post mating with the housing receptacle or bar for a posterior stabilized design.

The intercondylar housing receptacle and or one or more intercondylar bars can include features that are patient adapted e.g. patient specific or patient engineered . In certain embodiments the intercondylar housing receptacle and or one or more intercondylar bars includes one or more features that are designed and or selected preoperatively based on patient specific data including imaging data to substantially match one or more of the patient s biological features. For example the intercondylar distance of the housing or bar can be designed and or selected to be patient specific. Alternatively or in addition one or more features of the intercondylar housing and or one or more intercondylar bars can be engineered based on patient specific data to provide to the patient an optimized fit with respect to one or more parameters. For example the material thickness of the housing or bar can be designed and or selected to be patient engineered. One or more thicknesses of the housing receptacle or bar can be matched to patient specific measurements. One or more thicknesses of the housing receptacle and or bar can be adapted based on one or more implant dimensions which can be patient specific patient engineered or standard. One or more thicknesses of the housing receptacle or bar can be adapted based on one or more of patient weight height sex and body mass index. In addition one or more features of the housing and or bars can be standard.

Different dimensions of the housing receptacle or bar can be shaped adapted or selected based on different patient dimensions and implant dimensions. Examples of different technical implementations are provided in Table 11. These examples are in no way meant to be limiting. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means of shaping adapting or selecting a housing receptacle or bar based on the patient s geometry including imaging data.

The height or M L width or A P length of the intercondylar notch can not only influence the length but also the position or orientation of a bar or the condylar walls.

The dimensions of the housing receptacle or bar can be shaped adapted or selected not only based on different patient dimensions and implant dimensions but also based on the intended implantation technique for example intended femoral component flexion or rotation. For example at least one of an anteroposterior length or superoinferior height can be adjusted if an implant is intended to be implanted in 7 degrees flexion as compared to 0 degrees flexion reflecting the relative change in patient or trochlear or intercondylar notch or femoral geometry when the femoral component is implanted in flexion.

In another example the mediolateral width can be adjusted if an implant is intended to be implanted in internal or external rotation reflecting for example an effective elongation of the intercondylar dimensions when a rotated implantation approach is chosen. The housing receptacle or bar can include oblique or curved surfaces typically reflecting an obliquity or curvature of the patient s anatomy. For example the superior portion of the housing receptacle or bar can be curved reflecting the curvature of the intercondylar roof. In another example at least one side wall of the housing or receptacle can be oblique reflecting an obliquity of one or more condylar walls.

The internal shape of the housing receptacle or bar can include one or more planar surfaces that are substantially parallel or perpendicular to one or more anatomical or biomechanical axes or planes. The internal shape of the housing receptacle or bar can include one or more planar surfaces that are oblique in one or two or three dimensions. The internal shape of the housing receptacle or bar can include one or more curved surfaces that are curved in one or two or three dimensions. The obliquity or curvature can be adapted based on at least one of a patient dimension e.g. a femoral notch dimension or shape or other femoral shape including condyle shape or a tibial projection or post dimension. The internal surface can be determined based on generic or patient derived or patient desired or implant desired kinematics in one two three or more dimensions. The internal surface can mate with a substantially straight tibial projection or post e.g. in the ML plane. Alternatively the tibial post or projection can have a curvature or obliquity in one two or three dimensions which can optionally be at least in part reflected in the internal shape of the box. One or more tibial projection or post dimensions can be matched to designed to adapted to or selected based on one or more patient dimensions or measurements. Any combination of planar and curved surfaces is possible.

In certain embodiments the position and or dimensions of the tibial plateau projection or post can be adapted based on patient specific dimensions. For example the post can be matched with the position of the posterior cruciate ligament or the PCL insertion. It can be placed at a predefined distance from anterior or posterior cruciate ligament or ligament insertion from the medial or lateral tibial spines or other bony or cartilaginous landmarks or sites. By matching the position of the post with the patient s anatomy it is possible to achieve a better functional result better replicating the patient s original anatomy.

Similarly the position of the box or receptacle or bar on the femoral component can be designed adapted or selected to be close to the PCL origin or insertion or at a predetermined distance to the PCL or ACL origin or insertion or other bony or anatomical landmark. The orientation of the box or receptacle or bar can be designed or adapted or selected based on the patient s anatomy e.g. notch width or ACL or PCL location or ACL or PCL origin or insertion.

Femoral implant components of certain embodiments also can include other features that are patient specific and or optimized according to one or more of the parameters discussed above.

A variety of peg configurations can be used for the implant components described herein femoral implant components as well as other implant components . Exemplary configurations are illustrated in . In certain embodiments the peg cross section can be round. In certain embodiments as illustrated in the peg cross section can include a or cross like configuration which may aid in manufacturing. For example in layering processes used to create a casting blank such as stereolithography SLA selective laser sintering SLS or fused deposition modeling FDM generating or building the curved edges of a blank typically is more difficult than that of the straight edges of a blank. Accordingly the straight edges of the configured peg may allow for a simpler and better defined blank used in the casting process as compared to a round peg.

A variety of peg sizes can be used for a bicompartmental implant or implant component. For example a 5 mm peg a 6 mm peg a 7 mm peg or another peg size can be used. The peg can reflect a variety of configurations for example a configured peg can be used. The peg can be oriented on the device at any angle. For example one or more pegs can be oriented in line with the femoral mechanical axis. Alternatively one or more pegs can be oriented at an anterior leaning angle as the peg extends from the implant. For example one or more pegs can be oriented anteriorly 5 degrees 5 10 degrees 10 degrees 10 15 degrees and or 15 degrees in an anterior leaning angle relative to the femoral mechanism axis. The pegs can be oriented at the same angle or at different angles as one or both of the anterior and posterior cuts of the implant component. Pegs on a single implant component can have different diameters lengths or other features in accordance with independently designed portions of the implant component.

The design of a bone cement pocket or pockets of an implant component also may include features that are patient specific and or optimized according to one or more of the parameters discussed above. show bone cement pockets in a component of certain embodiments and in a traditional component . As shown in each section or facet of the bone facing surface of the component can have an independent cement pocket. One or more of the cement pockets can be offset from the periphery by 2 mm or more. Each pocket can have a maximum depth of less than 0.9 mm for example 0.5 mm or less.

A preferred embodiment of the femoral implant component and resection cuts is illustrated in . As shown the distal resection cuts are symmetric with less bone resected from the lateral posterior resection cut . These features are matched on the inner bone facing surface of the implant. As shown in the anterior surface of the implant component includes a unique superior edge . As shown the superior edge includes lateral and medial superior curvatures with a trough in between. The lateral superior curvature is higher e.g. more superior to the medial superior curvature and is about 2 higher relative to the lowest point in the trough between them. As shown in the trochlear peaks of the implant are lower than the patient s natural trochlear peaks and an 18 mm intercondylar distance is used with the implant component. To achieve this intercondylar distance the lateral condyle of the implant is slightly medialized relative to the patient s lateral condyle and intercondylar notch coverage is increased relative to the patient s intercondylar notch. illustrate the implant component from the opposite direction to show the notch roof with slightly overhanging coverage on the lateral intercondylar and the slightly medialized lateral condyle resulting in exposed bone facing surface on the medial side of the implant s lateral condyle .

The resection cuts to the patient s bone that correspond to and optionally match one or more selected and or designed bone cuts on the bone facing surface of the implant component can be achieved using a patient adapted guide tool. For example show a cutting guide tool that includes slots for distal cuts to the distal surface of the lateral condyle and to the distal surface of the medial condyle respectively. As shown the cutting guide slots are asymmetric with respect to a sagittal plane or to an axial plane . In certain embodiments the asymmetric cutting guide slots provide asymmetric resection cut facets that match one or more asymmetric bone cut facets on the bone surface surface of an implant component. The cutting guide slots resulting resection cut facets and or bone cut facets can be selected and or designed to meet or optimize one or more parameters for example bone preservation kinematics and or one or more other parameters described herein. As shown the cutting guide tool in provides a guide for cutting asymmetric distal resection cut facets optionally to produce resection surfaces that substantially match corresponding distal bone cut facets on the implant component. One or more guide tools can alternatively or additionally provide asymmetric anterior cut facets asymmetric posterior cut facets one or more asymmetric corresponding anterior chamfer cut facets and or one or more asymmetric corresponding posterior chamfer cut facets.

In certain embodiments a cutting guide tool also can include a patient specific bone facing surface that substantially matches an uncut femoral surface of a particular or single patient. Alternatively or in addition the cutting guide tool can include one or two pegs projecting from the bone facing surface that fit into holes previously drilled into the patient s femoral surface. In certain embodiments the selected and or designed peg placement can be patient adapted. For example in certain embodiments peg holes initially can be drilled into the patient s femur e.g. distal femur in an initial step and then one or more cutting guide tools and or an implant component can include pegs that fit into the peg holes. In such embodiments since the cutting guide slots resection cuts and or implant component fit are oriented based on the position of the peg holes it can be important to accurately position the peg holes for example in accordance with the selected and or designed implant component and resection cut strategy.

In certain embodiments the number angle orientation and or other feature of any one or more of the distal anterior posterior anterior chamfer and or posterior chamfer bone cuts cut facets and or corresponding resection cuts and cut facets can be selected and or designed for a single particular patient for example based on preoperatively obtained patient specific data such as image data and optionally determination of one or more desired parameter thresholds such as maximum bone preservation and or enhanced or restored kinematics.

As indicated above in certain embodiments the implant component can include one or more distal posterior and or posterior chamfer bone cuts that include medial and lateral condylar facets that are asymmetric e.g. non coplanar non parallel and or dissimilar in surface profile shape for example with respect to an A P plane M L plane or axial plane bisecting the bone cut. In addition or alternatively in certain embodiments one or more single facets of a cut can be asymmetric for example asymmetric with respect to an A P plane or M L plane bisecting that facet.

Accordingly in certain embodiments the implant component can include a posterior bone cut having facets that are asymmetric e.g. non coplanar non parallel and or dissimilar in surface profile shape for example with respect to an A P plane M L plane or axial plane bisecting the bone cut.

Any one or more resection cuts can be selected and or designed to substantially match one or more of the corresponding bone cuts on the implant. illustrates a cutting guide tool that provides a lateral posterior cutting guide slot and a medial posterior cutting guide slot among other cutting guide slots. As shown the lateral and medial posterior cutting guide slots are asymmetric to provide asymmetric resection cuts which correspond to matching asymmetric posterior bone cut facets on the inner bone facing surface of the implant component. In particular the medial slot is posterior to the lateral slot which provides for increased bone preservation for example on the medial condyle as compared to a parallel cut across both condyles at the height of the lateral cut slot . Moreover as shown in the figure the curvature profile on the lateral posterior edge and medial posterior edge of the cutting guide tool can be designed to substantially match the profile of the underlying edge of the particular patient s respective condyles e.g. in an axial view . This feature can allow the surgeon to confirm proper placement of the tool prior to performing resection cuts facilitated by that tool.

As shown by the lateral and medial cut slots in cut slots can be both asymmetric and equivalent in size. In certain embodiments a guide tool also can include one or more cutting guide slot inserts for example a metal insert that is placed into the cutting slot prior to resection. A cutting guide tool having asymmetric and or patient specific cutting guide slots of equivalent sizes can include one or more standard inserts that are interchangeable between the equivalently sized cutting guide slots. For example the same insert can be used for slots and in even though these slots are asymmetric and have patient adapted orientations. Accordingly in certain embodiments a patient specific cutting guide tool can include a cutting slot on the cutting guide comprising a patient adapted orientation angle or slope and a metal cutting guide insert for the cutting guide slot that is placed into the cutting slot prior to resection. The cutting guide insert can be a standard shape that can be fit into any one or more cutting guide slots having equivalent size even if the slots are patient adapted e.g. in orientation angle or slope .

In a traditional patellar implant procedure the articular surface i.e. the bearing surface and or joint facing surface of a patient s patella can be resected typically using a bone cut across the patella and a patellar implant component having standard dimensions can be mounted to the resected surface of the remaining portion of the patient s patella. The patella implant components have off the shelf standard dimensions and are typically selected intraoperatively.

In certain embodiments an imaging test such as x ray imaging digital tomosynthesis cone beam CT a CT scan including a spiral CT scan MRI scan including 3D acquisitions ultrasound scan laser scan optical coherence tomography or combinations thereof can be used to define the shape or geometry of a patient s patella and optionally one or more other biological or kinematic features. The scan data can be utilized to measure or derive information on the shape or geometry of the patient s patella. For example a superoinferior or mediolateral or oblique dimension or an anteroposterior width can be measured. One or more patellar axes can be determined e.g. a sagittal axis coronal axis axial axis a tracking axis one or more axes describing patellar motion in relationship to the trochlea e.g. mediolateral or superoinferior or oblique as well as select femoral axes e.g. a posterior condylar axis epicondylar axis Whiteside s line a mechanical axis and or one more other axes. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other patellar and axis related measurements that can be obtained. In principal any anatomic or functional measurement applicable to a patellar geometry or function and kinematics can be obtained or derived. Once one or more geometric functional and kinematic measurements have been obtained or derived the information can be utilized to select or design a patellar implant or component that is best suited for a particular patient.

For example an AP dimension of the patella can be measured and a patellar implant or component best matching the AP dimension can be selected and or designed. The selection or design can be adapted based on an intended resection depth. An ML dimension of a patellar implant or component can be measured and a patellar implant or component best matching the ML dimension can be selected or designed. The selection or design can be adapted based on an intended resection depth. The AP measurement or ML measurement or any other measurement can be adapted or derived for a preferred resection depth or cut depth. Resection for placing the patellar implant or component can be achieved with any technique known in the art such as sawing burring drilling and or other known techniques.

For example in certain embodiments the patellar implant or implant component can be selected and or designed so that it is substantially matches one or more AP or ML or oblique or other dimensions in at least a portion of the uncut patella and or in at least a portion of the patella resection profile. Alternatively or in addition the patellar implant or component can be selected and or designed so that it is smaller than one or more of the AP or ML or oblique or other dimensions in at least a portion of the uncut patella and or in at least a portion of the patella resection profile. For example in one or more select dimensions the patellar implant or component can be selected and or designed to be less than 5 10 15 20 or other percentage relative to the patellar profile or resected patellar profile for a given resection depth. The patellar implant can be selected and or designed to achieve a desired fit in one or more of those dimensions or other dimensions so that the fit is applicable to two or more resection depths. In this manner the surgeon has the ability to change his resection depth intraoperatively while for example still avoiding implant overhang.

A patellar implant also can be selected or designed for example based on the patient s original patellar surface shape. For example if the patellar has a dome shape a substantially dome shaped implant or component can be selected or designed. If the patella has a relatively flat shape a more flat implant or component can be selected or designed. If the patella has a relatively spherical shape a more spherical implant or component can be selected or designed. The patellar implant or component can be round or elliptical. Other shapes are possible. The patellar implant or component can be longer laterally than medially. The lateral and medial lengths can be matched to the native patella. Alternatively the lateral or medial lengths can be matched to the patient s trochlea. Alternatively the lateral or medial lengths can be matched to the trochlear implant dimensions which can be patient adapted or standard off the shelf. In this embodiment a patellar shape can be selected or designed that closely mimics the patient s original patellar shape for example by following at least in part the shape or contour of the cartilage or subchondral bone or portions thereof for example in a median ridge lateral facet medial facet trochlea trochlear groove and or in one or more other dimensions. In instances when the patella has been distorted in shape by arthritic deformity the patient s original patellar shape can be derived or estimated based on patient specific data for example based on data regarding the patient s surrounding or contralateral biological features and or on data regarding the patient s distorted biological features. Mathematical computations can be performed using the data to estimate or derive an approximate shape. Such mathematical computations can use for example patella dimensions trochlear dimensions or femoral dimensions to estimate the original or a preferred patellar shape. Any of these dimensions can be matched to a reference database of normal individuals to select a trochlear or patellar shape for any of the implant components. The database can be age matched gender matched weight matched race matched and or matched with respect to one or more other features known in the art.

The patellar implant or component shape can optionally also be selected and or designed based on the patient s trochlear shape or based on the shape of the trochlear implant profile e.g. of a total knee implant.

The patellar implant or component can be selected based on a single measured or derived parameter. Alternatively the patellar implant or component can be selected based on multiple parameters e.g. AP and ML dimensions or AP ML and oblique dimensions or AP ML and oblique dimensions and desired resection depth or AP ML and oblique dimensions and or desired resection depth and or trochlear shape or trochlear implant shape. A weighting can be applied to different parameters. Mathematical or statistical models can be applied for deriving the preferred patellar shape and for designing or selecting an implant based on a multiparametric fit or optimization. These fits or optimization can include kinematic modeling estimations and measurements.

The resection depth determination can be based on the desired thickness of the patellar implant or patellar component. For example the resection depth can be at a distance from the native articulating surface patellar cartilage or subchondral bone that is substantially equal to the thickness of the patellar implant or component. In another embodiment for example if a femoral component is chosen that removes more of the patient s trochlear bone and that has for example a femoral component trochlear articulating surface that is posterior to the patient s uncut trochlea the patellar resection depth may be further posterior i.e. less bone is removed from the articulating surface the patellar implant or component to extend the patellar implant further toward the femur than the native patella. In this instance the patellar resection depth can be derived using the following exemplary approach 

The above embodiments are applicable to patellar implants or components that are designed or derived for a particular patient as well as to implants that are pre manufactured and selected based on one or more measurements.

The patellar component can be made of a plastic e.g. a polyethylene a metal or ceramic. The patellar component can for example include a metal backing. The patellar implant can be cemented or uncemented. The patellar implant component can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. It can be spherical or aspherical. The patellar implant component can include symmetric portions and asymmetric portions. For example the patellar implant component can be symmetric in the AP dimension and asymmetric in the ML dimension. The patellar implant component can be round or elliptical. Other shapes are possible. The patellar implant or component can be longer laterally than medially.

In certain embodiments a patella implant or implant component having one or more patient specific features is included. In addition or alternatively certain embodiments include for example a patella implant or implant component having one or more features that are patient optimized i.e patient engineered e.g. designed based on patient specific data to enhance one or more parameters such as 1 deformity correction and limb alignment 2 preserving bone cartilage or ligaments 3 preserving and or optimizing features of the patient s anatomy such as patella trochlea and trochlear shape 4 restoring and or optimizing joint kinematics or biomechanics including patellofemoral tracking and or 5 restoring or optimizing joint line location and or joint gap width. For example a patella implant or implant component feature can be patient optimized or patient engineered to enhance the kinematics between the patellar component and the femoral component. The patient specific and or patient optimized patellar implant features and dimensions described herein can be applied as appropriate to either a patellar implant that completely replaces a patient s patella or to a patellar implant that amounts to a resected surface of a patient s patella. Embodiments that include patient specific and or patient optimized aspects also can include one or more standard aspects for example a standard bearing surface.

In certain embodiments one or more features of a patellar implant or implant component are patient specific. For example certain embodiments of patellar implants can be directed to restoring or maintaining the patient s original patella thickness in one or more locations which can help to preserve bone and restore patella femoral P F kinematics for example by restoring the patient s P F joint line. Accordingly in certain embodiments the thickness of the patella implant substantially positively matches the thickness of the patient s patella in one or more locations. Patient specific images of the patient s joint for example from a CT or MRI scan can be used for this purpose. The scan can be obtained preoperatively to determine the patient s patellar thickness including at least one of bone and articular cartilage or combinations thereof in different locations of the patella e.g. the superior dome superior third mid portion inferior third inferior tip lateral third central third and medial third.

In certain embodiments patellar implants can be directed to maintaining the patient s patella surface e.g. articulating surface in one or more locations. Accordingly in certain embodiments the surface of the patella implant substantially positively matches the surface of the patient s patella e.g. cartilage or subchondral bone in one or more locations. Certain embodiments of patellar implants can be directed to maintaining the patient s patella perimeter in one or more planes. Accordingly in certain embodiments the perimeter of the patella implant substantially positively matches the uncut or cut perimeter of the patient s patella in one or more planes e.g. for one or more resection depths. Thus the implant can be selected or designed to achieve a desired fit or match with the uncut or cut perimeter in one or more dimensions. Certain embodiments of patellar implants can be directed to maintaining the patient s patella volume. Accordingly in certain embodiments the volume of the patella implant substantially positively matches the volume of the patient s patella. By matching the patellar dimensions or volume patellar overstuffing or understuffing can optionally be avoided. The volume can be adapted by adding or subtracting based on the shape of the opposing trochlear component. For example if a trochlear component extends anterior to the patient s native bone the shape of the patellar component can be adapted so that the volume or dimensions are decreased to account for the anterior extension of the trochlear component. If the trochlear component rests posterior to the native trochlear bone for example with use of an anterior trochlear bone cut the shape of the patellar components can be adapted so that the volume or dimensions are increased to account for the more posterior location of at least portions of the trochlear components. Any of these embodiments can include one or more patient specific aspects patient engineered aspects and or standard aspects.

In certain embodiments one or more aspects of a patella implant include one or more patient optimized features for example to optimally engage an engineered or a patient derived trochlear groove of a femoral implant component. In certain embodiments a patella implant component can include a joint facing surface that is not derived from a sphere. For example in certain embodiments the joint facing surface of a patella implant can be derived from a prolate spheroid shape i.e. an elongated shape like a football or lemon for example the prolate spheroid cut longitudinally as shown in . For example the top side of the patella implant can be lemon shaped such that it has a differing medial lateral versus vertical radius. This design can allow for a reduced thickness of the leading edges of the implant during flexion extension. In certain embodiments the apex of a dome shaped or prolate shaped outer joint surface topography is lateralized relative to apex of the patient s patella. For example the patellar implant optionally can be lateralized 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm 5 mm 1 5 mm and or 2 4 mm lateralized. A patella component designed in this way can be used to address poor ML and or AP fit of traditional designs and or restore the patient s normal patella topography. In addition or alternatively the thickness of the patella implant can be less than about 13 mm less than about 12 mm less than about 11 mm less than about 10 mm less than 9 mm less than about 8.5 mm about 8 mm less than about 8 mm about 7 mm and or less than 7 mm. Further aspects of embodiments of patella implant components are shown in . For example depicts a patellar implant component e.g. in an axial plane having a sombrero shaped profile for its surface that articulates with the trochlea. As shown the peak of the articulating surface is offset about 2 mm laterally however the peak can be offset laterally or medially less than about 2 mm e.g. about 0.5 to 2 mm or greater than about 2 mm e.g. about 2 to 6 mm or about 2 to 4 mm or about 2 to 3 mm . The implant component shown in includes a resection coverage having an elliptical shape and is more similar to a typical anatomical patella as compared to the dome shaped patella shown in . depicts a patellar implant component e.g. in an axial plane having a dome shaped profile for its surface that articulates with the trochlea and includes a resection coverage having an elliptical shape. This dome shaped patellar implant component has enhanced congruence and therefore lower stress and it can tilt and roll easily in the trochlear groove i.e. is less constrained . Additional details about embodiments of patellar implant components are shown with reference to . For example in certain embodiments the peak of the dome or other shaped patellar implant component can be offset laterally or medially by for example 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm or more. The dome can be symmetric or asymmetric. The shape of the component perimeter that engages the trochlea can be circular or elongated like the 2D shape of a football or lemon. The edge between the trochlea engaging surface and the patella engaging surface can be a uniform thickness or a non uniform thickness. For example the edge can be thinner on one or both of the proximal and distal edges e.g. in the direction of motion and wider on the medial and or lateral sides. Exemplary sizes heights and edge thicknesses are described in the table in . Any of the foregoing is applicable to off the shelf implants that are for example selected using one or more parameters that are measured or derived from an imaging study or to implants that are designed for a particular patient.

Certain embodiments are directed to designing selecting and or making a patellar implant having one or more patient specific and or patient optimized aspects. For example a procedure can include one or more steps of a determining a patellar resection depth b determining the perimeter shape of the resected surface and c selecting designing and or making an implant that substantially positively matches in one or more locations one or both of the resection depth from a and the perimeter shape from b . One or more of these steps can be performed preoperatively. The steps optionally can be varied in sequence. For example a patellar implant thickness can be selected first then a resection depth is selected then optionally the perimeter of the implant can be cut or machined or altered to match the patellar perimeter in one or more dimensions at the selected resection depth. Alternatively a procedure can include one or more steps of a preoperatively determining a patellar resection depth for example based on a trochlear component location and or a desired patellar implant thickness and or shape b preoperatively determining the perimeter shape of the resected surface c optionally selecting a blank implant having a height that substantially positively matches in one or more locations the resection depth from a and having a standard perimeter and d making e.g. machining cutting etc. the perimeter for the blank selected in step c to substantially positively match the resected surface determined in step a wherein said match can be in one or more dimensions and wherein said match can be a partial or near complete match. One or more of these steps can be performed preoperatively.

The blank can have different basic features for example a dome shaped articular surface a sombrero shaped articular surface symmetrically or asymmetrically shaped features spherical or elliptical features and or one or more additional basic features as described above or known in the art. The step of selecting the blank can also account for the resultant peripheral or margin thickness of the blank once it is cut for a given perimeter or a given AP or ML dimension at a desired resection depth. Thus for example a blank can be selected so that once it is cut the resultant margin thickness does not fall below a desired minimum material thickness and does not exceed a desired maximal material thickness. Thus the steps of selecting a blank and cutting that blank can include not only adaptations relative to one or more parameters such as a patient s native anatomy and or dimensions or kinematics a resection depth an implant or component thickness a trochlear shape but also a desired minimal and maximal implant thickness in the periphery. Alternatively a procedure can include one or more steps of a preoperatively determining a patellar resection depth for example based on a trochlear component location and or a desired patellar implant thickness and or shape b preoperatively determining the perimeter shape of the resected surface c optionally designing an implant having a height that substantially positively matches in one or more locations the resection depth and d making e.g. machining cutting printing injection molding etc. the implant designed in step c to substantially positively match the resected surface determined in step a wherein said match can be in one or more dimensions and wherein said match can be a partial or near complete match. One or more of these steps can be performed preoperatively. show flow charts of exemplary processes for optimizing selecting and or designing and optionally optimizing a patellar component based on one or more patient specific biological features.

In certain embodiments the step of a determining a patellar resection depth can be performed by determining minimal implant material thickness based on patient specific data. For example patient specific information such as one or more of weight activity level femur size femur implant aspects such as surface geometry e.g. trochlear geometry patellar size patellar bone decay femoral shape or geometry patellar and or trochlear and or femoral kinematics and other information can be used to determine a minimal implant material thickness appropriate for the patient. Alternatively or in addition the step of a determining a patellar resection depth can be determined based on the features of one or more resection cuts or other implant components selected for the patient which have patient specific features patient engineered or combinations thereof. Then the patella resection depth and the patella implant can be designed or selected to match this minimal material thickness. Alternatively once the implant minimal material thickness is determined a patella implant can be selected from a family of implants having variable thicknesses and the patellar resection depth is designed to match the thickness of the selected patellar implant. For example a family of patellar implants can include implants with thicknesses of two or more of 4 mm 6 mm 8 mm 10 mm 10.5 mm and 11 mm. illustrate this procedure.

In certain embodiments the step of designing selecting and or making e.g. cutting from a blank the implant perimeter to be substantially positively match the determined resected perimeter or a percentage thereof in one or more dimensions can include smoothing the line of the surface perimeter on the implant as illustrated in .

Accordingly certain embodiments are directed to patellar implants and procedures that include one or more of a a preoperatively selected minimal implant thickness based on patient specific information such as femoral geometry and patellar size b a preoperatively determined patellar resection depth that matches the selected minimal implant thickness and or trochlear component thickness and or external femoral component trochlea surface and c a perimeter on patellar bone facing surface of the implant that substantially positively matches the perimeter of the resected surface with optional smoothing of the implant perimeter. A significant advantage to having matching implant surface and resected surface perimeters is that it minimizes exposed resected bone and thereby minimizes bleeding clot formation and scar formation. Moreover it can result in more bone preservation and or improved kinematics.

In certain embodiments the patella uses an external shape that is standard. In this case the trochlea can also include a standard shape typically mating with said patellar shape.

In another embodiment the patellar shape can be standard. The trochlear shape on a patellofemoral replacement or a total knee system can be designed or selected to substantially match the patellar implant or component profile in mediolateral direction. The trochlear shape of a patellofemoral replacement or a total knee system can have a standard geometry in sagittal direction. Alternatively the sagittal geometry of the trochlear surface of the implant can be derived from or adapted to the patient s sagittal trochlear geometry.

The shape and or dimensions of the trochlea and the selection of a trochlear implant surface or the design of a trochlear implant surface can assist in the selection or design of a mating patellar implant and or implant surface. Alternatively the shape and or dimensions of a patella and selected or designed patellar implant can assist in the selection or design of a mating trochlear implant surface and or shape and or dimensions.

A multiparametric fit or optimization can be performed that includes for example trochlea shape and or dimensions patella fit and or dimensions patella implant component thickness at center and or rim patellar component shape patellar and or trochlear implant component shapes anterior femoral resection depth and patellar kinematics in order to select or design the optimal combination of patellar and trochlear implant surfaces or components.

As indicated above in certain embodiments an implant includes a patellar component a femoral component and optionally a tibial component. As depicted in one or more features on the femoral articular surface and or one or more features on the patellar articular surface can be selected and or designed based on one or more of the corresponding component features. For example one or more femoral component features such as trochlear surface contour trochlear groove width and or depth trochlear j curve sulcus dimension s mediolateral displacement of trochlear groove and or sulcus e.g. from anterior to posterior medial and or lateral condylar coronal curvature s along one or more surface sections e.g. the anterior surface section medial and or lateral condylar sagittal curvature s j curves along one or more sections e.g. the anterior surface section and or other features can be selected and or designed to include standard patient specific and or patient engineered dimensions. Then one or more of the patellar component features such as the articular surface contour thickness perimeter or rim profile AP distance ML distance oblique distance and other features can be selected and or designed based on one or more of those femoral component features. Conversely one or more femoral component features can be selected and or designed based on one or more of patellar component features.

For example the trochlear surface of the femoral component can include one or more patient specific features such as a patient specific trochlear j curve trochlear groove coronal curvature and the corresponding AP dimension s of the patellar component and or its articular surface can be selected and or designed to optimize kinematic fit with the trochlear j curve. Alternatively or in addition the trochlear surface of the femoral component can include one or more patient engineered i.e. patient optimized features such as the trochlear coronal profile and the ML dimension of the patellar component and or its articular surface can be selected and or designed to optimize kinematic fit with the engineered trochlear coronal profile.

In various embodiments described herein one or more features of a tibial implant component are designed and or selected optionally in conjunction with an implant procedure so that the tibial implant component fits the patient. For example in certain embodiments one or more features of a tibial implant component and or implant procedure are designed and or selected based on patient specific data so that the tibial implant component substantially matches e.g. substantially negatively matches and or substantially positively matches one or more of the patient s biological structures. Alternatively or in addition one or more features of a tibial implant component and or implant procedure can be preoperatively engineered based on patient specific data to provide to the patient an optimized fit with respect to one or more parameters for example one or more of the parameters described above. For example in certain embodiments an engineered bone preserving tibial implant component can be designed and or selected based on one or more of the patient s joint dimensions as seen for example on a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation generated for example from a CT scan or MRI scan. Alternatively or in addition an engineered tibial implant component can be designed and or selected at least in part to provide to the patient an optimized fit with respect to the engaging joint facing surface of a corresponding femoral implant component.

Certain embodiments include a tibial implant component guide tool and or resection cut strategy having one or more patient adapted e.g. patient specific or patient engineered features and optionally one or more standard features. Optionally the one or more patient adapted features can be designed and or selected to fit the patient s resected tibial surface. For example depending on the patient s anatomy and desired postoperative geometry or alignment a patient s lateral and or medial tibial plateaus may be resected independently and or at different depths for example so that the resected surface of the lateral plateau is higher e.g. 1 mm greater than 1 mm 2 mm and or greater than 2 mm higher or lower e.g. 1 mm greater than 1 mm 2 mm and or greater than 2 mm lower than the resected surface of the medial tibial plateau.

Accordingly in certain embodiments tibial implant components can be independently designed and or selected for each of the lateral and or medial tibial plateaus. For example the perimeter of a lateral tibial implant component and the perimeter of a medial tibial implant component can be independently designed and or selected to substantially match the perimeter of the resection surfaces for each of the lateral and medial tibial plateaus. show exemplary unicompartmental medial and lateral tibial implant components without and with a polyethylene layer or insert. As shown the lateral tibial implant component and the medial tibial implant component have different perimeters shapes each of which substantially matches the perimeter of the corresponding resection surface see arrows . In addition the polyethylene layers or inserts for the lateral tibial implant component and the medial tibial implant component have perimeter shapes that correspond to the respective implant component perimeter shapes. In certain embodiments one or both of the implant components can be made entirely of a plastic or polyethylene rather than having a having a polyethylene layer or insert and each entire implant component can include a perimeter shape that substantially matches the perimeter of the corresponding resection surface.

Moreover the height of a lateral tibial implant component and the height of a medial tibial implant component can be independently designed and or selected to maintain or alter the relative heights generated by different resection surfaces for each of the lateral and medial tibial plateaus. For example the lateral tibial implant component can be thicker e.g. 1 mm greater than 1 mm 2 mm and or greater than 2 mm thicker or thinner e.g. 1 mm greater than 1 mm 2 mm and or greater than 2 mm thinner than the medial tibial implant component to maintain or alter as desired the relative height of the joint facing surface of each of the lateral and medial tibial implant components. As shown in and the relative heights of the lateral and medial resection surfaces is maintained using lateral and medial implant components and lateral and medial polyethylene layers or inserts that have the same thickness. Alternatively the lateral implant component and or the lateral polyethylene layer or insert can have a different thickness than the medial implant component and or the medial polyethylene layer or insert . For embodiments having one or both of the lateral and medial implant components made entirely of a plastic or polyethylene rather than having a having a polyethylene layer or insert the thickness of one implant component can be different from the thickness of the other implant component.

The medial and lateral unicompartmental tibial component can optionally have the same thickness including composite thickness but can be implanted at different resection heights. The resection height can be selected as the thickness of the component moved inferiorly for example in reference from the medial tibial plateau for the medial side and moved inferiorly for example in reference from the lateral tibial plateau for the lateral side. In this manner the prosthesis can respect or substantially replicate not only the medial but also the lateral location of the joint space preoperatively. Similarly a single metal backing tibial component can be designed to allow for a medial and a lateral tibial cut that are at different heights in order to replicate the natural medial and or lateral joint space in particular when inserts of the same thickness are used. A vertical or oblique connecting cut can then be used from the medial to the lateral side.

Different medial and lateral tibial cut heights also can be applied with a one piece implant component e.g. a monolithically formed tibial implant component. In this case the tibial implant component and the corresponding resected surface of the patient s femur can have an angled surface or a step cut connecting the medial and the lateral surface facets. For example depict three different types of step cuts separating medial and lateral resection cut facets on a patient s proximal tibia. In certain embodiments the bone facing surface of the tibial implant component is selected and or designed to match these surface depths and the step cut angle as well as other optional features such as perimeter shape. The height of the medial and or lateral tibial implant component plateau e.g. metal only ceramic only metal backed with polyethylene or other insert with single or dual inserts and single or dual tray configurations can be determined based on the patient s tibial shape for example using an imaging test.

Alternatively the height of the medial and or lateral tibial component plateau e.g. metal only ceramic only metal backed with polyethylene or other insert with single or dual inserts and single or dual tray configurations can be determined based on the patient s femoral shape or based on the shape of a corresponding implant component for example based on the shape of certain features of the patient s femoral implant component. The perimeter of the tibial component metal backed optionally poly inserts or all plastic or other material can be matched to or derived from the patient s tibial shape and can be optimized for different cut heights and or tibial slopes. In a preferred embodiment the shape is matched to the cortical bone of the cut surface. The surface topography of the tibial bearing surface can be designed or selected to match or reflect at least a portion of the tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. a sagittal plane or a coronal plane or both. The medial tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the medial tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal. The lateral tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the lateral tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal. The medial tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the lateral tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal. The lateral tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the medial tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal.

The medial and the lateral tibial plateau can also be cut with different slopes for single and dual medial and separately lateral components. The slopes can for example reflect the medial slope preoperatively on the medial side the lateral slope preoperatively on the lateral side or combinations thereof or one of a medial or one of a lateral slope applied to the contralateral side using a form of offset or mathematical function to modify the slope. Similarly a single metal backing tibial component can be designed to allow for a medial and a lateral tibial cut that different slopes in order to replicate the natural medial and or lateral slope. A vertical or oblique connecting cut can then be used from the medial to the lateral side.

In certain embodiments the medial tibial plateau facet can be oriented at an angle different than the lateral tibial plateau facet or it can be oriented at the same angle. One or both of the medial and the lateral tibial plateau facets can be at an angle that is patient specific for example similar to the original slope or slopes of the medial and or lateral tibial plateaus for example in the sagittal plane. Moreover the medial slope can be patient specific while the lateral slope is fixed or preset or vice versa as exemplified in Table 13.

The exemplary combinations described in Table 13 are applicable to implants that use two unicompartmental tibial implant components with or without metal backing one medial and one lateral. They also can be applicable to implant systems that use a single tibial implant component including all plastic designs or metal backed designs with inserts optionally a single insert for the medial and lateral plateau or two inserts e.g. one medial and one lateral for example PCL retaining posterior stabilized or ACL and PCL retaining implant components. The slope preferably is between 0 and 7 degrees but other embodiments with other slope angles outside that range can be used. The slope can vary across one or both tibial facets from anterior to posterior. For example a lesser slope e.g. 0 1 degrees can be used anteriorly and a greater slope can be used posteriorly for example 4 5 degrees. Variable slopes across at least one of a medial or a lateral tibial facet can be accomplished for example with use of burrs for example guided by a robot or with use of two or more bone cuts on at least one of the tibial facets. In certain embodiments two separate slopes can be used medially and laterally. Independent tibial slope designs can be useful for achieving bone preservation. In addition independent slope designs can be advantageous in achieving implant kinematics that will be more natural closer to the performance of a normal knee or the patient s knee.

In certain embodiments the slope can be fixed e.g. at 3 5 or 7 degrees in the sagittal plane. In certain embodiments the slope either medial or lateral or both can be patient specific. The patient s medial slope can be used to derive the medial tibial component slope and optionally the lateral component slope in either a single or a two piece tibial implant component. The patient s lateral slope can be used to derive the lateral tibial component slope and optionally the medial component slope in either a single or a two piece tibial implant component. A patient s slope typically is between 0 and 7 degrees. In select instances a patient may show a medial or a lateral slope that is greater than 7 degrees. In this case if the patient s medial slope has a higher value than 7 degrees or some other pre selected threshold the patient s lateral slope can be applied to the medial tibial implant component or to the medial side of a single tibial implant component. If the patient s lateral slope has a higher value than 7 degrees or some other pre selected threshold the patient s medial slope can be applied to the lateral tibial implant component or to the lateral side of a single tibial implant component. Alternatively if the patient s slope on one or both medial and lateral sides exceeds a pre selected threshold value e.g. 7 degrees or 8 degrees or 10 degrees a fixed slope can be applied to the medial component or side to the lateral component or side or both. The fixed slope can be equal to the threshold value e.g. 7 degrees or it can be a different value. show exemplary flow charts for deriving a medial tibial component slope and or a lateral tibial component slope for a tibial implant component.

In another embodiment a mathematical function can be applied to derive a medial implant slope and or a lateral implant slope or both wherein both can be the same . In certain embodiments the mathematical function can include a measurement derived from one or more of the patient s joint dimensions as seen for example on a series of two dimensional images or a three dimensional representation generated for example from a CT scan or MRI scan. For example the mathematical function can include a ratio between a geometric measurement of the patient s femur and the patient s tibial slope. Alternatively or in addition the mathematical function can be or include the patient s tibial slope divided by a fixed value. In certain embodiments the mathematical function can include a measurement derived from a corresponding implant component for the patient for example a femoral implant component which itself can include patient specific patient engineered and or standard features. Many different possibilities to derive the patient s slope using mathematical functions can be applied by someone skilled in the art.

In certain embodiments the medial and lateral tibial plateau can be resected at the same angle. For example a single resected cut or the same multiple resected cuts can be used across both plateaus. In other embodiments the medial and lateral tibial plateau can be resected at different angles. Multiple resection cuts can be used when the medial and lateral tibial plateaus are resected at different angles. Optionally the medial and the lateral tibia also can be resected at a different distance relative to the tibial plateau. In this setting the two horizontal plane tibial cuts medially and laterally can have different slopes and or can be accompanied by one or two vertical or oblique resection cuts typically placed medial to the tibial plateau components. and show several exemplary tibial resection cuts which can be used in any combination for the medial and lateral plateaus.

The medial tibial implant component plateau can have a flat convex concave or dished surface and or it can have a thickness different than the lateral tibial implant component plateau. The lateral tibial implant component plateau can have a flat convex concave or dished surface and or it can have a thickness different than the medial tibial implant component plateau. The different thickness can be achieved using a different material thickness for example metal thickness or polyethylene or insert thickness on either side. In certain embodiments the lateral and medial surfaces are selected and or designed to closely resemble the patient s anatomy prior to developing the arthritic state.

The height of the medial and or lateral tibial implant component plateau e.g. metal only ceramic only metal backed with polyethylene or other insert with single or dual inserts and single or dual tray configurations can be determined based on the patient s tibial shape for example using an imaging test.

Alternatively the height of the medial and or lateral tibial component plateau e.g. metal only ceramic only metal backed with polyethylene or other insert with single or dual inserts and single or dual tray configurations can be determined based on the patient s femoral shape. For example if the patient s lateral condyle has a smaller radius than the medial condyle and or is located more superior than the medial condyle with regard to its bearing surface the height of the tibial component plateau can be adapted and or selected to ensure an optimal articulation with the femoral bearing surface. In this example the height of the lateral tibial component plateau can be adapted and or selected so that it is higher than the height of the medial tibial component plateau. Since polyethylene is typically not directly visible on standard x rays metallic or other markers can optionally be included in the inserts in order to indicate the insert location or height in particular when asymmetrical medial and lateral inserts or inserts of different medial and lateral thickness are used.

Alternatively the height of the medial and or lateral tibial component plateau e.g. metal only ceramic only metal backed with polyethylene or other insert with single or dual inserts and single or dual tray configurations can be determined based on the shape of a corresponding implant component for example based on the shape of certain features of the patient s femoral implant component. For example if the femoral implant component includes a lateral condyle having a smaller radius than the medial condyle and or is located more superior than the medial condyle with regard to its bearing surface the height of the tibial implant component plateaus can be adapted and or selected to ensure an optimal articulation with the bearing surface s of the femoral implant component. In this example the height of the lateral tibial implant component plateau can be adapted and or selected to be higher than the height of the medial tibial implant component plateau.

Moreover the surface shape e.g. mediolateral or anteroposterior curvature or both of the tibial insert s can reflect the shape of the femoral component. For example the medial insert shape can be matched to one or more radii on the medial femoral condyle of the femoral component. The lateral insert shape can be matched to one or more radii on the lateral femoral condyle of the femoral component. The lateral insert may optionally also be matched to the medial condyle. The matching can occur for example in the coronal plane. This has benefits for wear optimization. A pre manufactured insert can be selected for a medial tibia that matches the medial femoral condyle radii in the coronal plane with a pre selected ratio e.g. 1 5 or 1 7 or 1 10. Any combination is possible. A pre manufactured insert can be selected for a lateral tibia that matches the lateral femoral condyle radii in the coronal plane with a pre selected ratio e.g. 1 5 or 1 7 or 1 10. Any combination is possible. Alternatively a lateral insert can also be matched to a medial condyle or a medial insert shape can also be matched to a lateral condyle. These combinations are possible with single and dual insert systems with metal backing Someone skilled in the art will recognize that these matchings can also be applied to implants that use all polyethylene tibial components i.e. the radii on all polyethylene tibial components can be matched to the femoral radii in a similar manner.

In other embodiments single and dual insert systems can be designed to have a different tibial dish depth medially and lateral. The different dish depth can have the same radius or radii medially and laterally or can have different radii. The radii medially and or laterally can be patient specific patient derived patient selected or engineered. The dish depth medially and or laterally can be selected to reflect or replicate at least one of an uncut medial plateau an uncut lateral tibial plateau a medial femoral condyle a lateral femoral condyle a medial femoral resection level a lateral femoral resection level a medial lateral distal femoral offset a medial lateral posterior femoral offset or an engineered offset.

The matching of radii can also occur in the sagittal plane. For example a cutter can be used to cut a fixed coronal curvature into a tibial insert or all polyethylene tibia that is matched to or derived from a femoral implant or patient geometry. The path and or depth that the cutter is taking can be driven based on the femoral implant geometry or based on the patient s femoral geometry prior to the surgery. Medial and lateral sagittal geometry can be the same on the tibial inserts or all poly tibia. Alternatively each can be cut separately. By adapting or matching the tibial poly geometry to the sagittal geometry of the femoral component or femoral condyle a better functional result may be achieved. For example more physiologic tibiofemoral motion and kinematics can be enabled.

The medial and or the lateral component can include a trough. The medial component can be dish shaped while the lateral component includes a trough. The lateral component can be dish shaped while the medial component includes a trough. The lateral component can be convex while the medial component includes a trough. The shape of the medial or lateral component can be patient derived or patient matched in one two or three dimensions for example as it pertains to its perimeter as well as its surface shape. The convex shape of the lateral component can be patient derived or patient matched in one two or three dimensions. The trough can be straight. The trough can also be curved. The curvature of the trough can have a constant radius of curvature or it can include several radii of curvature. The radii can be patient matched or patient derived for example based on the femoral geometry or on the patient s kinematics. These designs can be applied with a single piece tibial polyethylene or other plastic insert or with two piece tibial polyethylene or other plastic inserts. show exemplary combinations of tibial tray designs. include additional embodiments of tibial implant components that are cruciate retaining

Tibial insert geometries can be selected or designed for a patient s tibial shape medial and or lateral joint space location or distal or posterior medial and or lateral femoral offset. Alternatively engineered geometries can be used. In another embodiment patient selected or designed inserts can be combined with engineered inserts e.g. a patient specific medial insert can be combined with an engineered lateral insert. Patient selection or design can be based on a single plane or dimension e.g. sagittal geometry optionally matched to tibia or femoral sagittal J curve or coronal geometry on two planes or dimensions e.g. sagittal and coronal or can be three dimensional for example by also matching at least in part a tibial glenoid or acetabular implant perimeter to the patient s cut bone for example in a virtual 3D simulation. Insert selection or design can occur using information derived from the patient s native uncut tibial plateau or other bone shape e.g. medial or lateral plateau tibial spines or combinations thereof

Insert selection or design can also occur using information derived from the patient s femoral shape e.g. in a sagittal or coronal plane or combinations thereof or distal or posterior or combinations thereof medial and lateral femoral condyle offset. A medial and a lateral insert height for single and dual insert components can be the same can be greater medially than laterally or can be greater laterally than medially. A medial side can be concave flat or convex engineered patient selected or patient designed. A lateral side can be concave flat or convex engineered patient selected or patient designed. Any combination or medial and lateral concave flat or convex engineered patient selected or patient designed insert shapes single and dual insert designs is possible. For example a patient selected or patient designed insert shape can be used medially while an engineered design is used lateral either in a single or dual insert application. Of note these shape variations are applicable to tibial components with metal backing and polyethylene inserts as well as any other tibial implant component known in the art or developed in the future e.g. using ceramics composites all polyethylene tibial components and the like. For any of these embodiments a height difference between a medial and a lateral tibial bearing surface can be selected or designed based on the patient s native uncut medial and lateral tibial plateau or based on the patient s medial or lateral distal and or posterior femoral condyle offset or combinations thereof. Medial and lateral tibial components including trays and inserts or single material designs can be selected or designed to specifically avoid the tibial spines and or the one or both cruciate ligaments e.g. the ACL or ACL attachment E or the PCL or PCL attachment E . The insert perimeter can be optimized to avoid impingement on the MCL or LCL .

The bearing surface of the tibial insert can be adapted to follow the direction of the natural sweep of the femur on the tibia or a desired sweep of the femur on the tibia both in fixed as well as in mobile bearing designs slideably or rotatably engageable . The femoral sweep on the tibia can be estimated based on the patient s native uncut femoral and tibial shape a wear pattern observed or kinematic analysis. This adaptation can be achieved by designing or selecting a tibial bearing surface that is for example curved medially and straight laterally or curved medially and laterally. The medial and lateral sweep curves can be the same with a single or multiple radii or they can be different with a single or multiple radii. They can be engineered patient selected patient derived or patient designed. All of these embodiments are applicable to fixed as well as mobile bearings in all joints e.g. hip shoulder ankle elbow wrist hand foot knee spine.

The cross sectional views in the coronal plane demonstrate how the lowest point in the tibial bearing surface meanders from the periphery of the implant to the tibial spine for different medial and lateral curved or straight femoral sweep paths.

The tibial implant surface topography can be selected for adapted to or matched to one or more femoral geometries. For example the distance of the lowest point of the medial dish or trough to the lowest point of the lateral dish or trough can be selected from or derived from or matched to the femoral geometry e.g. an intercondylar distance or an intercondylar notch width see G K . In this manner the tibial component s can be adapted to the femoral geometry ensuring that the lowest point of the femoral bearing surface will mate with the lowest point of the resultant tibial bearing surface. For example an exemplary femoral geometry may be determined or derived and then a matching or appropriate tibial implant geometry and surface geometry can be derived from the femoral geometry i.e. from anatomical or biomechanical or kinematic features in the sagittal and or coronal plane of the femur or from a combination of the femoral geometry with the tibial geometry. In such combination cases it may be desirable to optimize the tibial implant geometry based on a weighted combination of the tibial and femoral anatomical or biomechanical or kinematic characteristics to create a hybrid implant that accomplishes a desired correction but which accommodates the various structural biomechanical and or kinematic features and or limitations of each individual portion of the joint. In a similar manner multi complex joint implants having three or more component support structures such as the knee i.e. patella femur and tibia elbow humerus radius and ulna wrist radius ulna and carpals and ankle fibula tibia talus and calcaneus can be modeled and repaired replaced with components modeled derived and manufactured incorporating features of two or more mating surfaces and underlying support structures of the native joint.

The perimeter of the tibial component metal backed optionally poly inserts or all plastic or other material can be matched to or derived from the patient s tibial shape and can be optimized for different cut heights and or tibial slopes. In a preferred embodiment the shape is matched to the cortical bone of the cut surface. The surface topography of the tibial bearing surface can be designed or selected to match or reflect at least a portion of the tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. a sagittal plane or a coronal plane or both. The medial tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the medial tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal. The lateral tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the lateral tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal. The medial tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the lateral tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal. The lateral tibial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the medial tibial geometry in one or more planes e.g. sagittal and coronal.

In various embodiments the design and or placement of the tibial component can be influenced or otherwise driven by various factors of the femoral geometry. For example it may be desirous to rotate the design of some or all of a tibial component i.e. the entirety of the component and it s support structure or some portion thereof including the tibial tray and or the articulating poly insert and or merely the surface orientation of the articulating surface of the tibial insert to some degree to accommodate various features of the femoral geometry such as the femoral epicondylar axis posterior condylar axis medial or lateral sagittal femoral J curves or other femoral axis or landmark. In a similar manner the design and or placement of the femoral component i.e. the entirety of the femoral component and it s support structure or some portion thereof including the orientation and or placement of one or more condyles condyle surfaces and or the trochlear groove can be influenced or driven by various factors of the tibial geometry including various tibial axes shapes medial and or lateral slopes and or landmarks e.g. tibial tuberosity Q angle etc. Both femoral and tibial components can be influenced in shape or orientation by the shape dimensions biomechanics or kinematics of the patellofemoral joint including for example trochlear angle and Q angle sagittal trochlear geometry coronal trochlear geometry etc.

The surface topography of the tibial bearing surface s can be designed or selected to match or reflect at least portions of the femoral geometry or femoral implant geometry in one or more planes e.g. a sagittal plane or a coronal plane or both. The medial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the medial femoral geometry or medial femoral implant geometry in one or more planes. The lateral implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the lateral femoral geometry or lateral femoral implant geometry in one or more planes. The medial implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the lateral femoral geometry or lateral femoral implant geometry in one or more planes. The lateral implant surface topography can be selected or designed to match or reflect all or portions of the medial femoral geometry or medial femoral implant geometry in one or more planes. The medial and or the lateral surface topography can be fixed in one two or all dimensions. The latter can typically be used when at least one femoral geometry e.g. the coronal curvature is also fixed.

For example a portion of a sagittal curvature of a femoral condyle can be used to derive and manufacture a portion of a sagittal curvature of a tibial plateau bearing surface. In one embodiment a CNC machine can have a sagittal sweep plane through a polyethylene bearing surface that corresponds to at least a portion of a femoral sagittal curvature. The coronal radius of the cutter tool can be matched or derived from at least portions of the femoral coronal curvature or it can be a ratio or other mathematical function applied to the femoral curvature. Of note the femoral coronal curvature can vary along the condyle allowing for smaller and larger radii in different locations. These radii can be patient specific or engineered. For example two or more engineered radii can be applied to a single femoral condyle in two or more locations which can be the same or different with respect to the second condyle.

If desired a femoral bearing surface can be derived off a tibial shape in one or more dimensions using the same or similar approaches. Likewise a femoral head or humeral head bearing surface can be derived of an acetabulum or glenoid in one or more directions or the reverse.

All of the tibial designs discussed can be applied with various alternative embodiments and combinations of tibial designs which may include for example 

Any material or material combination currently known in the art and developed in the future can be used.

Certain embodiments of tibial trays can have the following features although other embodiments are possible modular insert system polymer cast cobalt chrome standard blanks cobalt portion and or modular insert can be made in advance then shaped patient specific to order thickness based on size saves bone optimizes strength allowance for 1 piece or 2 piece insert systems and or different medial and lateral fins.

In certain embodiments the tibial tray is designed or cut from a blank so that the tray periphery matches the edge of the cut tibial bone for example the patient matched peripheral geometry achieves 70 80 90 or 95 cortical coverage. In certain embodiments the tray periphery is designed to have substantially the same shape but be slightly smaller than the cortical area.

The patient adapted tibial implants of certain embodiments allow for design flexibility. For example inserts can be designed to compliment an associated condyle of a corresponding femoral implant component and can vary in dimensions to optimize design for example one or more of height shape curvature preferably flat to concave and location of curvature to accommodate natural or engineered wear pattern.

In the knee a tibial cut can be selected so that it is for example 90 degrees perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis or to the tibial anatomical axis. The cut can be referenced for example by finding the intersect with the lowest medial or lateral point on the plateau.

The slope for tibial cuts typically is between 0 and 7 or 0 and 8 degrees in the sagittal plane. Rarely a surgeon may elect to cut the tibia at a steeper slope. The slope can be selected or designed into a patient specific cutting jig using a preoperative imaging test. The slope can be similar to the patient s preoperative slope on at least one of a medial or one of a lateral side. The medial and lateral tibia can be cut with different slopes. The slope also can be different from the patient s preoperative slope on at least one of a medial or one of a lateral side.

The tibial cut height can differ medially and laterally as shown in and . In some patients the uncut lateral tibia can be at a different height for example higher or lower than the uncut medial tibia. In this instance the medial and lateral tibial cuts can be placed at a constant distance from the uncut medial and the uncut lateral tibial plateau resulting in different cut heights medially or laterally. Alternatively they can be cut at different distances relative to the uncut medial and lateral tibial plateau resulting in the same cut height on the remaining tibia. Alternatively in this setting the resultant cut height on the remaining tibia can be elected to be different medially and laterally. In certain embodiments independent design of the medial and lateral tibial resection heights resection slopes and or implant component e.g. tibial tray and or tibial tray insert can enhance bone preservation on the medial and or lateral sides of the proximal tibia as well as on the opposing femoral condyles.

As shown in the medial portion of a tibial implant may be higher or lower than the lateral tibial portion to compensate for different sizes of the medial and lateral femoral condyle. This method can facilitate maintenance of a patient s normal J curve and thus help preserve normal knee kinematics. Alternatively the effect may be achieved by offsetting the higher tibial articular surface to be the same height as the other compartment. If the condylar J curve is offset by the same amount the same kinematic motion can be achieved as illustrated in . In this embodiment the gray wheel femoral condyle and track tibial implant surface are offset by the same amount as the orange wheel and track . When rolling the gray wheel over the gray track a similar motion path blue dotted curve results as for the orange wheel and track . Since in this case the tibial implant surface is desirably offset perpendicular to the surface this will result in a new surface curvature that may be different than that of the other compartment. Offsetting the femoral J curve by the corresponding amount desirably reduces the amount of bone to be removed from the femoral condyle.

In certain embodiments a patient specific proximal tibia cut and the corresponding bone facing surface of the tibial component is designed by 1 finding the tibial axis perpendicular plane TAPP 2 lowering the TAPP for example 2 mm below the lowest point of the medial tibial plateau 3 sloping the lowered TAPP 5 degrees posteriorly no additional slope is required on the proximal surface of the insert 4 fixing the component posterior slope for example at 5 degrees and 5 using the tibial anatomic axis derived from Cobb or other measurement technique for tibial implant rotational alignment. As shown in resection cut depths deeper than 2 mm below the lowest point of the patient s uncut medial or lateral plateau e.g. medial plateau may be selected and or designed for example if the patient s anatomy includes an abnormality or diseased tissue below this point or if the surgeon prefers a lower cut. For example resection cut depths of 2.5 mm 3 mm 3.5 mm 4 mm 4.5 mm or 5 mm can be selected and or designed and optionally one or more corresponding tibial and or femoral implant thicknesses can be selected and or designed based on this patient specific information.

In certain embodiments a patient specific proximal tibial cut and the corresponding bone facing surface of the tibial component uses the preceding design except for determining the A P slope of the cut. In certain embodiments a patient specific A P slope can be used for example if the patient s anatomic slope is between 0 degrees and 7 degrees or between 0 degrees and 8 degrees or between 0 degrees and 9 degrees a slope of 7 degrees can be used if the patient s anatomic slope is between 7 degrees and 10 degrees and a slope of 10 can be used if the patient s anatomic slope is greater than 10 degrees.

In certain embodiments a patient specific A P slope is used if the patient s anatomic slope is between 0 and 7 degrees and a slope of 7 degrees is used if the patient s anatomic slope is anything over 7 degrees. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other methods for determining the tibial slope and for adapting it during implant and jig design to achieve a desired implant slope.

A different tibial slope can be applied on the medial and the lateral side. A fixed slope can be applied on one side while the slope on the other side can be adapted based on the patient s anatomy. For example a medial slope can be fixed at 5 degrees while a lateral slope matches that of the patient s tibia. In this setting two unicondylar tibial inserts or trays can be used. Alternatively a single tibial component optionally with metal backing can be used wherein said component does not have a flat bone facing surface but includes for example an oblique portion to connect the medial to the lateral side substantially negatively match resected lateral and medial tibial surfaces as shown for example in and .

In certain embodiments the axial profile e.g. perimeter shape of the tibial implant can be designed to match the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia for example as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009 0228113. Alternatively or in addition in certain embodiments the axial profile of the tibial implant can be designed to maintain a certain percentage or distance in its perimeter shape relative to the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia. Alternatively or in addition in certain embodiments the axial profile of the tibial implant can be designed to maintain a certain percentage or overhang in its perimeter shape relative to the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia.

Alternatively or in addition one or more tibial guide tools can be selected and or designed to match the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia or alternatively to match the axial profile of a tibial implant that is selected and or designed to maintain a certain percentage or distance in its perimeter shape relative to the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia. For example illustrates a tibial post and keel cutting guide tool that includes an axial profile that matches the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia . illustrates the tibial post and keel cutting guide tool positioned on top of the patient s cut tibia with a matching axial profile. illustrates an alternative tibial post and keel cutting guide tool having an axial perimeter that matches the axial profile of a tibial implant that is selected and or designed to maintain a certain percentage or distance in its perimeter shape relative to the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia e.g. having a smoothed perimeter about 1 mm about 2 mm about 3 mm less than 3 mm less than 2 mm or less than 1 mm from the edge of the patient s resected tibial surface perimeter . Accordingly in certain embodiments a patient adapted tibial guide tool includes an axial perimeter that substantially positively matches the axial perimeter of a single patient s resected proximal tibial surface. Alternatively or in addition a patient adapted tibial guide tool can be included having an axial perimeter that substantially matches the axial profile of a tibial implant that is selected and or designed to maintain a certain percentage or distance in its perimeter shape relative to the axial profile of the patient s cut tibia. One or both of such guide tools can include a cutting slot for guiding a keel hole punch for example as shown in . In certain embodiments the tibial post and keel cutting guide tool can include instead of a cutting slot for guiding a keel hole punch a opening or a hole for receiving an insert that itself comprises a cutting slot for guiding a keel hole punch. The guide tool can include a round ovoid or many sided hole for receiving the insert such that the insert can be rotated within the guide tool to thereby rotate the keel hole punch guide slot. In certain embodiments the guide tool can be tapered posteriorly to provide fit in the knee joint during extension.

Any of the tibial implant components described above can be derived from a blank that is cut to include one or more patient specific features.

Tibial tray designs can include patient specific patient engineered and or standard features. For example in certain embodiments the tibial tray can have a front loading design that requires minimal impaction force to seat it. The trays can come in various standard or standard blank designs for example small medium and large standard or standard blank tibial trays can be provided. shows exemplary small medium and large blank tibial trays. As shown the tibial tray perimeters include a blank perimeter shape that can be designed based on the design of the patient s resected proximal tibia surface. In certain embodiments small and medium trays can include a base thickness of 2 mm e.g. such that a patient s natural joint line may be raised 3 4 mm if the patient has 2 3 mm of cartilage on the proximal tibia prior to the disease state . Large trays can have a base thickness of 3 mm such that in certain embodiments it may be beneficial to resect an additional 1 mm of bone so that the joint line is raised no more than 2 3 mm assuming 2 3 mm of cartilage on the patient s proximal tibia prior to the disease state .

In various embodiments a tibial implant design may incorporate one or more locking mechanisms to secure a tibial insert into a tibial tray. One exemplary locking mechanism of varying sizes is depicted in . In this mechanism a corresponding lower surface on the tibial insert engages one or more ridges on the surface of the tibial tray thereby locking the tibial insert in a desired position relative to the tray. The locking mechanism can be pre configured and or available for example in two or three different geometries or size. Optionally a user or a computer program can have a library of CAD files or subroutines with different sizes and geometries of locking mechanisms available. For example in a first step the user or computer program can define design or select a tibial acetabular or glenoid implant profile that best matches a patient s cut or optionally uncut tibia acetabulum or glenoid. In a second step the user or computer program can then select the pre configured CAD file or subroutine that is best suited for a given tibial or acetabular or glenoid perimeter or other shape or location or size. Moreover the type of locking mechanism e.g. snap dovetail etc. can be selected based on patient specific parameters e.g. body weight height gender race activity level etc. .

The tibial tray and or tibial insert can include various features to provide a locking mechanism between the insert and tray. For example illustrates a tibial implant component assembly that includes a monolithic insert a pair of medial and lateral inserts and a tray . The bottom tray facing surfaces of the inserts and the top insert facing surface of the tray are configured such that either the monolithic insert or the pair of inserts can be locked into the tray . show various aspects of the monolithic one piece tibial insert. show various aspects of a lateral insert in a two piece insert system. show various aspects of a medial insert in a two piece insert system. show various aspects of the corresponding tibial tray. show an insert locked into the tray. As shown the monolithic insert includes two male protrusions or slots . The outer medial edge of the medial protrusion and outer lateral edge of the lateral protrusion tapers posteriorly toward the center of the insert. The two piece inserts collectively include these same features as shown in and . Moreover as shown in the figures the protrusions include dovetailed fittings. These insert protrusions are designed to fit with female slots respectively on the tibial tray as shown in . The female slots are tapered and dovetailed to match the tapering and dovetails of the male protrusions on the inserts. Accordingly in certain embodiments a tibial implant includes a tibial tray having an engaging mechanism comprising a medial female engaging slot and a lateral female engaging slot and a tibial insert comprising an engaging mechanism comprising at least one of a corresponding medial male protrusion and a corresponding lateral male protrusion. In certain embodiments at least one of the medial side of the medial female engaging slot and the lateral side of the lateral female engaging slot is posteriorly tapered toward the center of the tray for example tapered toward the center by about ten degrees. In addition the tray can include at least one of an anterior medial and anterior lateral raised portion. In addition the tray can include at least one of a posterior medial and posterior lateral relieved portion for example which is lower than adjacent raised portions but higher than the female slot surface. These features enable placement of the insert s into the tray.

A patient specific peg alignment e.g. either aligned to the patient s mechanical axis or aligned to another axis can be combined with a patient specific A P cut plane. For example in certain embodiments the peg alignment can tilt anteriorly at the same angle that the A P slope is designed. In certain embodiments the peg can be aligned in relation to the patient s sagittal mechanical axis for example at a predetermined angle relative to the patient s mechanical axis. shows exemplary A P and peg angles for tibial trays.

The joint facing surface of a tibial implant component includes a medial bearing surface and a lateral bearing surface. Like the femoral implant bearing surface s described above a bearing surface on a tibial implant e.g. a groove or depression or a convex portion on the lateral side in the tibial surface that receives contact from a femoral component condyle can be of standard design for example available in 6 or 7 different shapes with a single radius of curvature or multiple radii of curvature in one dimension or more than one dimension. Alternatively a bearing surface can be standardized in one or more dimensions and patient adapted in one or more dimensions. A single radius of curvature and or multiple radii of curvature can be selected in one dimension or multiple dimensions. Some of the radii can be patient adapted.

Each of the two contact areas of the polyethylene insert of the tibial implant component that engage the femoral medial and lateral condyle surfaces can be any shape for example convex flat or concave and can have any radii of curvature. In certain embodiments any one or more of the curvatures of the medial or lateral contact areas can include patient specific radii of curvature. Specifically one or more of the coronal curvature of the medial contact area the sagittal curvature of the medial contact area the coronal curvature of the lateral contact area and or the sagittal curvature of the lateral contact area can include at least in part one or more patient specific radii of curvature. In certain embodiments the tibial implant component is designed to include one or both medial and lateral bearing surfaces having a sagittal curvature with at least in part one or more patient specific radii of curvature and a standard coronal curvature. In certain embodiments the bearing surfaces on one or both of the medial and lateral tibial surfaces can include radii of curvature derived from e.g. the same length or slightly larger such as 0 10 larger than the radii of curvature on the corresponding femoral condyle. Having patient adapted sagittal radii of curvature at least in part can help achieve normal kinematics with full range of motion.

Alternatively the coronal curvature can be selected for example by choosing from a family of standard curvatures the one standard curvature having the radius of curvature or the radii of curvature that is most similar to the coronal curvature of the patient s uncut femoral condyle or that is most similar to the coronal curvature of the femoral implant component.

In preferred embodiments one or both tibial medial and lateral contact areas have a standard concave coronal radius that is larger for example slightly larger for example between 0 and 1 mm between 0 and 2 mm between 0 and 4 mm between 1 and 2 mm and or between 2 and 4 mm larger than the convex coronal radius on the corresponding femoral component. By using a standard or constant coronal radius on a femoral condyle with a matching standard or constant coronal radius or slightly larger on a tibial insert for example with a tibial radius of curvature of from about 1.05 to about 2 or from about 1.05 to about 1.5 or from about 1.05 to about 1.25 or from about 1.05 to about 1.10 or from about 1.05 to about 1.06 or about 1.06 of the corresponding femoral implant coronal curvature. The relative convex femoral coronal curvature and slightly larger concave tibial coronal curvature can be selected and or designed to be centered to each about the femoral condylar centers.

In the sagittal plane one or both tibial medial and lateral concave curvatures can have a standard curvature slightly larger than the corresponding convex femoral condyle curvature for example between 0 and 1 mm between 0 and 2 mm between 0 and 4 mm between 1 and 2 mm and or between 2 and 4 mm larger than the convex sagittal radius on the corresponding femoral component. For example the tibial radius of curvature for one or both of the medial and lateral sides can be from about 1.1 to about 2 or from about 1.2 to about 1.5 or from about 1.25 to about 1.4 or from about 1.30 to about 1.35 or about 1.32 of the corresponding femoral implant sagittal curvature. In certain embodiments the depth of the curvature into the tibial surface material can depend on the height of the surface into the joint gap. As mentioned the height of the medial and lateral tibial component joint facing surfaces can be selected and or designed independently. In certain embodiments the medial and lateral tibial heights are selected and or designed independently based on the patient s medial and lateral condyle height difference. In addition or alternatively in certain embodiments a threshold minimum or maximum tibial height and or tibial insert thickness can be used. For example in certain embodiments a threshold minimum insert thickness of 6 mm is employed so that no less than a 6 mm medial tibial insert is used.

By using a tibial contact surface sagittal and or coronal curvature selected and or designed based on the curvature s of the corresponding femoral condyles or a portion thereof e.g. the bearing portion the kinematics and wear of the implant can be optimized. For example this approach can enhance the wear characteristics a polyethylene tibial insert. This approach also has some manufacturing benefits.

For example a set of different sized tools can be produced wherein each tool corresponds to one of the pre selected standard coronal curvatures. The corresponding tool then can be used in the manufacture of a polyethylene insert of the tibial implant component for example to create a curvature in the polyethylene insert. shows six exemplary tool tips and a polyethylene insert in cross section in the coronal view. The size of the selected tool can be used to generate a polyethylene insert having the desired coronal curvature. In addition shows an exemplary polyethylene insert having two different coronal curvatures created by two different tool tips. The action of the selected tool on the polyethylene insert for example a sweeping arc motion by the tool at a fixed point above the insert can be used to manufacture a standard or patient specific sagittal curvature. shows a sagittal view of two exemplary tools sweeping from different distances into the polyethylene insert of a tibial implant component to create different sagittal curvatures in the polyethylene insert .

In certain embodiments one or both of the tibial contact areas includes a concave groove having an increasing or decreasing radius along its sagittal axis for example a groove with a decreasing radius from anterior to posterior.

As shown in in certain embodiments the shape of the concave groove on the lateral and or on the medial sides of the joint facing surface of the tibial insert can be matched by a convex shape on the opposing side surface of the insert and optionally by a concavity on the engaging surface of the tibial tray . This can allow the thickness of the component to remain constant even though the surfaces are not flat and thereby can help maintain a minimum thickness of the material for example plastic material such as polyethylene. For example an implant insert can maintain a constant material thickness e.g. less than 5.5 mm 5.5 mm 5.6 mm 5.7 mm 5.8 mm 5.9 mm 6.0 mm 6.1 mm or greater than 6.1 mm even though the insert includes a groove on the joint facing surface. The constant material thickness can help to minimize overall minimum implant thickness while achieving or maintaining a certain mechanical strength as compared to a thicker implant . The matched shape on the metal backing can serve the purpose of maintaining a minimum polyethylene thickness. It can however also include design features to provide a locking mechanism between the polyethylene or other insert and the metal backing. Such locking features can include ridges edges or an interference fit. In the case of an interference fit the polyethylene can have slightly larger dimensions at the undersurface convexity than the matching concavity on the metal tray. This can be stabilized against rails or dove tail locking mechanisms in the center or the sides of the metal backing Other design options are possible. For example the polyethylene extension can have a saucer shape that can snap into a matching recess on the metal backing. In addition as shown in any corresponding pieces of the component such as a metal tray also can include a matching groove to engage the curved surface of the plastic material. Two exemplary concavity dimensions are shown in . As shown in the figure the concavities or scallops have depths of 1.0 and 0.7 mm based on a coronal geometry of R42.4 mm. At a 1.0 mm depth the footprint width is 18.3 mm. At a 0.70 mm depth the footprint width is 15.3 mm. These dimensions are only of exemplary nature. Many other configurations are possible.

In various alternative embodiments the tibial tray may comprise sections of varying thickness. If desired the modeling software may conduct FEA or other load analysis on the tibial tray incorporating various patient specific information including patient weight and intended activity levels among other factors and determine if specific areas of the intended implant design at are an undesirable risk of failure or fatigue. Such areas can be reinforced thickened or otherwise redesigned if desired to accommodate and or alleviate such risks desirably before actual manufacture of the implant . In a similar manner areas of lower stress fracture risk can be redesigned if desired by removal of material etc. which may improve the fit and or performance of the implant in various ways. Of course either or both of the upper and lower surface of the tibial tray may be processed and or redesigned in this manner.

In certain embodiments the sagittal curvature of the femoral component can be designed to be tilted as suggested by . The corresponding curvature of the tibial surface can be tilted by that same slope which can allow for thicker material on the corresponding tibial implant for example thicker poly at the anterior or posterior aspect of the tibial implant. The femoral component J curve and optionally the corresponding curvature for the tibial component can be tilted by the same slope in both the medial and lateral condyles just in the medial condyle or just in the lateral condyle or both independently or coupled. In certain embodiments some additional material can be removed or the material thickness can be adapted from the posterior aspect of the femoral and or tibial curvatures to allow for rotation.

In addition to the implant component features described above certain embodiments can include features and designs for cruciate substitution. These features and designs can include for example a keel post or projection that projects from the bone facing surface of the tibial implant component to engage on the corresponding an intercondylar housing receptacle or bars on the corresponding femoral implant component.

As shown in the figures the upper surface of the tray component has a keel type structure in between the concave surfaces that are configured to mate with the femoral condyle surfaces of a femoral implant. This keel type structure can be configured to slide within a groove in the femoral implant. The groove can comprise stopping mechanisms at each end of the groove to keep the keel type structure within the track of the groove. This keel type structure and groove arrangement may be used in situations where a patient s posterior cruciate ligament is removed as part of the surgical process and there is a need to posteriorly stabilize the implant within the joint.

In certain embodiments the tibial implant component can be designed and manufactured to include the post or projection as a permanently integrated feature of the implant component. However in certain embodiments the post or projection can be modular. For example the post or projection can be designed and or manufactured separate from the tibial implant component and optionally joined with the component either prior to e.g. preoperatively or during the implant procedure. For example a modular post or projection and a tibial implant component can be mated using an integrating mechanism such as respective male and female screw threads other male type and female type locking mechanisms or other mechanism capable of integrating the post or projection into or onto the tibial implant component and providing stability to the post or projection during normal wear. A modular post or projection can be joined to a tibial implant component at the option of the surgeon or practitioner for example by removing a plug or other device that covers the integrating mechanism and attaching the modular post or projection at the uncovered integrating mechanism.

The post or projection can include features that are patient adapted e.g. patient specific or patient engineered . In certain embodiments the post or projection includes one or more features that are designed and or selected preoperatively based on patient specific data including imaging data to substantially match one or more of the patient s biological features. For example the length width height and or curvature of one or more portions of the post or projection can be designed and or selected to be patient specific for example with respect to the patient s intercondylar distance or depth femoral shape and or condyle shape. Alternatively or in addition one or more features of the post or projection can be engineered based on patient specific data to provide to the patient an optimized fit. For example the length width height and or curvature of one or more portions of the post or projection can be designed and or selected to be patient engineered. One or more thicknesses of the housing receptacle or bar can be matched to patient specific measurements. One or more dimensions of the post or projection can be adapted based on one or more implant dimensions e.g. one or more dimensions of the housing receptacle or bar on the corresponding femoral implant component which can be patient specific patient engineered or standard. One or more dimensions of the post or projection can be adapted based on one or more of patient weight height sex and body mass index. In addition one or more features of the post or projection can be standard.

Optionally referring to an exemplary keel type structure or post can be adapted to the patient s anatomy. For example the post can be shaped to enable a more normal physiologic glide path of the femur relative to the tibia. Thus the post can deviate medially or lateral as it extends from its base to its tip. This medial or lateral deviation can be designed to achieve a near physiologic rolling and rotating action of the knee joint. The medial and lateral bending of the post can be adapted based on patient specific imaging data. For example the mediolateral curve or bend of the post or keel can be patient derived or patient matched e.g. to match the physical or force direction of PCL or ACL . Alternatively or in addition the post or keel can deviate at a particular AP angle or bend for example the sagittal curve of the post or keel can be reflection of PCL location and orientation or combinations of ACL and PCL location and orientation. The post can optionally taper or can have different diameters and cross sectional profiles e.g. round elliptical ovoid square rectangular at different heights from its base.

Different dimensions of the post or projection can be shaped adapted or selected based on different patient dimensions and implant dimensions. Examples of different technical implementations are provided in Table 14. These examples are in no way meant to be limiting. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means of shaping adapting or selecting a tibial implant post or projection based on the patient s geometry including imaging data.

The height or M L width or A P length of the intercondylar notch can not only influence the length but also the position or orientation of a post or projection from the tibial implant component.

The dimensions of the post or projection can be shaped adapted or selected not only based on different patient dimensions and implant dimensions but also based on the intended implantation technique for example the intended tibial component slope or rotation and or the intended femoral component flexion or rotation. For example at least one of an anteroposterior length or superoinferior height can be adjusted if a tibial implant is intended to be implanted at a 7 degrees slope as compared to a 0 degrees slope reflecting the relative change in patient or trochlear or intercondylar notch or femoral geometry when the tibial component is implanted. Moreover at least one of an anteroposterior length or superoinferior height can be adjusted if the femoral implant is intended to be implanted in flexion for example in 7 degrees flexion as compared to 0 degrees flexion. The corresponding change in post or projection dimension can be designed or selected to reflect the relative change in patient or trochlear or intercondylar notch or femoral geometry when the femoral component is implanted in flexion.

In another example the mediolateral width can be adjusted if one or both of the tibial and or femoral implant components are intended to be implanted in internal or external rotation reflecting for example an effective elongation of the intercondylar dimensions when a rotated implantation approach is chosen. Features of the post or projection can be oblique or curved to match corresponding features of the femoral component housing receptacle or bar. For example the superior portion of the post projection can be curved reflecting a curvature in the roof of the femoral component housing receptacle or bar which itself may reflect a curvature of the intercondylar roof. In another example a side of a post or projection may be oblique to reflect an obliquity of a side wall of the housing or receptacle of the femoral component which itself may reflect an obliquity of one or more condylar walls. Accordingly an obliquity or curvature of a post or projection can be adapted based on at least one of a patient dimension or a femoral implant dimension. Alternatively the post or projection of the tibial implant component can be designed and or selected based on generic or patient derived or patient desired or implant desired kinematics in one two three or more dimensions. Then the corresponding surface s of the femoral implant housing or receptacle can be designed and or selected to mate with the tibial post or projection e.g. in the ML plane. Alternatively the post or projection of the femoral receptacle or box or bar or housing can be designed and or selected based on generic or patient derived or patient desired or implant desired kinematics in one two three or more dimensions. Then the corresponding surface s of the post or projection of the tibial implant can be designed and or selected to mate with the tibial post or projection e.g. in the ML plane.

The tibial post or projection can be straight. Alternatively the tibial post or projection can have a curvature or obliquity in one two or three dimensions which can optionally be at least in part reflected in the internal shape of the box. One or more tibial projection or post dimensions can be matched to designed to adapted to or selected based on one or more patient dimensions or measurements. Any combination of planar and curved surfaces is possible.

In certain embodiments the position and or dimensions of the tibial implant component post or projection can be adapted based on patient specific dimensions. For example the post or projection can be matched with the position of the posterior cruciate ligament or the PCL insertion. It can be placed at a predefined distance from anterior or posterior cruciate ligament or ligament insertion from the medial or lateral tibial spines or other bony or cartilaginous landmarks or sites. By matching the position of the post with the patient s anatomy it is possible to achieve a better functional result better replicating the patient s original anatomy.

The tray component can be machined molded casted manufactured through additive techniques such as laser sintering or electron beam melting or otherwise constructed out of a metal or metal alloy such as cobalt chromium. Similarly the insert component may be machined molded manufactured through rapid prototyping or additive techniques or otherwise constructed out of a plastic polymer such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. Other known materials such as ceramics including ceramic coating may be used as well for one or both components or in combination with the metal metal alloy and polymer described above. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that an implant may be constructed as one piece out of any of the above or other materials or in multiple pieces out of a combination of materials. For example a tray component constructed of a polymer with a two piece insert component constructed one piece out of a metal alloy and the other piece constructed out of ceramic.

Each of the components may be constructed as a standard or blank in various sizes or may be specifically formed for each patient based on their imaging data and anatomy. Computer modeling may be used and a library of virtual standards may be created for each of the components. A library of physical standards may also be amassed for each of the components.

Imaging data including shape geometry e.g. M L A P and S I dimensions then can be used to select the standard component e.g. a femoral component or a tibial component or a humeral component and a glenoid component that most closely approximates the select features of the patient s anatomy. Typically these components will be selected so that they are slightly larger than the patient s articular structure that will be replaced in at least one or more dimensions. The standard component is then adapted to the patient s unique anatomy for example by removing overhanging material e.g. using machining.

Thus referring to the flow chart shown in in a first step the imaging data will be analyzed either manually or with computer assistance to determine the patient specific parameters relevant for placing the implant component. These parameters can include patient specific articular dimensions and geometry and also information about ligament location size and orientation as well as potential soft tissue impingement and optionally kinematic information.

In a second step one or more standard components e.g. a femoral component or a tibial component or tibial insert are selected. These are selected so that they are at least slightly greater than one or more of the derived patient specific articular dimensions and so that they can be shaped to the patient specific articular dimensions. Alternatively these are selected so that they will not interfere with any adjacent soft tissue structures. Combinations of both are possible.

If an implant component is used that includes an insert e.g. a polyethylene insert and a locking mechanism in a metal or ceramic base the locking mechanism can be adapted to the patient s specific anatomy in at least one or more dimensions. The locking mechanism can also be patient adapted in all dimensions. The location of locking features can be patient adapted while the locking feature dimensions for example between a femoral component and a tibial component can be fixed. Alternatively the locking mechanism can be pre fabricated in this embodiment the location and dimensions of the locking mechanism will also be considered in the selection of the pre fabricated components so that any adaptations to the metal or ceramic backing relative to the patient s articular anatomy do not compromise the locking mechanism. Thus the components can be selected so that after adaptation to the patient s unique anatomy a minimum material thickness of the metal or ceramic backing will be maintained adjacent to the locking mechanism.

Since the tibia has the shape of a champagne glass i.e. since it tapers distally from the knee joint space down moving the tibial cut distally will result in a smaller resultant cross section of the cut tibial plateau e.g. the ML and or AP dimension of the cut tibia will be smaller. For example referring to increasing the slope of the cut will result in an elongation of the AP dimension of the cut surface requiring a resultant elongation of a patient matched tibial component. Thus in one embodiment it is possible to select an optimal standard pre made tibial blank for a given resection height and or slope. This selection can involve 1 patient adapted metal with a standard poly insert or 2 metal and poly insert wherein both are adapted to patient anatomy. The metal can be selected so that based on cut tibial dimensions there is always a certain minimum metal perimeter in one two or three dimensions guaranteed after patient adaptation so that a lock mechanism will not fail. Optionally one can determine minimal metal perimeter based on finite element modeling FEA once during initial design of standard lock features or patient specific every time e.g. via patient specific FEA modeling .

The tibial tray can be selected or a metal base for other joints to optimize percent cortical bone coverage at resection level. This selection can be 1 based on one dimension e.g. ML 2 based on two dimensions e.g. ML and AP and or 3 based on three dimensions e.g. ML AP SI or slope.

The selection can be performed to achieve a target percentage coverage of the resected bone e.g. area or cortical edge or margin at the resection level e.g. AP ML perimeter e.g. 85 90 95 98 or 100 . Optionally a smoothing function can be applied to the derived contour of the patient s resected bone or the resultant selected designed or adapted implant contour so that the implant does not extend into all irregularities or crevaces of the virtually and then later surgically cut bone perimeter.

Optionally a function can be included for deriving the desired implant shape that allows changing the tibial implant perimeter if the implant overhangs the cortical edge in a convex outer contour portion or in a concave outer contour portion e.g. crevace . These changes can subsequently be included in the implant shape e.g. by machining select features into the outer perimeter.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that a combination of standard and customized components may be used in conjunction with each other. For example a standard tray component may be used with an insert component that has been individually constructed for a specific patient based on the patient s anatomy and joint information.

Another embodiment incorporates a tray component with one half of a two piece insert component integrally formed with the tray component leaving only one half of the two piece insert to be inserted during surgery. For example the tray component and medial side of the insert component may be integrally formed with the lateral side of the insert component remaining to be inserted into the tray component during surgery. Of course the reverse could also be used wherein the lateral side of the insert component is integrally formed with the tray component leaving the medial side of the insert component for insertion during surgery.

Each of these alternatives results in a tray component and an insert component shaped so that once combined they create a uniformly shaped implant matching the geometries of the patient s specific joint.

The above embodiments are applicable to all joints of a body e.g. ankle foot elbow hand wrist shoulder hip spine or other joint.

For example in a hip an acetabular component can be designed or selected or adapted so that its peripheral margin will be closely matched to the patient specific acetabular rim or perimeter. Optionally reaming can be simulated for placement of an acetabular cup and the implant can then be designed or selected or adapted so that it will be closely matched to the resultant acetabular rim after reaming or other bone removal. Thus the exterior dimensions of the implant e.g. the rim and or curvature s can be matched to the patient s geometry in this fashion. Curvatures of the exterior bone facing shape of the acetabular cup can have constant or variable radii in one two or three dimensions. At least one or more of these curvatures or surfaces can be selected or adapted to the patient s shape in one or more dimensions optionally adapted to the result of a simulated surgical alteration of the anatomy e.g. reaming the removal of osteophytes or cutting. The acetabular component can be selected adapted or designed to rest on the acetabular rim or extend beyond the acetabular rim resting on portions of cortical bone or for example also osteophytes. In this embodiment the acetabular fossa facing portion of the component can have standard dimensions e.g. approximating those of a reamer used for reaming the acetabular fossa while the peripheral portions e.g. those facing the acetabular rim or cortical bone e.g. on the acetabulum or ilium or ischium can be patient specific or patient adapted. Any of these embodiments can be applicable to hip resurfacing techniques and implants as well as hip replacement techniques and implants.

If desired the patient specific data can be utilized to create a reaming guide or other tools for preparing the acetabular space for an implant component. To avoid cutting reaming through an acetabulum in a reaming operation it may be desirous to have a guide or other tool that limits reamer motion or movement in various manners to one or more predetermined depths that were previously determined using patient specific data e.g. preoperative CT or MRI or intraoperative ultrasound measurement of acetabular wall thickness. Such a tool can comprise a patient matched surface on the acetabulum and or other acetabular head or other anatomical structures. Desirably the tool can control both placement and depth of reaming tools to a desired degree. Moreover the planning and design phase of such a guide tool can potentially identify any at risk operations for patients especially susceptible to such dangers and possibly the implant design can be redesigned to accommodate the special needs of such patients as well.

In another embodiment in a shoulder a glenoid component metal backed ceramic or all plastic e.g. polyethylene or any other know in the art or developed in the future can be designed or selected or adapted so that its peripheral margin will be closely matched to the patient specific glenoid rim or perimeter. Optionally reaming can be simulated for placement of a glenoid component and the implant can then be designed or selected or adapted so that it will be closely matched to the resultant glenoid rim after reaming or other bone removal. Thus the exterior dimensions of the implant e.g. the rim and or curvature s can be matched to the patient s geometry in this fashion. Curvatures of the exterior bone facing shape of the glenoid component can have constant or variable radii in one two or three dimensions. At least one or more of these curvatures or surfaces can be adapted to the patient s shape in one or more dimensions optionally adapted to the result of a simulated surgical alteration of the anatomy e.g. reaming the removal of osteophytes or cutting. For example if a cut is performed the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the bone resulting after the cut has been placed. In this setting at least a portion of the perimeter of the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the patient s cut bone. The undersurface of the implant can then be flat facing the cut bone. The glenoid component can be selected adapted or designed to rest on the glenoid rim or extend beyond the glenoid rim resting on portions of cortical bone or for example also osteophytes. In this embodiment the glenoid fossa facing portion of the component can have standard dimensions e.g. approximating those of a reamer used for reaming the glenoid fossa while the peripheral portions e.g. those facing the glenoid rim or cortical bone e.g. on the anterior or posterior aspect of the scapula can be patient specific or patient adapted. Any of these embodiments can be applicable to shoulder resurfacing techniques and implants as well as shoulder replacement techniques and implants including primary and revision shoulder systems as well as reverse or inverse shoulder systems.

If desired the patient specific data can be utilized to create a reaming guide or other tools for preparing the glenoid for an implant component. To avoid cutting reaming through a glenoid in a reaming operation it may be desirous to have a guide or other tool that limits reamer motion or movement in various manners to one or more predetermined depths that were previously determined using patient specific data e.g. pre operative CT or MRI or intraoperative ultrasound measurement of glenoid depths. Such a tool can comprise a patient matched surface on the glenoid and or other anatomical structures. Desirably the tool can control both placement and depth of reaming tools to a desired degree. Moreover the planning and design phase of such a guide tool can potentially identify any at risk operations for patients especially susceptible to such dangers and possibly the implant design can be redesigned to accommodate the special needs of such patients as well.

Optionally standard round dimensions of a polyethylene or other insert can be used with this embodiment.

Similarly a glenoid component can be selected for adapted to or matched to the glenoid rim optionally after surgically preparing or resectioning all or portions of the glenoid rim including osteophytes. Thus edge matching designing selecting or adapting implants including optionally lock features can be performed for implants used in any joint of the body.

In another embodiment in an ankle joint a talar or tibial component metal backed ceramic or all plastic e.g. polyethylene or any other material known in the art or developed in the future can be designed or selected or adapted so that its peripheral margin will be closely matched to the patient specific bony rim or perimeter in one or two or more dimensions. Optionally reaming or cutting can be simulated for placement of a component and the implant can then be designed or selected or adapted so that it will be closely matched to the resultant bony contour or surface after reaming or cutting or other bone removal. Thus the exterior dimensions of the implant e.g. the rim and or curvature s can be matched to the patient s geometry in this fashion. Curvatures of the exterior bone facing shape of the talar or tibial component can have constant or variable radii in one two or three dimensions. At least one or more of these curvatures or surfaces can be adapted to the patient s shape in one or more dimensions optionally adapted to the result of a simulated surgical alteration of the anatomy e.g. reaming the removal of osteophytes or cutting. For example if a cut is performed the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the bone resulting after the cut has been placed. In this setting at least a portion of the perimeter of the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the patient s cut bone. The undersurface of the implant can then be flat facing the cut bone. The tibial or talar component can be selected adapted or designed to rest on the bony rim or surface or extend beyond the bony rim of the articular surface resting on portions of cortical bone or for example also osteophytes. In this embodiment the articular bone facing portion of the component can have standard dimensions e.g. approximating those of a reamer used for reaming the bone while the peripheral portions e.g. those facing the bony rim or cortical bone e.g. on the anterior tibia or lateral or medial aspect of the talus can be patient specific or patient adapted. Any of these embodiments can be applicable to ankle resurfacing techniques and implants as well as ankle replacement techniques and implants including primary and revision ankle systems.

In another embodiment in an elbow joint a humeral or radial or ulnar component metal backed ceramic or all plastic e.g. polyethylene or any other material known in the art or developed in the future can be designed or selected or adapted so that its peripheral margin will be closely matched to the patient specific bony rim or perimeter in one or two or more dimensions. Optionally reaming or cutting can be simulated for placement of a component and the implant can then be designed or selected or adapted so that it will be closely matched to the resultant bony contour or surface after reaming or cutting or other bone removal. Thus the exterior dimensions of the implant e.g. the rim and or curvature s can be matched to the patient s geometry in this fashion. Curvatures of the exterior bone facing shape of the humeral or radial or ulnar component s can have constant or variable radii in one two or three dimensions. At least one or more of these curvatures or surfaces can be adapted to the patient s shape in one or more dimensions optionally adapted to the result of a simulated surgical alteration of the anatomy e.g. reaming the removal of osteophytes or cutting. For example if a cut is performed the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the bone resulting after the cut has been placed. In this setting at least a portion of the perimeter of the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the patient s cut bone. The undersurface of the implant can then be flat facing the cut bone. The humeral or radial or ulnar component s can be selected adapted or designed to rest on the bony rim or surface or extend beyond the bony rim of the articular surface resting on portions of cortical bone or for example also osteophytes. In this embodiment the articular bone facing portion of the component can have standard dimensions e.g. approximating those of a reamer used for reaming the bone while the peripheral portions e.g. those facing the bony rim or cortical bone e.g. on the anterior humerus or lateral or medial aspect of the radius or ulna can be patient specific or patient adapted. Any of these embodiments can be applicable to elbow resurfacing techniques and implants as well as elbow replacement techniques and implants including primary and revision elbow systems.

In another embodiment in a wrist joint a radial or ulnar or scaphoid or lunate component metal backed ceramic or all plastic e.g. polyethylene or any other material known in the art or developed in the future can be designed or selected or adapted so that its peripheral margin will be closely matched to the patient specific bony rim or perimeter in one or two or more dimensions. Optionally reaming or cutting can be simulated for placement of a component and the implant can then be designed or selected or adapted so that it will be closely matched to the resultant bony contour or surface after reaming or cutting or other bone removal. Thus the exterior dimensions of the implant e.g. the rim and or curvature s can be matched to the patient s geometry in this fashion. Curvatures of the exterior bone facing shape of the radial or ulnar or scaphoid or lunate component s can have constant or variable radii in one two or three dimensions. At least one or more of these curvatures or surfaces can be adapted to the patient s shape in one or more dimensions optionally adapted to the result of a simulated surgical alteration of the anatomy e.g. reaming the removal of osteophytes or cutting. For example if a cut is performed the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the bone resulting after the cut has been placed. In this setting at least a portion of the perimeter of the implant can be adapted to the perimeter of the patient s cut bone. The undersurface of the implant can then be flat facing the cut bone. The radial or ulnar or scaphoid or lunate component s can be selected adapted or designed to rest on the bony rim or surface or extend beyond the bony rim of the articular surface resting on portions of cortical bone or for example also osteophytes. In this embodiment the articular bone facing portion of the component can have standard dimensions e.g. approximating those of a reamer used for reaming the bone while the peripheral portions e.g. those facing the bony rim or cortical bone e.g. on the anterior radius can be patient specific or patient adapted. Any of these embodiments can be applicable to wrist resurfacing techniques and implants as well as wrist replacement techniques and implants including primary and revision wrist systems.

Whenever a metal backed or ceramic or other material component is used in conjunction with an insert e.g. made of ceramic or plastic including polyethylene in any of the above embodiments the insert can include standard dimensions and can optionally be selected from a number of pre manufactured parts available in different sizes. In this setting the bone facing metal backed or ceramic or other material component will have an insert facing geometry that includes at least one or more standard dimensions or shapes to accommodate the standard dimensions or shape of the insert. The one or more standard dimensions of the outer component can be part of a locking mechanism interfacing with corresponding features on the insert. The one or more standard dimensions or shapes of the outer component can have a geometry or radii similar to those of the insert and designed to allow motion e.g. rotation or translation of the insert relative to the outer component.

More than one insert can be used e.g. a first insert locked into the outer component and a second insert allowing for motion between the first insert and the second insert and optionally between the second insert and an opposite articular surface or component e.g. a femoral head or neck component or stem.

Thus in a hip joint for example a metal backed or ceramic acetabular component can include external bone facing patient specific features and shapes while the internal insert facing shape can be standard. For example a standard polyethylene insert can be locked into a patient specific acetabular cup the acetabular cup has patient specific features or shapes on the external bone facing side while the internal dimensions or shape can be standard. The external bone facing patient specific features and shape can help achieve a desired implant orientation and or position including a desired anteversion or retroversion. The internal dimensions can be standard and can be designed with a locking feature to hold a standard insert in place. The standard insert locked into the acetabular metal backed or ceramic component can have a smooth round internal bearing surface to accommodate a second insert and allow for rotation of the second insert within the first insert. Alternatively a femoral head component can rotate internal to the bearing surface of the insert. The femoral head can be modular in design and it can for example be allowed to rotate on a mating femoral neck component. The femoral neck component can optionally also be modular and can be selected for the patient s anatomy e.g. using also an imaging test. Similarly the femoral stem can be selected using an imaging test. The imaging test can be used to select a stem or neck component with any one of the following three geometries matched adapted to or selected for the patient using one or more scan data 

In a shoulder joint for example a metal backed or ceramic glenoid component can include external bone facing patient specific features and shapes while the internal insert facing shape can be standard. For example a standard polyethylene insert can be locked into a patient specific glenoid component the glenoid component has patient specific features or shapes on the external bone facing side while the internal dimensions or shape can be standard. The external bone facing patient specific features and shape can help achieve a desired implant orientation and or position including a desired anteversion or retroversion. The internal dimensions can be standard and can be designed with a locking feature to hold a standard insert in place. The standard insert locked into the glenoid metal backed or ceramic component can have a smooth flat or concave bearing surface to articulate with a humeral head component. The humeral head component can optionally be modular in design. The humeral component can be selected for a patient adapted to a patient or designed for a patient using an imaging test. The imaging test can be used to select or adapt or design a shape with any one of the following three geometries matched adapted to or selected for the patient using the one or more scan data 

Optionally a resurfacing humeral head component can be used with at least portions of a bone facing surface selected for adapted to or designed for aspects of the patients humeral head shape.

Any of the implant components for a knee hip ankle shoulder elbow or wrist or other joint can be formed or adapted based on a pre existing blank. For example in a hip or a shoulder joint but principally also in any other joint or a spine an imaging test e.g. a CT or MRI can be obtained to generate information for example about the shape or dimensions of the acetabular fossa acetabulum or glenoid as well as any other portions of the joint. Various dimensions or shapes of the joint can be determined and a pre existing blank acetabular or glenoid component can then be selected. The shape of the pre existing blank acetabular or glenoid component can then be adapted to the patient s shape for example by selectively removing material e.g. with a machining or cutting or abrasion or other process or by adding material. The shape of the blank will generally be selected to be smaller than the target anatomy when material is added to achieve the patient adapted or patient specific implant features or surfaces. The shape of the blank will generally be selected to be larger than the target anatomy when material is removed to achieve the patient adapted or patient specific implant features or surfaces. Any manufacturing process known in the art or developed in the future can be used to add or remove material including for metals ceramics plastics and other materials.

An outer bone facing component can be adapted to or matched to the patient s anatomic features using a blank in this manner. Alternatively or additionally an insert can be adapted or shaped based on the patient s anatomic features in one or two or three dimensions. For example a standard insert e.g. with a standard locking mechanism into the outer component can be adapted so that its outer rim will not overhang the patient s anatomy e.g. a glenoid rim before or after a surgical alteration such as a cutting or reaming. The surgical alteration can in this example as well as in many of the foregoing and following embodiments be simulated on a computer and the insert blank can then be shaped based on the result of the simulation. Thus a glenoid insert as well as a metal backing can be adapted e.g. machined so that its perimeter will match the glenoid rim in at least a portion either before or after the surgical alteration of the glenoid. Similar adaptations are possible in any other joint including the hip knee ankle elbow and wrist.

Implant components can be attached to the underlying bone. Any attachment mechanism known in the art can be used e.g. pegs fins keels stems anchors pins and the like. The attachment mechanisms can be standard in at least one of shape size and location. Thus in a glenoid component an all polyethylene component can be used. Using imaging data the blank glenoid component can be aligned relative to the patient s glenoid optionally after a simulated surgical intervention to optimize the position of any standard attachment mechanisms relative to the bone to which they are intended to be attached. Once the optimal position of the glenoid blank and its attachment mechanisms has been selected the outer rim and optionally the bearing surface of the component can be adapted based on the patient s anatomy. Thus for example the outer periphery of the implant can be machined then to substantially align with portions of the patients glenoid rim.

In a tibial component an all polyethylene component or a metal backed component can be used. Using imaging data the blank tibial component can be aligned relative to the patient s tibial plateau medial lateral or both optionally after a simulated surgical intervention e.g. a tibial cut to optimize the position of any standard attachment mechanisms relative to the bone to which they are intended to be attached. Once the optimal position of the tibial blank and its attachment mechanisms has been selected the outer rim and optionally the bearing surface of the component can be adapted based on the patient s anatomy. Thus for example the outer periphery of the implant can be machined then to substantially align with portions of the patients cut tibial plateau.

In an acetabular component an all polyethylene component or a metal backed component can be used. Using imaging data the blank acetabular component can be aligned relative to the patient s acetabulum optionally after a simulated surgical intervention e.g. a reaming to optimize the position of any standard attachment mechanisms relative to the bone to which they are intended to be attached. Once the optimal position of the acetabular blank and its attachment mechanisms has been selected the outer rim and optionally the bearing surface of the component can be adapted based on the patient s anatomy. Thus for example the outer periphery of the implant can be machined then to substantially align with portions of the patient s reamed acetabulum.

Alternatively rather than using standard attachment mechanisms the position and orientation of any peg keel or other fixation features of acetabular or glenoid or femoral or tibial components or implant components in any other joint can be designed adapted shaped changed or optimized relative to the patient s geometry e.g. relative to the adjacent cortex or for example the center of a medullary cavity or other anatomic or geometric features. In a glenoid the length and width of the attachment mechanisms can be adapted to the mediolateral width of the glenoid or to the existing bone stock available or any other glenoid dimension e.g. superoinferior. In a hip the length and width of the attachment mechanisms can be adapted to the thickness of the acetabular wall or to the existing bone stock available in the underlying and adjacent bone structures including the acetabular roof. In a knee the position of pegs or keels or stems can be standard or can be patient specific or adapted based on the patient s anatomy.

The articular surface of a glenoid component can have a standard geometry in one or more dimensions or can be completely standard. The articular surface of the glenoid component can also include patient specific or patient derived shapes. For example the articular surface of the glenoid component can be derived using the curvature or shape of the cartilage or subchondral bone of the patient on the glenoid or the humeral side in one or more dimensions or directions. Alternatively the articular surface of a humeral component can be derived using the curvature or shape of the cartilage or subchondral bone of the patient on the humerus or glenoid in one or more dimensions or directions and the articular surface of the glenoid component can be selected or adapted or designed based on the humeral component implant shape. The selection adaption or design can occur using a set of rules e.g. desirable humeral to glenoid articular surface radius ratios in one or more planes e.g. superoinferior or mediolateral. The foregoing is applicable to any other joint in the body including knees hips ankles elbows and wrists.

In another embodiment the thickness of one or more implant components or portions of one or more implant components can be selected or adapted or designed based on one or more geometric features of a patient or patient weight or height or BMI or other patient specific characteristics e.g. gender lifestyle activity level etc. This selection or adaptation or design can be performed for any implant component in a knee hip ankle shoulder elbow wrist spine or other human joint.

For example in a knee a tibial component thickness can be selected adapted or designed based on one or more of a patient s femoral or tibial AP or ML dimensions femoral or tibial sagittal curvature femoral or tibial coronal curvature estimated contact area estimated contact stresses biomechanical loads optionally for different flexion and extension angles and the like. Both the metal thickness as well as the thickness of an optional insert can be selected adapted or designed using this or similar information. A femoral component thickness can be selected adapted or designed based on one or more of a patient s femoral or tibial AP or ML dimensions femoral or tibial sagittal curvature femoral or tibial coronal curvature estimated contact area estimated contact stresses biomechanical loads optionally for different flexion and extension angles and the like.

In a hip an acetabular component thickness can be selected adapted or designed based on one or more of a patient s femoral or acetabular AP or ML or SI dimensions femoral or acetabular sagittal curvature femoral or acetabular coronal curvature estimated contact area estimated contact stresses biomechanical loads optionally for different flexion and extension angles acetabular wall thickness and the like. The metal ceramic or plastic thickness as well as the thickness of an optional insert can be selected adapted or designed using this or similar information.

In a shoulder a glenoid component thickness can be selected adapted or designed based on one or more of a patient s humeral or glenoid AP or ML or SI dimensions humeral or glenoid sagittal curvature humeral or glenoid coronal curvature estimated contact area estimated contact stresses biomechanical loads optionally for different flexion and extension angles glenoid bone stock and the like. The metal ceramic or plastic thickness as well as the thickness of an optional insert can be selected adapted or designed using this or similar information.

Thus edge matching designing selecting or adapting implants including optionally lock features can be performed for implants used in any joint of the body. Imaging tests available for edge matching designing selecting or adapting implants include CT MRI radiography digital tomosynthesis cone beam CT ultrasound laser imaging isotope based imaging SPECT PET contrast enhanced imaging for any modality and any other imaging modality known in the art and developed in the future.

An implant component can include a fixed bearing design or a mobile bearing design. With a fixed bearing design a platform of the implant component is fixed and does not rotate. However with a mobile bearing design the platform of the implant component is designed to rotate e.g. in response to the dynamic forces and stresses on the joint during motion.

A rotating platform mobile bearing on the tibial implant component allows the implant to adjust and accommodate in an additional dimension during joint motion. However the additional degree of motion can contribute to soft tissue impingement and dislocation. Mobile bearings are described elsewhere for example in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0100462.

In certain embodiments an implant can include a mobile bearing implant that includes one or more patient specific features one or more patient engineered features and or one or more standard features. For example for a knee implant the knee implant can include a femoral implant component having a patient specific femoral intercondylar distance a tibial component having standard mobile bearing and a patient engineered perimeter based on the dimensions of the perimeter of the patient s cut tibia and allowing for rotation without significant extension beyond the perimeter of the patient s cut tibia and a tibial insert or top surface that is patient specific for at least the patient s intercondylar distance between the tibial insert dishes to accommodate the patient specific femoral intercondylar distance of the femoral implant.

As another example in certain embodiments a knee implant can include a femoral implant component that is patient specific with respect to a particular patient s M L dimension and standard with respect to the patient s femoral intercondylar distance a tibial component having a standard mobile bearing and a patient engineered perimeter based on the dimensions of the perimeter of the patient s cut tibia and allowing for rotation without significant extension beyond the perimeter of the patient s cut tibia and a tibial insert or top surface that includes a standard intercondylar distance between the tibial insert dishes to accommodate the standard femoral intercondylar distance of the femoral implant.

Mobile bearing implants will typically have three components. A first component attached to a first articular surface a second component attached to a second articular surface and a third component slideably or rotatably or combinations thereof engageable between said first and second components. The third component or also mobile bearing can be entirely engineered. It can also include patient derived patient engineered or patient specific features. For example the mobile bearing piece or component can include the following combinations 

Any combination of patient specific patient derived partially engineered or completely engineered in one or two or three dimensions is possible. For example in a knee the first direction can be a sagittal plane while the second direction can be a coronal plane. The sagittal curvature can be derived from the femur or the tibia or combinations thereof. Similarly the coronal curvature can be derived from the femur or the tibia or combinations thereof. In general a first curvature can be derived from a first or a second articular surface or combinations thereof. Similarly a second curvature can be derived from a first or a second articular surface or combinations thereof. All of the embodiments of presented in this application are all applicable to different joints patient specific patient derived patient matched or image based selected implants components mobile bearings and the like for any joint including the knee partial and total knee hip ankle foot toes shoulder elbow wrist hand fingers lumbar thoracic cervical spine facet joints temporomandibular joints for any partial or total replacement as well as hemi replacement or resurfacing implants on one or more articular surfaces.

Moreover the perimeter or shape of any mobile bearing component can be at least partially matched to the cortical bone cartilage subchondral bone cut bone one or more resection surfaces including after grinding or milling articular surface dimensions or shape including normal and diseased cartilage or one or more implant components that include one or more patient specific or derived or patient engineered features as described through the application.

The surgeon can optionally make adjustments of implant position and or orientation such as rotation bone cuts cut height and selected component thickness insert thickness or selected component shape or insert shape. In this manner an optimal compromise can be found for example between biomechanical alignment and joint laxity or biomechanical alignment and joint function e.g. in a knee joint flexion gap and extension gap. Thus multiple approaches exist for optimizing soft tissue tension ligament tension ligament balance and or flexion and extension gap. These include for example one or more of the exemplary options described in Table 15.

Any one option described in Table 15 can be optimized alone or in combination with one or more other options identified in the table and or known in the art for achieving different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external positions and different kinematic requirements.

In one embodiment the surgeon can initially optimize the femoral and tibial resections. Optimization can be performed by measuring soft tissue tension or ligament tension or balance for different flexion and extension angles or other joint positions before any bone has been resected once a first bone resection on a first articular surface has been made and after a second bone resection on a first or second articular surface has been made such as a femur and a tibia humerus and a glenoid femur and an acetabulum.

The position and orientation between a first implant component and a second opposing implant component or a first articular surface and a trial implant or a first trial implant and a second trial implant or an alignment guide and an instrument guide and any combinations thereof can be optimized with the use of for example interposed spacers wedges screws and other mechanical or electrical methods known in the art. A surgeon may desire to influence joint laxity as well as joint alignment. This can be optimized for different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external rotation angles. For this purpose spacers can be introduced at or between one or more steps in the implant procedure. One or more of the spacers can be attached or in contact with one or more instruments trials or optionally patient specific molds. The surgeon can intraoperatively evaluate the laxity or tightness of a joint using spacers with different thicknesses or one or more spacers with the same thickness. For example spacers can be applied in a knee joint in the presence of one or more trials or instruments or patient specific molds and the flexion gap can be evaluated with the knee joint in flexion. The knee joint can then be extended and the extension gap can be evaluated. Ultimately the surgeon selects for a given joint an optimal combination of spacers and trial or instrument or patient specific mold. A surgical cut guide can be applied to the trial or instrument or patient specific mold with the spacers optionally interposed between the trial or instrument or patient specific mold and the cut guide. In this manner the exact position of the surgical cuts can be influenced and can be adjusted to achieve an optimal result. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means for optimizing the position of the surgical cuts. For example expandable or ratchet like devices can be utilized that can be inserted into the joint or that can be attached or that can touch the trial or instrument or patient specific mold. Hinge like mechanisms are applicable. Similarly jack like mechanisms are useful. In principal any mechanical or electrical device useful for fine tuning the position of a cut guide relative to a trial or instrument or patient specific mold can be used.

A surgeon may desire to influence joint laxity as well as joint alignment. This can be optimized for different flexion and extension abduction or adduction internal and external rotation angles. For this purpose for example spacers can be introduced that are attached or that are in contact with one or more trials or instruments or patient specific molds. The surgeon can intraoperatively evaluate the laxity or tightness of a joint using spacers with different thickness or one or more spacers with the same thickness. For example spacers can be applied in a knee joint in the presence of one or more instruments or trials or molds and the flexion gap can be evaluated with the knee joint in flexion. Different thickness trials can be used. The terms spacer or insert can be used interchangeably with the term trial.

In certain embodiments the surgeon can elect to insert different trials or spacers or instruments of different thicknesses in the medial and or lateral joint space in a knee. This can be done before any bone has been resected once a first bone resection on a first articular surface has been made and after a second bone resection on a first or second articular surface has been made such as a femur and a tibia or a medial and a lateral condyle or a medial and a lateral tibia. The joint can be tested for soft tissue tension ligament tension ligament balance and or flexion or extension gap for different orientations or kinematic requirements using different medial and lateral trial or spacer thicknesses e.g. at different flexion and extension angles. Surgical bone cuts can subsequently optionally be adapted or changed. Alternatively different medial and lateral insert thickness or profiles or composite heights can be selected for the tibial component s . For example combinations of medial and lateral spacers or trials having thicknesses described in Table 16 can be inserted.

Thus by using separate medial and or lateral spacers or trials or inserts it is possible to determine an optimized combination of medial or lateral tibial components for example with regard to medial and lateral composite thickness insert thickness or medial and lateral implant or insert profile. Thus medial and or lateral tibial implant or component or insert thickness can be optimized for a desired soft tissue or ligament tension or ligament balance for different flexion and extension angles and other joint poses. This offers a unique benefit beyond traditional balancing using bone cuts and soft tissue releases. In one embodiment the surgeon can place the tibial and femoral surgical bone cuts and perform the proper soft tissue or ligament tensioning or balancing entirely via selection of a medial or lateral tibial insert or composite thickness and or profile. Additional adaptation and optimization of bone cuts and soft tissue releases is possible.

The sets of exemplary spacers trials and inserts described in connection with can be expanded to include spacers trials and or inserts having various intermediate thicknesses e.g. in increments of 0.5 mm 0.25 mm and or 0.1 mm and or having various other selection features. For example sets of femoral and or tibial insert trials can include different bone facing and or joint facing surfaces from which the surgeon can select the optimum available surface for further steps in the procedure.

Using the various spacers trials and inserts described above the knee joint can be flexed and the flexion gap can be evaluated. In addition the knee can be extended and the extension gap can be evaluated. Ultimately the surgeon will select an optimal combination of spacers or trials for a given joint instrument trial or mold. A surgical cut guide can be applied to the trial instrument or mold with the spacers optionally interposed between the trial instrument or mold and the cut guide. In this manner the exact position of the surgical cuts can be influenced and can be adjusted to achieve an optimal result. Someone skilled in the art will recognize other means for optimizing the position of the surgical cuts. For example expandable or ratchet like devices can be utilized that can be inserted into the joint or that can be attached or that can touch the trial instrument or mold. Hinge like mechanisms are applicable. Similarly jack like mechanisms are useful. In principal any mechanical or electrical device useful for fine tuning the position of the cut guide relative to the trial or instrument or molds can be used. The trials or instruments or molds and any related instrumentation such as spacers or ratchets can be combined with a tensiometer to provide a better intraoperative assessment of the joint. The tensiometer can be utilized to further optimize the anatomic alignment and tightness or laxity of the joint and to improve postoperative function and outcomes. Optionally local contact pressures may be evaluated intraoperatively for example using a sensor like the ones manufactured by Tekscan South Boston Mass.

A variety of traditional guide tools are available to assist surgeons in preparing a joint for an implant for example for resectioning one or more of a patient s biological structures during a joint implant procedure. However these traditional guide tools typically are not designed to match the shape contour of a particular patient s biological structure s . Moreover these traditional guide tools typically are not designed to impart patient optimized placement for the resection cuts. Thus using and properly aligning traditional guide tools as well as properly aligning a patient s limb e.g. in rotational alignment in varus or valgus alignment or alignment in another dimension in order to orient these traditional guide tools can be an imprecise and complicated part of the implant procedure.

Certain embodiments described herein provide improved surgical guide tools and methods for preparing a patient s biological structure during a joint implant procedure.

Certain embodiments include a guide tool having at least one patient specific bone facing surface portion that substantially negatively matches at least a portion of a biological surface at the patient s joint. The guide tool further can include at least one aperture for directing movement of a surgical instrument for example a securing pin or a cutting tool. One or more of the apertures can be designed to guide the surgical instrument to deliver a patient optimized placement for for example a securing pin or resection cut. In addition or alternatively one or more of the apertures can be designed to guide the surgical instrument to deliver a standard placement for for example a securing pin or resection cut. As used herein jig also can refer to guide tools for example to guide tools that guide resectioning of a patient s biological structure. Alternatively certain guide tools can be used for purposes other than guiding a drill or cutting tool. For example balancing and trial guide tools can be used to assess knee alignment and or fit of one or more implant components or inserts.

Certain embodiments can include a guide tool that includes at least one patient specific bone facing surface that substantially negatively matches at least a portion of a biological surface at the patient s joint. The patient s biological surface can include cartilage bone tendon and or other biological surface. For example in certain embodiments patient specific data such as imaging data of a patient s joint can be used to select and or design an area on the articular surface that is free of articular cartilage. The area can be free of articular cartilage because it was never cartilage covered or because the overlying cartilage has been worn away. The imaging test can be specifically used to identify areas of full or near full thickness cartilage loss for designing the contact surface on the bone facing surface of a patient specific guide tool. Alternatively the area can be free of articular cartilage because an osteophyte has formed and is extending outside the cartilage. The guide tool then can rest directly on the bone e.g. subchondral bone marrow bone endosteal bone or an osteophyte. By selecting and or designing an area of the articular surface that is free of articular cartilage it is possible to a reference the guide tool against the articular surface and b reference it against bone rather than cartilage.

In certain embodiments patient specific data such as imaging test data of a patient s joint can be used to identify a contact area on the articular surface for deriving an area on the bone facing surface of a guide tool to substantially negatively match the contact area on the subchondral bone surface. While the area may be covered by articular cartilage the guide tool surface area can be specifically designed to match the subchondral bone contact area. The guide tool can have one or multiple areas that substantially negatively match one or multiple contact areas on the subchondral bone surface. Intraoperatively the surgeon can elect to place the guide tool on the residual cartilage. Optionally the surgeon then can mark the approximate contact area on the cartilage and remove the overlying cartilage in the marked area before replacing the guide tool directly onto the subchondral bone. In this manner the surgeon can achieve more accurate placement of the guide tools that substantially negatively matches subchondral bone.

In certain embodiments patient specific data such as imaging test data of a patient s joint can be used to identify a contact area on the articular surface for deriving an area on the bone facing surface of a guide tool that substantially negatively matches the endosteal bone or bone marrow contact area. While the area may be covered by articular cartilage the guide tool surface area can be specifically designed to match the endosteal bone or bone marrow. The guide tool can have one or multiple areas that substantially negatively match one or multiple areas on the endosteal bone or bone marrow. Intraoperatively the surgeon can elect to place the guide tool on the residual cartilage. Optionally the surgeon then can mark the approximate contact area on the cartilage and subsequently remove the overlying cartilage in the marked area before replacing the guide tool directly onto the endosteal bone or bone marrow. In this manner the surgeon can achieve more accurate placement of guide tools that match endosteal bone or bone marrow.

In certain embodiment the articular surface or the margins of the articular surface can include one or more osteophytes. The guide tool can rest on the articular surface e.g. on at least one of normal cartilage diseased cartilage or subchondral bone and it can include the shape of the osteophyte. In certain embodiments patient specific data such as imaging test data of a patient s joint can be used to derive an area on the bone facing surface of the guide tool that substantially negatively matches the patient s articular surface including the osteophyte. In this manner the osteophyte can provide additional anatomic referencing for placing the guide tool. In certain embodiments the osteophyte can be virtually removed from the joint on the 2D or 3D images and the contact surface of the guide tool can be derived based on the corrected surface without the osteophyte. In this setting the surgeon can remove the osteophyte intraoperatively prior to placing the guide tool.

Certain embodiments can include a guide tool that is flexible. The guide tool s flexibility optionally in combination with a patient specific bone facing surface can allow it to snap fit into position onto the patient s biological structure. For example the guide tool can be snap fit to a patient s biological structure by applying force to the guide tool to cause it to expand and engage the structure. During or following the expansion and engagement the tool can be adjusted so that the bone facing surface engages the corresponding surface of the biological structure.

The flexibility of the guide tool can be altered or enhanced using materials and processes known in the art. For example various types and or combinations of polymers and polymer manufacturing techniques can be used to make a guide tool with the appropriate flexibility to provide a snap fit.

The bone facing surface of the guide tool can be patient specific e.g. substantially negatively match for one or more surface dimensions or features of the patient s biological surface including for example width area height distance angle and curvature. For example in certain embodiments a dimension or feature of the patient s biological structure can be assessed to include the cartilage on its surface. In certain other embodiments a dimension or feature can be assessed based on the patient s bone surface for example subchondral bone surface.

If a subchondral bone surface is used to assess the patient s biological surface a standard cartilage thickness e.g. 2 mm or an approximate cartilage thickness derived from patient specific data e.g. age joint size contralateral joint measurements etc. can be used as part of the design for the guide tool for example to design the size and bone facing surface of the guide tool. The standard or approximate cartilage thickness can vary in thickness across the assessed surface area. In certain embodiments this design can be used with a similarly designed implant for example an implant designed to include a standard or approximate cartilage thickness.

In certain embodiments one or more guide tools described herein can include markings to identify relevant features for example alignment indicators for anatomical and or biomechanical axes. Such markings can intraoperatively guide a surgeon in the installation procedure. For example a guide tool can include on its surface alignment indicators for the patient s Whiteside s AP trochlear line the transepicondylar axis TEA and the posterior condylar axis PEA and or the mechanical axis of the tibia or femur. In certain embodiments two or more guide tools are designed to include markings that can be aligned to confirm proper placement of one or both guide tools optionally by referencing a common feature such as a common mechanical axis. These indicators can be in colors and or in raised geometries to strengthen the guide tool.

In certain embodiments a guide tool includes at least one feature for directing a surgical instrument to deliver a patient engineered feature to the patient s biological structure for example a resected hole or a resection cut for engaging a patient engineered implant peg or a patient engineered implant bone facing surface. In addition to the patient engineered feature in certain embodiments one or more of the guide tool s bone facing surfaces can be designed to be patient specific so that it substantially negatively matches a portion of the patient s joint surface. In addition or alternatively one or more of the guide tool s bone facing surfaces can be standard in shape.

Example 14 below describes a set of patient optimized guide tools that can be used to perform patient optimized resection cuts to the femur in preparation for implanting a femoral knee implant component having patient optimized bone cuts. As described in Example 14 one or more guide tools can be used to prepare a joint for a patient engineered implant.

The guide tools described herein can include any combination of patient specific features patient engineered features and or standard features. For example a patient specific guide tool includes at least one feature that is preoperatively designed and or selected to substantially match one or more of the patient s biological features. A patient engineered guide tool includes at least one feature that is designed or selected based on patient specific data to optimize one or more of the patient s biological features to meet one or more parameters for example as described elsewhere here such as in Section 4. A standard guide tool includes at least one feature that is selected from among a family of limited options for example selected from among a family of 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 options. Accordingly any one guide tool can be both patient specific in view of its patient specific features and patient engineered in view of its patient engineered features. Such a guide tool also can include standard features as well. Table 17 describes the various combinations of three features of a single guide tool with regard to being patient specific features patient engineered features and or standard features of the exemplary guide tools. Moreover in certain embodiments a set or kit of guide tools is provided in which certain guide tools in the set or kit include patient specific patient engineered and or standard features. For example a set or kit of guide tools can include any two or more guide tools described in Table 17.

A guide tool can be used for one or more purposes during an implant procedure. For example one or more guide tools can be used to establish resected holes in a patient s biological structure to establish resected cuts in a patient s biological structure and or to balance or estimate fit of a joint implant. The following subsections describe exemplary guide tools and guide tool features that can help to establish resected holes to establish resected cuts and to balance or estimate fit of a joint implant.

As shown in a guide tool can include one or more apertures for establishing resected holes in a patient s biological structure. One or more of these resected holes can be used to engage a peg which can be used to secure one or more subsequently used guide tools e.g. guide tools for establishing resection cuts into proper position on the biological surface. For example a subsequently used guide tool can include one or more attached pegs that correspond to the one or more holes resected using for example using the guide tool of . In particular the subsequently used guide tool can be secured onto the biological surface by sliding the pegs into the appropriate resected holes. Alternatively an independent peg can be placed into the resected hole and then a subsequently used guide tool having apertures corresponding to the independent pegs can be secured onto the biological surface by sliding the apertures over the independent pegs. In certain embodiments the exemplary guide tool shown in can include anterior and posterior portions that are extended and the material is pliable so that the guide tool can snap fit onto the femur.

In certain embodiments one or more attached pegs i.e. attached to a guide tool can be detachable so that once detached they can be used to secure a subsequent guide tool or implant component having a corresponding aperture. In certain embodiments a first guide tool can be secured to the biological structure and a second guide can be secured to the first guide tool. For example an attached or independent peg can extend from the resected hole through the aperture of the first guide tool and into a corresponding aperture of the second guide tool. Alternatively or in addition the second guide tool can include a feature that engages an aspect of the aperture on the first implant. For example a portion of the aperture on the second guide tool can be wider than the aperture on the first guide tool and engage a raised aperture collar surrounding the aperture on the first guide tool. Alternatively the second aperture can include a sleeve that slide into the aperture on the first guide tool.

Alternatively or in addition one or more of these resected holes can be used to secure an implant component. For example one or more pegs projecting from the bone facing surface of the implant component can be placed into the resected hole to fix the placement of the implant component. In certain embodiments cement can be applied to the resected hole and or the implant component peg to secure the placement of the implant.

A variety of aperture configurations can be used for the guide tools described herein. In certain embodiments a guide tool aperture configuration can be patient engineered to engage a particular patient engineered peg configuration on the corresponding implant component. Moreover aperture features such as size shape angle and optionally stop depth can be designed to substantially match the peg features for the corresponding implant component. For example in certain embodiments the aperture cross section can be round to match a round peg on the implant component. However in certain embodiments as suggested by the aperture cross section can include a or cross like configuration to match the corresponding peg on the implant component.

A variety of aperture sizes can be used. For example a 7 mm diameter aperture can be used. Moreover the aperture can be oriented to establish a resected hole at any angle. For example an aperture can be oriented to establish a resected hole in line with the femoral mechanical axis. Alternatively an aperture can be oriented to establish a resected hole at an anterior leaning angle to match the angle of the corresponding implant peg. For example one or more apertures can be oriented anteriorly to establish a 5 degree 5 10 degree 10 degree 10 15 degree and or 15 degree anterior leaning angle relative to the femoral mechanism axis. The aperture can be oriented to establish a resected hole that is oriented at the same angle or at different angles as one or both of the anterior and posterior cuts of the implant component. In certain embodiments a depth stop can be used so that the aperture allows a resected hole having a certain maximum depth.

In certain embodiments a guide tool includes at least one moveable aperture and optionally a moveable corresponding bushing. depicts a guide tool having a moveable lateral aperture and bushing. Specifically the lateral aperture and bushing in the figure are moveable in the A P direction. However a moveable aperture and optionally a moveable bushing can be moveable in the A P direction in the M L direction or in all directions from the aperture center e.g. can be rotated in a circular pattern . Moreover the guide tool can include two or more moveable apertures. For example a lateral aperture and a medial aperture and optionally one or both corresponding bushings can be moveable. Alternatively one or more apertures and optional bushings can be fixed for example as is the medial aperture and bushing in .

The guide tool that includes one or more moveable apertures also can include one or more patient specific features one or more patient optimized features and or one or more standard features. Moreover the guide tool can be used with a subsequently used guide tool or implant that includes one or more patient specific features one or more patient optimized features and or one or more standard features.

A guide tool that includes one or more moveable apertures for establishing resected holes can be used during surgery to adjust the orientation of subsequently placed guide tools and or implant components. For example one or more moveable apertures in a femoral guide tool can be used to adjust the femoral flexion femoral rotation and or tibial external rotation of the particular patient s femoral implant.

With reference to the exemplary guide tool shown in a surgeon can snap fit the guide tool on the femur observe placement of the moveable aperture as well as other guide tool features relative to one or more biological landmarks and if appropriate move the moveable aperture in order to adjust the orientation of the subsequently installed femoral implant component on the femur. For example if the surgeon moves the lateral aperture posteriorly to the 3 degree mark as shown in the figure the lateral resected hole and engaging lateral peg of the subsequently installed femoral implant component also would be shifted posteriorly. With the medial aperture fixed this would posteriorly flex the lateral side of the implant component and axially rotate the orientation of the implant component on the femur. As shown in the movable bushing can be limited to one or more ranges of motion and can be accompanied by markings and or values displayed on the tool surface indicating the rotation in relation to one or more axes. Moreover in certain embodiments patient specific information and or standard rules can be used to limit the extent of movement of the moveable aperture. For example the limit of posterior movement of the aperture in the guide tool can be established as the point that allows a subsequent guide tool to guide a lateral posterior bone resection that removes some minimum amount of bone for example so that the intersect between the posterior resection cut and posterior chamfer cut is below the bone surface.

In certain embodiments the movable aperture also could allow for a balancing technique. For example a navigation chip can be placed into the lateral joint in flexion e.g. as a laminar spreader. This rotates the femur internally and the joint gap can be balanced by moving the lateral aperture for example posteriorly. In various embodiments multiple combinations of the tools necessary for accomplishing these techniques can be integrated or incorporated into a single system allowing the surgeon to decide which he wants to utilize right there at the surgery.

In certain embodiments the extent limit of movement of the moveable aperture in the A P direction can be limited to 3 degrees less than 3 degrees 5 degrees less than 5 degrees 7 degrees and or less than 7 degrees.

In certain embodiments instead of including a moveable aperture the guide tool can include one or more alternative apertures and or an extended opening for example and opening that includes the approximate area through which a moveable aperture can move. Then a bushing e.g. metal or plastic or other device can snap slide or lock into place onto one of the alternative apertures or at a certain location in the extended opening. For example the bushing or other device could lock into place at alternative apertures or in the extended opening at 3 5 and 7 degrees. In this way the surgeon can alter the implant orientation as he or she deems appropriate. Alternatively a guide tool can include an aperture bushing that is fixed in one location but can swivel e.g. tilt . For example in certain embodiments a bushing can swivel or tilt in one direction in two directions or all directions about a fixed point. The amount of swivel or tilt can be for example between 0 and 7 degrees up to 7 degrees between 1 and 7 degrees and or between 3 and 7 degrees in one or more directions.

The guide tools described herein can include features and apertures for various steps in a joint replacement procedure. For example in certain embodiments one or more guide tools can be used to establish all the resection cuts associated with installation of a particular implant component. As noted above one or more of the guide tools can include one more patient specific features and or one or more patient engineered features and or one or more standard features.

In certain embodiments a set of three guide tools can be used to establish all the resection cuts associated with installation of a particular implant component. For example the three guide tools shown in and can be used together to establish all the resection cuts associated with installation of a femoral implant component. In particular each shows a peg hole driver guide tool for establishing pin or peg holes for subsequent guide tools and optionally for the femoral implant component. This tool can be used to establish the direction of pegs used by subsequent tools and or the implant component and can be specifically matched to the patient just like the implant component. Subsequently placed guide tools can be placed with respect to these peg hole features to ensure that the bone preparation is performed per the intended implant design. shows a guide tool for making distal and posterior resection cuts to the distal femur and show two options for a third guide tool for making anterior and posterior chamfer cuts. The particular set of guide tools shown in these figures is designed for a tibia first technique however the features of the guide tools for preparing a knee joint as described herein can be applied to both a tibia first technique and to a femur first technique.

Furthermore a spacer such as a lateral spacer can be used for balancing to equal distal asymmetry. The spacer can include patient specific and or patient engineered features. A series of balancer chips with thicknesses can be included for example a series of chips having 1 mm increases in thickness. Alternatively or in addition a guide tool can include an integrated spacer thickness to allow surgeon to assess tension without needing a spacer. For example a guide tool for establishing femoral resection cuts can include an integrated space having a tibial resection depth added to the guide tool external surface.

One or more guide tools can be selected and or designed to include patient specific and or patient engineered features. For example the peg hole driver guide tool shown in can include at least in part a patient specific bone facing surface that substantially matches a particular patient s femoral surface. Moreover such guide tools can include flexible material such as nylon plastic to allow the tool to snap fit onto the particular patient s femur as suggested by the peg hole driver guide tool shown in . Other features such as peg hole angle peg hole placement peg hole size tool thickness joint facing surface and other features can be patient specific or patient engineered. Alternatively or in addition one or more features can be standard. For example for the peg hole driver guide tool shown in the peg size is 6 mm which can accommodate a quarter inch drill size however any peg hole size can be used.

Resection cut guide tools can be designed to be patient specific on their bone facing surface to allow a snap fit onto a particular patient s femur. Moreover other features such as thickness joint facing surface and peg placement and size also can be patient specific or patient engineered. Alternatively or in addition one or more features can be standard. The cut guide tool shown in can be designed to rest on 2 mm thick cartilage relative to CT data and can include a standard tool thickness of 4 mm however other standard thicknesses can be used for example a 2 mm or a 3 mm thickness. Moreover the cut guide tool shown in can include three optional pin placements for stabilization and a posterior beam to give stability and rigidity to the tool. The lateral spacer shown on the left side of can rest on cut tibia to approximate the thickness of asymmetry.

The cut tools shown in are designed to follow the cut tool shown in and can complete the remaining chamfer cuts for the distal femur. Each of the cut tools shown in the figure includes two pin placements for stabilization. The tool on the left includes short pegs to be positioned in the peg holes established by a peg hole driver guide tool for example as shown in . The tool on the right includes no lateral peg to allow for external rotation of the guide tool to establish rotated chamfer cuts.

In certain embodiments fewer than three guide tools for example two guide tools or one guide tool can be used to establish the peg holes and all the resection cuts associated with installation of a particular implant component. For example the single guide tool shown in can be used to establish all the resection cuts associated with installation of a femoral implant component including for example a distal cut with one more facets a posterior cut with one or more facets an anterior cut an anterior chamfer cut with one or more facets one or more posterior chamfer cuts each with one or more facets and one or more step cuts for example between two facets of a cut. The apertures e.g. holes and slots in the guide tool and edges of the guide tools can be used to guide peg hole placement and resection cuts. For example the posterior surface of the guide tool shown in can be used to establish the posterior resection cuts. Optional guide tool attachments can be used to enhance the guidance for one or more of the cutting holes or slots in the cut guide tool. For example the optional guide tool attachments shown in can be used to enhance one or more cutting or drilling surfaces.

One or more resection cut slots in a particular guide tool can be substantially horizontal substantially diagonal or substantially vertical for example as compared to the patient s mechanical axis and or anatomical axis. Moreover one or more of the resection cut slots can allow for a complete resection cut or a partial resection cut e.g. scoring of the patient s bone to establish a resection cut that can be finished after removing the tool. This approach can be advantageous by allowing for faster resection in the absence of the guide tool. Moreover one or more resection cut slots can include a blade depth stop. This is particularly useful for step resection cuts for example vertical step resection cuts that connect two facets or planes of a resected surface.

In certain embodiments one or more guide tools described herein can include markings to identify relevant features for example alignment indicators for anatomical and or biomechanical axes. Such markings can intraoperatively guide a surgeon in the installation procedure. For example the guide tool shown in includes on its surface alignment indicators for the patient s Whiteside s AP trochlear line the transepicondylar axis TEA and the posterior condylar axis PEA . These indicators can be in colors and or in raised geometries to strengthen the guide tool.

Moreover as shown in resection cut apertures on a guide tool can include numbers or other instructions to direct a surgeon in the proper resection procedure.

Guide tools for establishing tibial resection cuts can include one or more patient specific features and or one or more patient engineered features and or one or more standard features. For example the bone facing surface of a tibial resection guide tool can include patient specific features that conform to the uncut tibial surface e.g. bone and or cartilage surface. Embodiments of patient specific tibial resection guide tools are shown in and in .

As shown in one or more additional guide tools can be included and used to remove additional bone from the proximal surface of the tibia. For example as shown in the figure an additional guide tool can provide a 2 mm deeper resection than is available with a first guide tool. Alternatively one or more additional guide tools can allow for resection of an additional 1 mm 3 mm 4 mm and or 5 mm or any amount in between these values off the patient s proximal tibia. A single additional guide tool can include one or more resection slots to allow for more than one additional resection depth to be achieved with that single guide tool. The one or more additional guide tools can include one or more patient specific features one or more patient engineered features and one or more standard features.

Various methods can be used to allow for intraoperative rotation of the tibial implant component during installation of the implant. Being able to rotate and install a rotated tibial implant component can be important in balancing the joint with the implant. One example of a method for intraoperatively preparing a rotated tibial implant component is shown in . In particular show the front and back views of the same tibial guide tool to resect into the cut tibial surface to create a notch for accepting the keel of a tibial implant component. each additionally show an insert with holes for guiding a drilling tool. The holes in each figure are oriented at different angles. Specifically the insert in can create holes at a 0 degree rotation angle the insert in can create holes at a 5 degree rotation angle and the insert in can create holes at a 10 degree rotation angle. Accordingly by supplying along with the guide tool a series of inserts with holes at various angles the resected holes and subsequent notch can be rotated at any desired angle for which an insert has been supplied which in turn will rotate the tibial implant component by the same angle as its keel is placed into the notch. Inserts can be included to have any degree of rotated holes for example inserts can be included to rotate the notch and implant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 degrees or more. Any number of inserts with different hole rotations can be included. In certain embodiments the maximum rotation for a given tibial implant component can be calculated as the rotation at which an undersized component perimeter extends beyond i.e. overhangs the perimeter of the patient s cut tibial surface and inserts can be limited to this maximum rotation. show the same front view of the guide tools and inserts shown in and in addition show front and back view of three exemplary inserts. As shown in the figures in certain embodiments the inserts can include differently keyed insert shapes.

The step of designing an implant component and or guide tool as described herein can include both configuring one or more features measurements and or dimensions of the implant and or guide tool e.g. derived from patient specific data from a particular patient and adapted for the particular patient and manufacturing the implant. In certain embodiments manufacturing can include making the implant component and or guide tool from starting materials for example metals and or polymers or other materials in solid e.g. powders or blocks or liquid form. In addition or alternatively in certain embodiments manufacturing can include altering e.g. machining an existing implant component and or guide tool for example a standard blank implant component and or guide tool or an existing implant component and or guide tool e.g. selected from a library . The manufacturing techniques to making or altering an implant component and or guide tool can include any techniques known in the art today and in the future. Such techniques include but are not limited to additive as well as subtractive methods i.e. methods that add material for example to a standard blank and methods that remove material for example from a standard blank.

Various technologies appropriate for this purpose are known in the art for example as described in 2009 Wohlers Associates 2009 ISBN 0 9754429 5 3 available from the web www.wohlersassociates.com Pham and Dimov Springer Verlag 2001 ISBN 1 85233 360 X Grenda 3 Castle Island Co. 2009 Bidanda and Bartolo Eds.

Exemplary techniques for adapting an implant to a patient s anatomy include but are not limited to those shown in Table 18.

Implant components generated by different techniques can be assessed and compared for their accuracy of shape relative to the intended shape design for their mechanical strength and for other factors. In this way different manufacturing techniques can supply another consideration for achieving an implant component design with one or more target features. For example if accuracy of shape relative to the intended shape design is critical to a particular patient s implant component design then the manufacturing technique supplying the most accurate shape can be selected. If a minimum implant thickness is critical to a particular patient s implant component design then the manufacturing technique supplying the highest mechanical strength and therefore allowing the most minimal implant component thickness can be selected. Branner et al. describe a method a method for the design and optimization of additive layer manufacturing through a numerical coupled field simulation based on the finite element analysis FEA . Branner s method can be used for assessing and comparing product mechanical strength generated by different additive layer manufacturing techniques for example SLM DMLS and LC.

In certain embodiments an implant can include components and or implant component parts produced via various methods. For example in certain embodiments for a knee implant the knee implant can include a metal femoral implant component produced by casting or by an additive manufacturing technique and having a patient specific femoral intercondylar distance a tibial component cut from a blank and machined to be patient specific for the perimeter of the patient s cut tibia and a tibial insert having a standard lock and a top surface that is patient specific for at least the patient s intercondylar distance between the tibial insert dishes to accommodate the patient specific femoral intercondylar distance of the femoral implant.

As another example in certain embodiments a knee implant can include a metal femoral implant component produced by casting or by an additive manufacturing technique that is patient specific with respect to a particular patient s M L dimension and standard with respect to the patient s femoral intercondylar distance a tibial component cut from a blank and machined to be patient specific for the perimeter of the patient s cut tibia and a tibial insert having a standard lock and a top surface that includes a standard intercondylar distance between the tibial insert dishes to accommodate the standard femoral intercondylar distance of the femoral implant.

A wide variety of materials find use in the practice of the embodiments described herein including but not limited to plastics metals crystal free metals ceramics biological materials e.g. collagen or other extracellular matrix materials hydroxyapatite cells e.g. stem cells chondrocyte cells or the like or combinations thereof. Based on the information e.g. measurements obtained regarding the defect and the articular surface and or the subchondral bone a repair material can be formed or selected. Further using one or more of these techniques described herein a cartilage replacement or regenerating material having a curvature that will fit into a particular cartilage defect will follow the contour and shape of the articular surface and will match the thickness of the surrounding cartilage. The repair material can include any combination of materials and typically includes at least one non pliable material for example materials that are not easily bent or changed.

Currently joint repair systems often employ metal and or polymeric materials including for example prostheses which are anchored into the underlying bone e.g. a femur in the case of a knee prosthesis . See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 203 576 to Afriat et al. issued Mar. 20 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 322 588 to Ogle et al. issued Nov. 27 2001 and references cited therein. A wide variety of metals is useful in the practice of the embodiments described herein and can be selected based on any criteria. For example material selection can be based on resiliency to impart a desired degree of rigidity. Non limiting examples of suitable metals include silver gold platinum palladium iridium copper tin lead antimony bismuth zinc titanium cobalt stainless steel nickel iron alloys cobalt alloys such as Elgiloy a cobalt chromium nickel alloy and MP35N a nickel cobalt chromiummolybdenum alloy and Nitinol T a nickel titanium alloy aluminum manganese iron tantalum crystal free metals such as Liquidmetal alloys available from LiquidMetal Technologies www.liquidmetal.com other metals that can slowly form polyvalent metal ions for example to inhibit calcification of implanted substrates in contact with a patient s bodily fluids or tissues and combinations thereof.

Suitable synthetic polymers include without limitation polyamides e.g. nylon polyesters polystyrenes polyacrylates vinyl polymers e.g. polyethylene polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride polycarbonates polyurethanes poly dimethyl siloxanes cellulose acetates polymethyl methacrylates polyether ether ketones ethylene vinyl acetates polysulfones nitrocelluloses similar copolymers and mixtures thereof. Bioresorbable synthetic polymers can also be used such as dextran hydroxyethyl starch derivatives of gelatin polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol poly N 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide poly hydroxy acids poly epsilon caprolactone polylactic acid polyglycolic acid poly dimethyl glycolic acid poly hydroxy butyrate and similar copolymers.

Other appropriate materials include for example the polyketone known as polyetheretherketone . This includes the material PEEK 450G which is an unfilled PEEK approved for medical implantation available from Victrex of Lancashire Great Britain. Victrex is located at www.matweb.com or see Boedeker www.boedeker.com . Other sources of this material include Gharda located in Panoli India www.ghardapolymers.com .

It should be noted that the material selected can also be filled. For example other grades of PEEK are also available and contemplated such as 30 glass filled or 30 carbon filled provided such materials are cleared for use in implantable devices by the FDA or other regulatory body. Glass filled PEEK reduces the expansion rate and increases the flexural modulus of PEEK relative to that portion which is unfilled. The resulting product is known to be ideal for improved strength stiffness or stability. Carbon filled PEEK is known to enhance the compressive strength and stiffness of PEEK and lower its expansion rate. Carbon filled PEEK offers wear resistance and load carrying capability.

As will be appreciated other suitable similarly biocompatible thermoplastic or thermoplastic polycondensate materials that resist fatigue have good memory are flexible are deflectable have very low moisture absorption and or have good wear and or abrasion resistance can be used. The implant can also be comprised of polyetherketoneketone PEKK .

Other materials that can be used include polyetherketone PEK polyetherketoneetherketoneketone PEKEKK and polyetheretherketoneketone PEEKK and generally a polyaryletheretherketone. Further other polyketones can be used as well as other thermoplastics.

Reference to appropriate polymers that can be used for the implant can be made to the following documents all of which are incorporated herein by reference. These documents include PCT Publication WO 02 02158 A1 dated Jan. 10 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials PCT Publication WO 02 00275 A1 dated Jan. 3 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials and PCT Publication WO 02 00270 A1 dated Jan. 3 2002 and entitled Bio Compatible Polymeric Materials.

The polymers can be prepared by any of a variety of approaches including conventional polymer processing methods. Preferred approaches include for example injection molding which is suitable for the production of polymer components with significant structural features and rapid prototyping approaches such as reaction injection molding and stereo lithography. The substrate can be textured or made porous by either physical abrasion or chemical alteration to facilitate incorporation of the metal coating. Other processes are also appropriate such as extrusion injection compression molding and or machining techniques. Typically the polymer is chosen for its physical and mechanical properties and is suitable for carrying and spreading the physical load between the joint surfaces.

More than one metal and or polymer can be used in combination with each other. For example one or more metal containing substrates can be coated with polymers in one or more regions or alternatively one or more polymer containing substrate can be coated in one or more regions with one or more metals.

The system or prosthesis can be porous or porous coated. The porous surface components can be made of various materials including metals ceramics and polymers. These surface components can in turn be secured by various means to a multitude of structural cores formed of various metals. Suitable porous coatings include but are not limited to metal ceramic polymeric e.g. biologically neutral elastomers such as silicone rubber polyethylene terephthalate and or combinations thereof or combinations thereof. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 605 123 to Hahn issued Sep. 20 1971. U.S. Pat. No. 3 808 606 to Tronzo issued May 7 1974 and U.S. Pat. No. 3 843 975 to Tronzo issued Oct. 29 1974 U.S. Pat. No. 3 314 420 to Smith issued Apr. 18 1967 U.S. Pat. No. 3 987 499 to Scharbach issued Oct. 26 1976 and German Offenlegungsschrift 2 306 552. There can be more than one coating layer and the layers can have the same or different porosities. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 938 198 to Kahn et al. issued Feb. 17 1976.

The coating can be applied by surrounding a core with powdered polymer and heating until cured to form a coating with an internal network of interconnected pores. The tortuosity of the pores e.g. a measure of length to diameter of the paths through the pores can be important in evaluating the probable success of such a coating in use on a prosthetic device. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4 213 816 to Morris issued Jul. 22 1980. The porous coating can be applied in the form of a powder and the article as a whole subjected to an elevated temperature that bonds the powder to the substrate. Selection of suitable polymers and or powder coatings can be determined in view of the teachings and references cited herein for example based on the melt index of each.

Example 17 illustrates an exemplary anterior cut method.

This example describes an exemplary process for selecting and or designing a patient adapted total knee implant for example a knee implant having one or more patient specific and or patient engineered based on patient specific data. The steps described in this process can be performed in any order and can be performed more than once in a particular process. For example one or more steps can be reiterated and refined a second third or more times before during or after performing other steps or sets of steps in the process. While this process specifically describes steps for selecting and or designing a patient specific total knee implant it can be adapted to design other embodiments for example patient adapted bicompartmental knee implants unicompartmental knee implants and implants for shoulders and hips vertebrae and other joints.

The exemplary process shown in includes four general steps and optionally can include a fifth general step. Each general step includes various specific steps. The general steps are identified as 1 5 in the figure. These steps can be performed virtually for example by using one or more computers that have or can receive patient specific data and specifically configured software or instructions to perform such steps.

In general step 1 limb alignment and deformity corrections are determined to the extent that either is needed for a specific patient s situation. In general step 2 the requisite tibial and femoral dimensions of the implant components are determined based on patient specific data obtained for example from image data of the patient s knee.

In general step 3 bone preservation is maximized by virtually determining a resection cut strategy for the patient s femur and or tibia that provides minimal bone loss optionally while also meeting other user defined parameters such as for example maintaining a minimum implant thickness using certain resection cuts to help correct the patient s misalignment removing diseased or undesired portions of the patient s bone or anatomy and or other parameters. This general step can include one or more of the steps of i simulating resection cuts on one or both articular sides e.g. on the femur and or tibia ii applying optimized cuts across one or both articular sides iii allowing for non co planar and or non parallel femoral resection cuts e.g. on medial and lateral corresponding portions of the femur and optionally non co planar and or non parallel tibial resection cuts e.g. on medial and lateral corresponding portions of the tibia and iv maintaining and or determining minimal material thickness. The minimal material thickness for the implant selection and or design can be an established threshold for example as previously determined by a finite element analysis FEA of the implant s standard characteristics and features. Alternatively the minimal material thickness can be determined for the specific implant for example as determined by an FEA of the implant s standard and patient specific characteristics and features. If desired FEA and or other load bearing modeling analysis may be used to further optimize or otherwise modify the individual implant design such as where the implant is under or over engineered than required to accommodate the patient s biomechanical needs or is otherwise undesirable in one or more aspects relative to such analysis. In such a case the implant design may be further modified and or redesigned to more accurately accommodate the patient s needs which may have the side effect of increasing reducing implant characteristics i.e. size shape or thickness or otherwise modifying one or more of the various design constraints or limitations currently accommodated by the present design features of the implant. If desired this step can also assist in identifying for a surgeon the bone resection design to perform in the surgical theater and it also identifies the design of the bone facing surface s of the implant components which substantially negatively match the patient s resected bone surfaces at least in part.

In general step 4 a corrected normal and or optimized articular geometry on the femur and tibia is recreated virtually. For the femur this general step can include for example the step of i selecting a standard sagittal profile or selecting and or designing a patient engineered or patient specific sagittal profile and ii selecting a standard coronal profile or selecting and or designing a patient specific or patient engineered coronal profile. Optionally the sagittal and or coronal profiles of one or more corresponding medial and lateral portions e.g. medial and lateral condyles can include different curvatures. For the tibia this general step includes one or both of the steps of iii selecting a standard anterior posterior slope and or selecting and or designing a patient specific or patient engineered anterior posterior slope either of which optionally can vary from medial to lateral sides and iv selecting a standard poly articular surface or selecting and or designing a patient specific or patient engineered poly articular surface. The patient specific poly articular surface can be selected and or designed for example to simulate the normal or optimized three dimensional geometry of the patient s tibial articular surface. The patient engineered poly articular surface can be selected and or designed for example to optimize kinematics with the bearing surfaces of the femoral implant component. This step can be used to define the bearing portion of the outer joint facing surfaces i.e. articular surfaces of the implant components.

In optional general step 5 a virtual implant model for example generated and displayed using a computer specifically configured with software and or instructions to assess and display such models is assessed and can be altered to achieve normal or optimized kinematics for the patient. For example the outer joint facing or articular surface s of one or more implant components can be assessed and adapted to improve kinematics for the patient. This general step can include one or more of the steps of i virtually simulating biomotion of the model ii adapting the implant design to achieve normal or optimized kinematics for the patient and iii adapting the implant design to avoid potential impingement.

The exemplary process described above yields both a predetermined surgical resection design for altering articular surfaces of a patient s bones during surgery and a design for an implant that specifically fits the patient for example following the surgical bone resectioning. Specifically the implant selection and or design which can include manufacturing or machining the implant to the selected and or designed specifications using known techniques includes one or more patient engineered bone facing surfaces that negatively match the patient s resected bone surface. The implant also can include other features that are patient adapted such as minimal implant thickness articular geometry and kinematic design features. This process can be applied to various joint implants and to various types of joint implants. For example this design process can be applied to a total knee cruciate retaining posterior stabilized and or ACL PCL retaining knee implants bicompartmental knee implants unicompartmental knee implants and other joint implants for example for the shoulder hip elbow spine or other joints. For example the thickness of an acetabular cup either metal backing or polyethylene or ceramic or other insert can be adapted based on the patient s geometry e.g. depth of the actebular fossa AP ML SI dimensions or other parameters including femoral parameters.

The exemplary process described above including the resulting patient adapted implants and predetermined bone resectioning design offers several advantages over traditional primary and revision implants and related processes. For example it allows for one or more pre primary implants such that a subsequent replacement or improvement can take the form of a primary implant. Specifically because the process described herein can minimize the amount of bone that is resected enough bone stock may remain such that a subsequent procedure may be performed with a traditional primary off the shelf implant. This offers a significant advantage for younger patients who may require in their lifetime more than a single revision for an implant. In fact the exemplary process described above may allow for two or more pre primary implants or procedures before so much bone stock is sacrificed that a traditional primary implant is required.

The advantageous minimal bone resectioning and therefore minimal bone loss that is achieved with this process arises from the fact that the bone facing surfaces of the implants are derived for each patient based on patient specific data such as for example data derived from images of the patient s joint size or weight of the patient size of the joint and size shape and or severity of defects and or disease in the joint. This patient adapted approach allows for the bone facing surface of the implant components to be optimized with respect to any number of parameters including minimizing bone loss using any number of resection cuts and corresponding implant component bone cuts and bone cut facets to conserve bone for the patient. With traditional implants the implant s bone facing surface includes standard bone cuts and the resection cuts to the patient s bone are made to fit those standard bone cuts.

Another advantage to this process is that the selection and or design process can incorporate any number of target parameters such that any number of implant component features and resection cuts can be selected and or designed to meet one or more parameters that are predetermined to have clinical value. For example in addition to bone preservation a selection and or design process can include target parameters to restore a patient s native normal kinematics or to provide optimized kinematics. For example the process for selecting and or designing an implant and or resection cuts can include target parameters such as reducing or eliminating the patient s mid flexion instability reducing or eliminating tight closure improving or extending flexion improving or restoring cosmetic appearance and or creating or improving normal or expected sensations in the patient s knee. The design for a tibial implant can provide an engineered surface that replicates the patient s normal anatomy yet also allows for low contact stress on the tibia.

For surgeons and medical professionals this process also provides a simplified surgical technique. The selected and or designed bone cuts and optionally other features that provide a patient adapted fit for the implant components eliminates the complications that arise in the surgical setting with traditional misfitting implants. Moreover since the process and implant component features are predetermined prior to surgery model images of the surgical steps can be provided to the surgeon as a guide.

As noted above the design of an implant component can include manufacturing or machining the component in accordance with the implant design specifications. Manufacturing can include for example using a designed mold to form the implant component. Machining can include for example altering a selected blank form to conform to the implant design specifications. For example using the steps described above the femoral implant component can be manufactured from a designed mold and the tibial implant component including each of a tibial tray and insert can be customized from a selected starting tray and insert for example from blanks

This example describes two exemplary methods for designing resection cuts to a patient s femur and related bone cuts on the bone facing surface of a femoral implant component designed for the patient. In particular in both methods a model of a patient s distal femur is created based on data from patient specific two or three dimensional images of the patient s femur. As shown in the epicondylar axis is determined for the patient s femur. Then the resection cut planes and cut angles and corresponding implant component cut planes and cut angles are assessed and selected using the epicondylar axis as a reference. Specifically four of the five cut planes the distal cut posterior cut posterior chamfer cut and anterior chamfer cut are designed to be parallel with the epicondylar axis . shows the distal cut plane parallel to the epicondylar axis . However for the particular patient the anterior cut plane is designed to be oblique to the epicondylar axis which can minimize the amount of bone resected on the lateral side of the cut. shows an example of an anterior oblique cut plane .

For each of the five cut planes optimized cuts i.e. resection cuts tangent to the bone surface at the angle of each resection plane also is determined. The optimized cuts as shown in included a maximum cut depth of 6 mm for the distal cut plane the anterior chamfer cut plane the posterior chamfer cut and the posterior cut plane . The maximum cut depth is 5 mm for the anterior cut plane . Optimized cuts can be determined based on one or more parameters including those described above. In this example optimized cut were determined at least in part to minimize resected bone while providing greater than a threshold minimum implant thickness. Deeper resection cuts allow for a thicker implant but require greater bone loss. Typically the thinnest resection cut depth and accordingly the minimum implant thickness occurs at the intersections between cut planes. Accordingly alternatively or in addition to altering cut plane depths the number of cut planes the cut plane angles and or the cut plane orientations can be altered to provide deeper cut plane intersections and corresponding greater minimum implant thickness at the bone cut intersections while also minimizing the amount of bone resected from the patient.

The optimized number of cut planes depths of cut planes angles of cut planes and or orientations of cut planes can be determined independently for each of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. For example show optimized cut planes based on the medial condyle. However show cut planes for the lateral condyle posterior chamfer and lateral condyle posterior cut planes that are independently optimized i.e. relative to the medial condyle posterior chamfer and medial condyle posterior cut planes respectively based on patient specific data for the lateral condyle. This type of independent optimization between condyles can result in a different number of cut plane facets different angles of cut plane facets and or different depths of cut plane facets on corresponding portions of medial and lateral condyles.

Two exemplary resection cut designs and corresponding implant component bone cut design e.g. that includes substantially matching cut features of the resection cut design is based on five cut planes are described in this example. In the first design shown in a distal cut plane is designed perpendicular to the sagittal femoral axis . In the second design referred to as a flexed or flex fit design and shown in the distal cut plane is rotated 15 degrees in flexion from the perpendicular to the sagittal femoral axis. The additional four cut planes are shifted accordingly for each design method as shown in .

An exemplary bone facing surface of the femoral implant component design is shown in . In addition to optimized cut planes described above these implant components also include a patient adapted peripheral margin that is 0.5 mm from the edge of cut bone. The designs also can include engineered coronal curvatures on the condyles. Side views of the resulting femoral implant component designs for the first and second design methods are shown in . This sagittal view of the implant components shows the difference in anterior and posterior coverage for the two designs. As seen by a comparison of the two figures the flexed cut design provides greater posterior coverage which enhances deep knee flexion for the patient. Accordingly as shown by this example one or more features or measurements derived from patient specific data are used to preoperatively select and or design implant component features that target and achieve more than one parameter in this case preservation of the patient s bone and preservation restoration or enhancement of the patient s joint kinematics.

As mentioned above the optimization of resection cuts and implant component bone cuts can result in a cut design that has any number of cut planes or facets depths of cut planes or facets angles of cut planes or facets and or orientations of cut planes or facets. In addition to optimizing the cut planes to minimize bone loss and maximize implant thickness various other parameters can be included in the cut plane optimization. In this example the flexed cut design was used to help preserve restore or enhance the patient s joint kinematics. Additional parameters that may be included in the determination of optimized resection and bone cuts can include but are not limited to one or more of 1 deformity correction and or limb alignment 2 maximizing preservation of cartilage or ligaments 3 maximizing preservation and or optimization of other features of the patient s anatomy such as trochlea and trochlear shape 4 further restoration and or optimization of joint kinematics or biomechanics 5 restoration or optimization of joint line location and or joint gap width and 6 preservation restoration or enhancement of other target features.

This example describes an exemplary design of femoral implant component. In particular the femoral component includes seven bone cuts on its inner bone facing surface.

A femoral implant component PCL retaining is designed with seven bone cuts for a femur first implantation technique. The design of the implant component is depicted in . The seven bone cuts on the inner bone facing surface of the implant component include a distal bone cut including lateral and medial facets that is perpendicular to the sagittal femoral axis and an anterior cut . The corresponding resection cut planes are shown in and in . Specifically a first anterior chamfer cut plane is at 25 degrees a second anterior chamfer cut plane is at 57 degrees and an anterior cut plane is at 85 degrees relative to the distal femoral cut plane as shown in . Moreover a first posterior chamfer cut plane is at 25 degrees a second posterior chamfer cut plane is at 57 degrees and a posterior chamfer cut plane is at 87 degrees relative to the distal femoral cut plane as shown in . The femoral implant includes bone cuts that substantially negatively match e.g. in cut angle area and or orientation the resection cuts on these cut planes. The femoral implant component also can include on its bone facing surface cement cutouts that are 0.5 mm deep and offset from the outer edge by 2 mm and a peg protruding from the each of the lateral and medial distal bone cuts facets. The pegs are 7 mm in diameter 17 mm long and are tapered by 0.5 degrees as they extend from the component. shows the cement pocket and peg features.

In a traditional femoral implant component the bone facing surface consists of five standard bone cuts. However the femoral component in this example includes seven bone cuts on the bone facing surface. The additional bone cuts can allow for the corresponding resection cut planes be less deep from the bone surface to insure that the cut plane intersections have a depth below the bone surface that allows for a minimum implant thickness. Accordingly less bone can be resected for a seven bone cut implant component than for a traditional five bone cut implant component to provide the same minimum implant component thickness e.g. at the bone cut intersections. Moreover the outer joint facing surface of the implant component described in this example includes a combination of patient adapted features and standard features.

A similar analysis was performed to assess relative bone loss between a five cut design and a five flexed cut design. shows a patient s femur having five not flexed resection cuts and shows the same femur but with five flexed resection cuts. As shown the model having five not flexed resection cuts retains a bone volume of 109 472 mm while the model having five flexed resection cuts retains a bone volume of 105 760 mm. As this analysis shows the not flexed five bone cut implant component saved substantially more of the patient s bone stock in this case nearly 4 000 mm as compared to the flexed five bone cut cut implant component. However as noted in Example 2 the flexed cut design can offer other advantages such as greater posterior coverage and enhanced deep knee flexion which can be weighed relative to all selected parameters and accordingly integrated in the selection and or design of an implant component.

In summary the component designs described in this example can save patient bone stock as compared to a traditional implant component and thereby allow the implant to be pre primary. Alternatively or in addition the implant components may include cut planes i.e. of resection cuts and bone cuts that are optimized based on patient specific data to meet one or more user defined parameters as described above. For example cut planes can be symmetric or asymmetric parallel or non parallel aligned perpendicular to the sagittal plane or not perpendicular varied from medial to lateral condyle and or can include other orientations. The cut plane designs may include a flexed i.e. rotated or offset relative to the biomechanical or anatomical axes orientation. Moreover the design of attachment pegs may also be flexed relative to the biomechanical or anatomical axes.

This example describes designs and surgical implantation of knee implant components and guide tools having certain patient specific patient engineered and or non traditional standard features. In the studies described in this example patient adapted femoral tibial and patellar implant components were designed and implanted for each of three cadaveric patients. In addition corresponding resection cut strategies were designed and performed. Moreover several different patient adapted guide tools were designed and used for the implantation procedure.

The implant components and guide tools also referred to as jigs or iJigs for each patient were designed based on patient specific CT derived data from each patient. Specifically data from CT images of each patient s knee was selected and imported into computer modeling software. The software was used to generate a model of the biological structures in the patient s knee and to design e.g. using CAD software a femoral implant component a tibial implant component and related guide tools. The design of the implant components and guide tools included manufacturing for example using CAM software and additive and or casting manufacturing techniques as described above. In addition predetermined resection cuts to each patient s femur and tibia were designed based on the patient s biology and in conjunction with the patient adapted features of the implant component. For example the resection cuts and the corresponding component s bone facing surfaces were designed based on patient specific data to substantially negatively match e.g. in surface area surface angle and or other feature . Then surgery was performed on the cadaveric patient to perform the predetermined e.g. designed resection cuts and to implant the components designed for the particular patient. In addition one or more guide tools were designed and used for the procedure which also were designed to include patient adapted features for example a bone facing surface that substantially negatively matched the patient s anatomy and or cutting guide slots or drilling guide holes that provided accurate placement for the predetermined resection cuts and holes for the particular patient.

Three surgical procedures were performed to implant femoral and tibial implant components for three different cadaveric patients. Prior to each surgery patient adapted implant components femoral and tibial implant components and guide tools were designed including manufacturing in conjunction with a resection cut design. Then the guide tools were used during surgery to prepare the predetermined resection cuts and place the implant components.

The patient adapted femoral implant components each included six bone cuts. The bone cut design was designed in conjunction with corresponding resection cuts. and show the patient adapted femoral implant and resection cuts respectively for each of the three patients. As exemplified in the six bone cuts included an anterior bone cut medial M and lateral L facets of a distal bone cut medial M and lateral L facets of a posterior bone cut an anterior chamfer bone cut medial M and lateral L facets of a first posterior chamfer bone cut and medial M and lateral L facets of a second posterior chamfer bone cut. In addition the femoral implant component included a stepped or step cut between the medial facet M and lateral facet L of the distal bone cut in order to provide enhanced preservation of distal medial bone stock. relating to the second patient and relating to the third patient include similar features as those numbered in . As the figures show the non coplanar distal bone cut facets which can be connected by a stepped cut allow for independent and optionally minimum resection depths on the medial and lateral portions of an otherwise continuous bone cut e.g. anterior bone cut anterior chamfer bone cut or distal bone cut .

Comparison between each of the three patient adapted implant components and corresponding resection cuts shows various features of the implant component that specifically match features of the resection cuts and or of the patient s anatomy. For example each implant component includes a width height and condylar width that is patient specific i.e. matches the patient s anatomy or patient engineered i.e. derived from patient specific data to achieve one or more predetermined parameter thresholds for example an implant component peripheral margin that does not overhang the cut surface of the bone and provides no more than 1 mm or 0.5 mm or 0.3 mm exposed resection cut surface .

Moreover as shown by a comparison of the figures the implant component bone cuts for each patient was engineered to specifically match the resection cuts for the patient e.g. in cut and or facet surface areas angles relative orientations and or other features . For example as exemplified in the resection cuts included an anterior resection cut medial M and lateral L facets of a distal resection cut medial M and lateral L facets of a posterior resection cut an anterior chamfer resection cut medial M and lateral L facets of a first posterior chamfer resection cut and medial M and lateral L facets of a second posterior chamfer resection cut. In addition the femoral implant component included a stepped or step resection cut between the medial facet M and lateral facet L of the distal resection cut. relating to the second patient and relating to the third patient include similar features as those numbered in . As shown by the figures the stepped cut saves substantial bone stock for example at the distal medial facet M in comparison to a distal medial facet cut having the same depth as the distal lateral facet cut.

In addition each patient adapted femoral implant component included on the joint facing surface of each condyle a patient specific J curve that substantially positively matched the J curve of the particular patient s femur. Toward the anterior joint facing surface each implant component included a trochlear groove profile that was patient engineered to be offset 2 mm laterally e.g. relative to the particular patient s trochlear groove and that was angled laterally. The first two patients implant components included a trochlear groove that engineered to be angled laterally at approximately 3 5 degrees while the third patient s implant component included a trochlear groove that was engineered to be angled laterally at approximately 5 7 degrees. The trochlear surface profile was designed to accommodate a dome shaped e.g. in profile patellar implant component. On the bone surface of the femoral implant component two pegs 7 mm in diameter projected from the medial M and lateral L facets of the distal bone cut. The receiving peg holes in the patient s distal femur were prepared with an 8 mm drill bit. Each bone cut and bone cut facet on the bone facing surface of the femoral implant included a cement cutout to hold cement applied during the procedure.

In one exemplary embodiment the troclear groove could incorporate an engineered portion and a patient specific portion. For example the superior aspect of the groove could comprise a relative straight section having an approximate 7 degree angle relative to the anatomical and or mechanical axis of the femur and or entire knee joint complex and then further comprise a curved or otherwise non straight inferior portion that can be engineered or that can follow a patient specific or patient engineered path or could comprise one or more additional straight portions if so desired . The trochlear groove path can comprise a simple smooth curved path or a more complex tortuous path in its superior or inferior or other portions as desired by the physician. The path can be engineered patient engineered or otherwise altered from its original path in some or all of the medial lateral direction the coronal caudal direction or in the anterior posterior direction relative to the femur and femoral head the tibia the tibial tuberosity the patient s Q angle trochlear angle and other measurements described in this specification or known in the art.

In one exemplary embodiment the trochlear groove could comprise an approximately 7 degree superior portion combined in a smooth continuous manner with a patient specific patient engineered lower portion creating a path shape similar to a hockey stick.

The guide tool designs were based on a tibial cut first technique. For the first two patients a femoral all in one guide tool was designed to include guide slots and holes to perform all of the predetermined e.g. designed based on patient specific data femoral resection cuts and peg hole placements. The all in one guide tools for each of the two patients are shown in respectively. As shown in the figures the guide slots were numbered sequentially 1 11 to guide the surgeon in the cutting steps and to maximize ease of use. The all in one guide tools also were prepared and provided to the surgeon in three different thicknesses denoted by different letters which allowed the surgeon to select the tool having the best fit e.g. between the femur in tibia with the knee in extension. Accordingly this guide tool aided the surgeon in assessing balance and implant fit as well as providing guide slots for all cuts and drill holes for the patient s femur. In addition the bone facing surface of each all in one guide tool was designed to be patient specific i.e. designed based on patient specific data to substantially match the corresponding biological surface of the patient . Moreover a comparison of the two patient s guide tools shown in respectively shows guide slots in different orientations from each other. These unique guide slot orientations are provided to establish the predetermined resection cuts specifically designed in conjunction with a patient adapted implant component for each patient based on patient specific data.

In addition several guide tool attachments were designed and included for the for the all in one guide tools . For example as shown in a drill guide attachment was designed and included for attaching to the guide tool to extend the drilling surface. Moreover as shown in various tool attachments were designed and included for attaching to the all in one guide tool to extend one or more cutting surfaces. For example the attachment in extends the cutting surface area for all cutting slots. The attachment in extends the surface area for the posterior resection cut slots and for posterior chamfer resection cut slots . The attachment in extends the surface area for the posterior resection cut slots . In addition guide peg attachments were designed and included to provide additional surface area for the posterior chamfer resection cut slots . As shown the guide pegs can be integrated with a guide attachment or can be used independently and optionally integrated with the guide tool . In addition or as an alternative to extending a cutting surface the guide pegs can be used to aid in securing the guide tool to the patient s femur after peg holes are drilled into the patient s femur.

As an alternative to the all in one guide tool a set of three guide tools also was designed and included for each of the first two patients. illustrate the set of three guide tools which collectively supplied all of the guide slots and holes to perform each of the predetermined femoral resection cuts and peg hole placements available in the single all in one guide tool . This set of guide tools was included for example in case the all in one guide tool did not suit the needs of the surgeon. As with the all in one guide tool each of the three guide tools in the set included one or more patient adapted features. As shown in the first guide tool in the set provided guide holes for drilling into the patient s femur predetermined holes for receiving the femoral implant component pegs. As shown in the figure the guide tool is attached to the patient s femoral bone . The bone facing surface of the first guide tool was designed to snap fit to 3 mm of cartilage on the patient s distal femur. As shown in a second balancing chip guide tool provided distal facet resection guide slots a slot to mark the termination of the distal lateral resection which can be used to establish the step cut between the distal lateral and medial resection facets and a guide surface for making the posterior resection cut. As with the all in one guide tool this tool also can be used for balancing and assessing implant fit e.g. based on the fit of the guide tool between the femur and cut tibia in knee extension . As shown in a third chamfer cutting guide tool provided guide slots for the remaining predetermined resection cuts. As shown the cutting guide slots were identified with numbers 1 6 to identify the order for performing the resection cuts.

For the third patient a different set of femoral guide tools was designed and included to perform the predetermined femoral resection cuts and peg hole placements as shown in . As shown in a femoral trial guide tool was designed and included to guide the hole placement for the pegs on the subsequently used guide tools and on the femoral implant component. As shown this guide tool includes marks incorporated into its joint facing surface to indicate to the surgeon the locations representing the Whiteside Line and Epicondylar Axis . As shown in the second guide tool a balancer chip guide tool was designed and included for guiding independent distal medial and distal lateral facet cuts as well as the step cut . Both the femoral trial guide tool and the balancer chip guide tool included a bone facing surface derived from patient specific data and designed to rest on 3 mm of cartilage atop the patient s femoral bone surface. The balancer chip guide tool was provided in six different thicknesses to allow the surgeon to use the tool for ligament balancing and assessment of the implant fit e.g. by observing the space or tightness of the tool positioned between the femur and cut tibia during flexion and extension . In addition a spacing paddle tool as shown in was designed and included for representing the extra asymmetric lateral poly thickness when balancing. As shown in a chamfer cut guide tool was designed and included for guiding an anterior resection cut a anterior chamfer resection cut and independent posterior medial and posterior lateral facet cuts. The a chamfer cut guide tool was designed with pegs to fit into the previously prepared peg holes in the patient s femur and with each cutting slot numbered for the order in which the cuts were to be performed. As shown in a pair of angled cut guides was designed and included to facilitate the first and second posterior chamfer cuts. As shown each angled cut guide includes a first surface that matches the distal resection surface and optionally includes pegs to fit into the previously prepared peg holes in the patient s femur. In the figures the distal resection surface includes two non co planar facets which first cut guide surface matches. In addition each angled cut guide also includes a second cutting guide surface angled at the predetermined angle of the corresponding chamfer cut such that a cutting tool placed against the surface cuts into the patient s bone at the predetermined angle.

For the first two patients and as shown in an anterior profile guide tool also was designed and included to compare the peak profile at the anterior portion of the femur in the installed implant as compared to the patient s native knee. As discussed above the trochlear area of the femoral implant component was patient engineered e.g. derived and or optimized from patient specific data to include a trochlear groove offset 2 mm laterally and designed to accommodate a dome shaped patellar implant component. Accordingly as shown in the figures the anterior profile of the implant differs from the anterior profile of the patient s native femur particularly in providing relief on the lateral side of the implant relative to the patient s femur.

Several guide tools for resectioning the tibia and or placing the tibial implant component were designed and included for each patient s surgery. For example as shown in for each patient a cutting guide tool was designed and included for accurately resectioning the proximal tibia to a predetermined resection depth and angle e.g. 2 mm below the lowest point of the medial plateau with an AP slope of 5 degrees and perpendicular to the mechanical axis . The anterior part of the tibial cutting guide tool was designed with a patient specific bone facing surface to substantially negatively match the corresponding anterior portion of the patient s tibia when the medial edge of the guide was aligned to the medial one third of the patient s tibial tubercle . The proximal part of the tibial cutting guide tool was designed to rest on an estimated 2 mm thick cartilage layer atop the patient s proximal tibia that was identified from patient specific data. For the first two patients an alternate tibial cutting guide tool shown in also was designed and included. The alternate tibial cutting guide tool included the same features of tibial cutting guide except that the proximal part of the alternate tibial guide tool was designed to rest directly on the bone surface of the patient s proximal tibia was identified from patient specific data rather than on a cartilage surface.

The tibial cutting guide tools were designed to include a dovetail mating feature that was attachable to a tibial alignment guide tool and down rod to visually check the alignment of the guide tools with the patient s mechanical axis. depicts the tibial alignment guide tool and down rod attached via the dovetail connection to a tibial cutting guide tool to confirm prior to cutting the alignment of the cutting guide tool with respect to the patient s mechanical axis. The tibial alignment guide tool included a complementary dovetail mating feature to attach to the tibial cutting guide tools.

For the third patient and as shown in the tibial cutting guide tool included two small holes on the anterior portion of the tool through which the patient s femur was marked with a pen or other instrument. The two markings on the surface of the cut tibia as shown in served as landmarks for placement of subsequent tools.

For each patient tibial keel preparation guide tools were designed and included to facilitate preparation of the holes and slots into the proximal resected tibial surface and thereby ensure proper placement of the tibial tray keel and tibial implant component generally. A different set of tibial keel preparation guides were used for each of the three patients. For the first patient and as shown in a tibial keel prep guide tool was designed and included. To help ensure proper placement the perimeter except for the handle portion of the tool was designed to substantially match the perimeter of the tibial tray implant component which itself was patient adapted to substantially match the perimeter of the patient s resected tibial surface. Accordingly the proper placement of the tibial prep guide tool could be discerned by the surgeon by aligning the perimeter of the tibial prep guide tool with the perimeter of the patient s resected tibial surface. In addition the medial edge of the handle of the tibial prep guide tool was designed to align with the medial of the tibial tubercle to further ensure proper tibial implant rotational alignment. The central hole was drilled using a 0.5 inch diameter drill bit. As shown in a set of tibial keel prep insert guides was designed to mate with the tibial prep guide once the central hole was drilled. The tibial keep prep insert guides allow for controlled intra operative tibial implant rotational alignment according to predetermined amounts of rotation. For example as indicated in the figure the set of tibial prep guides included a first tibial keel prep insert guide that provided 0 degrees of rotation a second tibial keel prep insert guide that provided 5 degrees of rotation and a third tibial keel prep insert guide that provided 10 degrees of rotation. After the surgeon selected the tibial keel prep guide that desired predetermined amount of rotation slots were created using the guide holes in the selected tibial keep prep guide to drill multiple angled holes e.g. six holes corresponding to the six guide holes in the tibial keep prep guide using a 4 mm drill bit. Once the 4 mm holes were drilled into the patient s resected proximal tibial surface an osteotome was used to create a rectangular slot for the keels of the tibial tray implant component.

For the second patient and as shown in a tibial keel prep guide tool was designed and included for establishing the keel slot in the patient s resected proximal tibial surface. Similar to the tibial keel prep guide tool for the first patient the tibial keel prep guide tool for the second patient included a perimeter except for the handle portion designed to substantially match the perimeter of the tibial tray implant component which itself was patient adapted to substantially match the perimeter of the patient s resected tibial surface. However for the second patient an optional drill guide and a keel saw guide also were designed and included. The drill guide was available to be inserted into the central opening of the tibial keel prep guide tool to provide an accurately placed central hole. In addition once the central hole was established the keel saw guide was available to be inserted to provide a narrow channel for sawing an accurately slot for receiving the keel of the tibial implant component.

As shown in the tibial keel prep guide tool for the third patient incorporated features from the first patient s tibial keel prep guide tool and insert guide tool . However unlike the tibial keel prep guide tools for the first two patients this tool did not include a handle. In certain embodiments more than one such tool can be included having different orientations of holes to provide different degrees of rotation for the keel and tibial tray. Similar to the tibial keel prep guide tools for the first two patients this tool also included a perimeter designed to substantially match the perimeter of the tibial tray implant component which itself was patient adapted to substantially match the perimeter of the patient s resected tibial surface. As shown in the figures an arrow was located on the proximal surface of the tool that indicated alignment to the medial of the tibia tubercle for proper tibial implant rotational alignment which itself had been marked as described above . The central hole was drilled using an 9 16 drill bit and the keel holes were drilled using a drill bit before cutting between them with an osteotome to establish the keel slots.

As shown in a set of tibial trial spacers was designed and included for the second and third patients. Specifically for the second patient two medial trial spacers were provided in thicknesses of 6 mm and 8 mm respectively second patient or 8 mm and 10 mm respectively third patient and three lateral trial spacers were provided in thicknesses of 9 mm 10 mm and 11 mm respectively second patient or 10 mm 11 mm and 12 mm respectively third patient . The spacers were used to assess balance and fit for example to assess the tightness and balance of the joint with the spacer in place to represent tibial implant thickness between the cut tibia and femur and optionally other components in place representing femoral thickness during flexion and extension of the knee.

For each patient and as shown in a set of tibial implant component trial inserts was designed and included for each patient in order for the surgeon to assess the appropriate thicknesses to use for medial and lateral tibial implant component inserts for properly balancing the patient s knee joint. As shown in the figure two medial trial inserts and three lateral trial inserts were designed and included. The two medial trial inserts had thicknesses of 6 mm and 8 mm respectively and the lateral trial inserts had thicknesses of 8.5 mm 9.5 and 10.5 mm respectively first patient or 9 mm 10 mm and 11 mm respectively second patient or 8 mm 9 mm and 10 mm respectively third patient . After assessing the trial inserts and deciding on an appropriate medial and lateral insert thickness for balancing the surgeon positioned the tibial implant tray and inserts having the appropriate thicknesses medially and laterally.

As shown in the tibial implant components that were designed and included for each patient comprised a tibial tray and a set of tibial inserts . The tibial tray was designed to include a patient specific perimeter that substantially matched the perimeter of the patient s resected proximal tibial surface. In addition the tibial tray was designed to include a 11 mm 35 mm first and second patients or a 13 mm 40 mm third patient central stem and 3.5 mm wide keels that were angled posteriorly 5 degrees on the medial and 15 on the lateral side and match the orientation of the holes created by the tibial keel prep guide . The tibial inserts were designed and provided to have the same thicknesses as the tibial trial inserts described above. As shown in the figure the tibial trial inserts were designed to have a locking fit onto the tibial tray joint facing surface .

The perimeters of the trial spacers except for the handle portion tibial implant component trial inserts and tibial inserts were designed to substantially match the perimeter of the tibial tray implant component which itself was patient adapted to substantially match the perimeter of the patient s resected tibial surface.

In addition to the patient adapted femoral and tibial implant components that were designed and included a patient adapted patellar implant component and related guide tools also were designed and included for the third patient s surgery. For example as shown in a set of patella sizers was designed and included to assess the diameter of the patella. As shown in a patellar cutting tool was designed and included to cut the patella to a predetermined depth of resection. In addition various patella implant trials also were designed e.g. using 3D print manufacturing and included. As shown in the implant trials included diameters of 32 mm 35 mm 38 mm and 41 mm respectively. As shown in a patellar implant of 41 mm was selected and implanted for the third patient.

The patient adapted implant components were successfully implanted using the resection cuts and patient adapted guide tools that were specifically designed for each cadaveric patient based on particular patient data e.g. image data . Specifically the tibial cut guide tools showed good fit with the patient s tibial plateau. The alignment guide tool and the drop down rod helped to confirm proper tibial alignment of the cut guide tool prior to resectioning for each patient. The different guide tools used to prepare the stem holes and keel slots in the proximal resected surface of each patient s femur were found to useful. The tibial guide tools designed to include a patient derived perimeter were found to fit well with the perimeter of each patient s resected tibia. The matching perimeter was helpful in properly aligning the cut tools to establish the predetermined resection cuts and or for balancing. Regarding the patient adapted tibial implant components the tibial tray perimeter was shown to have a perimeter profile that substantially matched the perimeter of the patient s resected proximal tibial surface with no excessive overhang or underhang. The tibial trial inserts were helpful in selecting the proper medial and lateral tibial inserts for balancing and fit. The tibial inserts were easily fit into the locking mechanism of the tibial tray. Overall the predetermined tibial resection cuts patient adapted tibial guide tools and patient adapted tibial implant components provided a well fit and aligned implant component.

On the femoral side the single all in one guide tool used with the first two patients was found to have a patient specific bone facing surface that fit well to each patient s biological surface. The posterior and distal thickness of the tool was useful to assess balance and tightness looseness of the joint. The set of femoral guide tools used to resect the third patient s femur were found to be useful for making the predetermined resection cuts. Regarding the patient adapted femoral implant components once in place the component for each patient was shown to have good coverage of the resected surfaces of the patient s femur and proper articulation with the tibial component.

This example illustrates an implant component having both straight and curvilinear bone cuts on its bone facing surface. Specifically a femoral implant is designed to include 3 mm curvilinear cut depths and corresponding implant thicknesses along the distal portion of each condyle. The cut depth and implant thickness along each condyle are designed independently of the other condyle. In addition jigs for performing the curvilinear cuts to the articular bone surface are described.

Using a computer model generated from patient specific data posterior and anterior resection cut lines are created in the model as shown in . To design the curvilinear bone cut line corresponding to the resection cut on the medial condyle a medial split line is identified on the condyle as shown in and then a 3 mm deep cut line is generated to follow the split line as shown in . The resulting virtual curvilinear cut is shown in . The same steps are performed independently for the lateral condyle as shown in .

The resulting resection cut model as shown in establishes predetermined resection cuts for the surgical procedure and it also can be used to engineer the bone facing surface of the corresponding patient specific implant component as shown in . Specifically the inner bone facing surface of the implant component can be designed and engineered to substantially negatively match the resection cut surface on the model. Optionally and as shown in the figures the outer joint facing surface of the implant also can include one or more patient specific features.

The resulting cut model also can be used to design one or more cutting jigs that are fitted to the bone to guide the bone cutting procedure. For example shows a model of a bone along with a jig that allows preparation of predetermined resection holes and optionally resection cuts surfaces to match the predetermined resection cuts specific to a patient s particular anatomy. show an alternative set of jigs that can be used with a router type saw. Specifically a router type bit can fit into the central channel of the jig shown in to cut along the channel to a specific depth for example 3 mm. Then as shown in a second jig having two channels that circumvent the channel of the first jig can be applied. The router type bit can fit into these two channels to cut medial and lateral to the first channel to the same depth for example 3 mm.

This example illustrates a an implant component and design having a resurfaced portion and a bone cut portion and b an implant and implant design having a resurfaced surface with no bone cuts.

Using a patient specific model e.g. CAD model generated from patient specific data a femoral implant is designed to include a single posterior cut on its inner bone facing surface as shown in above and in . The remaining portions of the inner bone facing surface of the implant are designed to substantially negatively match the patient s uncut articular bone surface that the implant component engages. Optionally the outer joint facing surface of the implant also can include one or more patient specific features. As shown in the figures the patient specific implant component with a single bone cut is prepared as two pieces or components which allows for fitting the curved anterior portion of the implant component around the anterior portion of the femur.

The femoral implant design shown in and the corresponding implant shown in also uses a two piece or two component design in part to allow for fitting the curved anterior portion of the implant around the anterior portion of the femur. Specifically using a patient specific model generated from patient specific data a femoral implant was designed to include no bone cuts on its inner bone facing surface. Instead the inner bone facing surface of the implant was designed to substantially negatively match the uncut articular bone surface that the implant component engages. Optionally the outer joint facing surface of the implant also can be designed and engineered to include one or more patient specific features.

This example illustrates exemplary implant components having enhanced articular surfaces i.e. joint facing surfaces . is a front schematic view of engaging portions of a single compartment e.g. a single condyle of a knee implant . is a cross sectional schematic view in the coronal plane of a femoral component of the implant of . With reference to and this exemplary embodiment of a patient specific implant component includes a femoral component and a tibial tray component and it is designed based on patient specific data. An inner bone facing surface of the femoral component conforms to the corresponding surface of the femoral condyle. Alternatively it can conform to one or more optimized bone cuts on the femoral condyle. However the outer articular surface of the femoral component is enhanced to incorporate a smooth surface having an approximately constant radius in the coronal plane. The corresponding articular surface of the tibial tray has a surface contour in the coronal plane that is engineered based on the coronal plane to the outer articular surface of the femoral component . In this embodiment the articular surface has a radius that is five times the radius of the outer articular surface . In certain embodiments the articular surface of the femoral component includes a sagittal curvature that matches the patient s existing or healthy sagittal radius.

The design of implant component has several advantages. First the design of articular surface allows the thickness of femoral component to be better controlled as desired. For example referring to if a curve of an articular surface of a femoral component is too large the thickness of the femoral component may be too thick along a centerline of the implant thereby requiring an excessive amount of bone to be removed when the implant is placed on the femoral condyle. On the other hand referring to if the same curve is applied to a device having an appropriate centerline thickness the margins or sidewalls of the device may be too thin to provide proper structural support. Similarly referring to if the curve of the outer articular surface of a femoral component is too flat the device does not exhibit the tapering from a centerline to the margins or sidewalls of the device and may not function well.

Referring again to a second advantage of implant component over certain other embodiments of patient specific devices is that the smooth articular surface can provide enhanced kinematics as compared to a true representation of the surface of the patient s femoral condyle.

For example referring also to one method of making patient specific implants is to use a simple offset in which a femoral component is designed using a standard offset from each point of the modeled surface of the patient s femoral condyle. Using such a design the thickness of the device remains essentially constant and an outer surface essentially positively matches or conforms to the underlying inner femoral facing surface as well as the modeled surface of the femoral condyle on which it is based. While this provides a truly patient matched joint facing surface it is not necessarily optimal for the kinematics of the resulting implant due to for example rough areas that may produce higher more localized loading of the implant. By using a smooth surface with an essentially pre determined shape the loading of the implant can be better managed and distributed thereby reducing the wear on the tibial tray component .

A third advantage which also is related to the loading and overall kinematics of the implant is in the negative matching of the tibial articular surface to the femoral articular surface in the coronal plane. By providing a radius that is predetermined for example five times the radius of the femoral articular surface at its centerline in the present embodiment the loading of the articular surfaces can be further distributed. Thus the overall function and movement of the implant is improved as is the wear on the tibial bearing surface which can include polyethylene material. While the embodiment described above uses a ratio of five times the radius of the outer surface at its centerline note that the radius of the outer surface may be slightly different at other locations of the outer surface away from the centerline other embodiments are possible including an outer tibial surface that in the coronal plane is based on other ratios of curvature other curvatures other functions or combinations of curves and or functions at various points. Additionally while the embodiments shown in through are not considered to be optimal designs generally they are embodiments that can be generated using automated systems and may have preferable characteristics in some instances.

This example describes a patient specific trochlea design that is optimized for proper kinematics of the patella femoral PF joint.

This exemplary implant design uses a patient specific sagittal curvature and an engineered coronal curvature to allow the patella component to track properly in the trochlear groove. This exemplary implant design for the femoral component and a patella component can allow various advantages including a reduction of lateral overstuffing of the P F joint and a post operative patella tracking that is normal or close to the patient s pre operative and or pre disease state. In certain embodiments the lateral peak can be retained which may minimize dislocation events. In certain embodiments the patella implant bone bearing surface can be or appear to be approximately parallel to the osteochondral junction of the native patella.

From a three dimensional perspective the lower extremity of the body ideally functions within a single plane known as the median anterior posterior plane MAP plane throughout the flexion extension arc. In order to accomplish this the femoral head the mechanical axis of the femur the patellar groove the intercondylar notch the patellar articular crest the tibia and the ankle remain within the MAP plane during the flexion extension movement. During movement the tibia rotates as the knee flexes and extends in the epicondylar axis which is perpendicular to the MAP plane.

As shown in the mechanical axis of a patient s lower extremity can be defined by the center of hip located at the head of the femur the center of the knee located at the notch where the intercondylar tubercle of the tibia meet the femur and the center of the ankle . In the figure the long axis of the tibia is collinear with the mechanical axis of the lower extremity. The anatomic axis aligns 5 7 degrees offset from the mechanical axis in the valgus or outward direction. A variety of image slices can be taken at each joint for example at one or more of the knee joint the hip joint and the ankle joint to determine the mechanical centerpoint or select anatomic points for each joint.

In certain preferred embodiments anatomic reference points are used to virtually determine a patient s misalignment and the proper mechanical axis of his or her lower extremity. Based on the difference between the patient s misalignment and the proper mechanical axis a knee implant and implant procedure can be virtually designed to include implant and or resection cut features that substantially realign the patient s limb to have a proper mechanical axis. The implant design process can include manufacturing the implant e.g. using CAM software and optionally the implant can be surgically implanted into the patient according to the virtually designed procedure.

In certain embodiments a patient s proper mechanical axis of the lower extremity and the extent of misalignment of the extremity is virtually determined using an appropriate computer aided design software program such as SolidWorks software Dassault Syst mes SolidWorks Corp. 300 Baker Avenue Concord Mass. 01742 . Using the software patient specific information for example a collection of anatomic reference points is used to generate a virtual model that includes the patient s knee joint.

The virtual model also can include reference points from the hip and or ankle joints. Using the virtual model a user can determine virtually the misalignment of and mechanical axis of the patient s lower extremity by determining in the model the patient s tibial mechanical axis femoral mechanical axis and one or more planes from each axis. For example the patient s tibial mechanical axis can be determined virtually in the model as a line connecting the center of the patient s ankle and the center of the patient s tibia. The patient s femoral mechanical axis can be determined virtually in the model as a line connecting the center of the patient s hip and the center of the patient s distal femur. The center of the patient s ankle tibia hip and or distal femur can be determined based on the patient specific anatomic reference points or landmarks used to generate the virtual model.

Then the user can align virtually the lower extremity by collinearly aligning the tibial and femoral mechanical axes. This collinear alignment can be achieved by adjusting the angle of the intersecting axes at the knee joint to be zero. The axes can be aligned axially by aligning one or more planes common to both axes such as the sagittal or coronal planes. each illustrate a model showing the existing misalignment of a patient s lower extremity dark and solid line and the virtual alignment light and dashed line determined using the model.

Exemplary methods for determining the tibial mechanical axis the femoral mechanical axis and the sagittal and coronal planes for each axis are described in more detail in the following subsections.

In certain embodiments the tibial mechanical axis and the tibial sagittal and coronal planes are determined virtually using a model that includes reference points from a patient s knee and ankle joints as follows 

As shown in an axial plane at the ankle is identified using three or more points at the inferior articular surface of the tibia. The three or more points are selected from the same or closely similar elevation s on the inferior articular surface of the tibia. This optional step can be used to establish an initial plane of reference for subsequent virtual determinations.

The distal point of the patient s tibial mechanical axis can be defined as the center of the ankle. As shown in the center of the ankle can be determined virtually by connecting a line from the medial to the lateral malleoli and marking 4 percent medial from the center of the line. For example if the distance between the malleoli is 100 then the center of the line is at 50 and the center of the ankle is 4 percent medial from the center of the line or in other words at 46 from the medial malleoli and 54 from the lateral malleoli.

The proximal point of the tibial mechanical axis can be determined virtually as the posterior aspect of the ACL insertion point as shown in .

The tibial mechanical axis can be determined virtually as the line connecting the distal and the proximal points of the tibial mechanical axis as shown in .

The TAPP can be determined virtually as the plane perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis line and including the proximal point of the tibial mechanical axis as shown in . This optional step can be used to establish a plane of reference for subsequent virtual determinations. The TAPP optionally tilted in an A P orientation also can be used to determine the tibial cut line.

The A P line of the tibia can be determined virtually based on method derived from Cobb et al. 2008 The anatomical tibial axis reliable rotational orientation in knee replacement J Bone Joint Surg Br. 90 8 1032 8. Specifically the A P line of the tibia can be determined virtually as the line perpendicular to the line connecting the diametric centers of the lateral and medial condyles of the tibia. For example as shown in a best fit circle can be sketched to determine the diametric center of the lateral condyle i.e. the lateral plateau of the tibia . In addition a best fit circle can be sketched to determine the diametric center of the medial condyle i.e. the medial plateau of the tibia .

In certain embodiments one or both of the circles can be sketched to best fit the corresponding condyle s at the superior articular surface of the tibia. Alternatively one or both of the circles can be sketched to best fit a portion of the wear pattern at the superior articular surface of the tibia. Still yet one or both of the circles can be sketched to best fit the condyle s at a certain distance distal to the superior articular surface of the tibia. For example the circle for the medial condyle can be sketched to best fit the medial condyle at 10 mm 15 mm 20 mm 25 mm or more below or distal to the superior articular surface of the tibia and then the circle can be adjusted proximally to lie on the plane of the superior articular surface of the tibia.

Then as shown in A P line of the tibia is determined virtually as the line perpendicular to and including the midpoint of the line connecting the diametric centers of the lateral and medial condyles of the tibia. If the midpoint of the line connecting the diametric centers of the lateral and medial condyles is not in the same location as the proximal point of the tibial mechanical axis then the A P line can be shifted away from the midpoint to include the proximal point of the tibial mechanical axis while remaining perpendicular to the line connecting the diametric centers of the lateral and medial condyles.

An alternative method for determining virtually the A P line can be derived from other published methods such as Agaki 2004 An Anteroposterior Axis of the Tibia for Total Knee Arthroplasty Clin Orthop 420 213 219.

As shown in the sagittal or A P plane of the tibia can be determined virtually as the plane including both the A P line of the tibia and the tibial mechanical axis line. The sagittal or A P plane also is perpendicular to the TAPP.

As shown in the coronal or M L plane of the tibia can be determined virtually as the plane perpendicular to the A P plane or perpendicular to the A P line of the tibia and including the tibial mechanical axis line. The coronal or M L plane also is perpendicular to the TAPP.

In certain embodiments the femoral mechanical axis and the femoral sagittal and coronal planes are determined virtually using a model that includes reference points from a patient s knee and hip joints as follows 

As shown in an axial plane of the femur is selected virtually using three or more points within the spherical femoral head that substantially lie in the same axial plane. This optional step can be used to establish an initial plane of reference for subsequent virtual determinations.

As shown in the proximal point of the patient s femoral mechanical axis can be determined virtually as the center of the spherical femoral head.

As shown in the distal point of the femoral mechanical axis is determined virtually as the point at the posterior aspect of the femoral trochlear notch or sulcus.

The femoral mechanical axis can be determined virtually as the line connecting the distal and the proximal points of the femoral mechanical axis as shown in .

The FMAPP can be determined virtually as a plane perpendicular to the femoral mechanical axis line and including the distal point of the femoral mechanical axis as shown in . This optional step can be used to establish a plane of reference for subsequent virtual determinations. In certain embodiments of implant procedures that require femoral cuts the distal femoral cut is applied at the FMAPP.

As shown in the A P line of the femur can be determined virtually as the line perpendicular to the epicondylar line and passing through distal point of the femoral mechanical axis. The epicondylar line is the line connecting medial and lateral epicondyles furthest out points .

As shown in the sagittal or A P plane of the femur can be determined virtually as the plane including both the A P line of the femur derived from the Whiteside s line and the femoral mechanical axis line. The sagittal or A P plane also is perpendicular to the plane perpendicular to the femoral axis.

As shown in the coronal or M L plane of the femur can be determined virtually as the plane perpendicular to the A P plane or perpendicular to the A P line of the femur and including the femoral mechanical axis line. The coronal or M L plane also is perpendicular to the plane perpendicular to the femoral axis.

After determining virtually the tibial and femoral mechanical axis and their sagittal and coronal planes the lower extremity can be aligned virtually by adjusting the angle of the intersecting mechanical axes at the knee joint to be zero. The axes can be aligned axially by aligning one or both of the sagittal or coronal planes from each axis as shown in respectively. show a model before and after virtual alignment as it appears in axial view looking distally from a section of the femoral head to a section of the distal femur and on to a section of the tibia. Similarly show a model before and after virtual alignment as it appears in axial view looking proximally from a section of the distal tibia to a section of the distal femur and in on to a section of the femoral head. show a model before and after virtual alignment and an overlay of both before and after virtual alignment .

Various features of the patient adapted implant components including bone cut angles bone cut slopes bone cut number implant thickness in one or more portions joint facing curvature implant component thickness and other features can be selected and or designed at least in part to optimize the parameter of deformity correction and or limb alignment for example using the virtual alignment method described herein. Optionally one or more other parameters can simultaneously be factored into the selection and or design of implant component features. For example in addition to limb alignment the implant component features also can be selected or designed meet one or more of the following parameters 1 preserving restoring or enhancing the patient s joint kinematics 2 deformity correction 3 maximizing preservation of bone cartilage or ligaments e.g. resulting from the resection 4 maximizing preservation and or optimization of other features of the patient s anatomy such as trochlea and trochlear shape 5 restoration or optimization of joint line location and or joint gap width and 6 preservation restoration or enhancement of other target features.

This example illustrates an exemplary finite element analysis FEA that can be conducted on a device component of some embodiments as one parameter in the optimization of patient specific features of the implant. Specifically this example describes FEA conducted on three variations of a femoral implant component.

This analysis investigates the effect of interference fit and loading scenarios on three different large knee femoral implant designs including as shown in respectively a component with six bone cuts and a perpendicular distal bone cut Perp 6 Cuts a component with five bone cuts and a perpendicular distal bone cut Perp 5 Cuts and a component with six bone cuts and flexed bone cuts Flexed 6 Cuts . The three femoral implant component geometries tested represented implants for the largest expected anatomy. each show a traditional implant component overlaid with each of the three tested implant components. In addition shows a traditional component overlaid with the 6 Cuts implant component in an overlaid position that respects the actual implant placements based on movement of the joint line. shows the joint facing surface of the 6 Cuts implant component positioned on a femur having six corresponding resection cuts.

Target results of the FEA analysis included identification of maximum principle stresses and displacements. For a general reference on conducting FEA on knee implant components see Initial fixation of a femoral knee component an in vitro and finite element study Int. J. Experimental and Computational Biomechanics Vol 1 No. 1 2009.

All contact surfaces between the implant and femur D were set up as frictional 0.5 coefficient of friction based on the general reference described above and the surfaces between the implant and condyle support plates E were frictionless.

For all cases the top face of the femur F was fully fixed. The bottom faces of the condyle support plates G and H were either fixed in all directions or when the load was applied allowed to move along the femoral axis only Z direction shown on visible coordinate system .

Loads of 1601 N 360 lbs. to the lateral condyle support plate and 2402 N 540 lbs. to the medial condyle support plate were applied in the direction of the Femoral Axis Z axis shown . A balance was struck to align model performance with the different contact areas and results. The overall mesh is shown in . The mesh of the implant component was refined for best results in the high stress areas .

The three different large knee femoral implant component geometries that were assessed were sized to correspond to large anatomical knees. The results for Interference No Load Interference Plus Load and No Interference Plus Load are shown in Table 19 below. show the corresponding high stress locations for the implant components which was the same for all three models tested. These data can be used in the design of patient specific implant components for example to identify a minimum component thickness for areas of high stress. As shown in the table there was a 24 reduction in stress with 6 cuts compared to five cuts 221 MPa versus 292 MPa interference plus no load .

This example illustrates tibial implant components and related designs. This example also describes methods and devices for performing a series of tibial bone cuts to prepare a patient s tibia for receiving a tibial implant component. Patient data such scans of the patient s joint can be used to locate the point and features used to identify planes axes and slopes associated with the patient s joint. As shown in the tibial proximal cut can be selected and or designed to be a certain distance below a particular location on the patient s tibial plateau. For example the tibial proximal cut height can be selected and or designed to be 1 mm 1.5 mm 2 mm 2.5 mm 3 mm 3.5 mm or 4 mm or more below the lowest point on the patient s tibial plateau or below the lowest point on the patient s medial tibial plateau or below the lowest point on the patient s lateral tibial plateau. In this example the tibial proximal cut height was selected and designed to be 2 mm below the lowest point on the patient s medial tibial plateau. For example as shown in anatomic sketches e.g. using a CAD program to manipulate a model of the patient s biological structure can be overlaid with the patient s tibial plateau. As shown in these sketched overlays can be used to identify the centers of tubercles and the centers of one or both of the lateral and medial plateaus. In addition as shown in one or more axes such as the patient s anatomic tibial axis posterior condylar axis and or sagittal axis can be derived from anatomic sketches e.g. based on a defined a midpoint line between the patient s lateral condyle center and medial condyle center. For example M L and AP planes can be determined as described in Example 9 above.

As shown in the proximal tibial resection was made a 2 mm below the lowest point of the patient s medial tibial plateau with a an A P slope cut that matched the A P slope on the patient s medial tibial plateau. As shown in an implant profile was selected and or designed to have 90 coverage of the patient s cut tibial surface. In certain embodiments the tibial implant profile can be selected and or designed such that tibial implant is supported entirely or substantially by cortical bone and or such that implant coverage of the cut tibial surface exceeds 100 and or has no support on cortical bone.

This example shows that using a patient s joint axes e.g. as identified from patient specific data and optionally from a model of the patient s joint to select and or design resection cuts e.g. the tibia and corresponding guide tools can create resection cuts perpendicular to the patient s tibial axis and based on the patient s medial AP slope. In addition one or more features of the corresponding implant components e.g. tibial tray implant thickness can be selected and or designed to align the tibial axis with the femoral axis and thereby correct the patient s alignment.

This example illustrates exemplary designs and implant components for tibial trays and inserts for certain embodiments described herein. In particular this example describes a standard blank tibial tray and insert and a method for altering the standard blanks based on patient specific data to include a patient adapted feature e.g. a patient adapted tray and insert perimeter that substantially match the perimeter of the patient s resected tibia .

If desired the locking mechanism for securing the tibial insert to the tibial tray can be designed and manufactured as an integral portion of the tibial tray. In some embodiments the locking mechanism can be significantly smaller than the upper surface of the tray to allow for perimeter matching of the tray whereby subsequent machining and or processing of the outer periphery and upper portion of the tibial tray to patient matched dimensions will not significantly degrade or otherwise affect the locking mechanism i.e. the final patient matched perimeter of the implant does not cut into the lock . In an alternative embodiment the locking mechanism may extend along the entire upper surface of the tibial tray whereby perimeter matching of the tray results in removal of some portion of the locking mechanism yet the remainder of the locking mechanism is still capable of retaining the tibial insert on the tibial tray i.e. the final patient matched perimeter of the implant cuts into some of the lock structure but sufficient lock structure remains to retain the insert in the tray . Such embodiments may have locking mechanisms pre formed in a library of pre formed tibial tray blanks. As another alternative one or more locking mechanism designs may be incorporated into the implant design program with an appropriate locking mechanism design and size chosen at the time of implant design and ultimately formed into or otherwise attached to a tibial tray chosen or designed to match patient anatomy during the process of designing manufacturing and or modifying the implant for use with the specific patient. Such design files can include CAD files or subroutines of locking mechanism of various sizes shaped and or locking features with an appropriate locking mechanism chosen at an appropriate time. If desired the design program can ultimately analyze the chosen designed lock and locking mechanism to confirm that the final lock will be capable of retaining the insert within the tray under loading and fatigue conditions and alerting or choosing an alternative design if FEA or other analyses identifies areas of weakness and or concern in the currently chosen design.

Standard blank tibial trays and or inserts can be prepared in multiple sizes e.g. having various AP dimensions ML dimensions and or stem and keel dimensions and configurations. For example in certain sized embodiments the stem can be 13 mm in diameter and 40 mm long and the keel can be 3.5 mm wide 15 degrees biased on the lateral side and 5 degrees biased on the medial side. However in other sized embodiments e.g. having larger or small tray ML and or AP dimensions the step and keel can be larger smaller or have a different configuration.

As mentioned above in this example and in certain embodiments the tibial tray can receive a one piece tibial insert or two piece tibial inserts. show aspects of an embodiment of a tibial implant component that includes a tibial tray and a one piece insert. show aspects of an embodiment of a tibial implant component that includes a tibial tray and a one piece insert. Alternatively a two piece tibial insert can be used with a two piece tibial tray. Alternatively a one piece tibial insert can be used with a two piece tibial tray.

This example illustrates tibial implant component selection and or design to address tibial rotation. describe exemplary techniques for determining tibial rotation for a patient and shows resulting alignment data for the second technique. With regard to a Floating Insert Technique includes putting the knee through a full range of flexion and extension allowing the tibial trial to orientate itself in the best position relative to the femoral component. The orientation is marked on the anterior tibial cortex and the tibial component is implanted to match this mark. With regard to an anatomic landmark technique see Mizu uchi et al Effect of Ankle Rotation on Cutting of the Tibia in TKA JBJS 2006 Vol 88 Pages 2632 2636 utilizes the AP Axis of the ankle joint and the line perpendicular to the anterior cortical line.

Various tibial implant component features can optimized to ensure proper tibial rotation. For example illustrates exemplary stem design options for a tibial tray including using stem and keel dimensions that increase or decrease depending on the size of the tibial implant component e.g. in the ML and or AP dimension . Moreover cement pockets can be employed to enhance stabilization upon implantation In addition patient specific stem and keel guide tools can be selected and or designed so that the prepared stem and keel holes in a patient s proximal tibia are properly sized which can minimize rotation e.g. of a keel in a keel hole that is too large .

Another tibial implant component that can be used to address tibial rotation is selecting and or designing a tibial tray perimeter profile and or a tibial insert perimeter profile that minimizes overhang from the patient s bone which may catch and cause rotation and optionally that maximizes seating of the implant component on cortical bone. Accordingly in certain embodiments the tibial tray perimeter profile and or a tibial insert perimeter profile is preoperatively selected and or designed to substantially match the perimeter profile of the patient s resected tibial surface. show an approach for identifying the patient s tibial implant perimeter profile based on the depth and angle of the proximal tibial resection which can applied in the selection and or design of the tibial tray perimeter profile and or the tibial insert perimeter profile. As shown in the bottom image the lines inside the perimeter of the cut surface represent the perimeters of the various cuts in the top image taken at various depths from the patient s tibial surface. show the same approach as described for but applied to a different patient having a smaller tibia e.g. smaller diameter and perimeter length .

Similarly show four different exemplary tibial implant profiles for example having different medial and lateral condyle perimeter shapes that generally match various different relative medial and lateral condyle perimeter dimensions. In certain embodiments a tibial tray and or insert can be selected e.g. preoperatively or intraoperatively from a collection or library of implants for a particular patient i.e. to best match the perimeter of the patient s cut tibial surface and implanted without further alteration to the perimeter profile. However in certain embodiments these different tibial tray and or insert perimeter profiles can serve as blanks. For example one of these tibial tray and or insert profiles can be selected preoperatively from a library e.g. an actual or virtual library for a particular patient to best match the perimeter of the patient s cut tibial surface. Then the selected implant perimeter can be designed or further altered based on patient specific data for example to substantially match the perimeter of the patient s cut tibial surface.

As described in this example various features of a tibial implant component can be designed or altered based on patient specific data. For example the tibial implant component design or alterations can be made to maximize coverage and extend to cortical margins maximize medial compartment coverage minimize overhang from the medial compartment avoid internal rotation of tibial components to avoid patellar dislocation and avoid excessive external rotation to avoid overhang laterally and impingement on the popliteus tendon.

This example describes methods and devices for performing a series of bone cuts to receive a patient specific implant. Specifically a set of jigs is designed in connection with the design of a patient specific implant component. The designed jigs guide the surgeon in performing one or more patient specific cuts to the bone so that those cut bone surface s negatively match the patient specific bone cuts of the implant component. The set of jigs described in this example are designed for a femur first cut technique.

In a first step shown in a first femur jig is used to establish peg holes and pin placements for a subsequent jig used for a distal cut. In this example the first jig is designed to circumvent 3 mm of cartilage thickness. In a second step shown in the distal cut is performed with a second femur jig. In this example the second jig is patient specific. However in certain embodiments that apply a traditional distal cut a standard jig can be used. In a third step as shown in the anterior cut the posterior cut and the chamfer cuts are performed with a third femur jig. In this example the jig includes slots that are 1.5 mm wide to allow for a saw blade thickness i.e. no metal guides . As shown in in certain embodiments for implant component designs having six or more inner bone facing surfaces for example having one or two additional chamfer cuts the additional cuts can be performed using one or more additional jigs. In this example the additional jig is designed to accommodate two steep additional chamfer cuts.

Next the tibia is cut using one or more jigs designed to make patient specific cuts to the tibia. An exemplary tibial jig is depicted in . A tibial alignment pin is used to help properly orient the jig. The portion of the jig inserted between the femur and tibia can have a variable thickness. In certain embodiments the tibial jig can be designed to accommodate for composite thickness from the distal cut femur . Alternatively or additionally a balancing chip can be used to address differences in the distance between the tibia and femur surfaces. For example in certain embodiments a tibia jig may be designed to rest on 2 mm of cartilage while a balancing chip is designed to rest on the distal cut femur.

A balancing chip is shown in . If a varus deformity of the knee is observed virtual realignment can be addressed by including added thickness to the balancing chip in the area that would produce a leg in neutral alignment . For a grossly mal aligned contra lateral leg correction can be per a surgeon s order. The balancing chip can include a feature to attach it to the tibia jig and thereby allow for accurate distal placement of the tibial cut while at the same time accommodating for composite thickness. An exemplary balancing chip attached to a tibia jig is shown in . To facilitate attachment the balancing chip handle matches the tibial slope designed into the tibial cut and tibial implant. Preferably the balancing chip is designed to enter into the joint easily.

This example describes methods and devices for performing a series of bone cuts to receive a patient specific implant. Specifically a set of jigs is designed in connection with the design of a patient specific implant component. The designed jigs guide the surgeon in performing one or more patient specific cuts to the bone so that those cut bone surface s negatively match the patient specific bone cuts of the implant component. The set of jigs described in this example are designed for cuts to a femoral implant component in a tibia first cut technique.

In a first step shown in a first jig is used to establish placement and alignment of femoral implant peg holes. In the example the placement is flexed 5 degrees with respect to the sagittal femoral axis. In a second step shown in a second jig is used to establish placement pins for the distal cut jig. The second jig can have different thicknesses to accommodate composite thickness from the cut tibial surface. In a third step as shown in a distal cut jig is positioned based on the placement established by the previous jig. The distal cut jig can be patient specific or standard. Lastly as shown in remaining cuts are performed with a chamfer cut jig. In the example the anterior cut is not oblique.

The implant components and guide tools also referred to as jigs or iJigs for the patient were designed based on patient specific CT derived data from the patient. Specifically data from CT images of the patient s knee was selected and imported into computer modeling software. The software was used to generate a model of the biological structures in the patient s knee and to design e.g. using CAD software a femoral implant component a tibial implant component and related guide tools. The design of the implant components and guide tools included manufacturing for example using CAM software and additive and or casting manufacturing techniques as described above. In addition predetermined resection cuts to the patient s femur and tibia were designed based on the patient s biology anatomy and in conjunction with the patient adapted features of the implant component s . For example the resection cuts and the corresponding component s bone facing surfaces were designed based on patient specific data to substantially negatively match e.g. in surface area surface angle and or other features . Then surgery was performed on the cadaveric patient to perform the predetermined e.g. designed resection cuts and to implant the components designed for the particular patient. In addition one or more guide tools were designed and used for the procedure which also were designed to include patient adapted features for example a bone facing surface that substantially negatively matched the patient s anatomy and or cutting guide slots or drilling guide holes that provided accurate placement for the predetermined resection cuts and holes for the particular patient.

A surgical procedure was performed to implant femoral and tibial implant components for the cadaveric patient. Prior to the surgery patient adapted implant components femoral and tibial implant components and guide tools were designed including manufacturing in conjunction with a resection cut design. Then the guide tools were used during surgery to prepare the predetermined resection cuts and place the implant components.

The patient adapted femoral implant components included six bone cuts. The bone cut design was designed in conjunction with corresponding resection cuts. show the patient adapted femoral implant and resection cuts for the patient. As exemplified in the six bone cuts included an anterior bone cut medial and lateral facets of a distal bone cut medial and lateral facets of a posterior bone cut medial and lateral facets of an anterior chamfer bone cut medial and lateral facets of a first posterior chamfer bone cut and medial and lateral facets of a second posterior chamfer bone cut. In addition the femoral implant component included a stepped or step cut between the medial facet and lateral facet of the distal bone cut in order to provide enhanced preservation of distal medial bone stock.

Review of the patient adapted implant component and corresponding resection cuts shows various features of the implant component that specifically match features of the resection cuts and or of the patient s anatomy. For example the implant component includes a width height and condylar width that is patient specific i.e. matches the patient s anatomy or patient engineered i.e. derived from patient specific data to achieve one or more predetermined parameter thresholds . Moreover the implant component bone cuts for the patient were engineered to specifically match the resection cuts for the patient e.g. in cut and or facet surface areas angles relative orientations and or other features including a stepped or step resection cut between the medial facet and lateral facet of the distal resection cut.

In addition the patient adapted femoral implant component included on the joint facing surface of each condyle a patient specific J curve that substantially positively matched the J curve of each of the particular patient s femoral condyles. Toward the anterior joint facing surface the implant component included a trochlear groove profile that was patient engineered to match a patellar prosthesis. The anterior margin of the femoral implant was designed to provide coverage specific to the selected and or designed anterior resected anatomical surface. On the bone facing side of the femoral implant component two pegs 7 mm in diameter projected from the medial and lateral facets of the distal bone cut. The receiving peg holes in the patient s distal femur were prepared with an 8 mm drill bit. Each bone cut and bone cut facet on the bone facing surface of the femoral implant included a cement cutout to hold cement applied during the procedure.

The guide tool designs were based on a tibial cut first technique. The set of guide tools used for this patient included a patient adapted femoral drilling guide tool and a C shaped attachment . The patient adapted femoral drilling guide tool included drill guide holes and a placement slot corresponding to a cutting guide slot for an anterior resection cut. The bone facing surface of the femoral drilling guide tool was designed or selected to substantially negatively match the corresponding surface of the patient s femur having 3 mm of cartilage such that when the tool was fitted in place on the femur the drill guide holes were placed at pre selected and or designed locations for the peg holes. In addition a C shaped attachment was included . The C shaped attachment included one end that fit into the placement slot so that the other end of the C shaped attachment touched or nearly touched the patient s femur. The C shaped attachment when fitted into the placement slot acted as a reference arm to indicate the position i.e. depth of the anterior resection cut. Accordingly the surgeon was able to optimize the positioning of the drilling guide tool based in part on the anterior cut reference provided by the C shaped attachment and thereby avoid for example notching of the anterior cortex i.e. at the anterior or proximal terminus of the anterior resection cut. Certain subsequent guide tools included pegs that anchored into these holes.

As shown in balancer chip guide tools were provided in varying thicknesses for ligament balancing. Six balancing chips with six different thicknesses were provided with two shown in respectively. On the bone facing surface not shown in the figures the tools included two pegs for anchoring the tool into the holes created with the drilling guide tool . As shown the figures additional pin holes were included on the medial and lateral sides of the tool for optional additional anchoring support. On the joint facing side the tools included marks in or on their surfaces representing the locations of various features that might be useful to the surgeon in balancing the joint for example the Whiteside line and epicondylar axis.

The balancer chip guide tool also included asymmetric medial and lateral distal cut guide slots and a step cut guide slot . Accordingly the selected balancer chip guide tool having the desired thickness also acted as a distal cut guide tool and as a step cut guide tool. Specifically once the surgeon selected the tool with the desired thickness the distal and step resection cuts were performed with that guide tool . In addition the guide tool included distal cutting guide slots that were patient specific in orientation angle and or depth but that had a standard slot size designed for fitting an interchangeable metal guide slot insert into both guide slots. For example of the six guide tools having variable thicknesses two had medial and lateral distal slot sizes with a standard 12 mm length e.g. to receive a standard 12 mm metal slot insert and four had medial and lateral distal slot sizes with a standard 20 mm length e.g. to receive a standard 20 mm metal slot insert . One or more features of the tool were patient adapted. For example the orientation of the distal and step cut slots were selected and or designed based on patient specific data e.g. imaging data.

As shown in a spacing paddle was included for using during balancing to represent extra asymmetric lateral poly thickness. Also included was an additional balancer chip guide tool not shown in the figures having the thickness of the spacing paddle incorporated into it.

As shown in a chamfer cut guide tool was designed with numbered cutting guide slots for an anterior resection cut 1 asymmetric medial and lateral posterior resection cuts 2 3 and an anterior chamfer resection cut 4 . As shown the cutting slots were numbered for the order in which the cuts were to be performed. Each cutting slot was designed to fit a metal saw guide insert with inserts for slots and being interchangeable. In addition as shown in the figure the curvature profile on the medial and lateral posterior edges of the tool were designed to substantially match the profile of the underlying edge of each condyle e.g. in an axial view . This feature allowed for the surgeon to confirm proper placement of the tool prior to performing resection cuts.

As shown in a pair of angled cutting guide tools was included to facilitate the first posterior chamfer resection cut and the second posterior chamfer resection cut respectively. As shown in the figures the tools included asymmetric cutting guide surfaces and that provided asymmetric resection cuts at different depths medially and laterally for example to maximize bone preservation for the particular patient. As shown in an additional angled cutting guide tool was included to perform the same resection cuts as tool but it also included holding arms for the surgeon to grasp while using the tool . The cutting guide tools also included additional pin holes on the medial and lateral sides of the tool for optional additional anchoring support.

As shown in Steinman pins were included to facilitate optional additional support of one or more tools. As shown in a patient adapted impactor tip was included to aid the surgeon in fitting the femoral implant component.

Several guide tools for resectioning the tibia and or placing the tibial implant component were designed and included for the patient s surgery. For example as shown in a tibial alignment guide tool was designed to position and stabilize the cutting guide tool for resectioning the proximal tibial surface for example to provide an accurate proximal tibia resection cut. For this patient the proximal tibial resection cut was designed to be 4 mm below the lowest point of the medial plateau with an AP slope of 5 degrees and perpendicular to the mechanical axis. The tibial cutting guide tool was designed to rest on the anterior part of the tibia with the medial edge of the guide tool aligned to the medial of the tibial tubercle. Accordingly on its bone facing surface the anterior part of the tibial cutting guide tool was designed to substantially negatively match the patient s anterior tibial surface. The proximal part of the tibial cutting guide tool was designed to rest on cartilage estimated as 2 mm in thickness. Additionally the tibial cutting guide tool was designed with a dovetail mating feature for attaching to a corresponding dovetail mating feature on the tibial alignment guide tool which could be attached to a rod attachment to visually check the alignment to the mechanical axis.

As shown in a tibial keel prep guide tool and keel punch were designed to facilitate preparation of the hole and keel slots in the cut tibia for proper implantation of the tibial tray. The perimeter of the guide was designed as an exact match to the perimeter of the tibial tray. An arrow was located on the proximal surface of the tool to indicate alignment to the medial of the tibia tubercle for proper tibial implant rotational alignment. The face of the keel prep guide tool included a central guide hole and guide slots extending from the central guide hole. The central guide hole was used to guide a drill bit to establish the central peg hole for the tibial implant. Then the keel punch was inserted into the peg hole with force. The guide slots oriented the keel edges to establish the keel slots in the proximal tibia which subsequently received the keels of the tibial implant.

In addition medial and lateral trial inserts mimicking various thicknesses of inserts for the tibial implant were included in 6 mm and 8 mm thicknesses for medial trial inserts and in 8 mm 9 mm and 10 mm thicknesses for lateral trial inserts. Medial and lateral trial spacers mimicking various thicknesses of tibial implant component s tibial tray and tibial insert also were included in 8 mm and 10 mm thicknesses for medial trial spacers and in 10 mm 11 mm and 12 mm thicknesses for lateral trial spacers.

As shown in a set of tibial implant components also was designed for the patient. As shown in the tibial tray was designed using an 11 mm 35 mm central stem and 2 mm wide keels angled posteriorly 5 degrees on the medial side and 15 degrees on the lateral side. The locking mechanism for engaging a tibial insert included a medial female engaging slot and a lateral female engaging slot for receiving a corresponding medial male engaging slot and a corresponding lateral male engaging slot on a one piece or on respective pieces of a two piece tibial tray insert. As shown the lateral side of the lateral female engaging slot and the medial side of the medial female engaging slot were posteriorly tapered toward the center of the tray for example tapered toward the center by about ten degrees. In addition the tray included an anterior raised portion posterior relieved portions and dovetail fittings to engage matching dovetail fittings on the underside of the implant insert s . These features provided easy movement of the corresponding male slot or projection on the underside of the insert s into the female slots on the tibial tray .

As shown in inserts having variable thicknesses were provided. Specifically two medial inserts with thicknesses of 6 mm and 8 mm and three lateral inserts with thicknesses of 8 mm 9 mm and 10 mm were provided. shows the tibial tray with lateral and medial inserts locked into place. depicts an axial view of the tibial tray implanted into the resected proximal tibial surface. As shown the tibial tray was designed to have a perimeter that matched the perimeter of the patient s resected proximal tibial surface with a 2 mm margin of tibial surface on the periphery.

The perimeters of the trial spacers except for the handle portion tibial implant component trial inserts and tibial inserts were designed to substantially match the perimeter of the tibial tray implant component which itself was adapted to match the perimeter of the patient s resected tibial surface with a 2 mm margin of tibial surface.

The patient adapted implant components were successfully implanted using the resection cuts and patient adapted guide tools that were specifically designed for the cadaveric patient based on particular patient data e.g. image data . Specifically the tibial cut guide tools showed good fit with the patient s tibial plateau. The alignment guide tool and down rod helped to confirm proper tibial alignment of the cut guide tool prior to resectioning for the patient. The different guide tools used to prepare the peg holes and keel slots in the proximal resected surface of the patient s femur were found to be useful. The tibial guide tools designed to include a patient derived perimeter were found to fit well with the perimeter of the patient s resected tibia. The matching perimeter was helpful in properly aligning the cut tools to establish the predetermined resection cuts and or for balancing. The tibial trial inserts were helpful in selecting the proper medial and lateral tibial inserts for balancing and fit. The tibial inserts were easily fit into the locking mechanism of the tibial tray. Overall the predetermined tibial resection cuts patient adapted tibial guide tools and patient adapted tibial implant components provided a well fit and aligned implant.

On the femoral side the guide tools having a patient specific bone facing surface fit the patient s biological surface. The tools with variable thicknesses were useful to assess balance and tightness looseness of the joint. Regarding the patient adapted femoral implant component once in place the component showed good coverage of the resected surfaces of the patient s femur and proper articulation with the tibial component.

This example describes methods and rationale for performing an anterior bone cut on a targeted femur of a patient in preparation for receiving a patient specific implant. The anterior cut can be placed to satisfy one or more conditions and or constraints which can include 1 placement relative to anterior cortex e.g. to avoid notching 2 angle with a selected biomechanical axis 3 angle with a selected anatomical axis 4 desired angle with a peg axis 5 desired angle relative to a posterior cut 6 angle with epicondylar axis or posterior condylar axis 7 desired patellar coverage 8 desired thickness of the implant 9 desired thickness of bone resection e.g. medial trochlear peak lateral trochlear peak trochlear groove and 10 desired position relative to femoral shaft to avoid notching. If desired the intended cut can be shifted along one two three or more degrees of freedom.

For example a desired anterior cut can be placed by 1 determining the flexion extension angle to be divergent from the mechanical axis e.g. in the sagittal plane 2 determining the internal external rotation to balance the resection of the medial and lateral trochlear surfaces or alternatively the lateral trochlear resection may be larger than the medial trochlear resection and 3 determining the A P position depth depth of cut plane to maximize patellar coverage without notching femoral cortex. In an alternative embodiment the internal external rotation and depth of the anterior cut can be determined to minimize implant thickness without compromising fatigue strength. In another embodiment the anterior cut angle can be determined to maximize cement compression. In another embodiment the anterior cut angle can be determined to facilitate implant insertion.
