The present Application for Patent is related to the following co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 800 431 entitled USING MOTION TO IMPROVE LOCAL WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTIVITY by Lee and Teague filed concurrently herewith assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Mobile devices such as cell phones smart phones tablet computers laptops personal digital assistants PDAs etc. are often capable of connecting to local wireless networks such as wireless local area networks WLANs WiFi networks Bluetooth networks and the like. Such networks are often used to provide data connectivity for these mobile devices.

A place of relevance PoR is a location that is often visited by a user. A PoR is typically associated with a particular local wireless network. Accordingly a mobile device can identify a PoR and detect subsequent visits by monitoring local wireless network signals. The mobile device can continuously scan for available local wireless networks and notify the user when it detects the local wireless network corresponding to the PoR.

Currently mobile devices simply perform periodic scans. The rate of scanning is a tradeoff between power consumption and the delay of establishing a connection. These scans can require significant power and thus there is an opportunity to use motion information to improve the power performance of the connectivity management.

The disclosure is directed to using a change in motion to improve PoR detection. A method for using a change in motion to improve PoR detection includes determining whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed to a new motion state determining whether or not to trigger the mobile device to scan for available local wireless networks if the motion state has changed and identifying a PoR based on the scanning.

An apparatus for using a change in motion to improve PoR detection includes logic configured to determine whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed to a new motion state logic configured to determine whether or not to trigger the mobile device to scan for available local wireless networks if the motion state has changed and logic configured to identify a PoR based on the scanning.

An apparatus for using a change in motion to improve PoR detection includes means for determining whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed to a new motion state means for determining whether or not to trigger the mobile device to scan for available local wireless networks if the motion state has changed and means for identifying a PoR based on the scanning.

A non transitory computer readable medium for using a change in motion to improve PoR detection includes at least one instruction to determine whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed to a new motion state at least one instruction to determine whether or not to trigger the mobile device to scan for available local wireless networks if the motion state has changed and at least one instruction to identify a PoR based on the scanning.

Various aspects are disclosed in the following description and related drawings. Alternate aspects may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any aspect described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects. Likewise the term aspects of the disclosure does not require that all aspects of the disclosure include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many aspects are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally the sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the aspects described herein the corresponding form of any such aspects may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs 1 . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EV DO Evolved High Rate Packet Data eHRPD Global System of Mobile Communication GSM Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Wideband CDMA W CDMA Long Term Evolution LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of WiFi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs 1 . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE 4 or UE 5 over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only memory ROM or random access memory RAM electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly an aspect of the disclosure can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the aspects of the disclosure and are merely to aid in the description of various aspects of the disclosure.

In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. the application the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include logic configured to determine whether or not a motion state of the communication device has changed to a new motion state logic configured to determine whether or not to trigger the communication device to scan for available local wireless networks if the motion state has changed and logic configured to identify a PoR based on the scanning. The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the logic configured to process information can include logic configured to determine whether or not a motion state of the communication device has changed to a new motion state logic configured to determine whether or not to trigger the communication device to scan for available local wireless networks if the motion state has changed and logic configured to identify a PoR based on the scanning. The processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM flash memory ROM erasable programmable ROM EPROM EEPROM registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input .

The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an aspect that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the aspects described below in more detail.

Mobile devices such as cell phones smart phones tablet computers laptops personal digital assistants PDAs etc. are often capable of connecting to local wireless networks such as wireless local area networks WLANs WiFi networks Bluetooth networks and the like. Such networks are often used to provide data connectivity for these mobile devices.

A place of relevance PoR is a location that is often visited by a user. A PoR is typically associated with a particular local wireless network or group of local wireless networks. Accordingly a mobile device can identify a PoR and detect subsequent visits by monitoring local wireless network signals. The mobile device can continuously scan for available local wireless networks and notify the user when it detects the one or more local wireless networks corresponding to the PoR.

Currently mobile devices simply perform periodic scans. The rate of scanning is a tradeoff between power consumption and the delay of establishing a connection. These scans can require significant power as shown in .

As shown frequent scans can require significant power. However there is an opportunity to use motion information to improve the power performance of the connectivity management. For example there is no need to continuously scan for local wireless networks when the mobile device is stationary. All that is needed is an initial scan to identify available local wireless networks at that location. Additionally there is no need to continuously scan for local wireless networks when the mobile device is moving because a PoR is a stationary location and thus network scans while the mobile device is moving do not contribute to identifying a PoR.

Accordingly a mobile device can reduce power consumption by performing scans only when the motion state of the mobile device changes from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state. The motion state of the mobile device and changes from one state to another can be detected by the mobile device s accelerometer which requires very little power. This reduces a large number of superfluous scans which dramatically decreases power consumption.

To determine whether the mobile device is stationary or non stationary a motion state classifier can classify the motion of the mobile device into seven motion states walk run sit stand fiddle in transit and null. Fiddle means the user is holding the mobile device. In transit means the mobile device is travelling in any vehicle such as an automobile a train a plane etc. Null means that the motion classifier cannot reach a level of confidence in the motion classification necessary to report a motion state.

These seven fine grained motion states can be remapped to two coarse grained motion states stationary sit stand fiddle null and non stationary walk run in transit . These coarse grained motion states can be used to identify two motion state change events the mobile device can go from stationary to non stationary or from non stationary to stationary.

There are several types of motion state change algorithms that can be used to determine the motion state of the mobile device. For example the instant change detection ICD algorithm monitors consecutive motion states and detects any transition between stationary and in transit the algorithm ignores the null output . As another example the cumulative sum control chart CUSUM based change detection CCD algorithm accumulates and detects change upon crossing a maximum divided by two e.g. the maximum may be 10 seconds . As yet another example the CUSUM based and collapse change detection CCCD algorithm detects change events within two minutes. This works because many of the CUSUM based change events are generated within two minutes. The algorithm collapses or combines change events if they are generated within two minutes.

At the motion state manager a motion detector reads motion data from the sensor s . The motion detector can be any appropriate motion detector. A motion state classifier receives data representing the motion from the motion detector . The motion state classifier can classify the motion as one of for example walk run sit stand absolute rest fiddle in transit or null. A motion state change detector receives the classified motion from the motion state classifier . The motion state change detector can detect a motion state change from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state or vice versa and can generate a corresponding motion state change event.

A local wireless network scan manager in the LWN subsystem receives motion state change event notifications from the motion state change detector . In response the local wireless network scan manager sends a message to the local wireless network access subsystem requesting that it perform one or more scans for available local wireless networks. For example the local wireless network scan manager may request that the local wireless network access subsystem perform five back to back scans for available networks.

A compute signal distance mechanism within a PoR visit segmentor receives a list of available local wireless networks and their corresponding received signal strength indications RSSIs from the local wireless network access subsystem . The local wireless network access subsystem generates the list of available networks and their RSSIs in response to the request received from the scan manager . A determine entry exit mechanism in the PoR visit segmentor stores the current PoR in the current PoR visit cache . The compute signal distance mechanism can read the current PoR from the current PoR visit cache .

The PoR visit segmentor can send entry and exit events to the PoR service . The PoR visit segmentor can also send entry events to a PoR model matcher and exit events to a PoR model updater both contained in the AP . The PoR model updater updates PoR models in the PoR model storage with the exit event. The PoR model matcher reads PoR model data from the PoR model storage .

The PoR service upon receiving entry or exit events stores the entry or exit time in a PoR visit history storage which may be for example flash memory. The PoR service can receive subscribe events or subscription requests from the one or more situation aware applications and in response can send entry and exit events to the one or more situation aware applications . The PoR service can also receive requests for PoR data from the one or more situation aware applications and in response can send the PoR data and the PoR visit history to the one or more situation aware applications .

There may be various interfaces between the sensor subsystem and the LWN subsystem . For example there can be a subscribe to motion state change events interface that specifies receiver time and distance parameters. The receiver parameter may be the identity of the event receiver to handle motion state change events. The motion state change events may include the type of event and the associated timestamp. The time parameter may be the minimum time latency for event detection and can be provided in milliseconds. The distance parameter may be the minimum movement distance for event detection and can be provided in meters. An unsubscribe to motion state change events interface can specify just the receiver parameter.

There also may be various interfaces between the LWN subsystem and the PoR services . For example there can be a subscribe to entry and exit events interface that specifies receiver and time parameters. The receiver parameter may be the identity of the event receiver to handle PoR visit events. The visit events can include the type of event either entry or exit the associated timestamp and the PoR model or fingerprint. The PoR model can include the basic service set identifier BSSID of any access points at the PoR the average RSSI at the PoR and a count of the resp. at the PoR. The time parameter may be the minimum time latency for event detection and can be provided in milliseconds. An unsubscribe to entry and exit events interface can specify just the receiver parameter.

At the PoR visit segmentor and local wireless network access subsystem request and perform a scan for available local wireless networks. As an example this may take approximately 10.5 seconds. At the PoR visit segmentor computes the signal distance of the detected local wireless networks. At the PoR visit segmentor determines an entry or exit event for the PoR visit. At the PoR visit segmentor updates the network fingerprint of the current PoR visit in the current PoR visit cache . As an example this processing at the PoR visit segmentor may take approximately 80 ms.

For entry events at the PoR model matcher can read all the PoR models from the PoR model storage . At the PoR model matcher can determine a matched PoR identifier and at can update the PoR visit history in the PoR visit history storage . For exit events at the PoR model matcher can update any matched PoR models in the PoR model storage and at can update the PoR visit history in the PoR visit history storage .

If at the motion state has changed from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state then at the mobile device scans for available local wireless networks. At the mobile device measures the signal strengths of any detected local wireless networks. At the mobile device determines whether or not the available local wireless networks match a stored model of a PoR. The model may include a fingerprint of the PoR which may include the identities and signal strengths of the local wireless networks available at the PoR as discussed above. If the mobile device does not identify a stored PoR then at the mobile device connects to the best available local wireless network. If however the mobile device does identify a stored PoR based on the model then at the mobile device generates a PoR entry event and connects to the local wireless network specified in the PoR model. At the mobile device updates the history of PoR events with the PoR entry event.

If the mobile device connects to a local wireless network at then at the mobile device may optionally identify its current location as a PoR as is known in the art. At the mobile device optionally stores a model of the PoR for future identification. As discussed above the model can include a fingerprint of the PoR which may include the identities and signal strengths of the local wireless networks available at the PoR.

In an aspect a scan can be triggered based on more than simply a motion state change. For example there could be a minimum period between scans and or a maximum period between scans. The minimum period would prevent the mobile device from scanning too frequently while the maximum period would ensure that the mobile device scanned frequently enough. The scan at the maximum period is referred to as a long interval heartbeat scan and can be for example a scan every 300 seconds.

In an additional aspect RF information can be used to disable other sensor subsystems when not needed. For example if the cellular transceiver determines during idle handoff procedures that occur anyway to enable fast connectivity of a mobile device that the mobile device is greater than a threshold distance from any local wireless network access points then the inertial motion tracking can be disabled to save power until needed.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
