Typically organization administrators org admins or similar do not have a centralized view of the computing infrastructure that enables them to efficiently and quickly monitor and troubleshoot objects of interest e.g. virtual datacenters virtual machines etc. . Oftentimes any viewing of objects of interest is provided by displaying various pages that provide information in textual and or tabular form. Additionally the views that org admins are provided do not properly aid the org admin to effectively monitor and troubleshoot objects of interest. As a result it is difficult for org admins to efficiently and easily view information of objects of interest.

Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While various embodiments are discussed herein it will be understood that they are not intended to be limiting. On the contrary the presented embodiments are intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents which may be included within the spirit and scope the various embodiments as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore in this Description of Embodiments numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. However embodiments may be practiced without one or more of these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the described embodiments.

Computing environment includes a plurality of virtual datacenters for example virtual datacenter virtual datacenter and virtual datacenter . In general a virtual datacenter is an abstract pool of resources such as resources . Resources can include memory central processing unit CPU and storage . It is understood that a virtual data center is implemented on one or some combination of physical machines.

Computing environment can include any number of virtual datacenters. For example computing environment is a corporate computing environment that includes many physical and or virtual datacenters. In some embodiments the virtual datacenters are associated with various groups or organizations within the corporation such as management marketing operations testing etc.

Virtual datacenter includes a plurality of devices. The devices are any number of physical and or virtual machines such as virtual machines . For example in one embodiment computing environment is a corporate computing environment that includes tens of thousands of physical and or virtual machines. It is understood that a virtual machine is implemented on one or some combination of physical machines. It should be appreciated that cloud environment can be communicatively coupled to any number of computing environments and associated virtual datacenters.

Virtual machines may be logically grouped. That is a subset of virtual machines may grouped together in a container e.g. VMware vApp . For example three different virtual machines may be implemented for messaging. As such the three different virtual machines are logically grouped together to facilitate in implementing messaging functionality. The virtual machines in the logical group may execute instructions alone and or in combination e.g. distributed with one another. Also the container of virtual machines and or individual virtual machines may be controlled by a virtual management system.

Virtual machines include a variety of applications e.g. operating system . The virtual devices may have the same installed applications or may have different installed software. The installed software may be one or more software applications from one or more vendors.

Virtual datacenter and virtual datacenter are similar to virtual datacenter described herein. For example virtual datacenter includes resources virtual machines and parameters .

Cloud environment is a device comprising at least one processor and memory. As described herein cloud environment may be located in an Internet connected data center or a private cloud computing center coupled with one or more public and or private networks. Cloud environment typically couples with a virtual or physical entity in a computing environment e.g. computing environment through a network connection which may be a public network connection private network connection or some combination thereof. For example a user in computing environment may couple via an Internet connection with cloud environment by accessing a web page or application presented by cloud environment at a virtual or physical entity within computing environment .

Cloud environment includes monitoring system for monitoring computing environment . In general monitoring system generates graph that includes various parameters e.g. parameters and parameters of the virtual datacenters and or virtual machines.

In various embodiments graph allows a user e.g. organization administrator etc. to quickly and efficiently monitor troubleshoot and or audit computing environment . As will be described in further detail below based on graph a user can select various visual depictions of parameters to identify possible causes for poor health. Additionally the user has an option to view the objects interlaced with specific users activities over a timeframe. Also events are correlated to problem areas and overlaid with overall health.

Monitoring system includes among other things parameter accessor database and graph generator . In various embodiments anyone of or combination of parameter accessor database and graph generator may be located in computing environment or any other computing environment.

Parameter accessor accesses parameters or attributes of the virtual datacenters. For example parameter accessor accesses parameters of virtual datacenter parameters of virtual datacenter and parameters of virtual datacenter

Parameters of the virtual datacenters can be any parameter or attribute that facilitates in monitoring of computing environment . For example parameters can be but are not limited to CPU allocation CPU usage resource allocation current resource usage virtual machine aggregate health memory allocation memory usage user activity etc.

In one embodiment the parameters are stored in database . For example an application programming interface API is utilized to access the parameters periodically e.g. 1 2 seconds and the parameters are then stored in database for subsequent use of graph generator .

Graph generator as described above accesses parameters for example from database and generates graph . Graph is configured to be rendered for display as a single view on a display. That is graph is generated such that it is rendered as a single viewing object on a display. As such a user is able to easily view graph on a display and view parameters of computing environment for one or more of monitoring auditing and troubleshooting of computing environment .

More specifically graph is utilized as an interactive user interface. For instance graph displays various pertinent computing environment parameters for a user to facilitate quick understanding of problems and pinpointing the root causes of the problems in computing environment .

It should be understood that utilizing any of graphs A I provides a hierarchical view of various attributes parameters or metrics that are overlaid and or correlated with one another. This allows a user to relationally navigate within the graphs to help determine the cause of problem events e.g. errors that occur in computing environment .

Referring now to graph A includes computing environment overview portion which includes a global overview of allocated resources for each virtual datacenter and current usage of resources for each virtual datacenter of computing environment . That is overview portion depicts an overview of the entire infrastructure of computing environment .

For example computing environment includes seven different virtual datacenters because seven different virtual datacenters are depicted in overview portion . One of the virtual datacenters is virtual datacenter depicted as the far right virtual datacenter of the seven different virtual datacenters in overview portion . Virtual datacenter includes a bottom portion that depicts the allocated resources of virtual datacenter as compared to or in proportion to the allocated resources of all the other virtual datacenters. Additionally virtual datacenter includes top portion that depicts the current resource usage of virtual datacenter as compared to or in proportion to the current resource usage of all the other virtual datacenters.

Moreover computing environment overview portion includes window which controls which virtual datacenters are viewed in other portions of graph A. For example window includes four virtual datacenters. The four virtual datacenters are the Management virtual datacenter Marketing virtual datacenter Operations virtual datacenter and Test virtual datacenter respectively.

It should be appreciated that window can include any number of virtual datacenters. As such any virtual datacenter located in window would be viewed in other portions of graph A.

Graph A includes health portion that depicts the health for virtual machines or virtual machines groupings e.g. VMware vApp for each virtual datacenter. In particular each bar in health portion represents a grouping of virtual machines. For example virtual datacenter depicts thirteen bars that represent the health of thirteen different virtual machine groupings in health portion virtual datacenter depicts sixteen bars that represent the health of sixteen different virtual machine groupings in health portion virtual datacenter depicts four bars that represents the health of four different virtual machine groupings in health portion and virtual datacenter depicts thirteen bars that represents the health of thirteen different virtual machine groupings in health portion .

In one embodiment the height of each bar in health portion represents the aggregate health of a virtual machine grouping. As such the health of each virtual machine grouping can be compared to other virtual machine groupings within the same virtual datacenter and or with respect to other virtual machine groupings in other virtual datacenters.

In another embodiment the greater the length of the bar the poorer the health of the virtual machine grouping. For example virtual datacenter includes virtual machine grouping that has poor health which is represented by bar . In such an example bar for the virtual machine grouping can be shaded a different color to signify that the associated virtual machine grouping is in poor health e.g. has an error . For instance a bar that exceeds a predetermined threshold for poor health can be shaded a different color than bars that have not exceeded the predetermined threshold for poor health. It is noted that virtual datacenter also includes a virtual machine grouping represented by a bar that indicates the virtual machine grouping is in poor health similar to bar .

In various embodiments the health as depicted by bars in health portion is an aggregate health of the virtual machine grouping. For example the aggregate health is comprised of three factors such as health capacity and workload. The health factor represents historical data and facilitates in determining whether the current state of health is different than historical states of health. The capacity factor the time remaining until the virtual machine grouping is out of computing space. The workload factor represents what resources the virtual machine grouping is currently utilizing e.g. CPU .

In one embodiment overall aggregate health Max Health Capacity Workload wherein each of the Health Capacity and Workload are normalized in a 1 100 scale.

Graph A includes resource portion . Resource portion depicts memory allocation memory usage CPU allocation CPU usage storage allocation and storage usage for each virtual datacenters which are included in window . For example virtual datacenter depicts bar that represents CPU allocation in gigahertz ghz bar that represents memory allocation in gigabytes gb and bar that represents storage allocation in terabytes tb .

In various embodiments the bars that represent each respective resource have matching visual features. For example the bars that represent memory allocation have the same color and or shading with respect to each other but different than the bars that represent other resource allocations the bars that represent have CPU allocation have the same color and or shading with respect to each other but different than the bars that represent other resource allocations and the bars that represent storage allocation have the same color and or shading with respect to each other but different than the bars that represent other resource allocations .

In one embodiment the surface area of bars e.g. bars for each virtual datacenter represent memory allocation CPU allocation and storage allocation respectively for the virtual datacenters. For example the surface area or width of bar depicts the CPU allocation of virtual datacenter in proportion to the bars that depict CPU allocation for virtual datacenters respectively.

Likewise the surface area or width memory allocation bars e.g. bar represents the memory allocation for each of the virtual datacenters in proportion to one another. Similarly the surface area or width storage allocation bars e.g. bar represents the storage allocation for each the virtual datacenters in proportion to one another.

Resource portion also depicts the current usage of the resources. For example bar includes indicator e.g. another bar overlayed on bar that represents the current CPU usage for virtual datacenter . Similarly each bar that represents memory allocation for each virtual datacenter also includes a visual indicator e.g. different shading darker shading etc. that represents the current memory usage. Also each bar that represents CPU allocation for each virtual datacenter also includes a visual indicator e.g. darker shading that represents the current CPU usage. Moreover each bar that represents storage allocation for each virtual datacenter also includes a visual indicator e.g. darker shading that represents the current storage usage.

In one embodiment a percentage or fraction of actual resource usage with respect to allocated resource is listed. For example indicator represents the current CPU usage for bar . The proportion of CPU usage as indicated by indicator for virtual datacenter is listed at the top of bar as 10 25. That is 10 25 of the CPU resources are current being utilized by virtual datacenter .

It should be appreciated that the graphs depicted herein for example graph A highlights virtual machine groupings e.g. VMware vApps that a user should look at based on health attributes or metrics. Accordingly the user uses the graphed parameters to determine what caused poor health of the virtual machine groupings.

Now referring to graph B is similar to graph A as described above. However graph B includes description portion .

Bar indicates that a virtual machine grouping is in poor health. A user may select bar to view specific description or information regarding the virtual machine grouping represented by bar . In particular when bar is selected e.g. by clicking on bar description portion appears in graph B. For example description portion lists the name of the virtual machine grouping e.g. Exchange Server the values for health e.g. 50 workload e.g. 30 and capacity e.g. 13 CPU usage e.g. 1.2 ghz memory usage 2 gb storage usage e.g. 0.3 tb and lease length e.g. 145 hours . It should be appreciated that other resources information and or description of the selected virtual machine grouping may be listed.

Resource portion also includes visual indicators for the particular resource usage for the selected virtual machine grouping. For example bar includes indicator e.g. another bar overlayed on bar that represents the current CPU usage for the selected virtual machine grouping. Similarly bar also includes a visual indicator e.g. different shading darker shading etc. that represents the current memory usage for the selected virtual machine grouping and bar also includes a visual indicator e.g. different shading darker shading etc. that represents the current storage usage for the selected virtual machine grouping.

Now referring to graph C is similar to graph A as described above. However health portion also depicts lease length of each virtual machine grouping. In particular the bars that indicate the health of the virtual machine groupings also provide a visual indication of the lease length. For example each bar has a particular color or shading that indicates the lease length. In one embodiment a visual indication e.g. color or shading of an infinite lease length is provided.

Graph C allows a user to among other things efficiently correlate lease length with resource usage. For example a user may determine that one or more virtual machine groupings have a long lease length e.g. infinite however they are rarely or never used. Accordingly the resources assigned to the rarely or never used virtual machine groupings are not used efficiently.

It should be appreciate that the various graphs as described herein are able to be switched with one another. For example a user viewing graph B is able to easily switch to graph C if the user is interested in the lease length of the various virtual machine groupings.

Now referring to graph D is similar to graph A as described above. However health portion also depicts health workload and capacity indicators for each virtual machine grouping. For example bar includes indicator e.g. color or shading for visual indication of a capacity metric of the virtual machine grouping indicator e.g. color or shading for visual indication of a workload metric of the virtual machine grouping and indicator e.g. color or shading for visual indication of a health metric of the virtual machine grouping.

It should be appreciated that the various graphs as described herein may have a particular label associated with the graph. For example graph D which depicts health attributes may be selected via a drop down tab labeled health. 

Now referring to graph E is similar to graph D as described above. However the health workload and capacity indicators are separated from each other for each virtual machine grouping in a selected virtual datacenter. For example virtual datacenter is selected such that the health indicators e.g. indicator workload indicators e.g. indicator and capacity indicator e.g. indicator are separated from one another. This allows a user to efficiently compare the aggregate health values metrics e.g. health workload and capacity across virtual machine groupings within a virtual datacenter.

In various embodiments the state of graph D is switched to the state of graph E by various user input. For example a user may select a feature that indicates the different color coding for each aggregate health values metrics e.g. health workload and capacity to switch from graph E to graph D and vice versa . In other words a user may switch from a compressed view e.g. graph E to a separated view e.g. graph D and vice versa based on user input.

Now referring to graph F includes a portion of graph E. In particular graph F includes a graph of parameters pertaining to virtual datacenter as shown in graph E .

Additionally graph F includes portions depicting user events of a selected virtual datacenter or any selected virtual machine grouping corresponding to various parameters of the selected virtual datacenter or any selected virtual machine grouping which will be described in further detail below. It should be appreciated that portions and with respect to virtual datacenter may be used as a reference pane to navigate through various virtual machine groupings in virtual datacenter .

In one embodiment graph F includes timeline portion . Timeline portion is a graphical representation of the health of the virtual datacenter over a period of time. For example timeline portion graphically depicts the overall aggregate health of the virtual machine grouping corresponding to bar . Timeline portion also depicts problem event markers overlaid on the overall aggregate health which will be described in detail below.

Moreover timeline portion may be separated into time intervals such as hours days weeks etc. For example interval depicts a graphical representation of overall aggregate health and problem event markers that occurred on a selected date.

User event portion depicts a graph of user events corresponding to the time interval of time interval portion . Moreover user event portion includes an expanded view of interval . For example user event portion includes among other things a graph of overall aggregate health and problem event markers such as problem event marker and problem event marker . A problem event marker is a marker that marks any event that potentially decreases the health of the virtual machine grouping such as any form of error.

In one embodiment problem event marker visually indicates a problem event of the selected virtual machine grouping on virtual datacenter and problem event marker visually indicates a problem event on another virtual machine grouping on virtual datacenter . Depicting a problem event marker on a non selected virtual machine grouping allows a user to view similar problem events to facilitate in determining if there is any correlation between the similar problem events. For example the same user activity may be the root cause for more than one problem event. As such the same user activity may be determined by viewing the related problem events.

Now referring to graph G depicts problem event information . For example when problem event marker is selected problem event information is displayed. In one embodiment problem event information includes name of the virtual machine grouping where the problem event occurred the type of error and time of the problem event.

Referring again to user event portion also includes a graph of aggregate user activity that corresponds to the time line of timeline portion . Aggregate user activity depicts user activity of user groups such as console users organization administrators catalog authors etc. In one embodiment the groups of users are listed in user group portion .

User event portion also includes individual user activities . Individual user activities depicts types of activities that were performed by an individual that corresponds to the timeline of timeline portion . Moreover individual user activities may depict the type of individual user e.g. console user org admin etc. .

Individual user activities allow a user to view specific activities by particular users before and or after a problem event such as the problem event associated with problem event marker .

Now referring to graph depicts an embodiment of individual user activities for an individual. For example graph includes first visual indicator indicating a first type of user activity and second visual indicator indicating a second type of user activity. For example first visual indicator may indicate important or impactful but less frequent user activities such as an error. Second visual indicator may indicate less important or less impactful but more frequent user activities such as user log on.

Referring again to graph F includes contextual information portion . Contextual information portion provides information associated with various attributes that are depicted in graph F. For example contextual information portion may list one or more of event name user name user type event type status time stamp etc.

Now referring to graph depicts an embodiment of a selection of a particular user activity and displaying information associated with the selected user activity. For example user activity is selected because it is an important event that occurred immediately prior to a problem event of problem event marker . In response to the selection of user activity information associated with user activity is displayed in contextual information portion at row . Row displays in one embodiment event name user name e.g. yangd user type e.g. console user event type e.g. resource allocation status e.g. pass and a time stamp.

Moreover the console user e.g. yangd may be bookmarked and listed in bookmark portion . A bookmark allows a user to track other user events of the bookmarked user.

Moreover a user e.g. yangd may be pinned such that the user s activities may be viewed. For example user activity across various virtual machine groupings or various virtual datacenters e.g. virtual datacenters may be viewed. As a result the viewed activities of a user in one virtual datacenter may help troubleshoot problem events associated with user events in another virtual datacenter.

In various embodiments bookmark portion can include bookmarks of any user and or virtual machine grouping e.g. exchange server . For example if an exchange server is bookmarked a user can track and view any event that occurs within the exchange server. In such an example particular event information may be displayed in contextual information portion .
