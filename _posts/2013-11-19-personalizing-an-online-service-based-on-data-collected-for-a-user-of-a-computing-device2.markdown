At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to data and information processing systems in general and more particularly but not limited to personalizing or customizing an Internet or other online service based on data collected for a user of a computing device.

The Twitter online service previously has launched a so called Twitter Lists feature that provides a way to organize the people that a person is following on the Twitter service. Twitter Lists are a groups feature and offer a way for a person to collect together other users on Twitter into groups so that the person can get an overview of what these other users are doing. These Twitter Lists are not static listings of users but are curated Twitter streams of the latest tweets from a specified set of users.

A user can create a list that groups together people for whatever reason the user may decide e.g. the members of the user s family and then the user can get a snapshot of the things those other users are saying online by viewing the page for that particular list i.e. the page for that specific Twitter List that the user created . This page includes a complete tweet stream for everyone on the list. These lists allow the user to organize the people the user is following into groups and the lists allow the user to include people that the user is not following.

Because Twitter Lists create grouped tweet streams of the people that are on them a user can use Lists to organize the user s tweets into groups based on anything the user desires. For example a list of every employee at a company may be created. By viewing or following this company list the user could easily see what all of the company s employees are tweeting about. The user can do the same thing with his or her co workers family or friends or just group Twitter users based on location subject or anything else the user may select.

When a user follows a Twitter List the user is not actually following every user on the list but is following the entire list those users tweets aren t added to the user s main stream. The user can then visit that list and view its tweet stream. This is why the user can also use Lists to follow people without really following them. For example if there are users whose tweets a user would like to follow but whom the user does not necessarily want in his or her main Twitter stream e.g. they tweet too often for a user s personal liking the user can add them to a list and then check up on their latest tweets every once in a while by viewing the user s list.

Systems and methods for personalizing or customizing an Internet or other online service based on data collected for a user of a computing device e.g. a mobile device a desktop computer or other computing device are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.

In one embodiment a method includes storing a plurality of person profiles for persons associated with communications received by a user of a computing device receiving data associated with an online service and filtering using at least one processor the data based on the plurality of person profiles wherein the filtered data is for display to the user on the computing device e.g. display via a web page presented on a desktop or laptop computer .

In one embodiment each of the persons associated with the communications received by the user may be a person cc d or copied on one of the communications a person bcc d or blind copied on one of the communications a sender of one of the communications a recipient of one of the communications or a person referenced in the body text or other content of one of the communications.

In various embodiments the computing device may be a mobile device e.g. an iPhone or Android device a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer or a computing apparatus for presenting information on an advertising display or electronic billboard e.g. a billboard in Times Square or other forms of display suitable for public presentation .

In another embodiment a method includes storing using at least one processor a plurality of person profiles for persons associated with communications received by a user of a computing device e.g. a desktop computer creating a list of persons available on an online service receiving a feed e.g. a list or stream of messages or other information from the online service that is based on the list of persons and customizing the feed based on the plurality of person profiles.

In another embodiment a method includes storing a plurality of person profiles for persons associated with communications received by a user of a computing device determining a set of persons of the person profiles that are active on an online service filtering the set of persons to provide a plurality of highly ranked persons the filtering based on the plurality of person profiles and creating a list using the highly ranked persons wherein the list is for presentation to the user on the computing device.

The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods including data processing systems which perform these methods and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.

Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.

The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However in certain instances well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one.

Reference in this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.

In one embodiment a server stores and analyzes data associated with a user of a computing device e.g. a mobile device . The server may store the data for example in a database in the form of person profiles. The data collected may be associated with prior communications and or other activity of the user on the mobile or other computing device e.g. data extracted from prior emails or other communications received or sent by the user . The data may be for example extracted by the server in the course of the transmission of the communications the mobile or other computing device may send the data to the server and or other approaches may be used by the server to collect the data. Numerous examples of various types of data e.g. person profiles for callers associated with the user that may be collected in a database for the user are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 792 698 and or other of the patent applications and patent publications incorporated by reference above.

In one embodiment data may be collected from multiple different devices. For example data may be collected from a user of a web page a desktop application a mobile device etc. Feeds as described herein e.g. a curated feed or stream of more meaningful or relevant contacts may be displayed on multiple different devices such as for example a mobile device another computing platform presenting a web page to a user as part of a user interface in a desktop application or even on public or large scale display or advertising devices e.g. Times Square ticker feed display . In addition the behavior of a user on a mobile and other devices may be observed to provide data as to the user s context and data be collected from these observations e.g. by a server or otherwise . For example data may be collected from the behavior of a user when the user is interacting with a desktop application or making selections or other actions within a web page etc.

The data collected on the server may be used to customize the providing of an online service e.g. the Twitter service and providing of Twitter feeds or tweets to the user. In one embodiment the data collected for the user represents an implicit or social graph of the user that is used to filter or select a subset of data from a larger set of data associated with the online service. For example the social graph may be used by a user of Twitter to select new people to follow on the Twitter service or to customize the Twitter feed e.g. to select the people to include in the feed . The use of the social graph may be done on a real time or other periodic dynamic basis e.g. as the collected data is updated on the server changes in the customization of the online service may be implemented . In other embodiments the online service may be a travel service a texting service an e commerce service or yet other services.

In an alternative embodiment filtering of a feed may be based on more than merely a ranking of contacts. More specifically a feed may be filtered based on the ratio of noise to a contact s rank. In other words a contact determined to be un important e.g. having a rank below a predetermined threshold is still included in the feed even though the contact tweets infrequently e.g. less than once or other given number of times in a given time period . However if this un important contact e.g. a low ranked person based on relevancy is noisy e.g. tweets frequently say more than a predetermined number of tweets for a given time period the contact will be excluded. This creates a more diverse feed without flooding a user with lots of undesirable information. Although volubility may be used for such a noise filter in other embodiments content analysis personal relationship distance similarity in job distance etc. could also be used.

In one embodiment a mobile device of a user or a server associated with the mobile device or the user stores data e.g. in a database in the form of person profiles associated with prior communications and or other activity of the user on the mobile device e.g. data extracted from one of more of the following prior communications such as email or text messages voice messages or other documents or information received by the user from the user s friends or other persons such as work associates . The other activity may include the manner or ways in which the user operates the mobile device e.g. what buttons or functions or activated when the user has previously interacted with another person or what online service is used by the user when previously interacting with another person . This collected data is used for determining a ranking of contacts for personalizing or customizing an online service.

In one embodiment a ranking server e.g. ranking server of discussed below collects email and other communications data associated with a mobile device of a user as described above. This ranking server or alternatively a different server in other embodiments determines a ranking of a predetermined number of the user s most highly ranked contacts persons e.g. a top 100 list . A server obtains data for some or all users that are available or active on the Twitter service e.g. this data may include Twitter screen names provided or made available by the Twitter service .

Using this obtained data the ranking server determines which of the most highly ranked contacts are on the Twitter service e.g. by matching Twitter screen names or other information from the Twitter service with corresponding or related data in person profiles previously extracted from user communications data and then a Twitter List is created using these contacts. The Twitter List or data from the Twitter List is followed by the user e.g. on the user s mobile device or otherwise presented to the user. As an alternative to use of the Twitter List these contacts may be indicated to the Twitter service as contacts to be followed by the user.

The foregoing process can be dynamic such that the rankings and selected contacts change for example hourly or daily or using another predetermined time period. The ranking server also may infer data from user behavior on his or her mobile device. For example the ranking may be adjusted for certain criteria on a mobile phone due to a mobile device being more temporally based or focused. In contrast other criteria that is less temporally focused may be used for example on a desktop computer of the user or for the user s Outlook email client account.

Thus different user contexts may be used to provide different rankings appropriate to those contexts and thus different feeds of data may be provided from the Twitter service to different particular devices of the user e.g. a mobile device feed is different than a tablet computer feed . For example the top 100 contacts for a user s phone may be different than the top 100 contacts for the user s desktop computer or the top 100 contacts from use of Outlook email.

In one embodiment the list of persons for a user to follow on Twitter may be selected based on a ranking determined from relevancy of each person to the user by ranking of each person from data collected on the server associated with the mobile device. For example this ranking may be done as described for ranking of contacts in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 792 698 incorporated by reference above.

In another embodiment a Twitter List is used. A user of the Twitter service can create a Twitter List and any Twitter contact may be added to the user s list . This Twitter List will create a feed from everyone on the List so the user does not have to actually follow them . A Twitter List for a user is created and the List is given a name e.g. Bambi . The user signs onto the Twitter service and a server creates this List on the user s account on behalf of the user. The user then may log in e.g. log into www.twitter.com to see the feed from the List.

A user interface with a List tab may be presented to the user and the List is accessed using this tab. The user does not create this List herself instead a server acting at the user s request creates this List for the user from one or more servers by analyzing the data previously collected for the user.

If the user clicks on a user screen the user can see tweets from numerous contacts on the Twitter service. The List can be created for the user and then the user may access this List from any computing device that is configured to access the Twitter service and that supports Twitter Lists e.g. a Twitter client .

As was mentioned above for because these tweeters are contacts known to the ranking server the ranking server or associated servers may be used to display richer contact information for the tweeters than is shown in typical Twitter clients e.g. name phone number and other personal and professional details . Also as mentioned above for clicking on a tweet from one of these users will cause the ranking server to display a richer set of information about the contact than can be easily displayed in just a small screen area.

Finally it should be noted that a mouse over user movement in the user interface provides the user access to typical Twitter operations e.g. follow reply retweet but again this is for tweets the user is seeing because the ranking server has determined that these contacts are tweeters who are likely to be interesting to the logged in user even though the user is not explicitly following them on Twitter. Not depicted here is that these tweets are gleaned from the Twitter service by assembling a Twitter List consisting of the Twitter IDs that match the contacts that the ranking server has determined are meaningful to the user and who have Twitter IDs .

In an alternative embodiment a user s home stream and a user s curated stream i.e. stream for more meaningful contacts may be combined for presentation. More specifically a display of combined tweets not illustrated that come from the user s home feed and the curated feed are presented to the user on a display of a computing device. For example the user may be following people not in the curated list and vice versa. This combined feed allows the user to see the tweets from both types of feeds at the same time e.g. on a single display .

Additional specific non limiting examples of the collection of user data and personalization of an online service are now discussed below.

In one example when a person wants to join the Twitter service or the person may already be active on the Twitter service the person typically needs or desires to determine who to follow immediately and then determine over time who else the person should be following.

The ranking server e.g. ranking server analyzes the person s emails and determines who is important to the person by ranking her contacts. The ranking server uses email addresses and Twitter IDs to determine who is using the Twitter service and who the person s top ranked contacts are. Based on this the ranking server recommends that the person follow these people. The ranking server also can create a Twitter List using those identified people. The person gets a feed from this List as if the person were following these identified people.

This need is not unique to the Twitter service. Any social network may have a curation need. A user joining a network has to curate who it is that the user wants to be following or in the case of the Facebook service be friends with or in the case of LinkedIn to be connected with.

The relevancy ranking or selection process may be further tuned by looking at data for people that the user is currently following and determining some characteristics of those people and using data related to these characteristics to predict other persons who would be appropriate or relevant for following. For example for the LinkedIn service suggestions for someone to be connected to in LinkedIn may be based in part on analyzing the current people that the user is connected with and examining the connectedness of each such person in the user s inbox. If a person is not connected to above a predefined number of other people in the user s inbox then the user is unlikely to desire to connect with them. If a person is connected to above a predefined number of other people that the user already knows e.g. from inbox communications having a lot of emails from those other people then the user is likely to want to be connected with that person and a server may make the suggestion to connect to that person . Characteristics used to predict who the user may or may not want to connect with may be based on data from emails phone calls or other communications.

So the approach described above may be used to curate a user s social network automatically and dynamically or manually . The above approach also lets a user know who the user should not follow e.g. persons having a low relevancy ranking and or as determined from other collected or user specified data .

In one example because many online networks are public data from the network is made available publicly the ranking server may present the data to a user as if the user had curated a list to follow or be connected with the user does not actually have to curate it. So in the case of the Twitter service most people s tweets are public. The ranking server can offer to users an example of what the user s Twitter feed would have looked like if the user permitted the ranking server to rank persons to follow.

In one example the curation of the Twitter or other service is done on an ongoing basis. For example a user may have a change in his life situation such as a job change so that the user does not receive emails from a supervisor anymore. So the supervisor s ranking will fall and the supervisor is automatically removed from being followed on Twitter due to her falling to a lower relevance e.g. below a threshold number or defined limit . So data for this person is dropped from the feed of data that is provided from the Twitter service. The relevancy rankings may be dynamically recalculated as often as desired e.g. every minute hour or daily and the relevance of the persons on the list to follow will be calculated as the user s life changes.

There may be a default relevance that is set to cut off people below a certain relevance or the user can set this. For example the user may adjust by the number of messages that a the user will see per day in total from all persons. In another situation the user may want to set the number of persons to watch for example 100 persons because each person tweets very little. If the persons tweet a lot the user may set the list to follow at for example five persons.

Now discussing an exemplary screen from the Twitter service the user sees a stream of classic tweets e.g. some of these people have the word Following displayed underneath or near them which indicates that the user is already explicitly following those people . For other persons on the screen the user never explicitly followed those persons on Twitter. But the ranking server has determined that these are important people in the user s network and has determined their Twitter IDs based on the email addresses of these people.

In one example the graph of a user that the ranking server determines is an implicit graph which is a set of relationships determined by inference based on the user s prior communications. The graphs from a traditional social network such as LinkedIn Facebook or Twitter are explicit graphs for which a user indicates with an action that connection or following is desired. The ranking server may use the implicit graph to curate the explicit graph.

In one example the algorithm used by the ranking server to determine relevancy for person profiles on a mobile or other computing device may be further tuned for a specific online service. Each individual online service or network may require that the ranking server add characteristics that are not necessarily taken into account for other rankings e.g. for a user s Outlook email account . For example a user s nanny may be highly ranked in one network ranking because the user has a lot of communications with her but the nanny may not fit well the characteristics statistically that would be considered a highly relevant match for LinkedIn. For example the ranking server would notice that people on LinkedIn are fairly highly connected through the user s business email account. In another example the ranking server would notice that the potential person to be ranked highly and selected has an email with a domain from a company that is recognized by a third party ratings service such as Hoover.

In another example a user looks at a home screen that includes the normal Twitter home screen. The same screen display intersperses data feeds for other persons that have been selected by the ranking server. So the user can be provided with a single unified data stream e.g. that includes everyone that a user would normally be following on his or her Twitter clients and further everyone that the user is implicitly following based on the ranking server selections . The order of the persons presented on the single screen is time based i.e. based on time of receipt of the data such as 22 minutes ago . The implicitly followed people can be shaded or indicated in some other way on the screen to distinguish them from the explicitly followed people.

In one example the ranking server primarily looks at communications data for the user. This may include location information. From all of this data the ranking server develops a model of the user s relationships this is the user s social graph. This social graph can be intersected with any online or public service. Value can be added to that public service based on this knowledge of the user s private world. Thus private communications of the user may be used to build preferences data that can then be used on a third party server to improve the relevance of that service for the user. This might be used for example for travel or e commerce or public or other events. The user s private information may remain private because it is not shared with third parties when personalizing the service. The user only shares sufficient data to get a personalized service e.g. this may be only a portion of the user s social graph .

In another example the online service is the travel service TripAdvisor which asks a user whether she wants to contact other friends of the user that have gone to similar places being considered by the user. The ranking server may tune down this list of people suggested by TripAdvisor to those who are most relevant to the user for requesting travel suggestions e.g. in this particular context . There are other services e.g. Beluga GroupMe or Blackberry Messenger that may benefit from the implicit relationships as provided by the ranking server as opposed to relying merely on a user s explicit graph.

The ranking server may include one or more web servers or other types of data communication servers to communicate with the user terminals e.g. . . . and or mobile devices. An online server provides an online service to mobile device and other mobile devices.

The ranking server may be connected to a data storage facility to store user provided content such as multimedia content navigation data preference data etc. The ranking server may also store or have access to stored person profiles .

Person profiles and or person profiles may be created and updated based on email or other communications to and from mobile device and other mobile devices of various users. In an alternative embodiment person profiles may be stored in a memory of mobile device . During operation mobile device may access and use person profiles obtained locally from mobile device and or obtained over communication network from ranking server .

User data e.g. data regarding Twitter users that is stored at online server and used for providing the Twitter or other online service and or data that is provided to or made accessible to users of the Twitter or other online service may be accessed and used e.g. by mobile device and or ranking server for relevancy rankings and or presentation of contacts as described herein. Mobile device or ranking server may access user data or other data from online server .

Although illustrates an example system implemented in client server architecture embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various alternative architectures. For example the system can be implemented via a peer to peer network of user terminals where content and data are shared via peer to peer communication connections.

In some embodiments a combination of client server architecture and peer to peer architecture can be used in which one or more centralized servers may be used to provide some of the information and or services and the peer to peer network is used to provide other information and or services. Thus embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to a particular architecture.

In the system includes an inter connect e.g. bus and system core logic which interconnects a microprocessor s and memory . The microprocessor is coupled to cache memory in the example of .

The inter connect interconnects the microprocessor s and the memory together and also interconnects them to a display controller and display device and to peripheral devices such as input output I O devices through an input output controller s . Typical I O devices include mice keyboards modems network interfaces printers scanners video cameras and other devices which are well known in the art.

The inter connect may include one or more buses connected to one another through various bridges controllers and or adapters. In one embodiment the I O controller includes a USB Universal Serial Bus adapter for controlling USB peripherals and or an IEEE 1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE 1394 peripherals.

The memory may include ROM Read Only Memory and volatile RAM Random Access Memory and non volatile memory such as hard drive flash memory etc.

Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM DRAM which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. Non volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive e.g. a DVD RAM or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non volatile memory may also be a random access memory.

The non volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non volatile memory that is remote from the system such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface can also be used. In one embodiment a data processing system as illustrated in is used to implement a server.

In one embodiment a data processing system as illustrated in is used to implement a user terminal. A user terminal may be in the form of a personal digital assistant PDA a cellular phone or other mobile device a notebook computer or a personal desktop computer.

In some embodiments one or more servers of the system can be replaced with the service of a peer to peer network of a plurality of data processing systems or a network of distributed computing systems. The peer to peer network or a distributed computing system can be collectively viewed as a server data processing system.

Embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented via the microprocessor s and or the memory . For example the functionalities described can be partially implemented via hardware logic in the microprocessor s and partially using the instructions stored in the memory . Some embodiments are implemented using the microprocessor s without additional instructions stored in the memory . Some embodiments are implemented using the instructions stored in the memory for execution by one or more general purpose microprocessor s . Thus the disclosure is not limited to a specific configuration of hardware and or software.

In this description various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor such as a microprocessor. Alternatively or in combination the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry with or without software instructions such as using an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA . Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions or in combination with software instructions. Thus the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer readable media used to actually effect the distribution.

At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied at least in part in software. That is the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor such as a microprocessor executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory such as ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory cache or a remote storage device.

Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system middleware service delivery platform SDK Software Development Kit component web services or other specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API Application Programming Interface . The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.

A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory and or cache. Portions of this software and or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically just in time when needed for execution. Thus it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.

Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non recordable type media such as volatile and non volatile memory devices read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory devices floppy and other removable disks magnetic disk storage media optical storage media e.g. Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROMS Digital Versatile Disks DVDs etc. among others. The computer readable media may store the instructions.

The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical optical acoustical or other forms of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. However propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.

In general a tangible machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides e.g. stores information in a form accessible by a machine e.g. a computer network device personal digital assistant manufacturing tool any device with a set of one or more processors etc. .

In various embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof.

In the foregoing specification the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense.
