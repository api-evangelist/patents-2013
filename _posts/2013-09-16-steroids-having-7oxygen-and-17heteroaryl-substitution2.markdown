Immune dysregulation can be a component of many pathological diseases or conditions. Such dysregulation may be a factor that favors the establishment maintenance or progression of these diseases or conditions. Deficient immune responses or immune suppression can enhance a mammal s susceptibility to infection or to the development of cancer. Conversely excessive or inappropriate immune responses can play a role in the establishment or progression of unwanted inflammation or autoimmune conditions. It would thus be advantageous to utilize agents that can modulate immune responses and to at least partially reverse immune dysregulation when such dysregulation is a component of a given pathological condition. Some agents are known that can ameliorate some aspects of immune dysregulation but typically such agents have their own unwanted effects on either the host s immune system or other organs or tissues. Agents such as glucocorticoid steroids have been used to reduce unwanted inflammation in a number of clinical conditions but such compounds often have serious limitations such as inducing immune suppression or causing unwanted mood changes.

Human and mammalian immune responses to infections or other conditions are often characterized by responses mediated by different immune effector cell populations. In some situations helper T cells designated Th1 in the murine system facilitate immune effector functions that are typically dominated by cell mediated responses. In other cases helper T cells designated Th2 cells facilitate immune effector functions that are typically dominated by humoral responses. A vigorous Th1 response is usually desirable to help clear infections or to slow the progression of an infection. When a subject s immune response is biased to or dominated by a Th2 type response the cytokines associated with the Th2 response tend to suppress the immune system s capacity to mount a vigorous Th1 response at the same time. The converse is also generally true. When mammalian immune responses begin to result in an increasing Th1 response Th2 responses tend to weaken. Insufficient Th1 responses may be associated with progression of some infections or other conditions see e.g. M. Clerici and G. M. Shearer 14 107 111 1993 M. Clerici and G. M. Shearer 15 575 581 1994.

There is a current need for cost effective pharmaceutical agents and treatment methods for treating various immune dysregulation conditions. The invention provides compounds that can be used in such treatments to treat or ameliorate one or more aspects of immune dysregulation conditions. Such agents can be used to treat autoimmune or inflammation conditions immune suppression conditions infections blood cell deficiencies and other described conditions. The agents and methods are useful to ameliorate these conditions or one or more symptoms associated with any of these conditions. The use of these agents can be combined with one or more conventional treatments for these disorders.

The methods include a method to prevent treat ameliorate or slow the progression of cystic fibrosis sickle cell disease neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in a subject or to treat a symptom of the cystic fibrosis sickle cell disease neutropenia or thrombocytopenia comprising administering to a subject or delivering to the subject s tissues an effective amount of a formula 1 compound having the structure 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14

Unless otherwise contraindicated or implied e.g. by including mutually exclusive elements or options in these definitions and throughout this specification the terms a and an mean one or more and the term or means and or.

Reference to an androstane compound e.g. 3 16 17 trihydroxyandrostane means that the hydrogen atom at the 5 position is in the configuration. For androstanes with hydrogen in the configuration the compound name will specify this configuration e.g. 3 16 17 trihydroxy 5 androstane.

An invention formulation formulation pharmaceutical formulation or the like means a composition that one can administer to a subject e.g. human mammal or other animal without further manipulations that change the ingredients or the ingredient proportions that are present. Formulations will typically comprise a single formula 1 compound and one or more excipients. Formulations are suitable for human or veterinary applications and would typically have expected characteristics for the formulation e.g. parenteral formulations for human use would usually be sterile and stored in a suitable closed container.

When referring to mixtures that contain a formula 1 compound an invention composition composition or the like means a composition that is a formulation or that can be an intermediate one can use e.g. to make a formulation or a formula 1 compound. Compositions also include other types of mixtures e.g. 1 reagents for assays or cells that are optionally contacted with a formula 1 compound or mixtures of compounds and 2 compounds used to make a formula 1 compound or by products of formula 1 compound synthesis or analysis. Invention compositions include compositions where further processing may be required before it is a formulation e.g. mixing or addition of a desired amount of an excipient.

Phrases such as administration of a compound of formula 1 treatment with a formula 1 compound use of a formula 1 compound or similar terms mean that the compound s is administered to contacted with or delivered to the subject or to the subject s cells or tissues in vitro or in vivo by one or more suitable methods e.g. in vivo delivery can be by an oral topical subcutaneous parenteral buccal or sublingual route.

Expressions such as a formula 1 compound s a formula 1 compound and the like mean invention compositions or formulations where one or more than one formula 1 compound is present e.g. in a composition or is used in the disclosed method typically 1 2 3 or 4 usually 1. Any reference to a formula 1 compound one or more compounds of formula 1 or the like means that the formula 1 compound can have the formula 2 structure or any other structure disclosed herein that is within the definition of formula 1 compounds. The phrase formula 1 compound or formula 1 compound s is sometimes abbreviated as F1C or F1C s and formula 1 compounds may be abbreviated as F1Cs .

Reference to subject matter as disclosed herein such as a therapeutic treatment or agent as disclosed herein a dosing protocol as disclosed herein or a clinical condition or symptom as disclosed herein or the like means a treatment agent protocol condition symptom or the like that is described herein or in any reference that is cited herein.

An excipient carrier pharmaceutically acceptable excipient pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or similar terms mean one or more component s or ingredient s that is acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of invention compositions or formulations and not overly deleterious to the patient animal tissues or cells to which the F1C composition or formulation is to be administered.

A subject means a human or animal. Usually the animal is a mammal or vertebrate such as a primate rodent lagomorph domestic animal or game animal. Primates include chimpanzees cynomologous monkeys spider monkeys and macaques e.g. or . Rodents and lagomorphs include mice rats woodchucks ferrets rabbits and hamsters.

The terms effective amount effective dose or the like with reference to a F1C s mean an amount of the F1C s that is sufficient to elicit a desired response e.g. detectable restoration of normal immune responsiveness in an immunodeficient subject to which it is administered e.g. a human or to detectable modulation or amelioration of an immune or cellular parameter or a clinical condition or symptom. An effective amount e.g. for human therapeutic use may be a single dose or two or more subdoses of a F1C administered in one day or it may be administered as multiple doses over a period of time e.g. over 1 2 3 4 or about 7 days to about 1 year.

Terms such as use treat treatment address or the like in the context of using the F1Cs in the treatment methods or other methods disclosed herein mean that a F1C is administered to a subject delivered to the subject s tissues or contacted with tissues cells or cell free systems in vivo or in vitro e.g. as described herein or a reference cited herein. Typically such use or treatment results in e.g. 1 detectable improvement in or amelioration of the condition or symptom being treated 2 detectable modulation in the activity level or numbers of a relevant biomolecule therapeutic immune cell population or a pathological cell population 3 slowing of the progression of a condition or delaying its onset or reduction of the severity of a symptom s of the condition or 4 another detectable response as described herein.

Thus a F1C use or treatment typically results in detectable modulation in a relevant immune parameter such as modulation of the level activity or relative amount of a target effector or suppressor immune cell population interleukin cytokine chemokine immunoglobulin compared to a suitable control e.g. untreated. A F1C treatment can also cause modulation of the level or activity of a relevant transcription factor enzyme cell biological activity or level or activity of the etiological agent of the disease such as a pathogen tumor cell or autoreactive immune cell subset. A treatment with a F1C may be used to delay or prevent the onset of a disease symptom or complication or to ameliorate or slow the progression of a preexisting disease condition symptom or complication or to facilitate elimination of a disease condition symptom or complication.

Immune dysregulation conditions are as described herein or in the cited references.

Terms such as cellular response cellular activity biological response biological activity and the like mean a response or activity that is detectably modulated in response to the presence of a F1C. Such responses or activities can be direct effects or indirect effects on one or more cellular activities or on the expression or level of one or more molecules that the affected cell s bind sequester synthesize or respond to. Such responses or activities include a detectable change in the synthesis or level of one or more cytokines growth factors transcription factors including receptors and their cofactors enzymes Th1 or Th2 associated antibody subtype responses or the like. Typically the cytokines growth factors transcription factors enzymes or antibodies that are modulated are involved in the amelioration of a pathological condition or in the establishment maintenance severity or progression of a pathological condition.

As used herein references to CD molecules specific immune cell subsets immune responses and the like generally use nomenclature that applies to molecules cells or the like that are found in humans. Analogs or counterparts of such molecules cells or the like in other species may have a differing nomenclature but are included in this invention. A description of the nomenclature and function of various CD molecules and immune cell subsets are as found in the scientific literature. References to Th0 Th1 or Th2 cells and references to Th1 or Th2 immune responses in the context of human patients refers to the human counterparts of the murine Th0 Th1 or Th2 immune cells or responses.

 Immunosuppressive molecule means molecules such as cyclosporin cyclohexamide mitomycin C adriamycin taxol and amphotericin B. These molecules tend to have toxicities toward the immune system and are directly or indirectly immunosuppressive e.g. they are toxic to dividing cells they inhibit proliferation of immune cell precursors or they can downregulate an otherwise desired or improved immune response or condition.

 Nuclear hormone receptor means a gene product typically as a protein monomer or dimer that can bind to a ligand and affect transcription of one or more genes. Ligands include e.g. certain natural steroids steroid analogs F1Cs or another ligand such as a lipid e.g. a prostaglandin or the like. Nuclear hormone receptors include orphan steroid receptors which typically function as heterodimers and the classical steroid receptors e.g. androgen receptor AR estrogen receptor ER estrogen receptor ER that function as homodimers.

Invention embodiments include salts and complexes of F1Cs including pharmaceutically acceptable or salts that are relatively non toxic. Some of the F1Cs have one or more moieties that carry at least a partial positive or negative charge in aqueous solutions typically at a pH of about 4 10 that can participate in forming a salt a complex a composition with partial salt and partial complex properties or other noncovalent interactions all of which we refer to as a salt s . Salts are usually biologically compatible or pharmaceutically acceptable or non toxic particularly for mammalian cells. Salts that are biologically toxic are optionally used with synthetic intermediates of F1Cs. When a water soluble composition is desired monovalent salts are usually used.

Metal salts typically are prepared by reacting the metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts that are optionally prepared in this way are salts containing Li Na and K. A less soluble metal salt can be precipitated from the solution of a more soluble salt by adding a suitable metal compound. Invention salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic acids such as organic carboxylic acids and inorganic acids such as alkylsulfonic acids or hydrogen halide acids to acidic or basic centers on F1Cs such as basic centers on the invention pyrimidine base analogs. Metal salts include ones containing Na Li K Ca or Mg.

Salts are produced by standard methods including dissolving free base in an aqueous aqueous alcohol or aqueous organic solution containing the selected acid optionally followed by evaporating the solution. The free base is reacted in an organic solution containing the acid in which case the salt usually separates directly or one can concentrate the solution.

Suitable amine salts include amines having sufficient basicity to form a stable salt usually amines of low toxicity including trialkyl amines tripropylamine triethylamine trimethylamine procaine dibenzylamine N benzyl betaphenethylamine ephenamine N N dibenzylethylenediamine N ethylpiperidine benzylamine and dicyclohexylamine.

Salts include organic sulfonic acid or organic carboxylic acid salts made for example by addition of the acids to basic centers typically amines. Exemplary sulfonic acids include Caryl sulfonic acids Cheteroaryl sulfonic acids and Calkyl sulfonic acids such as phenyl sulfonic acid a naphthalene sulfonic acid naphthalene sulfonic acid S camphorsulfonic acid methyl CHSOH ethyl CHSOH n propyl i propyl n butyl s butyl i butyl t butyl pentyl and hexyl sulfonic acids. Exemplary organic carboxylic and other acids include Calkyl Caryl carboxylic acids and Cheteroaryl carboxylic acids such as acetic glycolic lactic pyruvic malonic glutaric tartaric citric fumaric succinic malic maleic oxalic hydroxymaleic benzoic hydroxybenzoic phenylacetic cinnamic salicylic nicotinic 2 phenoxybenzoic methanesulfonic pamoic propionic toluenesulfonic and trifluoroacetic acids.

Invention salts include those made from inorganic acids e.g. HF HCl HBr HI HSO HPO NaCO KOCO CaCO MgCOand NaClO. Suitable anions which are optionally present with a cation such a Ca Mg Li Na or K include arsenate arsenite formate sorbate chlorate perchlorate periodate dichromate glycodeoxycholate cholate deoxycholate desoxycholate taurocholate taurodeoxycholate taurolithocholate tetraborate nitrate nitrite sulfite sulfamate hyposulfite bisulfite metabisulfite thiosulfate thiocyanate silicate metasilicate CN gluconate glucuronate hippurate picrate hydrosulfite hexafluorophosphate hypochlorite hypochlorate borate metaborate tungstate and urate.

Salts also include the F1C salts with one or more amino acids. Many amino acids are suitable especially the naturally occurring amino acids found as protein components although the amino acid typically is one bearing a side chain with a basic or acidic group e.g. lysine arginine histidine or glutamic acid or a neutral group such as glycine serine threonine alanine isoleucine or leucine.

For formula 1 compounds F1Cs 2 3 or more of R R Rand Rare usually not H and typically one or both Rand R Rand R R Rand Ror Rand Rare not H and or 1 or 2 of R R Rand Rare optionally not H. For any F1C disclosed herein steroid nucleus carbon atoms that contain two variable groups e.g. two Rat Ror Ror two Ror Rat the 16 or 17 position each variable group is independently selected and each can thus be the same or different e.g. both can be methyl ethyl methoxy ethoxy F Cl Br I or they can be different. As is apparent from the F1C structures a double bond can be present at either the 4 5 position or at the 5 6 position but not at both positions at the same time. Steroid nucleus carbon atoms refers generally to the carbons that make up the rings in F1Cs and carbons if present that are bonded to the 10 13 and 17 positions. Additional carbons that may be at the 17 position are typically numbered using the cholesterol numbering system although any other suitable nomenclature can be used to describe species or genera of F1C. Exemplary F1C embodiments are described below.

Individual F1Cs described or disclosed herein are suitable for use as standards for determining chemical or physical properties using one two or more analytical methods e.g. for use in HPLC reverse phase HPLC MS mass spectrometry quadrupole MS GC MS LC MS NMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry H NMR H NMR C NMR C NMR infrared spectrometry IR Fourier transform IR optical rotary dispersion loss on drying for water and solvent measurement Karl Fisher titration for water determination differential scanning calorimetry melting point density refractive index solubility characteristics in organic solvents aqueous systems or aqueous organic solvent mixtures the partition coefficient in immiscible solvent systems e.g. octanol water partition coefficient heat stability or epimerization rate or characteristics of a given enantiomer. These analytical or chemical properties of each F1C are collectively referred to as analytical characteristics. For general methods see e.g. H. L. J. Makin et al. eds. 1995 Chapman Hall ISBN 0751401285. Thus to aid in the determination of e.g. the structure of a metabolite of a F1C or a structurally related compound the parent compound or another structurally related F1C could be used as a standard. Metabolism of F1Cs will often include one or more of oxidation reduction hydroxylation or conjugation e.g. oxidation or reduction to a OH or O moiety or conjugation with a moiety such as sulfate phosphate amino acid dipeptide or a monosaccharide such as glucuronic acid at e.g. the 2 3 6 7 11 15 16 17 or other positions on the steroid nucleus. In these embodiments the appropriate use of a F1C of known structure as a standard can aid in or verify the identification of metabolites that are projected to have closely related structures. Information regarding the identification can be useful or sometimes is necessary for e.g. obtaining regulatory approval to market a therapeutic agent such as a F1C or understanding the potential biological role that a F1C or its metabolite can play in one of the applications disclosed herein or in a cited reference.

Embodiments include a method the characterization method to characterize or at least partially characterize a formula 1 compound that is at least partially uncharacterized for one or more given chemical or analytical properties e.g. a known or potential metabolite of a parent formula 1 compound comprising a providing a formula 1 compound having one two or more known characteristics e.g. a known or at least partially known or characterized chemical structure XRD spectrum or melting point a CF1C and a formula 1 compound that is unknown or at least partially uncharacterized i.e. is uncharacterized for at least one of the same analytical characteristics a UCF1C b obtaining one two or more analytical characteristics of the UCF1C and c comparing the 1 2 or more analytical characteristics of the CF1C with the analytical characteristics of the UCF1C. The steps in this method may be conducted in any suitable order e.g. analytical or chemical data for the CF1C will usually be obtained before or at about the same time as one obtains the analytical or chemical data for the UCF1C. Usually the CF1C will be more completely characterized than the UCF1C particularly with regard to its chemical structure or its relative degree of purity or with regard to the analytical or chemical data that is being sought. This method allows further characterization of the UCF1C e.g. by confirming the UCF1C s chemical structure or by determining the UCF1C s stability under various storage or temperature conditions or in various formulations or by determining other analytical or chemical properties of interest. In this method the CF1C itself may not be completely characterized however for the one two or more analytical characteristics of interest the CF1C will usually have a known or confirmed property or properties while the UCF1C is unknown or at least unconfirmed for the same property or properties.

In some embodiments the characterization method is conducted by comparing dissimilar analytical characteristics. For example the CF1C may be well characterized by GC MS or by NMR while an insufficient amount of the UCF1C is available for analysis with the same technique. In these cases one can then e.g. compare the GC MS of the CF1C with the NMR of the UCF1C to obtain the same or essentially the same information for the UCF1C. Other examples of where this can be done is where DSC data is available for the CF1C and only melting point data is available for the UCF1C. In this case the CF1C DSC data is compared to the UCF1C s melting point data. Also in conducting the characterization method one can optionally derivatize or chemically modify the CF1C and or the UCF1C to facilitate analysis of the compound s . For example in conducting MS GC MS or NMR analysis one or more free hydroxyl or ketone moieties on the CF1C and or the F2C can be silylated using e.g. trimethylsilyl chloride t butyl dimethylsilyl chloride or other suitable silylating agents. Similarly the UCF1C may be treated or incubated with a cell line or tissue or with a glucuronidase sulfatase phosphatase esterase lipase oxidoreductase or other enzyme and then characterized. This treatment may in some cases convert the UCF1C into the CF1C but this conversion would usually be confirmed by one two or more suitable analytical methods. Such treatments will usually generate additional data about the structure properties or origin of the UCF1C.

Embodiments include modifications of the characterization method that use a CF1C and a second formula 1 compound that is believed or known to have a related structure or empirical formula. In these modifications the CF1C is used as described and a second formula 1 compound or a UCF1C that is believed or known to be e.g. an epimer or a salt of the CF1C is compared to the CF1C. Invention embodiments include other modifications of the characterization method such as 1 comparing analytical or chemical data from a single CF1C with 2 3 4 or more UCF1C 2 comparing analytical or chemical data from 2 3 4 or more CF1C with a single UCF1C and 3 comparing analytical or chemical data from 2 3 4 or more CF1C with 2 3 4 or more UCF1C. In these modifications the CF1C or UCF1C are used essentially as described for the characterization method except that data is obtained for the added formula 1 compounds.

Typically when the 1 2 or more analytical characteristics of a CF1C or a UCF1C are obtained which may be for use in the characterization method or for other purposes each compound is analyzed under the same or essentially the same analytical conditions using the same or essentially the same analytical technique or instrument. Variations in an analytical technique may be used where the properties of a CF1C or a UCF1C require slightly different handling or specimen preparation. An example of a variation in analytical conditions is the comparison of a property of a CF1C e.g. its stability to heat humidity or prolonged storage at a given temperature with the same property of the CF1C in a composition containing an excipient s or in a formulation where the CF1C in a composition is then considered the UCF1C for the characterization method . This allows the determination of the stability of the CF1C as a pure compound compared to its stability in any desired composition.

When characterizing a CF1C by MS particularly by GC MS one will usually conduct an initial characterization of a formula 1 compound or a CF1C in the characterization method using a known GC MS method e.g. H. L. J. Makin et al. 1999 John Wiley Sons pages XIII XIV or a suitable variation of this method. For F1Cs that contain free hydroxyls or oxo groups the hydroxyl groups can be derivatized to an ester such as acetate hydroxyl and oxo or groups can be derivatized to trimethylsilyl ether i.e. O Si CH and oxo groups can be derivatized to a an oxime such as N O CHbefore GC MS analysis. Other functional groups can also be suitably derivatized. For embodiments of the characterization method that use a GC MS analysis method the CF1C or the UCF1C is analyzed by the GC MS method or a suitable variation to obtain or to confirm chemical structure information about the CF1C or the UCF1C. Suitable variations include e.g. a change in the carrier gas from helium to hydrogen to increase the sensitivity of detection or a decrease in the ionization from 70 eV to 50 eV can give a better parent mass ion.

As is apparent from the present disclosure the F1C may be prepared synthetically and typical embodiments will utilize purified a F1C. Purified F1C can be free essentially free or partially free of other F1C or other compounds such as excipients. Thus any given purified F1C can be present as a solid that contains e.g. less than about 15 w w or less than about 10 w w or less than about 8 w w or less than about 5 w w or less than about 3 w w or less than about 1 w w of one two or more other F1Cs excipients synthetic by products decomposition products or synthesis or purification reactants or reagents. Similarly the F1C can be present in a solution or suspension that contains at least about 90 w w or at least about 95 w w or at least about 97 w w of the F1C and one or more excipients and less than about 10 or 8 or 5 or 3 w w or 1 w w of one two or more other F1Cs excipients synthetic by products decomposition products or synthesis or purification reactants or reagents.

Various groups that F1Cs contain as described herein e.g. hydroxyl groups or ketones bonded to the steroid nucleus or substituted alkyl groups substituted heterocycles amino acids and peptides which can contain one or more reactive moieties such as hydroxyl oxo carboxyl amino or thiol moieties. Intermediates used to make F1Cs may be protected as is apparent in the art e.g. using suitable Rmoieties. Noncyclic and cyclic protecting groups and corresponding cleavage reactions are described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Theodora W. Greene John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1991 ISBN 0 471 62301 6 hereafter Greene and will not be detailed here. In the context of the present invention these protecting groups are groups that can be removed from a F1C without irreversibly changing the covalent bond structure or oxidation reduction state of the remainder of the molecule. For example the protecting group R that is bonded to an ORor NHRgroup can be removed to form OH or NH respectively without affecting other covalent bonds in the molecule. Protecting groups for carbonyl or ketone moieties include ethylene ketals e.g. O CH CH O . At times when desired more than one protecting group can be removed at a time or they can be removed sequentially. In F1Cs containing more than one protecting group the protecting groups are the same or different.

Protecting groups are removed by known procedures although it will be understood that the protected intermediates fall within the scope of this invention. The removal of the protecting group may be arduous or straightforward depending upon the economics and nature of the conversions involved. In general one will use a protecting group with exocyclic amines or with carboxyl groups during synthesis of a F1C. For most therapeutic applications amine groups should be deprotected. Protecting groups commonly are employed to protect against covalent modification of a sensitive group in reactions such as alkylation or acylation. Ordinarily protecting groups are removed by e.g. hydrolysis elimination or aminolysis. Thus simple functional considerations will suffice to guide the selection of a reversible or an irreversible protecting group at a given locus on the F1Cs. Suitable protecting groups and criteria for their selection are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts Eds. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2nd edition Wiley Press at pps. 10 142 143 174 175 223 224 276 277 308 309 405 and 406 454.

Characterization of a protecting group is made in the conventional manner e.g. as described by Kocienski Philip J. Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York 1994 hereafter Kocienski Section 1.1 page 2 and Greene Chapter 1 pages 1 9. In particular a group is a protecting group if when based on mole ratio 90 of that protecting group has been removed by a deprotection reaction no more than 50 typically 25 more typically 10 of the deprotected product molecules have undergone changes to their covalent bond structure or oxidation reduction state other than those occasioned by the removal of the protecting group. When multiple protecting groups of the same type are present in the molecule the mole ratios are determined when all of the groups of that type are removed. When multiple protecting groups of different types are present in the molecule each type of protecting group is treated and the mole ratios are determined independently or together with others depending on whether the deprotection reaction conditions pertinent to one type are also pertinent to the other types present. In one embodiment a group is a protecting group if when based on mole ratio determined by conventional techniques 90 of that protecting group has been removed by a conventional deprotection reaction no more than 50 typically 25 more typically 10 of the deprotected product molecules have undergone irreversible changes to their covalent bond structure or oxidation reduction state other than those occasioned by the removal of the protecting group. Irreversible changes require chemical reactions beyond those resulting from aqueous hydrolysis acid base neutralization or conventional separation isolation or purification to restore the covalent bond structure or oxidation reduction state of the deprotected F1C.

Groups capable of biological cleavage typically include prodrugs. Some exemplary groups are described in Design of Prodrugs Hans Bundgaard Elsevier N.Y. 1985 ISBN 0 444 80675 X Bundgaard and will not be detailed here. In particular Bundgaard at pages 1 92 describes prodrugs and their biological cleavage reactions for a number of functional group types. Prodrugs for carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are detailed in Bundgaard at pages 3 to 10 for amides imides and other NH acidic compounds at pages 10 to 27 amines at pages 27 to 43 and cyclic prodrugs at pages 62 to 70. These moieties are optionally bonded to the steroid at one two or more of the variable groups that are bonded to the rings in the F1Cs e.g. one or more R R R R Rand R.

In some embodiments one or more F1Cs or groups of F1Cs may be excluded from one or more of the uses disclosed herein. For example if the subject has or is susceptible to developing a memory impairing neurological disorder or memory impairment condition excluded compounds can include 5 androstene 3 ol 7 17 dione or 5 androstene 3 7 diol 17 one or a derivative of these compounds that can has a group at the 7 position that can convert to OH or O by hydrolysis.

In treating any of the conditions or symptoms disclosed herein one can continuously or intermittently administer the F1C s to a subject having or susceptible to developing the condition or symptom. In treating a condition such as an infection a hyperproliferation condition an inflammation condition or another condition disclosed herein with a F1C using an intermittent dosing can avoid or ameliorate some of the undesired aspects normally associated with discontinuous dosing. Such undesired aspects include development of resistance of a pathogen such as a pathogen disclosed herein e.g. a virus or bacterium such as HIV or or a parasite such as a parasite to the therapeutic agent failure of the patient or subject to adhere to a daily dosing regimen or reduction of the dosages of other therapeutic agents and or their associated unwanted side effects or toxicities e.g. reduction or a toxic effect of a chemotherapy or radiation exposure. In any of the continuous or intermittent dosing protocols described herein other appropriate treatments can be applied as the subject s clinical situation dictates. Suitable other appropriate treatments or therapeutic agents are described elsewhere herein and in the cited references.

In any of the continuous or in any step s in the intermittent dosing protocols described herein or in treating any of the diseases conditions or symptoms described herein the F1C s can be administered by one or more suitable routes e.g. oral buccal sublingual intramuscular i.m. subcutaneous s.c. intravenous i.v. intradermal another parenteral route or by an aerosol. The effective daily dose in such methods will typically comprise about 0.05 mg kg day to about 200 mg kg day or about 0.1 to about 100 mg kg day including about 0.2 mg kg day 0.5 mg kg day about 1 mg kg day about 2 mg kg day about 4 mg kg day about 6 mg kg day about 10 mg kg day about 20 mg kg day about 40 mg kg day or about 100 mg kg day. Higher dosages e.g. about 250 mg kg day about 300 mg kg day or about 350 mg kg day can also be utilized e.g. in veterinary applications. One can administer the F1C s orally using about 4 to about 60 mg kg day usually about 6 30 mg kg day. In some embodiments the intermittent dosing methods exclude dosing protocols that are commonly used to deliver contraceptive steroids to e.g. human females such as daily dosing for 21 days followed by no dosing for 7 days. For humans dosing is generally about 0.005 mg kg day to about 30 mg kg day typically about 0.5 5 mg kg day. Low dosages for humans such as about 0.005 mg kg day to about 0.2 mg kg day or about 0.25 10 mg day can be used with e.g. local topical transmucosal or intravenous administration and higher dosages such as about 0.1 mg kg day to about 20 mg kg day or about 5 200 mg day can be used e.g. for oral subcutaneous or other systemic or local administration route. For non human subjects e.g. mammals such as rodents or primates the effective daily dosage may comprise about 0.05 mg kg day to about 350 mg kg day. F1C formulation dosages or daily doses or unit doses or subdoses for subjects such as humans and mammals include e.g. about 1 5 10 15 20 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 400 or 450 mg of the F1C.

An effective dosage or an effective amount of a F1C s is one that is sufficient to result in e.g. a detectable change in a symptom or an immune parameter such as one described herein. An effective dosage or daily dosage may be administered to a subject over a period of time e.g. at least about 1 14 days before a symptom change or an immune parameter detectably changes. Effective amounts of a F1C can be delivered using the dosages and dosing protocols described herein.

In some embodiments F1C are used to treat ameliorate prevent or slow the progression of a condition or disease described herein by continuous daily dosing of the F1C for 1 day to 1 2 3 years or more. In related embodiments F1C are used to treat ameliorate prevent or slow the progression of a condition or disease described herein by continuous dosing the F1C every other day or dosing every third fourth fifth sixth seventh or 14day over a time period of 3 days to 1 2 3 years or more e.g. dosing for about 2 3 4 5 6 or 7 days or about 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 12 16 20 24 or more weeks. Daily doses in any of these dosing regimens or protocols may be subdivided into 2 or 3 subdoses.

Intermittent dosing protocols include administration of a F1C e.g. orally topically or parenterally as follows 1 daily dosing or dosing every other day or dosing every third day or dosing every fourth day or dosing every fifth day or dosing every seventh day for about 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 or 28 days to about 190 days or more e.g. 1 or 2 years 2 no dosing of the F1C for 1 to about 190 consecutive days e.g. about 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 days to about 20 days 3 daily dosing for about 3 to about 190 days e.g. about 3 to about 20 days and 4 optionally repeating step 2 or a variation of step 2 and 5 optionally repeating the steps 1 2 3 and 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 15 20 30 or more times. In some embodiments the dosing of steps 1 and 3 are the same while in others step 1 dosing is for a longer time than step 3 . Less frequently step 1 dosing will be for a shorter time. In some embodiments steps 1 4 or 1 5 of the dosing protocol described above where step 4 is included is repeated at least one time e.g. at least 2 3 4 5 or 6 times. For conditions that tend to remain chronic e.g. HIV infection or other chronic conditions described herein any of these intermittent dosing protocols can be maintained over a relatively long time period e.g. for at least about 4 months or 6 months to about 5 or more years.

In some embodiments the number of days of dosing in steps 1 and 3 is the same in each round of treatment i.e. each time period in step 1 and 3 is the same in the initial and subsequent rounds of the method. In other embodiments they differ. Thus in some embodiments step 1 may comprise dosing of about 1 mg day to about 1500 mg day of a F1C for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 or more consecutive days. Then step 2 may comprise not administering any F1C for at least about 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 21 28 42 56 84 98 112 or more consecutive days. Step 3 could comprise dosing of a F1C for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more consecutive days. When step 4 is included it is typically about 1 day to about 3 months usually 3 days to about 6 weeks. On days when the F1C is administered to the subject it may be delivered in a single dose or in two three or more subdoses at e.g. about 12 hour or about 8 hour time intervals.

One aspect of invention intermittent dosing is monitoring the subject s response to a particular dosing regimen or schedule e.g. to any intermittent administration method disclosed herein. For example while dosing a subject who has a viral infection e.g. HCV HIV SIV SHIV one can measure the subject s or pathogen s response e.g. amelioration of one or more symptoms or a change in infectious particles or viral DNA or RNA in the serum or a change in an immune parameter of interest. Once a response is observed dosing can be continued for one two or three additional days followed by discontinuing the dosing for at least one day at least 24 hours usually for at least about 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 21 28 42 56 70 84 98 112 or more days. Once the subject s response shows signs of remission e.g. a symptom begins to intensify viral serum DNA or RNA begins to increase or an immune parameter e.g. as described herein begins to deteriorate dosing can be resumed for another course. An aspect of the subject s response to F1C s is that the subject may show a measurable response within a short time usually about 5 10 days which allows straightforward tracking of the subject s response e.g. by monitoring viral titer in peripheral white blood cells PBMC by measuring viral nucleic acid levels in the blood or by measuring a white blood cell population s or expression of a cytokine or interleukin by e.g. white blood cells or a subset s thereof. One may monitor one or more immune cell subsets e.g. NK LAK dendritic cells or cells that mediate ADCC immune responses during and after intermittent dosing to monitor the subject s response and to determine when further administration of the F1C is indicated. These cell subsets are monitored as described herein e.g. by flow cytometry.

Dosages of the F1C continuous or intermittent dose protocols routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for any of the diseases or conditions that are disclosed herein. Thus the F1Cs may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically in chronic or acute conditions. In acute conditions the F1Cs may also be administered at the time of occurrence or relatively soon after an acute event such as the onset of surgery a migraine or the occurrence of trauma e.g. a central nervous system injury a cerebral stroke or myocardial infarction. For acute events a F1C may thus be administered concurrently e.g. within about 15 minutes or about 30 minutes or about 45 minutes of the onset or occurrence of the acute event or at a later time e.g. at about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 36 42 48 54 60 72 84 96 108 or 120 hours after the onset or occurrence of the acute event or at any range of times defined by any two of these later times. The F1Cs may thus be administered at about 4 120 hours about 6 120 hours about 8 48 hours 8 24 hours 8 12 hours 10 12 hours 10 14 hours 10 16 hours about 10 24 hours 12 14 hours or about 12 16 hours after an acute event starts occurs or is believed to have begun e.g. after a surgical procedure has been completed or after a radiation treatment has ended or after a cytotoxic chemotherapy or a myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy has been administered to the subject.

Alternatively the F1Cs may be administered before e.g. within about 15 minutes about 30 minutes or about 45 minutes before the onset or occurrence of a planned or anticipated acute event or at an earlier time e.g. at about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 36 42 48 54 60 72 84 96 108 or 120 hours before the onset or occurrence of the acute event. The F1Cs may thus be administered at about 6 120 hours about 8 48 hours about 10 24 hours about 10 16 or about 12 16 hours before the planned or anticipated acute event e.g. before a planned surgery or a radiation treatment starts or occurs.

Invention embodiments include formulations described here and elsewhere in this disclosure. While it is possible for the F1C s to be administered to a subject or incubated with a subject s cells in vitro as the compound alone it is usual to use F1C in a formulation or at least in a composition that contains 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more excipients. The formulations which are useful for veterinary or human pharmaceutical use comprise at least one F1C together with 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more excipients and optionally one or more additional therapeutic ingredients.

The invention includes compositions comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. The compositions are used to prepare formulations suitable for human or animal use. Formulations may be designed or intended for oral rectal nasal topical or transmucosal including buccal sublingual ocular vaginal and rectal and parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intrathecal intraocular and epidural administration. In general aqueous and non aqueous liquid or cream formulations are delivered by a parenteral oral or topical route. In other embodiments the F1C s may be present as an aqueous or a non aqueous liquid formulation or a solid formulation suitable for administration by any route e.g. oral topical buccal sublingual parenteral aerosol a depot such as a subcutaneous depot or an intraperitoneal or intramuscular depot or a rectal or vaginal suppository. The preferred route may vary with for example the subject s pathological condition or weight or the subject s response to therapy with a F1C or other therapy that is used or that is appropriate to the circumstances. The F1C formulations can also be administered by two or more routes e.g. subcutaneous injection and buccal or sublingual where these delivery methods are essentially simultaneous or they may be essentially sequential with little or no temporal overlap in the times at which the compound is administered to the subject.

The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques excipients and dosage forms are found in e.g. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1985 17edition Nema et al. 1997 51 166 171 1995 G. Cole et al. editors Taylor Francis ISBN 0 136628915 1992 2revised edition volumes 1 and 2 H. A. Lieberman et al. editors Marcel Dekker ISBN 0824793870 1998 pages 1 306 J. T. Carstensen Technomic Publishing Co. ISBN 1566766907 and volumes 1 2 and 3 2edition 2002 J. Swarbrick and J. C Boylan editors Marcel Dekker Inc. New York N.Y.

Methods to make invention formulations include the step of bringing into association or contacting a F1C s with one or more excipient such as one described herein or in the cited references. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the F1C s with liquid excipients or finely divided solid excipients or both and then if appropriate shaping the product.

Formulations suitable for oral administration are prepared as discrete units such as capsules soft gelatin capsules softgels cachets tablets or caplets each containing a predetermined amount of the F1C s . F1C formulations can also be present as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension colloid or gel in an aqueous liquid or base or in a non aqueous liquid or base or as an oil in water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. The F1C formulations may also be a bolus electuary or paste. Suspension formulations will typically contain about 0.5 w w or about 1 w w to about 5 10 15 or 20 w w of the F1C which can be for parenteral use or for other routes of administration e.g. oral softgels.

A tablet is made by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the F1C s in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder lubricant inert diluent preservative surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered or granulated F1C and one or more excipients which are optionally moistened with an inert liquid diluent or excipient. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the F1C s therefrom. An exemplary tablet or caplet formulation suitable for buccal or sublingual delivery of a F1C to a subject s tissues comprises about 25 or 50 mg of a F1C comprising per 25 mg of the F1C about 6.2 mg povidone about 0.62 mg magnesium stearate about 45 mg mannitol and about 48 mg of compressible sucrose.

For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. the mouth or skin the formulations are typically applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the F1C s in an amount of for example about 0.075 to about 20 w w including F1C s in a range between about 0.1 and 20 in increments of 0.1 w w such as about 0.6 w w about 0.7 w w about 1 w w about 1.5 w w about 2 w w about 2.5 w w about 3 w w about 5 w w about 7 w w about 10 w w etc. including about 0.2 to 15 w w and about 0.5 to 10 w w. When formulated in an ointment the F1C s may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water miscible ointment base. Alternatively they may be formulated in a cream with an oil in water cream base.

If desired the aqueous phase of the cream base may include for example at least 30 w w of a polyhydric alcohol i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol butane 1 3 diol butane 1 4 diol mannitol sorbitol glycerol and a polyethylene glycol including e.g. PEG 300 and PEG 400 and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the F1C s through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.

The oily phase of the emulsion formulations may be constituted from known excipients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise an emulsifier or emulgent it typically comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. A hydrophilic emulsifier may be included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. Some embodiments include both an oil and a fat. Together the emulsifier s with or without stabilizer s make up the so called emulsifying wax and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.

Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulations include Tween60 Span80 cetostearyl alcohol benzyl alcohol myristyl alcohol glyceryl mono stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate. Other excipients include emulsifying wax propyl gallate citric acid lactic acid polysorbate 80 sodium chloride isopropyl palmitate glycerin and white petrolatum.

Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye include eye drops which are usually sterile wherein the F1C s is dissolved or suspended in a suitable excipient s including an aqueous solvent for a F1C s that comprise at least about 0.5 one two or more charges at pH values near neutrality e.g. about pH 6 8. The F1C s is typically present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 20 w w about 1 10 w w or about 2 5 w w.

Formulations suitable for topical administration to oral mucosa include lozenges or tablets comprising the F1C s in a flavored basis or a monosaccharide or disaccharide such as sucrose lactose or glucose and acacia or tragacanth pastilles comprising the F1C s in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia and mouthwashes comprising the F1C s in a suitable liquid excipient s . In some embodiments the lozenges or tablets optionally comprise the property of rapid dissolution or disintegration e.g. disintegration within about 15 seconds to about 2 minutes while in others the lozenges or tablets comprise the property of slower dissolution or disintegration e.g. disintegration within about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes or more.

Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.

Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the F1C s such excipients as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants buffers bacteriostats salts e.g. NaCl potassium or sodium carbonate or bicarbonate or potassium or sodium phosphates and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended subject and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents or thickening agents. In general the F1C that is present in liquid compositions or formulations is completely dissolved in aqueous or non aqueous excipients. However in some embodiments e.g. transient compositions or some formulations the F1C is partially dissolved while the remaining portion is present as a solid which can be a suspension or a colloid.

Formulations suitable for parenteral delivery of F1Cs to subjects such as humans or animals typically comprise 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more excipients. Exemplary embodiments include 1 any two three or four of propylene glycol PEG200 PEG300 ethanol benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate and 2 any two three or four of propylene glycol PEG100 PEG200 PEG300 PEG400 benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate. Typically such formulations will contain both propylene glycol and one or more PEGs e.g. PEG100 PEG200 PEG300 or PEG400 which enhance the solubility of the F1C by a cosolvent effect.

Formulations or compositions disclosed herein for use to make formulations suitable for administration by the routes disclosed herein optionally comprise an average particle size in the range of about 0.01 to about 500 microns about 0.1 to about 100 microns or about 0.5 to about 75 microns. Average particle sizes include a range between 0.01 and 500 microns in 0.05 micron or in 0.1 micron or other increments e.g. an average particle size of about 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.7 1 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6 7 8 9 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 60 75 85 100 120 150 etc. microns . The F1C itself that is used to make a formulation can have one two or more of these average particle sizes. When F1Cs or compositions that comprise a F1C are used as intermediates to make a formulation they may comprise one two three or more of these average particle sizes or size ranges. In preparing any of the compositions or formulations that are disclosed herein and that comprise a F1C and optionally one or more excipients one may optionally mill sieve or otherwise granulate the compound or composition to obtain a desired particle size e.g. as described above.

Milling or micronization by any other method may occur before or after the F1C is contacted with one or more excipients. For example one may mill a F1C to obtain an average particle size or diameter of about 0.05 50 M or about 0.5 10 M e.g. about 0.02 0.04 0.05 0.07 0.1 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 or 120 M average particle size or diameter before contacting the milled F1C with a liquid or solid excipient. In some cases the F1C is milled or sieved to obtain an average particle size of about 5 m or about 10 m before it is contacted with a solid or liquid excipient s to obtain a solution or suspension or a powder suitable for making a tablet capsule or other dosage form as described herein or in the cited references. Micronized compound may be prepared using any suitable process for obtaining small particles e.g. controlled precipitation from a solution micronizing or milling a number of which are known in the art. The micronized particles may include a percentage of particles that are less than or equal to about 0.1 20 m in diameter. Ranges of average particle sizes include F1Cs of about 0.04 0.6 m about 0.04 1.0 m about 0.05 0.6 m about 0.05 1.0 m about 0.1 0.4 m about 0.5 1 m about 1 20 m or about 2 50 m.

As used herein reference to an average particle size or an average particle diameter means that the material e.g. a F1C s an excipient s or a composition that comprises both is ground milled sieved or otherwise treated so as to comprise the specified average size. It is to be understood that some particles may be larger or smaller but the composition or the F1C s will comprise a significant proportion of the material with the specified size or within an acceptable range of the specified size e.g. at least about 70 or about 80 of the particles within about 30 to about 50 of the average size or diameter. Micronization methods include milling by ball mills pin mills jet mills e.g. fluid energy jet mills and grinding sieving and precipitation of a compound s from a solution see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 919 341 5 202 129 5 271 944 5 424 077 and 5 455 049. Average particle size is determined by known methods e.g. transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy light microscopy X ray diffractometry light scattering methods or Coulter counter analysis.

Thus the F1Cs may comprise a powder that consists of one two or more of these average particle sizes and the powder may be contacted with a solid excipient s suitably mixed and optionally compressed or formed into a desired shape. Alternatively such a F1C s is contacted with a liquid excipient s to prepare a liquid formulation or a liquid composition that is incorporated into a solid formulation. Suitable micronized formulations thus include aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions of the F1C s .

Formulations suitable for aerosol administration typically will comprise a fine powder e.g. having an average particle size of about 0.1 to about 20 microns or any one two or more of the average particle sizes within this range that are described above. The powder is typically delivered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the bronchioles or alveolar sacs of the lungs.

Formulations suitable for aerosol dry powder or tablet administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of viral or other infections as described herein. Such formulations may be administered e.g. orally parenterally e.g. intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous intradermal intrathecal topically sublingually or by a buccal or sublingual route.

Micronized F1C is useful e.g. to facilitate mixing dissolution or uniform suspension of the F1C in one or more liquid or solid excipients e.g. a PEG such as PEG 300 or PEG 400 propylene glycol benzyl benzoate a complexing agent such as a cyclodextrin e.g. an or cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin . Micronized F1C is also useful to facilitate uniformly distributing drug substance when the micronized compound is contacted with one or more solid excipients e.g. a filler a binder a disintegrant complexing agent e.g. a cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin a preservative a buffer or a lubricant .

In related embodiments suitable compositions or formulations comprise a F1C that is present in two or more physical forms. For example a liquid composition or formulation may comprise a F1C that is present in solution and as undissolved particles which may be milled as described herein. Alternatively a solid composition or formulation may comprise a F1C that is present as an amorphous form and as a crystal or in an encapsulated granule. Such encapsulated granules may comprise a slow release type formulation and the F1C that is present may be in one or more physical forms e.g. liquids or solids as described herein but usually as a solid in tablets or other solid formulations.

The formulations are presented in unit dose or multi dose containers for example sealed ampules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient for example water for injection immediately prior to use. In general solid liquid or other formulations or compositions that comprise a F1C e.g. unit dosages for solid or liquid formulations are stored in a sealed container which may optionally be opaque or nearly opaque e.g. amber or blue glass or brown plastic to reduce the amount of light that reaches the formulation or composition. Such containers are also optionally sealed e.g. hermetically sealed to prevent or limit exchange of air water or other gases between the container s contents and air. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets as described above. Unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose as recited herein or an appropriate fraction thereof of the F1C s .

Invention formulations include controlled release or slow release formulations containing a F1C s in which the release of the F1C s is controlled or regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given F1C s . Polymers and other materials that are suitable to prepare controlled release formulations that comprise a F1C have been described e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 652 443 4 800 085 4 808 416 5 013 727 5 188 840.

Formulations may thus contain microcapsules granules or other shaped forms and may comprise a F1C and a slow release polymer or polymer matrix that comprises or consists of one or more of ethylene dimethacrylate diethylene glycol dimethacrylate diethylene glycol diacrylate triethylene glycol dimethacrylate triethylene glycol diacrylate tetrathylene glycol dimethacrylate tetraethylene glycol diacrylate polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate polyethylene glycol diacrylate diethylaminoethyl dimethacrylate glycidyl methacrylate epoxy acrylate glycidyl acrylate hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydroxyethyl acrylate hydroxypropyl methacrylate hydroxypropyl acrylate hydroxybutyl methacrylate hydroxybutyl acrylate hydroxyhexyl methacrylate hydroxyhexyl acrylate butanediol dimethacrylate butanediol diacrylate propanediol dimethacrylate propanediol diacrylate pentanediol dimethacrylate pentanediol diacrylate hexanediol dimethacrylate hexanediol diacrylate neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate neopentyl glycol diacrylate trimethylopropane triacrylate trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate trimethyloethane triacrylate trimethylolethane trimethacrylate polypropyleneglycol diacrylate and polypropylene glycol dimethacrylate.

Invention embodiments include the product made by a process of combining mixing or otherwise contacting a F1C and one two or more excipients. Such products are produced by routine methods of contacting the ingredients. Such products optionally contain a diluent a disintegrant a lubricant a binder or other excipients described herein or in references cited herein.

When a F1C and an excipient s is contacted or mixed the final composition may comprise a homogenous mixture or it may comprise a mixture that is not homogenous for one or more of the compounds that are present in the composition. Compositions and formulations that are either homogenous or non homogenous are included in the scope of the invention. Non homogenous compositions can be used e.g. to make controlled release formulations.

Other embodiments include the product obtained by storing invention compositions or formulations e.g. unit dosage forms or compositions used to make formulations at about 4 40 C. for at least about 30 days e.g. storage at ambient temperature for about 1 24 months. Invention formulations will typically be stored in hermetically or induction sealed containers for these time periods. Compositions and formulations that comprise a F1C will typically be held in closed or sealed containers particularly when the composition is a formulation for pharmaceutical or veterinary use.

Typical containers for storage of compositions and formulations that comprise a F1C will limit the amount of water that reaches the materials contained therein. Typically formulations are packaged in hermetically or induction sealed containers. The containers are usually induction sealed. Water permeation characteristics of containers have been described e.g. Containers Permeation chapter USP 23 United States Pharmacopeial Convention Inc. 12601 Twinbrook Parkway Rockville Md. 20852 pp. 1787 et seq. 1995 .

The F1Cs or the biologically active substances produced from these compounds by hydrolysis or metabolism in vivo have a number of clinical and non clinical applications. The compounds are generally useful to correct immune dysregulation e.g. imbalanced immune responses to disease conditions pathogens or the like suppression of an innate or acquired immune response s and inflammation conditions in vertebrate or mammalian subjects e.g. as disclosed herein. Thus while the compounds will generally enhance a deficient immune response in a given clinical condition they will generally reduce the same immune response when it is too active in a different clinical condition. For example they can enhance insufficient or suboptimal Th1 immune responses reduce excess or undesirable Th2 immune responses reduce excess or undesirable Th1 immune responses or enhance insufficient or suboptimal Th2 immune responses or they can reduce excess or undesirable inflammation or one or more of its symptoms. The compounds will generally also modulate dysregulated Tc1 and Tc2 immune responses associated with CD8 T cells in a similar manner e.g. excessive Tc1 or Tc2 responses will be detectably decreased and deficient or suboptimal Tc1 or Tc2 responses will generally be detectably enhanced.

Invention embodiments include a method to modulate a subject s innate immunity Th1 immune responses Tc1 immune responses Th2 immune responses or Tc2 immune responses comprising administering an effective amount of a F1C to a subject or delivering the F1C to the subject s tissues. Other methods include modulating an immune or cellular response in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject or delivering to the subject s tissues an effective amount of a compound of formula 1. Immune and cellular response modulation includes enhancing Th1 immune responses reducing Th2 immune responses reducing Th1 immune responses enhancing Th2 immune responses reducing unwanted or pathological inflammation enhancing hematopoiesis or modulating the synthesis level or a biological activity of a biomolecule such as 1 a transcription factor such as a nuclear hormone receptor or an associated receptor factor 2 a purine such as adenosine 3 a nucleotide cofactor such as NADPH 4 a cytokine or interleukin or a receptor for a cytokine or interleukin or 5 another biomolecule as disclosed herein. Such enhancements reductions levels or activities are usually in an easily detectable range e.g. a change compared to a suitable control of at least about 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or a range that is between about any two of these values. Typically the subject is in need of such treatment e.g. by having a clinical condition disclosed herein or being subject to developing such a condition e.g. having been exposed or potentially exposed to a pathogen or having a predisposing condition such as precancer.

In modulating one or more activities of Th1 Th2 Tc1 or Tc2 cells or their function s the F1Cs will typically detectably modulate one two three or more factors e.g. immune cell subsets or populations cytokines interleukins surface antigens such as a CD molecule s and or their receptors that affect the development migration numbers or biological function s of such cells. When a Th1 or Tc1 cell or population is affected the F1Cs will typically increase or decrease the synthesis or level of one two or more of an associated effector factor e.g. IFN IL 2 IL 12 IL 18 T bet PPAR and PPAR or a cell surface molecule e.g. as disclosed herein or in the cited references that is associated with or needed for normal optimal or enhanced Th1 or Tc1 cells or cell function. Such molecules are generally associated with development or enhancement of Th1 or Tc1 cells or their biological function s . When a Th2 or Tc2 cell or population is affected the F1Cs will typically increase or decrease the synthesis or level of one two or more of an associated effector factor e.g. IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 8 IL 10 IL 13 GATA 3 COX 2 or a cell surface molecule e.g. as disclosed herein or in the cited references that is associated with or needed for normal optimal or enhanced Th2 or Tc2 cells or cell function s . Such molecules are generally associated with development or enhancement of Th2 or Tc2 cells or their biological function s .

Similarly when a subject has or is subject to developing an unwanted or excessive inflammation the F1Cs will generally detectably modulate one or more relevant effector factors for inflammation e.g. a detectable decrease of one two three or more of IL 1 IL 1 TNF TNF MIP 1 MIP 2 TGF 1 IP 10 LT IFN IL 6 IL 8 IL 10 and COX 2 lipoxygenase or an increase of one or more suppressor factors or antagonists of inflammation. Such modulation can comprise increases or decreases of at least about 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 75 80 85 90 95 98 100 200 300 500 1000 5000 or within a range between any two of these values e.g. between about 5 95 about 10 90 about 5 60 or about 40 95 . In general such changes leads to a detectable amelioration of an inflammation associated disease condition symptom or to the detectable slowing of the progression thereof or to a detectably reduced incidence or severity of or susceptibility to developing an unwanted inflammatory response.

In conditions where an unwanted or excessive Th1 Tc1 Th2 or Tc2 response is associated with or causes a disease s disease s progression disease s state maintenance condition s or symptom s the F1Cs will generally decrease the level or one or more biological activity of one two or more of their respective associated effector molecules. In conditions where a deficient or suboptimal Th1 Tc1 Th2 or Tc2 response is associated with or causes a disease s disease s progression disease s state maintenance condition s or symptom s the F1Cs will generally increase the level or one or more biological activity of one two three or more of their respective associated effector molecules. Such changes in the level or biological activity ies the associated effector molecules is generally detectable using standard methods and is typically an increase when a response is insufficient or a decrease when a response is in excess of at least about 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 75 80 85 90 95 98 or within a range between any two of these values e.g. between about 5 95 about 10 90 about 5 60 or about 40 95 . In general such changes leads to a detectable amelioration of a disease condition symptom or to the detectable slowing of the progression thereof or to a detectably reduced incidence or severity of or susceptibility to developing a disease s or the occurrence of a symptom s for a at least a portion of subjects that are treated with a F1C e.g. at least about 5 10 20 40 60 or 80 of treated subjects. The F1Cs may facilitate the clinical cure of a disease s prolong remission of a disease s or eliminate or ameliorate a clinically detectable symptom s .

The F1C will generally also affect the function of other immune cell subsets in a similar manner. Thus when an insufficient macrophage dendritic cell or neutrophil response is associated with the establishment maintenance or progression of a disease symptom or a condition the F1Cs will generally enhance of the level or a biological activity ies of one or more effector molecule associated with or needed for an optimal or more normal response or immune function that is mediated by the macrophages dendritic cells or neutrophils. Similarly when the subject suffers from a excessive or pathological activity associated with macrophages dendritic cells or neutrophils which is associated with the establishment maintenance or progression of a disease symptom or a condition the F1Cs will generally detectably reduce the level or a biological activity ies of one or more effector molecule associated with or needed for an optimal or more normal response or immune function that is mediated by the macrophages dendritic cells or neutrophils. Such effector molecules are as described herein or in the cited references.

As used herein reference to Th1 or Th2 immune responses means such responses as observed in mammals generally and not as observed in the murine system from which the Th1 and Th2 terminology originated. Thus in humans Th1 cells are CD4 T lymphocytes and they usually preferentially display chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 while Th2 cells are CD4 T lymphocytes and usually preferentially express the CCR4 CCR8 and or CXCR4 chemokine receptor molecule s and generally a smaller amount of CCR3 see e.g. U. Syrbe et al. 1999 21 263 285 S. Sebastiani et al. 2001 166 996 1002. Tc1 and Tc2 immune responses are mediated by CD8 lymphocytes and means to identify these cells and their associated lymphokines cell specific antigens and biological activities have been described see e.g. M. B. Faries et al. 2001 98 2489 2497 W. L. Chan et al. 2001 167 1238 1244 C. Prezzi et al. 2001 31 894 906 H. Ochi et al. 2001 119 297 305 D. H. Fowler and R. E. Gress 2000 38 221 234.

The F1Cs are useful in reestablishing normal immune function in various immune dysregulation or immune suppression conditions. For example they are useful to treat slow progression of or to ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with one or more of an autoimmune condition s a inflammation condition s an infection s a cancer s a precancer s a chemotherapy ies radiation therapy a burn s a trauma s a surgery ies a pulmonary condition a cardiovascular disease s and a neurological or neurodegenerative disease s . Without being limited to any theory the F1Cs are believed to act through several mechanisms including by directly or indirectly modulating nuclear hormone receptor activity or by affecting or modulating other biological targets such as transcription factors steroid binding proteins or enzymes in at least some of the diseases conditions or symptoms disclosed herein.

The F1Cs are useful to modulate delayed type hypersensitivity DTH responses and anergic conditions in subjects having to subject to developing abnormal DHT responses or anergy. Means to measure such responses and conditions are known and can be used to characterize the effects of the F1Cs on these responses and conditions. See e.g. A. E. Brown et al. 83 633 639 2000 R. A. Smith et al. 27 384 390 2000 N. M. Ampel 37 245 250 1999. The compounds will generally detectably enhance or restore DTH in immune suppression conditions. They will also generally detectably reduce or eliminate anergy in subjects having significantly reduced or no immune response to e.g. specific antigens or pathogens.

Clinical indications that have an association with or have a symptom s that is consistent or associated with an excessive or unwanted Th2 immune response include e.g. fatigue pain fever or an increased incidence of infection schizophrenia acute myelitis tumor progression progressive systemic sclerosis Omenn s syndrome atopic disease atopy allergen hypersensitivity atopic asthma atopic dermatitis burns trauma e.g. bone fracture hemorrhage surgery immune responses to xenotransplantation chronic periodontitis SLE systemic lupus erythematosus discoid lupus erythematosus osteoporosis myasthenia gravis Graves disease mite associated ulcerative dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Excessive Th2 immune responses are also associated with an unwanted symptom or pathology e.g. fatigue pain fever or an increased incidence of infection that is associated with aging allergy and inflammation conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis patients allergic respiratory disease allergic rhinitis atopic dermatitis subepithelial fibrosis in airway hyperresponsiveness chronic sinusitis perennial allergic rhinitis fibrosing alveolitis lung fibrosis . This common underlying immune component is at least part of the pathology or symptoms of all of these conditions. This allows a F1C to be effectively used to prevent or treat the condition or to treat or ameliorate one or more symptoms that are associated with these conditions. Thus in some embodiments an unwanted or excessive Th2 response is present and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with this condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a F1C according to the methods described herein e.g. F1C is administered using a formulation and a route of administration essentially as described herein on an intermittent or a daily basis.

Typically unwanted Th2 immune responses are associated with or caused by increased expression of one or more cytokines or interleukins such as one two three or more of cortisol IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 10 and IL 13. Administration of a F1C will generally reduce the expression of one or more of the Th2 associated cytokines or interleukins. At the same time the compounds generally enhance the expression of one or more cytokines or interleukins associated with Th1 immune responses. Because of their capacity to modulate or to balance Th1 and Th2 immune responses the compounds are useful for a variety of clinical conditions e.g. infection immunosuppression or cancer where an enhanced Th1 immune response is desired. Effects of the F1Cs in treating preventing or slowing the progression of the clinical conditions described herein can include one or more of 1 enhancing the Th1 character of a subject s immune response or immune status 2 increasing the intensity of a Th1 or a Th2 immune response or both and 3 decreasing inflammation or a symptom thereof.

Exemplary conditions where an immune imbalance or an excessive Th1 immune response is involved include autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis Crohn s disease regional enteritis ulcerative colitis inflammatory bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis reactive arthritis acute allograft rejection sarcoidosis type 1 diabetes mellitus associated peptic ulcer graft versus host disease and Hashimotos thyroiditis. Because these conditions are associated with a similar type immune dysfunction a F1C can be effectively used to prevent or treat these conditions or to treat or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated therewith. Thus in some embodiments an unwanted or excessive Th1 response is present and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with this condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a F1C according to the methods described herein e.g. F1C is administered using a formulation and a route of administration essentially as described herein on an intermittent or a daily basis. In other embodiments an deficient Th1 response is enhanced which is optionally observed as a detectable increase in one or more of IFN IL 2 IL 12 or IL 18 in Th1 cells or in accessory cells such as a dendritic cell or macrophage. In all of the conditions where an insufficient or excess Th1 Th2 Tc1 or Tc2 response is present amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with the condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a F1C according to the methods described herein.

Aspects of the invention include the use or administration of compositions or formulations that comprise a carrier and an amount of at least one F1C effective to detectably modulate an immune parameter. For example to enhance the relative proportion of a desired immune cell subset e.g. CD4 T cells CD8 T cells NK cells LAK cells neutrophils granulocytes basophils eosinophils or dendritic cells or to modulate detectably increase or decrease one or more functions of immune cell subsets. The F1Cs can modulate the expression of CD molecules or alter the proportion of cell subsets e.g. CD4 or CD8 T cells or their relative numbers in a subject s blood or tissues. CD and related molecules participate in the function of various immune cell subsets and can be useful as markers for immune function in vivo. In some aspects the F1Cs activate immune cells which generally alters increases or decreases expression of or changes the numbers of cells that express one or more of CD4 CD6 CD8 CD25 CD27 CD28 CD30 CD36 CD38 CD39 CD43 CD45RA CD45RO CD62L CD69 CD71 CD90 or HLA DR molecules. Often the numbers of cells that express these molecules are increased e.g. CD25 CD36 CD16 or CD69. Typically such increases are observed as an increased proportion of circulating white blood cells that express one or more of these molecules or white blood cells e.g. T cells or dendritic cells that express CXCR3 CCR5 CCR4 CCR8 and or CXCR4. In some cases the number of such molecules per cell is detectably altered.

Expression of one or more adhesion molecules CD2 CD5 CD8 CD11a CD11b CD11c CD18 CD29 CD31 CD36 CD44 CD49a CD49b CD49c CD49d CD49e CD49f CD50 CD54 CD58 CD103 or CD104 are also detectably modulated after administration of the F1Cs to a subject. Often the numbers of cells that express these molecules are increased e.g. CD5 or CD56. The adhesion molecules function in various aspects of immune responses such as binding to class I MHC molecules transducing signals between cells or binding to molecules in the extracellular matrix associated with endothelial or other cell types. Administration of the F1Cs to a subject also affects the numbers of certain immune cell subsets e.g. NK cells e.g. CD8 CD56 or CD8 CD56 or lymphokine activated killer cells LAK . Increased circulating NK or LAK cells are typically observed which is reflected in increased numbers of cells that express one or more of CD16 CD38 CD56 CD57 or CD94. Also increased numbers of circulating dendritic cell precursors are observed as shown by increases in cells that express one or more of CD11c CD80 CD83 CD106 or CD123. Although one can observe an increased proportion of circulating white blood cells that express one or more of these molecules in some instances the number of such molecules per cell is detectably altered. Both the cell numbers and the density of CD molecule per cell can also be detectably modulated. Modulation of immune cell subsets typically occurs on intermittent dosing of a F1C but will arise from any suitable dosing regimen e.g. as described herein.

Expression of one or more homing or other receptors or receptor subunits such as CD62L CLA 1 LFA1 CD44 ICAM VCAM or ECAM may also be detectably affected after administration of the F1Cs to a subject. The numbers of cells that express these molecules or the relative amounts per cell of e.g. CD44 or CD62L may be increased where a desired immune response is desired e.g. migration of T cells to mucosal tissues or exposure of na ve T cells to antigen in lymph nodes. Alternatively numbers of cells that express these molecules or the relative amounts per cell of e.g. CLA 1 may be decreased where inhibition of an undesired immune response such as an inflammatory response is desired. The subject s response to such enhanced expression includes migration of cells such as movement of na ve T cells to peripheral lymph nodes in response to modulation of CD62L or other homing receptor expression. Thus the F1Cs can also facilitate migration of various immune cell types e.g. dendritic cells NK cells LAK cells macrophages or lymphocytes from one location to another within a subject. For example the compounds can enhance dendritic cell or lymphocyte migration from areas such as the skin tissues to the gut associated lymphoid tissue GALT lymph nodes or spleen. Such migration may facilitate the function of those cell types by increasing their transit to tissues where their effector functions e.g. antigen presentation by dendritic cells normally occur. The migration period is often relatively transient e.g. observable over about 1 7 days or occasionally longer e.g. occurring for about 8 40 days depending on the dosing regimen and other factors. This migration can be observed by standard methods e.g. by cell staining by PCR analyses or by determining the presence of a given cell type in circulation or determining a decrease in the number circulating cells. A decrease would generally reflect sequestration of an immune cell population s in a tissue s where the immune cell normally exercises its effector functions.

Thus in some embodiments the migration of one or more immune cell subsets such as CD11C cells from tissue such as skin or lung through the blood to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT is seen as a transient increase in the level of circulating CD11C cells in response to exposure of the subject s tissues to a suitable amount of a F1C. Thus the level of CD11C cells in the blood will generally detectably increase e.g. a statistically significant increase plateau and then decrease as migration of the cells to immune tissue subsides. In these embodiments the proportion of the cells of the affected immune cell subset is typically relatively low in most physiological immune states e.g. normal or abnormal immune conditions compared to the total white blood cell population in circulation. In other embodiments the migration of one or more immune cell subsets such as CD123 cells from the circulation to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT results in a decrease. In these embodiments the decrease in the numbers of circulating immune cells reflects the migration of the immune cells from the blood to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT. Such a decrease may be transient and followed by recovery of the affected immune cell subset s over about 2 to 24 weeks. In conducting these embodiments administration of the F1C to the subject is accomplished using the formulations or the methods as described herein.

Thus an aspect of the invention is a method to enhance the migration of one or more immune cell types in a subject from one location e.g. bone marrow circulating blood or a tissue such as the skin liver central nervous system or lung to another e.g. to the blood or to a lymphoid tissue such as a lymph node spleen or a mucosal tissue such as GALT by administration to a subject as described herein of an effective amount of a F1C essentially as described by any of the methods disclosed herein. A related aspect is the monitoring e.g. by suitable blood counts or tissue biopsy of the subject s response to determine the timing and extent of such immune cell migration.

Other CD molecules that are modulated by the presence of the F1Cs in a subject include cytokine receptor molecules such as one or more of CD115 CDW116 CD117 CD118 CDW119 CD120a CD120b CD121a CD121b CD122 CD123 CD124 CD125 CD126 CDW127 CDW128 or CDW130. Often the numbers of receptor molecules per cell will be modulated. For example receptors for cytokines that mediate or facilitate Th1 immune responses or innate immune responses e.g. one or more of IL 1 IL 1 IL 2 IL 4 IL 12 IFN or interferon will typically increase in or on cells that mediate Th1 or innate immune responses. Modulation of these molecules may be by direct interactions with a receptor s in the cell that expresses the cytokine receptor or indirectly by modulation of cytokine synthesis in the affected cells or in other cells typically immune cells that may interact with the cells whose receptor synthesis is being modulated. Thus autocrine or paracrine mechanisms may underlie some of the effects associated with administration of a F1C s such as altered cytokine profiles in immune cells or altered immune cell populations. Endocrine cytokine mechanisms may also contribute to desired immune responses.

Treatment of a subject with a F1C can result in a change of at least about 20 80 or about 25 50 above or below e.g. at least 30 or at least 40 above or below the control or basal level of affected immune cell subsets. For example increases of more than about 30 in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells e.g. CD8 CD69 CD25 T cells CD8 CD69 CD25 T cells or CD8 CD69 CD25 T cells can occur by 7 days after a single dose of a F1C to a subject. Such increases may be greater than 50 60 or 100 in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells or subsets of activated CD8 T cells in individual subjects. Typically such increases are about in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells or subsets of activated CD8 T cells averages about 30 40 with individual subjects experiencing increases over 100 in the numbers of activated CD8 T cells per unit blood volume compared to the basal level.

Administration of the F1Cs can affect other immune cell subsets. For example the concentration of circulating CD4 CD69 CD25 Th1 helper cells and CD8 CD16 CD38 LAK cells or CD8 CD16 CD38 LAK cells typically increases during or after the course of dosing a subject with a F1C. Also CD8 CD16 CD38 and CD8 CD16 CD38 ADCC effector cells and low side scatter Lin DR CD123 dendritic precursors or low side scatter Lin DR CD11c dendritic cells or precursors may show modest to significant increases.

In subjects that are immunosuppressed e.g. from certain infections e.g. viral HIV HCV bacterial infection or parasite infection or from chemotherapy e.g. an antiviral therapy a cancer chemotherapy or a radiation therapy administration of the F1Cs to the subject results in a favorable shift in the balance of Th1 or Th2 responses the subject can mount in the face of immunosuppression. When Th1 responses are suboptimal or insufficient treatment with a F1C results in enhancement of Th1 responses or a reduction in Th2 responses. Conversely when Th2 responses are suboptimal or insufficient treatment with a F1C results in enhancement of Th2 responses which may occur with a concomitant modulation increase or decrease in Th1 responses. The F1Cs can thus be used to shift the nature of a subject s immune response to result in a more balanced immune response from immunosuppression. Alternatively the compounds can selectively suppress inappropriate or unwanted immune responses. Enhanced Th1 responses appears to be at least partly due to one or more of i a reduction in biological restraints e.g. high levels of IL 4 or IL 10 on Th1 functions by preexisting primed Th1 effector cells ii enhanced differentiation of Th0 cells to Th1 cells or enhanced responses mediated by Th1 cells iii enhanced function of accessory cell function e.g. antigen presentation by dendritic cells dendritic precursor or progenitor cells or by macrophages or their precursors or progenitors iv enhanced proliferation and differentiation of Th1 precursor or progenitor cells v enhanced IL 12 expression in dendritic cells or their precursors which results in enhanced differentiation of Th1 cells from Th0 precursors vi enhanced expression or activity of factors associated with Th1 functions e.g. IL 2 gamma interferon IFN or IFN IL 18 or lymphotoxin.

An aspect of the invention methods is an alteration in the expression of IL 4 or IL 10 that occurs after administration of a F1C to a subject. A consistent observation is that extracellular IL 4 or IL 10 levels rapidly decrease to levels that are undetectable by ELISA. Intracellular IL 10 levels are reduced to levels that are near or below the limits of detection by flow cytometry. The administration of a F1C to a subject thus provides a means to inhibit either or both of these interleukins. Such inhibition may be associated with enhancement of Th1 immune responses relative to Th2 or Th0 responses e.g. in subjects where Th1 responses are suppressed e.g. from viral bacterial or parasite infection HIV HCV etc or chemotherapy or are otherwise suboptimal. In many subjects levels of either IL 4 or IL 10 usually IL 10 before dosing with a F1C is low or undetectable. In these subjects dosing with the F1C results in a rapid drop in the interleukin that is detectable usually IL 4.

Additional information regarding these and other clinical conditions or symptoms that can be treated prevented or ameliorated with the F1Cs are found at e.g. 17edition M. H. Beers and R. Berkow editors 1999 Merck Research Laboratories Whitehouse Station N.J. ISBN 0911910 10 7 or in other references cited herein.

Responses to treatment of a subject having a condition disclosed herein with a F1C is optionally monitored by observing changes in one or more immune or other appropriate clinical parameters e.g. as described herein or in D. S. Jacobs et al. editors 4edition pages 11 686 Lexi Comp Inc. Hudson Ohio ISBN 0 916589 36 6 or in any of the references cited herein or by monitoring the progression or severity of the underlying condition according to known methods e.g. J. B. Peter editor 5Edition pages 1 309 1998 Specialty Laboratories Santa Monica Calif. ISBN 1 889342 13 0.

Although the forgoing combination therapies have been described in the context of viral or other infections the protocols and methods that employ a F1C can be used in conjunction with any suitable new or known therapeutic agent s or treatment protocol s for other any other clinical condition described herein. Any of these additional treatments can be coupled with the administration of any of the F1Cs in any of the embodiments described herein. Exemplary conditions include one or more of a non viral pathogen infection s a cancer s a precancer s an inflammation condition s an autoimmune condition s an immunosuppression condition s a neurological disorder s a cardiovascular disorder s a neurological disorder s diabetes obesity wasting anorexia anorexia nervosa a cancer chemotherapy ies side effect s a side effect s of a chemotherapy ies or a radiation therapy ies of any other clinical condition disclosed herein or in the cited references or the like. Thus invention embodiments include the use of a F1C before during or after a treatment that uses another suitable therapeutic agent s or therapeutic treatment s for any of the diseases or conditions disclosed herein any of which diseases or conditions may be acute chronic severe mild moderate stable or progressing.

Other uses for the F1C s include administering the compound s to a subject who suffers from a pathological condition s . The treatment may treat or ameliorate the source of the condition s and or symptoms associated with the pathological condition s such as infection with a pathogen s viruses bacteria fungi a malignancy unwanted immune response i.e. an immune response that causes pathology and or symptoms e.g. autoimmune conditions or allergy or conditions such as hypoproliferation conditions e.g. normal or impaired tissue growth or wound healing or burn healing or in immunosuppression conditions e.g. conditions characterized by an absence of a desired response and or an inadequate degree of a desired response.

Many cancers precancers malignancies or hyperproliferation conditions are associated with an unwanted Th2 immune response a deficient Th1 response or unwanted inflammation. An insufficient Th1 immune response may play a role in the capacity of malignant or premalignant cells to escape immune surveillance. Any of the F1Cs disclosed herein may thus be used to treat prevent or slow the progression of one or more cancers precancers or cell hyperproliferation conditions or they may be used to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof. In these conditions the F1Cs are useful to enhance the subject s Th1 responses or to reestablish a more normal Th1 Th2 balance in the subject s immune responses. The F1Cs may function at least in part by decreasing inflammation or inflammation associated markers such as IL 6 and or by enhancing hematopoiesis in many of these conditions.

These conditions include cancers or precancers comprising carcinomas sarcomas adenomas blastoma disseminated tumors and solid tumors such as one associated with or arising from prostate lung breast ovary skin stomach intestine pancreas neck larynx esophagus throat tongue lip oral cavity oral mucosa salivary gland testes liver parotid biliary tract colon rectum cervix uterus vagina pelvis endometrium kidney bladder central nervous system glial cell astrocyte squamous cell blood bone marrow muscle or thyroid cells or tissue. The F1Cs are thus useful to treat prevent slow the progression of or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a precancer cancer or related hyperproliferation condition such as myelodysplastic syndrome actinic keratoses endometriosis Barrett s esophagus leiomyoma fibromyoma benign or precancerous intestinal or bowel polyps or benign prostatic hyperplasia. The compounds can also be used to treat prevent slow the progression of slow the replication or growth of or to ameliorate one or more symptoms of a primary tumor a metastasis an advanced malignancy a blood born malignancy a leukemia or a lymphoma. Any of these conditions may be in an early or mild form or can be moderate or advanced in the existent or progression of the disease or a symptom.

In treating endometriosis the use of an F1C will slow the rate of disease progression and decrease the severity or frequency of one or more symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods infertility abdominal pain or cramping and pain in the lower back or pelvic area which may precede menstruation or may accompany sexual intercourse or bowel movements. Beneficial effects from F1C treatment will be mediated in patients with endometriosis at least partially by increasing the patient s Th1 immune responses and or by decreasing anti endometrial antibodies or aberrent Th2 immune responses. Treatment of emdometriosis could be accompanied by other suitable treatments e.g. treatment with one or more of estrogen progesterone danazol follicle stimulating hormone antagonists leutinizing hormone antagonists gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonists such as nafarelin acetate or analgesics such as codeine tylenol or aspirin.

The F1Cs can be used to treat paraneoplastic syndromes or conditions such as ones associated with lung or breast cancers that secrete calcitonin or that enhance osteoclast activity. Such conditions include hypercalcemia Cushing s syndrome acromegaly and non islet cell tumor hypoglycemia. The compounds are used to decrease osteoclast activity or other symptoms associated with such conditions.

Hyperproliferation conditions that can be treated include melanoma Kaposi s sarcoma leiomyosarcoma non small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell cancer or carcinoma glioma glioblastoma pancreatic or gastric adenocarcinoma gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma human papillomavirus associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cervical carcinoma hepatoma hepatocellular carcinoma hepatocellular adenoma cutaneous T cell lymphoma mycosis fungoides Sezary syndrome colorectal cancer chronic lymphocytic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia ALL or follicular lymphoma multiple myeloma carcinomas with p53 mutations colon cancer cardiac tumors adrenal tumors pancreatic cancer retinoblastoma a small cell lung cancer a non small cell lung cancer intestinal cancer testicular cancer stomach cancer neuroblastoma neuroma myxoma myoma endothelioma osteoblastoma osteoclastoma osteosarcoma chondrosarcoma adenoma breast cancer prostate cancer Kaposi s sarcoma ovarian cancer squamous cell carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract and non myeloid tumors. Treating a subject with a F1C can ameliorate one or more side effects of chemotherapy or cancer symptoms such as alopecia pain fever malaise chronic fatigue and cachexia or weight loss. Other cancers precancers or their symptoms that can be treated prevented or ameliorated are described in e.g. 5 5edition R. C. Bast et al. editors 2000 ISBN 1 55009 113 1 pages 168 2453 B.C. Becker Inc. Hamilton Ontario Canada or 17edition M. H. Beers and R. Berkow editors 1999 Merck Research Laboratories Whitehouse Station N.J. ISBN 0911910 10 7.

In some of these embodiments the subject s hyperproliferation or malignant condition may be associated with or caused by one or more pathogens. Such conditions include hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV or HBV Kaposi s sarcoma associated with HIV 1 or HIV 2 T cell leukemia associated with HTLV I Burkitt s lymphoma associated with Epstein Barr virus or papillomas or carcinoma associated with papilloma viruses e.g. human HPV 6 HPV 11 HPV 16 HPV 18 HPV 31 HPV 45 or gastric adenocarcinoma gastric MALT lymphoma or gastric inflammation associated with or propionibacteria infection.

In some of these embodiments the F1Cs may be used to treat prevent or slow the progression of or ameliorate one or more conditions in a subject having or subject to developing a hyperproliferation condition where angiogenesis contributes to the pathology. Abnormal or unwanted angiogenesis or neovascularization contributes to the development or progression of solid tumor growth and metastases as well as to arthritis some types of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration corneal graft rejection neovascular glaucoma rubeosis retinoblastoma uvietis and pterygia or abnormal blood vessel growth of the eye and psoriasis. See e.g. Moses et al. 9 630 634 1991 Folkman et al. 333 1757 1763 1995 and Auerbach et al. 29 401 411 1985.

Dosages of the F1C routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for cancer or hyperproliferation conditions or other conditions as disclosed herein. Thus in some embodiments the use of the F1C is optionally combined with one two or more additional therapies for a cancer or precancer s e.g. one two or more of surgery and treatment with an antiandrogen or an antiestrogen as described herein or in the cited references an antineoplastic agent such as an alkylating agent a nitrogen mustard a nitrosourea an antimetabolite a cytotoxic agent a cytostatic agent platinum agents anthracyclines taxanes or treatment with an analgesic such as propoxyphene napsylate acetaminophen morphine or codeine. Exemplary anticancer and adjunct agents include tamoxifen paclitaxel taxol docetaxil methotrexate vincristine vinblastine 5 fluorouracil thioguanine mercaptopurine adriamycin chlorambucil cyclophosphamide cisplatin carboplatin transplatinum irinotecan procarbazine hydroxyurea erythropoietin G CSF bicalutamide anastrozole fludarabine phosphate doxorubicin and any suitable form of any of these agents e.g. salts and solvates. Such therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and they would precede be essentially concurrent with and or follow treatment with a F1C. In some embodiments such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a F1C is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the F1C is completed. In other embodiments a course of therapy is administered to the subject e.g. treatment with a myelosuppressive amount of a myelosuppressive agent such as 5 fluorouracil cyclophosphamide or a platinum compound such as cisplatin followed within about 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 days by administration of one or more courses of treatment with a F1C. Other suitable exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail see e.g. 54edition 2000 pages 303 3250 ISBN 1 56363 330 2 Medical Economics Co. Inc. Montvale N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents can be used in combination with a F1C to ameliorate slow the establishment or progression of prevent or treat any of the appropriate cancers precancers or related conditions described herein or any of their symptoms.

In treating cancers or hyperproliferation conditions the F1Cs may detectably modulate e.g. decrease or increase the expression or level or activity of one or more biomolecules associated with the prevention establishment maintenance or progression of the cancer or hyperproliferation condition. Such biomolecules include one or more of carcinoembryonic antigen prostate specific antigen her2 neu Bcl XL bcl 2 p53 IL 1 IL 1 IL 6 or TNF GATA 3 COX 2 NF B IkB an IkB kinase e.g. IkB kinase IkB kinase or IkB kinase NFAT calcineurin calmodulin a ras protein such as H ras or K ras cyclin D cyclin E xanthine oxidase or their isoforms orthologs homologs or mutant forms which may be observed as either reduced or increased levels or biological activity ies . Biomolecule levels or their activity ies that can be at least transiently detectably increased include one or more IL 2 IFN IL 12 T bet O6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase calcineurin calmodulin a superoxide dismutase e.g. Mn Zn or Cu a tumor suppressor protein such as the retinoblastoma protein Rb or CDKN2A p16 BRCA1 BRCA2 MeCP2 MBD2 PTEN NBR1 NBR2 or the isoforms orthologs homologs or mutant forms which may have either attenuated or enhanced biological activity ies of any of these molecules. In treating a cancer described herein such as prostate cancer one or more of ELAC2 2 5 oligoadenylate dependent RNAse L RNASEL macrophage scavenger receptor 1 MSR1 BRCA2 can be modulated or decreased.

The F1Cs can modulate the synthesis or a biological activity of one or more other gene products such as transcription factors enzymes or steroid or other receptors that are associated with the establishment progression or maintenance of a cancer or precancer or associated symptom. The compounds can inhibit AIB 1 coactivator or HER2 neu synthesis or activity in breast cancer cells or breast cancer conditions. They can enhance the synthesis or an activity of an estrogen receptor such as ER ER 1 or ER 2 or progesterone receptor in breast cancer or colon cancer cells or conditions. These effects can include modulation of the expression or one or more biological activities of proteins or enzymes that contribute to disease establishment or progression. Thus the compounds can decrease IL 4 IL 6 or IL 13 expression by stromal cells or immune cells that are in proximity to or adjacent to solid or diffuse tumor cells in a subject such as a human or another mammal. In the cancers or precancers described herein the compounds can thus directly or indirectly modulate e.g. decrease the activity or expression of relevant enzymes such as STAT 6 neutral endopeptidase a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase such as a 17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 7 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or a 3 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

In some embodiments the F1Cs are used to treat tumors or cancers wherein proliferation of the tumor or cancer cells is enhanced in response to sex steroids such as natural or synthetic androgens or estrogens. In other embodiments the tumor or cancer cells are not responsive to such hormones or they are only slightly responsive to the presence of such compounds.

Any of the F1Cs disclosed herein may be used to treat prevent or slow the progression of one or more of congenital heart defects cardiovascular diseases disorders abnormalities and or conditions or to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof in a subject. These include peripheral artery disease arterio arterial fistula arteriovenous fistula cerebral arteriovenous malformations aortic coarctation cor triatum coronary vessel anomalies patent ductus arteriosus Ebstein s anomaly hypoplastic left heart syndrome levocardia transposition of great vessels double outlet right ventricle tricuspid atresia persistent truncus arteriosus and heart septal defects such as aortopulmonary septal defect endocardial cushion defects Lutembacher s Syndrome ventricular heart septal defects cardiac tamponade endocarditis including bacterial heart aneurysm cardiac arrest congestive heart failure congestive cardiomyopathy paroxysmal dyspnea cardiac edema post infarction heart rupture ventricular septal rupture heart valve diseases myocardial diseases pericardial effusion pericarditis including constrictive and tuberculous pneumopericardium postpericardiotomy syndrome pulmonary heart disease rheumatic heart disease ventricular dysfunction hyperemia cardiovascular pregnancy complications cardiovascular syphilis cardiovascular tuberculosis arrhythmias such as sinus arrhythmia atrial fibrillation atrial flutter bradycardia extrasystole Adams Stokes Syndrome bundle branch block sinoatrial block long QT syndrome parasystole sick sinus syndrome ventricular fibrillations tachycardias such as paroxysmal tachycardia supraventricular tachycardia accelerated idioventricular rhythm atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia ectopic atrial tachycardia ectopic junctional tachycardia sinoatrial nodal reentry tachycardia sinus tachycardia Torsades de Pointes and ventricular tachycardia and heart valve diseases such as aortic valve insufficiency aortic valve stenosis heart murmurs aortic valve prolapse mitral valve prolapse tricuspid valve prolapse mitral valve insufficiency mitral valve stenosis pulmonary atresia pulmonary valve insufficiency pulmonary valve stenosis tricuspid atresia tricuspid valve insufficiency and tricuspid valve stenosis.

The F1Cs can be used to treat prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of myocardial diseases or pathological myocardial or vascular conditions such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy congestive cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy aortic subvalvular stenosis pulmonary subvalvular stenosis restrictive cardiomyopathy Chagas cardiomyopathy endocardial fibroelastosis myocardial fibrosis endomyocardial fibrosis Kearns Syndrome myocardial reperfusion injury myocarditis cardiovascular or vascular diseases such as dissecting aneurysms false aneurysms infected aneurysms ruptured aneurysms aortic aneurysms cerebral aneurysms coronary aneurysms heart aneurysms and iliac aneurysms angiodysplasia angiomatosis bacillary angiomatosis Sturge Weber Syndrome angioneurotic edema aortic diseases Takayasu s Arteritis aortitis Leriche s Syndrome arterial occlusive diseases arteritis enarteritis polyarteritis nodosa cerebrovascular diseases disorders and or conditions diabetic angiopathies diabetic retinopathy thrombosis erythromelalgia hemorrhoids hepatic veno occlusive disease hypertension hypotension idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis peripheral vascular diseases phlebitis pulmonary veno occlusive disease Raynaud s disease CREST syndrome retinal vein occlusion Scimitar syndrome superior vena cava syndrome telangiectasia atacia telangiectasia hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia varicocele varicose veins varicose ulcer vasculitis venous insufficiency and arterial occlusive diseases such as arteriosclerosis intermittent claudication carotid stenosis fibromuscular dysplasias mesenteric vascular occlusion Moyamoya disease retinal artery occlusion thromboangiitis obliterans or atherosclerosis any of which may be at an early stage or at a more advanced or late stage.

The F1Cs can also be used to treat prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of cerebrovascular diseases thrombosis and or conditions such as carotid artery diseases cerebral amyloid angiopathy cerebral aneurysm cerebral anoxia cerebral arteriosclerosis cerebral arteriovenous malformation cerebral artery diseases cerebral embolism and thrombosis carotid artery thrombosis sinus thrombosis Wallenberg s syndrome cerebral hemorrhage epidural hematoma subdural hematoma subarachnoid hemorrhage cerebral infarction cerebral ischemia including transient subclavian steal syndrome periventricular leukomalacia vascular headache cluster headache migraine vertebrobasilar insufficiency air embolisms embolisms such as cholesterol embolisms fat embolisms pulmonary embolisms or amniotic fluid embolism thromoboembolisms thrombosis such as coronary thrombosis hepatic vein thrombosis retinal vein occlusion carotid artery thrombosis sinus thrombosis Wallenberg s syndrome and thrombophlebitis.

The F1Cs can also be used to treat prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of vascular ischemia or myocardial ischemias vasculitis and coronary diseases including angina pectoris coronary aneurysm coronary arteriosclerosis coronary thrombosis coronary vasospasm myocardial infarction and myocardial stunning cerebral ischemia ischemic colitis compartment syndromes anterior compartment syndrome myocardial ischemia reperfusion injuries peripheral limb ischemia aortitis arteritis Behcet s Syndrome mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome thromboangiitis obliterans hypersensitivity vasculitis Schoenlein Henoch purpura allergic cutaneous vasculitis Wegener s granulomatosis or metabolic syndrome which may be accompanied by one two or more of obesity insulin resistance dyslipidemia hypertension or other related symptoms or conditions.

Exemplary symptoms that the use of the F1Cs can ameliorate include one or more of pain such as arm jaw or chest pain edema or swelling high blood pressure shortness of breath or dyspnea e.g. on exertion or while prone fatigue or malaise and low cardiac injection fraction. In treating a cardiovascular condition in a subject or in improving one or more symptoms thereof the F1Cs may accomplish one or more of increasing cardiac ejection volume or fraction decreasing levels of IL 6 decreasing levels of C reactive protein fibrinogen cardiac creatinine kinase increasing fatty acid metabolism or utilization by cardiac tissue increasing carnityl palmitoyl fatty acid transferase or other cardiac metabolic enzymes activating potassium dependent calcium channels vasodilating or enhancing oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues or decreasing levels of scarring or plaque formation that occurs e.g. after vascular damage. Symptoms associated with a cardiovascular condition such as ischemia that can be ameliorated also include acidosis expression of one or more immediate early genes in e.g. glial cells vascular smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells neuronal membrane depolarization and increased neuronal extracellular calcium and glutamate concentration. Other biological effects associated with treatment using a F1C may also be monitored e.g. and increase or decrease of a cell surface antigen a cytokine or an interleukin as disclosed herein.

Useful biological effects of the F1Cs in cardiovascular indications such as myocardial ischemias also include preventing or reducing heart or vascular cell death and subsequent fibrosis. These effects are associated with a decreased oxidative capacity of heart cells or myocytes which is associated with a decreased capacity of the cells to metabolize fatty acids efficiently. The compounds enhance fatty acid metabolism and ameliorate the deleterious effects of a limited oxidative capacity.

The F1Cs also can limit inflammation or cell injury that is associated with ischemia or oxygen reperfusion after ischemia. Ischemia which is a detrimental decrease in oxygenated blood delivery to affected cells or tissues may arise from a cardiovascular condition or event such as an infarction or from thermal injury or burns. Ischemia may also arise from accidental or surgical trauma. Reperfusion after cells have become hypoxic for a sufficient period of time can lead to tissue or cell injury that varies from slight to lethal. The compounds can reduce cell or tissue injury or death associated with ischemia and reperfusion by e.g. reducing inflammation or the level of a molecule associated with inflammation. Thus levels of a proinflammatory cytokine or molecule such as leukotriene B4 platelet activating factor or levels of extracellular P selectin may result from administration of a F1C to a subject who may experience reperfusion injury. Thus the compounds can reduce injury or death of e.g. neuron cardiac vascular endothelium myocardial pulmonary hepatic or renal cells or tissues. Without wishing to be bound by any theory the compounds may act in part by reducing one or more of neutrophil activation platelet activation platelet aggregation endothelial cell activation and neutrophil adherence or adhesion to endothelial cells in these conditions.

The F1Cs are useful to treat autoimmune or metabolic conditions or disorders or their symptoms in subjects such as mammals or humans that relate to impaired insulin synthesis or use or that relate to abnormal or pathological lipid or cholesterol metabolism or levels. Such conditions and symptoms include polycystic ovarian syndrome Type 1 diabetes including Immune Mediated Diabetes Mellitus and Idiopathic Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 diabetes including forms with 1 predominant or profound insulin resistance 2 predominant insulin deficiency and some insulin resistance 3 forms intermediate between these obesity hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia unwanted hyperlipidemia conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemias such as hyper LDL cholesterolemia 4 unwanted hypolipidemias e.g. hypo HDL cholesterolemia or low HDL cholesterol levels and 5 angina pectoris. In diabetes the compounds are useful to 1 enhance cell function in the islets of Langerhans e.g. increase insulin secretion 2 reduce the rate of islet cell damage 3 increase insulin receptor levels or activity to increase cell sensitivity to insulin and or 4 modulate glucocorticoid receptor activity to decrease insulin resistance in cells that are insulin resistant. The compounds are thus useful to treat prevent ameliorate or slow the progression of a metabolic or cardiovascular condition such as diabetes or hyperglycemia or a related symptom or condition such as a dyslipidemia in a subject such as a human or a mammal.

Beneficial effects that can the F1Cs can exert on such related symptoms or conditions include improved glucose tolerance improved glucose utilization decreased severity or slowed progression of vascular disease e.g. microvascular or macrovascular disease including nephropathy neuropathy retinopathy hypertension cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease or a decreased severity or slowed progression of atherosclerosis an arteriosclerosis condition e.g. coronary arteriosclerosis hyperplastic arteriosclerosis peripheral arteriosclerosis or hypertensive arteriosclerosis decreased severity or slowed progression of diabetic osteoarthropathy skin lesions rhabdomyolysis ketosis detectably decreased generation of islet cell autoantibodies decreased levels or activity of inflammatory macrophages foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques or detectably decreased expression or levels of one or more of human or mammalian angiopoietin like 3 gene product apolipoprotein C 1 inducible or constitutive nitric oxide synthase e.g. in endothelial cells macrophages or the like pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 carboxyl ester lipase cholesteryl ester transfer protein endothelial lipase vascular wall lipoprotein lipase anti lipoprotein lipase autoantibodies triglyceride rich lipoproteins LDL cholesterol C reactive protein high sensitivity C reactive protein fibrinogen plasma homocysteine VCAM 1 IL 1 e.g. IL 1 IL 6 a TNF e.g. TNF AP 1 NF B and IFN . In these any of these diseases or conditions the F1Cs can also modulate e.g. detectably increase the activity or level of one two or more of human or mammalian LOX 1 apolipoprotein A 1 apolipoprotein A 2 LPDL lipase hormone sensitive lipase paraoxonase brain natriuretic peptide a brain natriuretic peptide receptor e.g. Npr1 or Npr3 hepatic lipase LDL receptor HDL apoliporpotein E HDL apoliporpotein J HDL cholesterol VLDL receptor ATP binding casette transporter 1 leukemia inhibitory factor CD36 LXR LXR CAR RXR PPAR PPAR PPAR or a lipoprotein lipase e.g. marophage lipoprotein lipase. As used herein obesity includes a human with a body mass index of at least about 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 or greater. Obese humans that are treated with a F1C may have one or more of the conditions described here.

The F1Cs are useful in treating insulin resistance and associated symptoms and conditions. Insulin resistance is typically observed as a diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. This leads to less than the expected biologic effect for a given level of insulin. Insulin resistant subjects or human have a diminished ability to properly metabolize glucose or fatty acids and respond poorly if at all to insulin therapy. Manifestations of insulin resistance include insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in liver. Insulin resistance can cause or contribute to polycystic ovarian syndrome impaired glucose tolerance gestational diabetes hypertension obesity atherosclerosis and a variety of other disorders. Insulin resistant individuals can progress to a diabetic state. The compounds can also be used in the treatment or amelioration of one or more condition associated with insulin resistance or glucose intolerance including an increase in plasma triglycerides and a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol high blood pressure hyperuricemia smaller denser low density lipoprotein particles and higher circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. Such diseases and symptoms have been described see e.g. G. M. Reaven 1998 9 387 406 G. M. Reaven 1995 75 473 486 and J. Flier 1983 34 145 60.

The compounds can thus be used in diabetes obesity hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia conditions to reduce body fat mass increase muscle mass or to lower one or more of serum or blood low density lipoprotein triglyceride cholesterol apolipoprotein B free fatty acid or very low density lipoprotein compared to a subject that would otherwise be considered normal for one or more of these characteristics. These beneficial effects are typically obtained with little or no effect on serum or blood high density lipoprotein levels. The F1Cs are useful to reduce or slow the rate of myocardial tissue or myocyte damage e.g. fibrosis or to enhance cardiac fatty acid metabolism in conditions such as inflammation where fatty acid metabolism is depressed or decreased. Elevated cholesterol levels are often associated with a number of other disease states including coronary artery disease angina pectoris carotid artery disease strokes cerebral arteriosclerosis and xanthoma which the F1Cs can ameliorate or slow the progression or severity of. Abnormal lipid and cholesterol conditions that can be treated include exogenous hypertriglyceridemia familial hypercholesterolemia polygenic hypercholesterolemia biliary cirrhosis familial combined hyperlipidemia dysbetalipoproteinemia endogenous hypertriglyceridemia mixed hypertriglyceridemia and hyperlipidemia or hypertriglycidemia secondary to alcohol consumption diabetic lipemia nephrosis or drug treatments e.g. corticosteroid estrogen colestipol cholestyramine or retinoid treatments. Dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols for the F1Cs are essentially as described herein. Where the condition is chronic the F1Cs will generally be administered to a subject such as a human for a relatively long time period e.g. for about 3 months to about 10 years or more. Dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols for the F1Cs are essentially as described herein. Dosing of the compound can be daily or intermittent using a dosing protocol using dosages as described herein e.g. about 0.01 to about 20 mg kg of a F1C administered to a subject once or twice per day daily or intermittently. The use of the F1Cs can be combined with one two or more other suitable treatments e.g. treatment for cessation of smoking diet control e.g. caloric restriction or reduced fat intake or treatment with fibrates non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as aspirin clofibrate fenofibrate ciprofibrate gemfibrozil Simvastatin Pravastatin Mevastatin or Lovastatin .

The use of any F1C or species in any genus of F1Cs disclosed herein to treat prevent or ameliorate any of these cardiovascular or metabolic disorders or symptoms will generally use one or more of the routes of administration dosages and dosing protocols as disclosed herein. Thus in exemplary embodiments about 0.5 to about 100 mg kg or about 1 to about 25 mg kg of the F1C will be administered per day by an oral buccal sublingual or parenteral route. Such administration can be e.g. daily for about 5 to about 60 days in acute conditions or it can be intermittent for about 3 months to about 2 years or more for chronic conditions. Alternatively intermittent dosing can be used essentially as described herein for acute cardiovascular conditions. In some embodiments for conditions such as ischemia or trauma administration of the F1C is provided before or as soon after the ischemic or traumatic event as possible e.g. within about 6 hours of an ischemic or traumatic event or about 12 24 hours before an anticipated ischemic or traumatic event. In other embodiments administration of the F1C can be delayed for e.g. about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 21 24 28 32 36 40 48 or more hours after an ischemic or traumatic event has occurred and a course of daily or intermittent dosing is initiated at one of these times or in a range between any of these times after the event. Thus administration of the F1C can begin at about 10 14 hours at about 11 13 hours or at about 8 16 hours after the ischemic or traumatic event.

In another aspect of the invention the F1Cs can be used to prevent treat or to reduce the severity of vascular or microvascular occlusions in human sickle cell diseases SCD . SCD is heterogenous and includes subgroups with high transcranial velocities which is a group with an increased risk of infarctive stroke or cerebral thrombosis. SCD types also include sickle cell thalassemia sickle cell thalassemia sickle cell thalassemia and sickle cell HPFH hereditary of persistent fetal hemoglobin . Another subgroup of SCD patients is characterized by the presence of a parasite infection. SCD is usually accompanied by acute vaso occlusive episodes such as microvascular occlusions ischemia and infarctions that arise from adhesion of sickle cells and other blood cell types e.g. platelets or leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells. Reduced sickle cell adhesion in response to treatment with a F1C and related responses is facilitated at least in part by decreased production or activity of one or more biological response mediators such as one two three or more of thrombospondin von Willebrand factor epinephrine C reactive protein cAMP basal cell adhesion molecule Lutheran BCAM Lu P selectin L selectin E selectin VCAM 1 ICAM 1 fibronectin annexin V placenta growth factor superoxide CD11a CD11b CD11c CD15 CD18 CD31 CD36 TNF NF B IL 1 or IL 6 by endothelial cells or one or more immune cell types as described herein. In treating sickle cell disease the F1Cs will also increase the activity or levels of one two or more desired response mediators including fetal hemoglobin erythropoietin heme oxygenase nitric oxide PPAR PPAR or GM CSF. The F1Cs will thus ameliorate one or more symptoms of sickle cell disease such as anemia stroke pain e.g. chest or abdominal pain skin ulcers dyspnea organ damage retinopathy or the level of infected red cells in infected subjects. Treatment of acute SCD episodes or of chronic SCD with F1Cs can be combined with other suitable therapies e.g. inhaled nitric oxide hydroxyurea treatment anti adhesion molecule antibody treatment or analgesic use such as morphine oxycodone or codeine. The F1Cs can also be used to reduce cellular damage from reactive oxygen species associated with hydroxyurea treatment since the F1Cs will enhance cellular antioxidant capacity.

As is apparent from the foregoing the use of the F1C is optionally combined with one or more additional therapies for cardiovascular or related disorders e.g. insulin therapy vascular surgery cardiac surgery angioplasty or treatment with andrenergic blockers coronary vasodilators calcium channel blockers nitrates angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors anti hypertensives anti inflammatory agents diuretics anti arrhythmia agents thrombolytic agents enzyme inhibitors such as hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors or xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Exemplary hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors include statins such as mevastatin lovastatin pravastatin simvastatin or compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 346 227 4 448 979 4 739 073 5 169 857 5 006 530 or 5 401 746. Other therapies that can be applied include diet control dietary calorie restriction or diet modification for subjects who are or who are susceptible to developing a cardiovascular or related condition such as pulmonary hypertension diabetes a dyslipidemia or obesity e.g. humans having a body mass index of 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 or greater. Diet modifications include limiting or restricting salt alcohol caffeine cigarette drugs e.g. opiate hallucinogen sedative narcotic or amphetamine sugar refined sugar and or fat or cholesterol intake use or abuse. Additional therapies include treatment with one or more of digoxin nitroglycerin doxazosin mesylate nifedipine enalapril maleate indomethicin tissue plasminogin activator urokinase acetylsalicylic acid or the like. Any of such additional therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and such therapies would precede be concurrent with or follow treatment with a F1C. In some embodiments such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a F1C is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the F1C is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail see e.g. 54edition 2000 pages 303 3251 ISBN 1 56363 330 2 Medical Economics Co. Inc. Montvale N.J. 15edition 2001 E. Braunwald et al. editors McGraw Hill New York N.Y. ISBN 0 07 007272 8 especially chapters 231 241 248 and 258 265 at pages 1309 1318 1377 1442 and 1491 1526. One or more of these exemplary agents or treatments can be used in combination with a F1C to treat any of the appropriate cardiovascular and related disorders described herein and in the references cited herein.

F1Cs can be used to treat ameliorate prevent or slow the progression of a number of pulmonary conditions or their symptoms such as 1 2 3 or more of cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis cor pulmonale pneumonia lung abcess acute bronchitis chronic bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases emphysema pneumonitis e.g. hypersensitivity pneumonitis or pneumonitis associated with radiation exposure alveolar lung diseases and interstitial lung diseases e.g. associated with asbestos fumes or gas exposure aspiration pneumonia pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes amyloidosis connective tissue diseases systemic sclerosis ankylosing spondylitis allergic granulomatosis granulomatous vasculitides asthma e.g. acute asthma chronic asthma atopic asthma allergic asthma or idiosyncratic asthma cystic fibrosis and associated conditions e.g. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis chronic sinusitis pancreatic insufficiency inflammation or or infection. In some of these conditions where inflammation plays a role in the pathology of the condition the F1Cs can ameliorate or slow the progression of the condition by reducing damage from inflammation. In other cases the F1Cs act to limit pathogen replication or pathogen associated lung tissue damage.

For these conditions the severity of the disease or the type or severity of associated symptoms can vary. For example in humans having pediatric e.g. infants or children of about 1 month or about 4 months of age to about 16 or 17 years of age or adult cystic fibrosis CF the disease may be associated with the presence of one or more symptoms syndromes genetic mutations or the like. Symptoms or syndromes that can be observed in human CF patients include 1 2 3 4 or more of e.g. or respiratory tract or lung infection or propensity to develop detectable infection or colonization coughing wheezing cyanosis bronchiolitis bronchospasm pneumothorax hemoptysis pancreatic exocrine insufficiency bronchiectatic lung disease atelectasis consolidation pulmonary edema increased lung vascular hydrostatic pressure increased lung vascular permeability sinusitis respiratory insufficiency bronchial wall or interlobular septa thickening reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 second dyspnea impaired male fertility elevated sweat chloride e.g. 60 mmol L mucous plugging tree in bud sign mosaic perfusion pattern glucose intolerance or abnormal elevation of one or more of IL 4 IL 8 RANTES neutrophil elastase eosinophils macrophages neutrophils eosinophil cationic protein or cysteinyl leukotrienes. Any of these symptoms or syndromes can be acute intermittent or chronic and or mild moderate or severe. Relevant mutations include e.g. a homozygous or heterozygous dominant or recessive deletion insertion and or point mutation in 1 the cationic trypsinogen gene or 2 the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR gene such as one two or more of a CFTR F508del deletion mutation or CFTR lacking phe508 3272 26A G F508del 3659delC 394delTT S1455X or 26 I1234V 2183AA G 2043delG 548A T I148T R334W S1196X 4041C G 1161delC 1756G T or 3120 1G A mutation.

The use of a F1C to treat ameliorate or slow the progression of conditions such as CF can be optionally combined with other suitable treatments. For CF this includes e.g. one two or more of oral or aerosol corticosteroid treatment ibuprofen treatment DNAse or IL 10 treatment diet control e.g. vitamin E supplementation vaccination against pathogens e.g. or chest physical therapy e.g. chest drainage or percussion.

Humans or other subjects who have one or more of these conditions can be treated with other suitable therapeutics. Pulmonary conditions that can be treated with the F1Cs and other therapeutic methods and agents that can be used in conjunction with the F1Cs have been described in detail see e.g. 15edition 2001 E. Braunwald et al. editors McGraw Hill New York N.Y. ISBN 0 07 007272 8 especially chapters 252 265 at pages 1456 1526 54edition 2000 pages 303 3251 ISBN 1 56363 330 2 Medical Economics Co. Inc. Montvale N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents or treatments can be used in combination with a F1C to treat any of the appropriate cardiovascular and related disorders described herein and in the references cited herein. Treatment of any of these respiratory and pulmonary conditions using a F1C is accomplished using the treatment regimens described herein. For chronic conditions intermittent dosing of the F1C can be used to reduce the frequency of treatment. Intermittent dosing protocols are as described herein.

As mentioned above the F1Cs may be used to treat prevent or slow the progression of one or more autoimmune allergic or inflammatory diseases disorders or conditions or to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof in a subject. These diseases and conditions include Addison s Disease autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss antiphospholipid syndrome acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis and other synovial disorders an osteoarthritis including post traumatic osteoarthritis and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy psoriatic arthritis polyarthritis epichondylitis type I diabetes type II diabetes rheumatic carditis bursitis ankylosing spondylitis multiple sclerosis a dermatitis such as contact dermatitis atopic dermatitis exfoliative dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis mycosis fungoides allergic encephalomyelitis autoimmune glomerulonephritis Goodpasture s Syndrome Graves Disease Hashimoto s Thyroiditis multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis neuritis bullous pemphigoid pemphigus polyendocrinopathies purpura Reiter s Disease autoimmune thyroiditis systemic lupus erythematosus scleroderma fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome autoimmune pulmonary inflammation Guillain Barre Syndrome type 1 or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus autoimmune inflammatory eye disease hepatitis C virus associated autoimmunity postinfectious autoimmunity associated with e.g. virus or bacterial infection such as a parvovirus such as human parvovirus B19 or with rubella virus autoimmune skin and muscle conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris pemphigus foliaceus systemic dermatomyositis or polymyositis or another inflammatory myopathy myocarditis asthma such as allergic asthma allergic encephalomyelitis allergic rhinitis a vasculitis condition such as polyarteritis nodosa giant cell arteritis or systemic necrotizing vasculitis chronic and an acute or chronic inflammation condition such as chronic prostatitis granulomatous prostatitis and malacoplakia ischemia reperfusion injury endotoxin exposure complement mediated hyperacute rejection nephritis cytokine or chemokine induced lung injury cachexia sarcoidosis inflammatory bowel disease regional enteritis ulcerative colitis Crohn s disease inflammatory bowel disease or inflammation associated with an infection e.g. septic shock sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Any of these diseases or conditions or their symptoms may be acute chronic mild moderate severe stable or progressing before during or after the time administration of the F1C to a subject such as a human is initiated. In general a detectable improvement is observed in the subject within a period of about 3 days to about 12 months after initiation of a dosing protocol e.g. the severity of the disease or condition will detectably decrease the rate of progression will detectably slow or the severity of a symptom s will detectably decrease.

As used herein acute inflammation conditions are characterized as an inflammation that typically has a fairly rapid onset quickly becomes moderate or severe and usually lasts for only a few days or for a few weeks. Chronic inflammation conditions as used herein are characterized as an inflammation that may begin with a relatively rapid onset or in a slow or even unnoticed manner tends to persist for at least several weeks e.g. about 3 6 weeks months or years and may have a vague or indefinite termination. Chronic inflammation may result when the injuring agent or products resulting from its presence persists in the lesion and the subject s tissues respond in a manner or to a degree that is not sufficient to overcome completely the continuing effects of the injuring agent. Other exemplary conditions are described in e.g. R. G. Lahita editor Lippincott Williams Wikins Philadelphia Pa. 2000 ISBN 0 7817 1505 9 pages 175 851 and 2edition J. H. Klippel et al. editors 1998 ISBN 0 7234 2405 5 volume 1 sections 1 5 and volume 2 sections 6 8 Mosby International London UK.

A F1C can be used to inhibit or ameliorate one or more inappropriate immune responses or their symptoms in autoimmunity inflammation allergy or related conditions. The effects of the F1Cs include detectably ameliorating one or more of 1 the proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells 2 reducing unwanted cytotoxic T cell responses 3 reducing unwanted autoantibody or other antibody synthesis e.g. an unwanted IgA IgE IgG or IgM in allergy asthma or another autoimmune or inflammation condition 4 inhibiting the development proliferation or unwanted activity of autoreactive T or B cells 5 altering the expression of one or more cytokines interleukins or cell surface antigens e.g. a cytokine interleukin or cell surface antigen described herein decreasing IL 8 in an autoimmune condition decreasing the level of acute phase proteins such as C reactive protein or fibrinogen in inflammation conditions 6 decreasing eosinophilia in allergy conditions 7 detectably decreasing the level or activity of one or more of ICAM 1 IL 1 IL 1 TNF IL 6 or IL 8 in e.g. inflammation conditions or in autoimmune conditions such as an arthritis or a myocarditis condition such as osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis toxic myocarditis indurative myocarditis or idiopathic myocarditis 8 decreasing the level or biological activity of one or more of anti islet antibody TNF IFN IL 1 an arthritis symptom s nephritis skin rash photosensitivity headache frequency or pain migraine frequency or pain abdominal pain nausea or anti DNA antibodies in e.g. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or an autoimmune or inflammation condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn s disease 9 reducing induction of arachidonic acid metabolism or reducing eicosanoid metabolites such as thromboxanes or prostaglandins in e.g. inflammation asthma or allergy 10 reducing IL 4 IL 8 or IL 10 synthesis levels or activity in e.g. allergy or inflammation such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or allergic asthma or 11 reducing or interfering with neutrophil chemotaxis by e.g. reducing thioredoxin release from affected cells in conditions such as cancer infections inflammation or autoimmunity.

Exemplary symptoms that the use of the F1Cs can ameliorate in these autoimmune inflammatory and allergy conditions include one or more of pain such as shoulder hip joint abdominal or spine pain joint stiffness or gelling bursitis tendonitis edema or swelling fatigue or malaise headache dyspnea skin rash fever night sweats anorexia weight loss skin or intestine ulceration muscle weakness pericarditis coronary occlusion neuropathy and diarrhea. In treating one of these conditions in a subject or in improving one or more symptoms thereof the F1Cs may accomplish one or more of decreasing levels of one or more of IL 1 IL 4 IL 6 or TNF decreasing levels of C reactive protein fibrinogen or creatinine kinase. Other biological effects associated with treatment using a F1C may also be monitored or observed e.g. an increase or decrease of a cell surface antigen a cytokine or an interleukin as disclosed herein.

In another aspect of the invention the F1Cs can be used to treat or to reduce the severity of chronic allergies or atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis psoriasis eczema gastrointestinal allergies atopic dermatitis conditions allergic asthma food allergies and hay fever. These conditions are typically characterized by the presence of elevated levels of allergen specific antibodies of the IgE isotype. In treating or ameliorating these conditions the F1Cs reduce the generation of IgE by isotype switching which is increasing allergen specific IgA production and or decreasing IgE production from preexisting allergen primed cells. Allergen specific IgG may also be increased from new cells that might otherwise have responded to allergen exposure by generating unwanted IgE.

The IgA and IgG are allergen specific which will enhance clearance of allergen from mucosa or other tissue and reduction of chronic or late phase allergic responses. The F1C can thus also be used to increase the biological clearance of allergens from tissue and mucosa. Reduced generation of the levels or activity of IgE by B cells in response to treatment with a F1C and related responses is facilitated at least in part by decreased production of one or more biological response mediators e.g. cytokines or response mediators such as protein kinase A inhibitors substance P neuropeptide thymus and activation regulated chemokine e.g. by airway smooth muscle cells proteinase activated receptor 2 by neurons intracellular signal transducing protein 6 STAT6 Janus kinase 1 Janus kinase 6 CD40 CD86 and or NF kB by B cells CD154 in T cells and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 phosphodiesterase 4 TNF MCP 1 RANTES CXCL10 CXCL8 IL 8 prostaglandin E2 receptor IL 1 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 9 IL 10 IL 13 and IL 23 by one or more other cell types such as immune cells as described herein airway smooth muscle cells mucosal cells or keratinocytes. In these treatments the F1Cs will also increase the activity or levels of one or more desired response mediators including soluble CD23 cathepsin E epidermal growth factor receptor IFN IL 2 IL 12 or IL 18. In treating these conditions Treatment can be combined with other suitable therapies e.g. corticosteroids such as fluticasone propionate. The F1Cs can also be used to reduce rebound phenomena following withdrawal of corticosteroid therapies since the F1Cs have an anti inflammatory effect without having immunosuppressive side effects. Use of the F1Cs to generate any of these biological responses or treatments can be by daily or intermittent administration of the F1C to the subject.

In a related embodiment the F1Cs are used in allergen vaccination protocols to enhance levels or activity of allergen specific IgA or IgG which contributes to reducing IgE responses to allergen exposure. Such protocols are used to decrease a subject s sensitivity to allergen exposure. Typically such allergies are chronic or atopic. In these applications the vaccination protocol typically uses the allergen s or an active fragment s of the allergen that is associated with the allergy or atopic condition. In these methods a F1C is administered to a subject who has an IgE mediated allergy or atopy condition in conjunction with administration of the allergen. Allergens typically used include dermatophagoides house dust cat allergen and pollen. In any of these methods isotype switching or vaccination methods the F1C is typically administered as described herein e.g. by administering the F1C about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or more days before the allergen is administered to the subject. The subject may receive about 1 20 mg kg of a F1C at 2 3 and 4 days before the allergen is administered or injected. The F1C treatment increases allergen specific IgA or IgG responses or levels relative to untreated controls. The use of F1C with allergens will reduce the total number of anti allergic vaccinations that are needed increase the quality or length of an effective response and or increase the proportion of subjects in which allergy shots are effective. An effective response is seen in about 55 60 65 70 75 80 or more of vaccinated patients who also receive the F1C compared to about 40 50 of vaccinated patients who do not receive the F1C.

In treating inflammation or any condition described herein where inflammation contributes to the condition the F1Cs may detectably modulate e.g. decrease or increase the expression or level or activity of one or more biomolecules associated with the prevention establishment maintenance or progression of the inflammation condition. Such biomolecules include one or more of carcinoembryonic antigen prostate specific antigen her2 neu Bcl XL bcl 2 p53 IL 1 IL 1 IL 6 or TNF GATA 3 COX 2 NF B IkB an IkB kinase e.g. IkB kinase IkB kinase or IkB kinase NFAT a ras protein such as H ras or K ras cyclin D cyclin E xanthine oxidase or their isoforms orthologs homologs or mutant forms which may have either reduced or enhanced biological activity ies and which may be detectably decreased. Biomolecules that can be detectably increased include IL 2 IFN IL 12 T bet 06 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase calcineurin calmodulin a superoxide dismutase e.g. Mn Zn or Cu a tumor suppressor protein such as the retinoblastoma protein Rb or CDKN2A p16 BRCA1 BRCA2 MeCP2 MBD2 PTEN NBR1 NBR2 or the isoforms orthologs homologs or mutant forms which may have either attenuated or enhanced biological activity ies of any of these molecules. One or more of these biomolecules may be modulated in any inflammation condition described herein.

The use of any F1C or species in any genus of F1Cs disclosed herein to treat prevent or ameliorate any of these autoimmune inflammatory or allergy conditions or symptoms will generally use one or more of the routes of administration dosages and dosing protocols as disclosed herein. Thus in exemplary embodiments about 0.5 to about 100 mg kg or about 1 mg kg to about 15 mg kg of the F1C will be administered per day by e.g. an oral buccal sublingual topical or parenteral route. Such administration can be e.g. daily for about 5 to about 60 days in acute conditions or it can be intermittent for about 3 months to about 2 years or more for chronic conditions. Alternatively intermittent dosing can be used essentially as described herein for acute autoimmune inflammatory and allergy conditions.

In another aspect of the invention the F1Cs can be used to treat or to reduce the severity of chronic allergies or atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis psoriasis eczema gastrointestinal allergies atopic dermatitis conditions allergic asthma food allergies and hay fever. These conditions are typically characterized by the presence of elevated levels of the IgE isotype and of B cells that generate IgE. In treating or ameliorating these conditions the F1Cs reduce the generation of IgE by facilitating an isotype switch from B cells that produce IgE to cells that produce antigen specific IgA and or IgG4. The IgA and IgG4 are allergen specific which will facilitate clearance of allergen from mucosa or other tissue and reduction of chronic or late phase allergic responses. The F1c can thus be used to increase the biological clearance of allergens from tissue. Reduced generation of the levels or activity of IgE by B cells in response to treatment with a F1C and related responses is facilitated at least in part by decreased production of one or more biological response mediators e.g. cytokines or response mediators such as protein kinase A inhibitors substance P neuropeptide thymus and activation regulated chemokine e.g. by airway smooth muscle cells proteinase activated receptor 2 by neurons intracellular signal transducing protein 6 STAT6 Janus kinase 1 Janus kinase 6 CD40 CD86 and or NF B by B cells CD154 in T cells and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 phosphodiesterase 4 TNF MCP 1 RANTES CXCL10 CXCL8 IL 8 prostaglandin Ereceptor IL 1 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 10 IL 13 and IL 18 by one or more other cell types such as immune cells as described herein airway smooth muscle cells mucosal cells or keratinocytes. In these treatments the F1Cs will also increase the activity or levels of one or more desired response mediators including cathepsin E epidermal growth factor receptor IFN IL 2 IL 12. In treating these conditions Treatment can be combined with other suitable therapies e.g. corticosteroids such as fluticasone propionate. The F1Cs can also be used to reduce rebound phenomena following withdrawal of corticosteroid therapies since the F1Cs have an anti inflammatory effect without having immunosuppressive side effects. Use of the F1Cs to effect any of these biological responses or treatments can be by daily or intermittent administration of the F1C to the subject.

In a related embodiment the F1Cs are used to enhance isotype switching from IgE to IgG in these chronic allergies or atopic diseases in vaccination protocols that use the allergen s or an active fragment s of the allergen that is associated with the allergy or atopic condition. In these methods a F1C is administered to a subject who has an elevated IgE allergy or atopy condition in conjunction with administration of the allergen. The subject s response to the allergen is an enhanced proportion of B cells that produce IgG compared to B cells that generate IgE. Allergens typically used include dermatophagoides house dust cat allergen and pollen. In these methods the F1C is typically administered about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or more days before the allergen is administered to the subject e.g. the subject receives about 1 20 mg kg of a F1C at 2 3 and 4 days before the allergen is administered or injected. The F1C facilitates isotype switching to IgG. The use of F1C with allergens will reduce the total number of anti allergic vaccinations that are needed increase the quality or length of an effective response and or increase the proportion of subjects in which allergy shots are effective e.g. an effective response is seen in about 55 60 65 70 75 80 or more of vaccinated patients who also receive the F1C compared to about 40 50 of vaccinated patients who do not receive the F1C.

The F1Cs are suitable for enhancing immune responses in aging in subjects such as humans or primates. In humans at about 50 to 60 years of age and later one or more aspects of immune responses will typically decrease by a detectable amount compared to typical immune responses at younger ages e.g. at about 18 50 years of age. The F1Cs can be used on an intermittent basis or continuously in aged subjects. Intermittent administration of a F1C can occur as described herein e.g. daily dosing or dosing every other day or every third day for about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 9 days followed by about 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 weeks of no dosing optionally followed by about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 days of daily dosing or dosing every other day or every third day and then followed by about 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 weeks of no dosing. Such dosing cycles can be repeated indefinitely or as needed. Such treatments can be used prophylactically or therapeutically. In prophylaxis the F1C are administered e.g. before or during influenza outbreaks or in aged patients in hospitals or in aged patients in long term living or care facilities such as retirement communities or nursing homes. In therapeutic applications the F1C are used to treat trauma e.g. bone fractures or active infections. The F1C treatments in these embodiments will result in enhanced immune responses including increased innate and specific responses to e.g. infectious agents. These treatments will typically also have other beneficial effects including enhancing bone marrow production of blood cells or blood components such as neutrophils or improving levels of dysregulated immune response mediators e.g. decreasing elevated cortisol IL 6 IL 10 COX 2 or C reactive protein levels or increasing low IL 2 or IL 12 levels.

In related embodiments the use of the F1C is optionally combined with one or more additional known or experimental therapies for an autoimmune inflammatory or allergy disorder s e.g. one or more of surgery and treatment with a corticosteroid or glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone hydrocortisone acetate fludrocortisone prednisone prednisolone prednisolone acetate methylprednisolone dexamethasone dexamethasone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide leflunomide an antibody e.g. a human or humanized monoclonal antibody that decreases the activity or level of C5 complement TNF or TNF receptor an antirheumatic drug such as methorexate D penicillamine sodium aurothiomalate sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine immunosuppressive agents such as 6 thioguanylic acid chlorambucil cyclophosphamide or cyclosporin a non steroidal antiinflammatory agent such as celecoxib ibuprofin piroxicam or naproxin an antihistamine such as loratidine or promethazine hydrochloride an analgesic such as propoxyphene napsylate acetaminophen or codeine or administration of vitamins e.g. multivitamins individual vitamins antioxidants or other agents e.g. vitamin E folinic acid carnitine a C2 8 alkanoyl carnitine such as acetyl or propionyl L carnitine or nutritional supplements e.g. liquid protein or carbohydrate preparations . Such therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and such they would precede be concurrent with or follow treatment with a F1C. In some embodiments such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a F1C is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the F1C is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail see e.g. 54edition 2000 pages 303 3267 ISBN 1 56363 330 2 Medical Economics Co. Inc. Montvale N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents can be used in combination with a F1C to ameliorate prevent or treat any of the appropriate autoimmune inflammatory or allergy conditions or disorders described herein or any of their symptoms.

Where a natural or synthetic antiinflammatory glucocorticoid is used to treat one more of the conditions disclosed herein or wherein endogenous levels of glucocorticoid such as cortisol are elevated to an unwanted level in a subject the use of a F1C will ameliorate unwanted side effects of such glucocorticoid use or excess. Typically the F1C will be administered during before and or after glucocorticoid levels are elevated or during before and or after a therapeutic glucocorticoid is administered to the subject e.g. within about 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 7 days or within about 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 16 20 or 24 weeks before or after glucocorticoid use or elevated glucocorticoid levels exist. Typically the use of the F1C to counteract unwanted side effects of therapeutic glucocorticoid use In these embodiments will reduce or ameliorate the onset severity or progression of one or more unwanted side effects of glucocorticoid therapy such as a detectable immune suppression an increased occurrence or incidence of infection an undesirable alteration of mood e.g. increased anxiety depression or schizophrenia or a detectable loss or alteration of memory.

Nervous system diseases disorders conditions or their symptoms collectively neurological conditions that can be ameliorated treated or prevented with any of the F1Cs disclosed herein include but are not limited to nervous system trauma or injury and neurological conditions that result in an unwanted pathology or symptom e.g. demyelination pain impairment of cognitive function discernable memory loss depression anxiety a disconnection of axons a diminution of neuron astrocyte or glia function or degeneration or death of nervous system cells or tissues such as one or more of those described herein.

Neurological conditions including nervous system lesions that may be treated prevented or ameliorated in a subject include but are not limited to the following lesions of either the central including spinal cord brain or peripheral nervous systems. Exemplary neurological conditions include 1 ischemic lesions in which a lack of oxygen in a portion of the nervous system results in neuronal injury or death including cerebral infarction ischemia or stroke or spinal cord infarction or ischemia 2 traumatic lesions including lesions caused by physical injury or associated with surgery for example lesions which sever a portion of the nervous system or compression injuries 3 malignant lesions in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured by malignant tissue which is either a nervous system associated malignancy or a malignancy derived from non nervous system tissue 4 infectious lesions in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured as a result of infection for example by an abscess or associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus herpes zoster or herpes simplex virus or with Lyme disease tuberculosis or syphilis 5 degenerative lesions or conditions in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured as a result of a degenerative process including but not limited to degeneration associated with Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease Huntington s chorea AIDS associated dementia eplieptic dementia presenile dementia senile dementia vascular dementia post stroke dementia post traumatic dementia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS 6 lesions associated with nutritional diseases disorders and or conditions in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured by a nutritional disorder or disorder of metabolism including but not limited to vitamin B12 deficiency folic acid deficiency Wernicke disease tobacco alcohol amblyopia Marchiafava Bignami disease primary degeneration of the corpus callosum and alcoholic cerebellar degeneration 7 neurological lesions associated with systemic diseases including but not limited to diabetes diabetic neuropathy Bell s palsy systemic lupus erythematosus carcinoma or sarcoidosis 8 lesions caused by toxic substances including alcohol lead or neurotoxins 9 demyelinated lesions in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured by a demyelinating disease including but not limited to multiple sclerosis human immunodeficiency virus associated myelopathy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and central pontine myelinolysis or a myelopathy e.g. diabetic meylopathy or a transverse myelopathy 10 neurological conditions such as insomnia e.g. transient or chronic epilepsy schizophrenia psychosis delusion a unipolar mood disorder a bipolar mood disorder psychomotor dysfunction depression anxiety addiction to or abuse of a drug substance such as tobacco nicotine caffeine alcohol a barbiturate a tranquilizer a narcotic such as hydromorphone HCl propoxyphene napsylate meperidine HCl valium codeine cocaine morphine heroin or methadone 11 cognitive dysfunction conditions or diseases such as one or more of impaired long term or short term memory impaired concentration impaired attention or impaired learning where the cognitive dysfunction condition or disease is optionally associated with chemotherapy radiation therapy or exposure aging trauma e.g. CNS trauma or neurodegeneration and 12 genetic disorders with a neurological pathology or component such as Down s syndrome or Tay Sach s disease.

The F1Cs are useful to ameliorate treat or prevent the onset severity or length of other neurological diseases or conditions such as headache or a migraine condition or symptom such as classic migraine cluster headache abdominal migraine common migraine hemiplegic migraine ocular migraine fulminating migraine complicated migraine or a symptom of any of these such as head pain vertigo nausea vomiting or photophobia.

In some embodiments the F1C is used to protect neural cells from the damaging effects of cerebral hypoxia cerebral ischemia or neural cell injury associated with cerebral infarction heart attack stroke or elevated levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. The compounds that are also useful for treating or preventing a nervous system disorder may be selected e.g. by assaying their biological activity in promoting the survival or differentiation of neurons. For example and not by way of limitation the F1Cs can be used to elicit any of the following useful effects 1 increased survival time of neurons in culture 2 increased sprouting of neurons in culture or in vivo 3 increased production of a neuron associated molecule in culture or in vivo e.g. dopamine or choline acetyltransferase or acetylcholinesterase with respect to motor neurons or 4 decreased symptoms of neuron dysfunction in vivo. Such effects may be measured by any method known in the art. Increased survival of neurons may be measured using known methods such as for example the method set forth in Arakawa et al. 10 3507 3515 1990 increased sprouting of neurons may be detected by methods known in the art such as the methods set forth in Pestronk et al. 70 65 82 1980 or Brown et al. 4 17 42 1981 . Increased production of neuron associated molecules may be measured by e.g. bioassay enzymatic assay antibody binding or Northern blot assay using techniques known in the art and depending on the molecule to be measured. Motor neuron dysfunction may be measured by assessing the physical manifestation of motor neuron disorder e.g. weakness motor neuron conduction velocity or functional disability. Motor neuron conditions may arise from infarction cancer infection exposure to toxin trauma surgical damage or a degenerative disease that affects motor neurons as well as other components of the nervous system.

Other neurological conditions that can be treated using F1Cs include conditions that selectively affect neurons or adjacent tissues such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progressive spinal muscular atrophy progressive bulbar palsy primary lateral sclerosis infantile and juvenile muscular atrophy poliomyelitis and the post polio syndrome hereditary motorsensory neuropathy spinal cord compression and a myelitis such as necrotizing myelitis transverse myelitis ascending myelitis bulbar myelitis concussion myelitis demyelinated myelitis postinfectious myelitis systemic myelitis or transverse myelitis.

In some neurological conditions such as mood changes depression anxiety memory loss or motor function impairment the F1Cs can modulate one or more biological activities of a transcription factor or a nuclear hormone receptor such as ER in tissue such as the hypothalamus or amygdala or ER in tissue such as the hippocampus thalamus or entorhinal cortex.

In neurological conditions or other conditions where loss or damage to nervous system cells or tissue is typically present e.g. multiple sclerosis cerebral infarction cerebral trauma elevated glucocorticoid levels or Alzheimer s disease use of the F1Cs can lead to detectable repair of damaged cells or replacement of at least some killed cells. Elevated glucocorticoids can result from endogenous production of natural glucocorticoids e.g. cortisol or hydrocortisone or from administration of synthetic glucocorticoids e.g. dexamethasone triamcinolone betamethasone or other synthetic agents disclosed herein or in the cited references. Repair or replacement can occur for cell types that are present in nervous system tissues e.g. neurons Schwann cells glial cells astrocytes oligodendrocytes macroglia cells endothelial cells or stem or progenitor cells of any of these cell types. The cells may reside in discrete regions of nervous organs e.g. hippocampus cerebrum or cerebellum or they may reside in multiple regions. Any of the neurological conditions that can be treated with the F1Cs may be acute subacute or chronic and they may be subclinical having few or no overt symptoms mild moderate or severe.

In treating neurological conditions the F1Cs will generally enhance function self renewal and or differentiation of stem or progenitor cells and or they will reduce the severity of cell damage or impairment compared to similar subjects that are not treated with the F1Cs. In cases where myelin damage or nerve death occurs the F1Cs can reduce the rate at which damage or death occurs or they can detectably reverse damage or enhance replacement of killed cells particularly where the extent of such damage or killing is mild or moderate. Without wishing to be bound to any theory the F1Cs may exert these properties 1 by directly acting as a hormone growth factor or modulator of a biomolecule disclosed herein such as an enzyme a glucocorticoid receptor PPAR a neural stem cell helix loop helix transcription factor such as HES1 or an estrogen receptor to enhance replication synaptogenesis or other repair or maintenance functions 2 by enhancing recruitment and or differentiation of cells involved in cell or tissue repair e.g. enhanced recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte cells to a demyelinated lesion in multiple sclerosis and or 3 indirectly by modulating the level or activity of autocrine paracrine or endocrine factors such as one or more inflammatory cytokines or markers as disclosed herein that can modulate disease progression e.g. cortisol IL 1 IL 1 TNF IL 6 a thromboxane a prostaglandin or a neuregulin.

In treating chronic or progressive disorders such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer s disease the F1Cs will typically slow the rate of progression of the disease. The F1Cs act at least in part by decreasing the activity or levels of chemokines and or pro inflammatory cytokines e.g. one two or more of MCP 1 MIP 1 ICAM V CAM E selectin RANTES IL 1 IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 and TNF . This reduction can be accompanied by a reduced rate of deposition of amyloid AJ3 protein which results in slowed disease progression and in reduced severity and or frequency of one or more symptoms such as short term memory loss impaired concentration impaired judgement episodes of disorientation or confusion and periods of mood or behavior changes such as irritability anxiety or aggression. Treatment of chronic or progressive disorders such as Alzheimer s disease with a F1C is optionally accompanied by other suitable treatments e.g. treatment with one or more non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or other palliative measures.

Factors such as increased levels of cortisol or thromboxane that are associated with increased cell or tissue damage or with inhibition of cell growth or differentiation are generally decreased or reregulated to express in a normal manner by the appropriate cells such as neurons astrocytes glial cells or their stem or precursor cells. Factors that facilitate normal differentiation or repair e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor 2 or neuregulin are generally increased or reregulated to express in a normal manner by the appropriate cells such as neurons astrocytes glial cells or their stem or precursor cells.

Because of these properties the F1Cs can be used in various protocols or methods to enhance differentiation or proliferation of these cell types in vivo or in vitro. Typically the concentration of the F1Cs will exert one or more of these beneficial effects at extracellular concentrations of about 1 10M to about 5 10M e.g. about 1 10M to about 5 10M or about 1 10M to about 1 10M. Such concentrations can suitably be established transiently e.g. for about 10 minutes to about 6 hours or about 12 hours once or twice per day on one two or more days. Alternatively such concentrations may be maintained more or less constantly e.g. within these ranges for at least about 12 hours per day for one two or more days particularly for in vitro use to enhance cell or tissue growth differentiation or viability in tissue culture. Methods to administer the F1Cs for in vivo use are essentially as described herein.

For any of these neurological conditions or their associated symptoms the presence of the condition or its pathological manifestation e.g. cell or tissue damage or symptom may be determined by suitable objective or subjective means e.g. assays to detect tissue damage levels of diagnostic markers or an etiological agent performance of histopathological examination of cells or tissues patient questionnaires or behavior performance tests measurement of a diagnostic marker s e.g. an enzyme hormone cytokine or drug substance in blood or tissue electroencephalography imaging methods such as X ray MRI scan or CAT scan observation and diagnosis of clinical features or symptoms or biopsy of affected tissue or cells e.g. aspiration biopsy needle biopsy incision biopsy or punch biopsy of tissue or cells. Neurological conditions diseases and symptoms which the F1Cs can be used to treat or ameliorate and methods to diagnose and characterize such conditions or diseases have been described. See e.g. Ph.

The use of the F1Cs in these conditions is optionally combined with one or more of the therapeutic treatments that are described in these references. The F1C may be administered before during or after another treatment is employed to prevent treat or ameliorate a given neurological condition or symptom thereof. Any of these neurological conditions or symptoms may be mild or at an early stage moderate or severe or advanced.

Dosages of the F1C routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for cardiovascular conditions or as disclosed elsewhere herein. Thus the F1Cs may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically in chronic conditions or they may be administered at the time of or relatively soon before or after an acute event such as an epileptic seizure onset of a migraine or occurrence of trauma before during or after surgery accidental head or central nervous system injury or a cerebral stroke or infarction. For acute events the formula 1 compounds may thus be administered concurrently e.g. within about 15 minutes or about 30 minutes of the onset or occurrence of the acute event or at a later time e.g. at about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 36 42 48 54 60 72 84 96 108 or 120 hours after the onset or occurrence of the acute event. The F1Cs may thus be administered at about 6 120 hours or about 8 48 hours about 10 24 hours or about 12 16 hours after an acute event starts or occurs. In other embodiments the F1C can be administered before an expected acute event such as a planned surgery. In these cases the F1Cs may be administered before e.g. within about 15 minutes or about 30 minutes of the onset or occurrence of the acute event or at an earlier time e.g. at about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 36 42 48 54 60 72 84 96 108 or 120 hours before the onset or occurrence of the acute event.

The affect of the F1Cs on immune function permits their use to improve the function of organs or organ systems that rely on the optimal functioning of one or more immune responses. Thus the F1Cs can be administered to a subject to prevent treat ameliorate slow the progression of or enhance the healing of certain skin conditions such as skin inflammation lesions atrophy or rash. Conditions that can give rise to skin pathology or an unwanted skin condition include autoimmune diseases inflammation allergy age exposure to sunlight cancer infection or the like.

As used here skin includes external skin and internal skin or surfaces such as oral intestinal and rectal mucosa. These conditions include lesions rashes or inflammation associated with e.g. burns infections and the thinning or general degradation of the dermis often characterized by a decrease in collagen or elastin as well as decreased number size and doubling potential of fibroblast cells. Such skin conditions include keratoses such as actinic keratosis psoriasis eczema warts such as papillomavirus induced warts ulcers or lesions such as herpesvirus induced ulcers or lesions or diabetes associated ulcers or lesions discoid lupus erythematosus erythema nodosum erythema multiform cutaneous T cell lymphoma atopic dermatitis inflammatory vasculitis relapsing polychondritis exfoliative dermatitis sarcoidosis burns melanoma rash or irritation from poison oak poison ivy or poison Sumac blemished or hyperpigmented skin hyperkeratotic skin dry skin dandruff acne inflammatory dermatoses scarring such as from a chemical or thermal burn and age related skin changes. In these embodiments treatment with the F1Cs is optionally combined with other appropriate treatments or therapies essentially as described herein e.g. one or more of a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone or cortisol prednisone or prednisolone an hydroxybenzoic acid or an hydroxycarboxylic acid s is coadministered with a F1C to treat prevent or ameliorate a skin condition such as atrophy or a lesion. Hydroxybenzoic acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids suitable for use in these embodiments are described in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 262 407 5 254 343 4 246 261 4 234 599 and 3 984 566. The F1C can be used to minimize cutaneous atrophy caused by corticosteroids a side effect of their application to the skin.

In these embodiments that address skin conditions dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols for the F1Cs are essentially as described herein. In some embodiments the F1C is administered to the subject in the form of a topical cream ointment spray foam or gel. These topical formulations will optionally comprise about 0.1 w w to about 20 w w or about 0.2 w w to about 10 w w of a F1C in a composition that comprises one or more excipients that are suitable for such topical formulations including e.g. one or more agents that enhance penetration or delivery of the F1C into the skin. Such topical formulations can be administered e.g. once twice or three times per day using about 0.1 g to about 8 g or about 0.2 g to about 5 g of the topical formulation on each occasion. Administration may be daily for about 1 to about 28 days or it may be intermittent and used as needed. The amount of a topical formulation that can be administered may be higher e.g. about 15 g or about 20 g if the size of the area to be treated is relatively large e.g. at least about 30 cmto about 100 cmor more. Alternatively systemic administration of the F1C such as oral parenteral sublingual or buccal delivery may be used particularly when the area of the skin to be treated is relatively large. In some cases both topical and systemic administration of a F1C can be used. Excipients that topical or other formulations may contain include those described herein or agents that enhance permeation or solubilization of the F1C e.g. DMSO or an alkylalkanol such as a 2 alkylalkanol or a 3 alkyloctanol that comprises about 8 36 carbon atoms e.g. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 carbon atoms such as 2 ethyloctanol 2 propyloctanol 2 octyldodecanol 2 butyloctanol 2 hexyldecanol 2 pentylnonanol 3 ethyloctanol 3 propyloctanol 3 octyldodecanol 3 butyloctanol 3 hexyldecanol 3 pentylnonanol isostearyl alcohol isocetyl alcohol or mixtures thereof. Such alkylalkanol moieties include those having the structure HO CH CH CH C1 10 alkyl CH CH any of which are optionally substituted at the alkanol or the alkyl moiety with one two three or more independently selected substituents as described herein e.g. with one two three or more independently selected O F OH CN or CH CH moieties. Such formulations can be used in therapeutic applications described herein or in cosmetic applications.

In treating any of the diseases conditions or symptoms disclosed herein the F1Cs can modulate i.e. detectably enhance or increase or detectably inhibit or decrease the expression or a biological activity ies of one or more transcription factors or receptors. This can lead to detectable modulation of target gene activity or expression as part of the treatment or amelioration of the disease condition or symptom. Such modulation can arise from changes in the capacity of a transcription factor or receptor to bind to or form a complex with other natural ligands such as a target DNA sequence s another transcription factor s a transcription cofactor a receptor such as a nuclear hormone receptor or cell membrane receptor e.g. a lipid peptide protein or glycoprotein receptor such as an interleukin receptor or a growth factor receptor a receptor cofactor or an enzyme such as a polymerase kinase phosphatase or transferase. The effects of F1Cs on these biomolecules can be exerted in immune cells or in non immune tissue e.g. cells or tissue adjacent to diseased tissue such as infected or malignant cells. The F1Cs may directly or indirectly modulate the capacity of any of these molecules to transduce signals that are part of normal signal transduction processes.

In many of the clinical conditions described herein e.g. in cancers infections acute inflammation chronic inflammation trauma neurological conditions or autoimmunity the F1Cs can modulate e.g. detectably decrease or increase a biological activity ies protein or molecule level or RNA level of 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more biomolecules that are involved in establishment maintenance or progression of a disease condition or symptom. Such biomolecules include 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more of AP 1 a cyclooxygenase such as mammalian or human cyclooxygenase 1 COX 1 or cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 a mammalian or human lipoxygenase e.g. 5 lipoxygenase TNF TNF receptor 1 TNF receptor 2 TNF receptor associated factor TNF TNF receptor MIP 1 monocyte chemoattractant 1 MCP 1 interferon gamma IFN or IFN IL 1 IL 1 IL 1 receptor IL 1 receptor IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 4 receptor IL 4R IL 5 IL 6 IL 6 receptor IL 6R IL 8 IL 8 receptor IL 8R IL 10 IL 10 receptor IL 10R IL 12 an IL 12 receptor e.g. IL 12R 2 IL 13 IL 15 IL 17 IL 18 nuclear factor kappa B NF B AP 1 c maf v maf mafB NrI mafK mafG the maf family protein p18 reactive oxygen species e.g. peroxynitrite hydrogen peroxide or superoxide ion collectively ROS a 17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17 HSD or an 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11 HSD e.g. 11 HSD type 1 11 HSD type 2 17 HSD type 1 17 HSD type 2 or 17 HSD type 5 a steroid aromatase e.g. cytochrome P450 aromatase steroid 5 reductase serum or blood cortisol cytosolic phospholipase A2 cPLA2 calcium independent phospholipase A2 iPLA2 a prostaglandin e.g. prostaglandin E2 PGE2 or prostaglandin D2 PGD2 a leukotriene e.g. leukotriene B4 inducible nitric oxide synthetase iNOS nitric oxide NO GM CSF RANTES regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted eotaxin GATA 3 CCR1 CCR3 CCR4 CCR5 CXCR4 in e.g. a subject s cell s or tissue s or in enzyme tissue or cell based assays. In these subjects the levels of other biomolecules their RNAs or the level of their activity can be detectably modulated include IFN INF receptor PPAR PPAR PPAR or a transcription factor such as T bet is detectably increased. Other biomolecules or their isoforms polymorphs orthologs or homologs that the F1Cs directly or indirectly modulate include one or more of e.g. Janus kinase 1 JAK1 Janus kinase 2 JAK2 Janus kinase 3 JAK3 signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 STAT1 signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 STAT2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 STAT3 . The F1Cs can modulate the other biologically active analogs of any these enzymes chemokines cytokines their receptors or ligands including their isoforms polymorphs orthologs or homologs. In some cells or tissues one or more of these biomolecules may be detectably increased while in other cells or tissues the same biomolecule may be detectably decreased. Thus the biomolecules that the F1Cs can modulate e.g. detectably increase or decrease include the intracellular or extracellular level or biological activity of one or more enzyme cytokine cytokine receptor chemokine and or chemokine receptor. Exemplary chemokine receptors include one two or more of CCR 1 CCR 2 CCR 2A CCR 2B CCR 3 CCR 4 CCR 5 CXCR 3 and CXCR 4.

The F1Cs can modulate the activity of certain biomolecules that mediate various biological responses that affect establishment or progression of a disease or that enhance or inhibit specific immune responses. Thus in conditions where unwanted inflammation is present the F1Cs can reduce inflammation while enhancing Th1 or Tc1 immune responses at the same time. The biomolecules that the F1Cs can modulate include e.g. transcription factors or receptors including orphan nuclear receptors and the homologs isoforms orthologs and co factors e.g. co repressors co activators transcription factors gene promoter regions sequences or messenger moieties such as calcium ions potassium ions or cAMP of any of these molecules and related molecules that participate in their function. The compounds can directly or indirectly from complexes with such molecules or they can modulate detectably increase or decrease the synthesis level or one or more biological activities of those molecules. These complexes include receptors or transcription factor complexes which can comprise heterodimers homodimers and trimer tetramer pentamer or higher homo or hetero complexes. A number of the orphan receptors or their isoforms orthologs or homologs e.g. PPAR PPAR PPAR PPAR 1 PPAR 2 PPAR 3 LXR LXR SXR PXR CAR and CAR can form heterodimers with one or more of RXR RXR and RXR .

The homologs orthologs and isoforms of these transcription factors receptors and other molecules are included among the molecules that the F1Cs can modulate the synthesis or one or more biological activities of. Such factors are biologically active or function in one or more of a number of cell types such as T cells B cells macrophages dendritic cells platelets monocytes neutrophils neurons epithelial cells endothelial cells cartilage cells osteoblasts osteoclasts splenocytes thymocytes and GALT associated cells. Methods to identify these molecules and their biological activities have been described e.g. U.S. Pat.

WO 00 24245 WO 0073453 and WO 97 39721.

In one aspect the compounds are used to treat prevent or to ameliorate conditions or symptoms that are associated with unwanted or expression or activity of one or more of these molecules in conditions such as e.g. acute inflammation chronic inflammation or their symptoms acute allergy chronic allergy or their symptoms e.g. allergic rhinitis or acute or chronic asthma psoriatic arthritis osteoporosis osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis neurological dysfunction or their symptoms e.g. dementias such as Alzheimer s Disease Parkinson s Disease or memory loss conditions in osteoporosis or in cancer such as breast cancer. The compounds can prevent NF B from translocating from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and thus can increase the ratio of cytoplasmic NF B to nuclear NF B. The F1Cs may inhibit activation of NF B mediated transcription while NF B is bound to target DNA sequences in the nucleus. Alternatively the F1Cs can activate or enhance the expression of or one or more activity of a transcription factor such as T bet in e.g. a subject s cell s or tissue s or in enzyme or cell based assays. In this aspect the compounds are used to treat prevent or to ameliorate conditions or symptoms that are associated with deficient expression or activity of T bet in conditions such as immune dysfunction in an immunosuppression condition aging an infection a cancer or precancer as described herein or in the cited references.

The invention provides methods to identify compounds to regulate immune or other biological responses in a context sensitive manner. Such compounds modulate differential expression in a cell of the level of or an activity of eg. 4 5 6 7 8 or more genes or gene products comprising administering an effective amount of a F1C. The genes or gene products are USF1 c Fos EGR1 CuI1 RIPK2 I B I BKb NF B NF B2 NF B1 p50 Fn14 fibroblast growth factor inducible 14 TWEAK TNF like weak inducer of apoptosis NEMO NF B essential modifier FCAR c Fos C EBP RANTES ICAM1 TSG TNFAIP6 IL 2 receptor GRO2 GRO3 HO1 Jun B c Fos JunB complex JunB ATF3 complex c Jun c Fos c Jun complex ATF 3 MMP1 TSG 6 TNFAIP3 AP 1 EGR1 TGF ATF 3 c Jun complex c Fos MMP3 IL 8 STAT5A STAT5B CDKN1A IFN receptor 2 IFN R2 T bet C reactive protein immunoglobulin E an AP 1 family protein GATA 3 Jak2 Tyk2 stat1 stat3 stat4 stat5 MIP 1 MIP 2 IP 10 MCP 1 TNF TNF LT IFN IFN TGF 1 NF B IL 1 IL 1 IL 4 IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 receptor 1 IL 12p35 IL 12p40 IL 23 IL 23 receptor or another gene or gene product disclosed herein including in Table 1. The compounds identified by the screening methods modulate the expression of dysregulated genes and restore or enhance normal immune responses in conditions where unwanted dysregulation contributes to the establishment or progression a pathological condition such as an infection an autoimmune disorder a cardiovascular condition or a neurological condition.

Thus in some embodiments the level or a biological activity of 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 or more of COX 2 IL 1 TNF TNF receptor 1 TNF receptor 2 TNF receptor associated factor MIP 1 MCP 1 IFN IL 4 IL 4R IL 6 IL 6R IL 8 IL 8R IL 10 IL 10R IL 12 IL 12R IL 18 IL 18R NF B IkB AP 1 GATA 3 11 HSD1 cPLA2 iPLA2 cortisol ROS PGE2 PGD2 leukotriene A4 leukotriene B4 leukotriene C4 iNOS or GM CSF are optionally measured and they are generally detectably reduced e.g. RNA or protein levels are reduced by about 10 95 or about 20 95 or more compared to suitable untreated controls. In these embodiments the level or a biological activity of 4 5 6 or more of IFN INF receptor IL 12 an IL 12 receptor e.g. IL 12R 2 PPAR PPAR and T bet are optionally measured and they are generally detectably increased. In a chronic infection condition e.g. HIV in humans autoimmunity a chronic fungal or parasite infection or in a precancer or cancer condition e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia the progression of the condition may be slowed over a period of 1 2 3 4 5 or more years. In these embodiments the subject s condition becomes more manageable with a reduced incidence or severity of side effects e.g. a detectable halt slowing reversal or decreased incidence of wasting dementia CD4 cell count decreases or viral load increases which tend to occur over time in HIV infected humans or a halt slowing or reversal of pathogen or precancer or cancer cell replication.

These effects are typically observed after administration of an effective amount of a F1C using e.g. a method or dose essentially as disclosed herein. The simultaneous reduction of multiple biomolecules provides a method to modulate immune responses by modulating multiple pathways that lead to a common condition such as inflammation. This provides a method to treat or ameliorate e.g. acute or chronic inflammation a cancer an infection or a symptom associated therewith or to slow the progression of or reduce the severity of these conditions or their symptoms.

Previously described methods can be used to measure the amount activity or cellular location of various biomolecules such as cytokines or transcription factors. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 107 034 5 925 657 5 658 744 4 016 043 and 3 850 752 S. Szabo et al. 2000 100 655 669 Y. Nakamura et al. 1999 103 2 pt. 1 215 222 R. V. Hoch et al. 1999 84 122 128. These methods can be used to measure the effects of the F1Cs on transcription factors or receptors in cells or tissues that have been exposed to the compounds.

Without wishing to be bound to any theory the F1Cs may modulate multiple biomolecules in a microenvironment sensitive manner or context. The effects of the compounds can provide a decrease in a particular molecule such as IFN and a decrease in inflammation associated with elevated IFN levels or activity without eliminating beneficial effects of the molecule. This effect arises from decreasing the level or activity of a biomolecule such as IFN in cells that are dysregulated while allowing normal immune cells to produce sufficient amounts of the same molecule to perform normal immune functions. In locations where the biomolecule is needed for activity e.g. in lymph nodes or spleen cells sufficient amounts of the modulated molecule are present to elicit a desired response while the level of the molecule in cells in circulation decreases. The compounds can increase IL 13 IL 15 IL 17 or IL 18 in conditions where a subject has a deficient Th1 immune response e.g. in infection or cancer. Conversely the compounds can decrease IL 13 IL 15 or IL 18 in conditions such as allergy or autoimmune conditions e.g. multiple sclerosis where an excess Th1 immune status may prevail.

In general the F1Cs will detectably decrease the synthesis or one or more biological activity of one or more of these molecules or other transcription factors or receptors disclosed herein when such synthesis or activities is associated with the establishment maintenance progression or enhanced severity of a clinical condition or symptom disclosed herein. Conversely the F1Cs will generally detectably increase the synthesis or one or more biological activities of one or more of these molecules or other transcription factors or receptors disclosed herein when such synthesis or activity is associated with the treatment prevention cure or amelioration of a clinical condition or symptom disclosed herein.

These decreases or increases compared to suitable controls can be relatively small including changes near the lower limits of delectability for such molecules using known or new assays e.g. a decrease or increase in the synthesis or biological activity of at least about 2 about 5 about 10 or about 20 . Such changes can be modest or relatively large e.g. at least about a 50 change at least about a 90 change or at least about a 200 change up to about a 5 fold about a 10 fold about a 100 fold or greater decrease or increase in the synthesis or biological activity of the affected molecule s compared to suitable controls. These changes are typically measured relative to controls that lack a F1C or that use known agonists or antagonists of one or more relevant molecules. Assays can be based on measuring decreases or increases in e.g. one or more of protein levels RNA or mRNA levels a ligand binding activity transcription of a target gene s and the like. Suitable assay protocols include any suitable polymerase chain reaction assay to measure an RNA or mRNA any suitable blotting protocol for nucleic acid or for protein such as a Northern or Western blot method or any transcription assay including DNA footprinting or a gene expression or gene function assay. Typically the F1Cs will effect detectable changes in the synthesis or one or more biological activities in a concentration range of about 0.5 10M to about 3 10M. Exemplary compositions that comprise a F1C for use in e.g. in vivo animal assays in vitro cell or tissue culture assays or in cell free assays will comprise one or more suitable solvents or vehicles including DMSO ethanol water and a suitable tissue culture medium.

One or more of these transcription factors receptors or complexes can be a component in methods when e.g. they are used with a F1C in cell free assays or in tissue culture assays. Formation of these complexes in cells or analysis of the effects of F1Cs on one or more of their biological activities is facilitated by inserting into the cells a DNA construct s that expresses one or more of these proteins e.g. mammalian or yeast cells containing a stable DNA construct or a construct used for transient transfection assays. Methods to perform assays or to induce biological responses in vitro or in vivo using the F1Cs as agonists antagonists or as reference standards are essentially as described see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 080 139 5 696 133 5 932 431 5 932 555 5 935 968 5 945 279 5 945 404 5 945 410 5 945 412 5 945 448 5 952 319 5 952 371 5 955 632 5 958 710 5 958 892 and 5 962 443 International Publication Numbers WO 96 19458 WO 99 41257 and WO 99 45930. The complexes or assay systems that comprise a F1C and one or more of these molecules are embodiments of the invention as are the use of these compositions when employed in the practice of any of the assay methods or in any of the clinical treatment methods disclosed herein or in the cited references.

Invention embodiments include a method comprising contacting a F1C s with a cell s whereby the F1C s forms a complex with a steroid hormone receptor or results directly or indirectly in the modulation of a biological activity of the steroid hormone receptor or a gene that it regulates. The steroid hormone receptor may be an orphan nuclear hormone receptor or a characterized receptor such as the glucocorticoid receptor estrogen receptor or the androgen receptor that displays a moderate or high binding affinity for the F1C s . In some embodiments the nuclear hormone receptor is a known receptor. Biological effects from interaction of a F1C and a receptor can lead to interference with the replication or development of a pathogen or the cell s itself e.g. detectably inhibited proliferation of cancer cells. For example expression of HIV transcripts in HIV infected cells may be altered. The receptor F1C complex may directly interfere with LTR dependent transcription of HIV genes leading to reduced viral replication. Alternatively such effects can include the decreased synthesis or biological activity of a protein or gene product that is associated with the establishment maintenance or progression of a disease condition described herein or in the cited references.

An aspect of F1C biological activity is their capacity to modulate the capacity of cells or tissues described herein to express one or more enzymes that mediate phase II detoxification and reduction of damaging or reactive species such as xenobiotics including electrophiles and chemical carcinogens and superoxide radicals or hydrogen peroxide. Modulation of these genes is mediated by one or more transcription factors or complexes of factors that include bZip transcription factors such as Nrf2 NF E2 related factor 2 Unigene symbol Nfe2L2 and Maf proteins such as MafG MafK or MafF. These factors bind to cis elements such as EpRE electrophile response element or ARE antioxident response element . EpRE and or ARE elements present in the promoters of phase II detoxification enzymes including NAD P H quinine oxidoreductase 1 NQO1 and glutathione 5 transferase GST as well as cellular defensive enzymes such as thioredoxins heme oxygenase 1 HO 1 or HMOX1 the catalytic and regulatory subunit glutamylcycleine synthetase GCS or GCLM and xCT SLC7A11 a subunit of the cystine glutamate exchange transporter. EpRE and ARE mediate upregulation of these genes following exposure of the cells to many xenobiotics. In situations where enhanced expression of these genes or transcription factors is desirable the F1C upregulate the activity or levels of one or more of these factors and or enzymes.

Thus in some embodiments the F1C are used to modulate the level or activity of one or more of Nrf2 a thioredoxin NQO1 GST HO 1 the catalytic subunit of GCS the regulatory subunit of GCS and xCT in cells or tissues that are exposed to a F1C. In some embodiments the cells or tissues are treated with a F1C when an unwanted acute or chronic condition such as toxin exposure or elevated oxidative stress is present in the cells or tissues. Such conditions can occur e.g. as described elsewhere herein including in acute or chronic pathological inflammation conditions acute or chronic infections and trauma conditions. The effect of the F1Cs is restoration of normal expression or establishment of desired levels of expression of one or more of these transcription factors or enzymes e.g. decreased expression in situations where chronic over expression occurs. Thus the F1C can be used to modulate these or other genes described herein e.g. to decrease expression or mRNA levels or protein levels of one or more of these or other genes in clinical conditions where excess or unwanted expression or levels of the gene is associated with establishment maintenance severity or progression of the clinical condition resulting in clinical improvement in the disease or an unwanted symptom.

Homologs of these genes or proteins in other species e.g. primates are also modulated by the F1C. Modulation of these genes can be observed e.g. as increased expression or mRNA levels or protein levels of the biomolecules in clinical conditions where insufficient or suboptimal expression or levels of the gene is associated with establishment maintenance severity or progression of the clinical condition to produce a desired clinical improvement.

The F1Cs are useful for preventing slowing the progression of or treating certain chronic conditions in a subject such as a mammal or a human. Chronic conditions include diseases and conditions that arise or develop over a relatively long time period e.g. over about 3 months to 10 years or more. Such conditions include chronic renal failure which may result from polycystic kidney disease from e.g. an autoimmune condition such as acute or chronic glomerulonephritis or from diabetes interstitial nephritis hypertension and other conditions discussed elsewhere herein. Chronic conditions include chronic pulmonary conditions such as chronic bronchitis lung fibrosis right ventricular hypertrophy pulmonary hypertension emphysema asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which may be treated with a F1C. These conditions or their symptoms may be mild moderate or severe. The subject may be suffering from the disease or condition or may be subject to developing the condition e.g. the subject may display early signs or a predisposition to develop a chronic condition. Such treatment will generally facilitate prevention of the disease delay the onset or severity of the disease or condition ameliorate one or more symptoms e.g. reduce shortness of breath coughing or dyspnea or slow progression of the disease or condition. In these and other chronic conditions described herein the F1Cs will generally be administered to a subject such as a human for a relatively long time period e.g. for at least about 3 months to about 10 years or more. Dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols for the F1Cs are essentially as described herein. Dosing of the compound can be daily or intermittent using a dosing protocol using dosages as described herein e.g. about 0.1 to about 20 mg kg of a F1C administered to a subject once or twice per day daily or intermittently. The use of the F1Cs can be combined with other treatments e.g. agonists such as metaproterenol or albuterol or corticosteroids e.g. prednisone for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The F1Cs can modulate the biological activity of cytokines or interleukins that are associated with various immune deficiency or dysregulation conditions which may be transient or chronic. They can thus be used to ameliorate treat or prevent naturally occurring age related decline in immune function in a subject or immune deficiency or dysregulation resulting from trauma stress burns surgery autoimmunity or infections as described herein. Such immune deficiency dysregulation may be associated with e.g. an age related increase in production of one or more of IL 4 IL 5 and IL 6 or an age related decrease in production of one or more of IL 2 IL 3 IFN GM CSF or antibodies. In these embodiments the F1C is administered to the subject to detectably decrease production or levels of one or more of IL 4 IL 5 and IL 6 or to detectably increase production or levels of one or more of IL 2 IL 3 IL 5 IL 12 GM CSF and IFN. These cytokine changes facilitate normalization of the subject s immune responses. Such normalization can be observed by various means. These means include monitoring appropriate cytokine RNA or protein level s in the subject or by measuring biological responses such as restoration or detectable improvement of contact hypersensitivity in a subject with depressed or suboptimal contact hypersensitivity response. The F1Cs can thus be used to enhance or restore a deficient or suboptimal immune response such as contact hypersensitivity response in a subject with a chronic or transient state of immune deficiency or dysregulation. In these embodiments the F1C is administered using the dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols for the F1Cs essentially as described herein. Treatment with the F1Cs is optionally combined with other appropriate treatments or therapies essentially as described herein e.g. a antibacterial or antiviral agent s is coadministered with a F1C to treat prevent or ameliorate an infection in an infected subject or a subject suffering from e.g. a burn. Methods to measure changes in cytokine levels or contact hypersensitivity are known and can optionally be applied in these embodiments see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 919 465 5 837 269 5 827 841 5 478 566.

The capacity of the F1Cs to modulate immune functions permits their use for treating preventing slowing the progression of or alleviating the a symptom s of subjects with psychological disorders metabolic disorders chronic stress sleep disorders conditions associated with sexual senescence aging or premature aging. Metabolic disorders include parathyroidism pseudoparathyroidism hypoparathyroidism hypercalcemia hypocalcemia and detectable symptoms thereof such as fatigue constipation kidney stones and kidney malfunction. Chronic stress and related disorders include fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome hypothalamic pituitary axis dysregulation. Other related pathological conditions that can be treated with the F1Cs include hormone deficiency associated with aging or with a pathological condition hypogonadism vaginal atrophy diminished libido urinary incontinence skin collagen loss loss or impairment of skin organ or joint connective tissue and menopause or its symptoms such as hot flashes unwanted mood changes fatigue and insomnia. In these embodiments treatment of subjects with a F1C is optionally combined with other suitable agents such as triiodothyronine tetraiodothyronine an insulin like growth factor insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 an estrogen or a progestin.

As noted above in some embodiments a treatment with a F1C is combined with a corticosteroid or glucocorticoid. Corticosteroids are used in a number of clinical situations to e.g. decrease the intensity or frequency of flares or episodes of inflammation or autoimmune reactions in conditions such as acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis acute or chronic osteoarthritis ulcerative colitis acute or chronic asthma bronchial asthma psoriasis systemic lupus erythematosus hepatitis pulmonary fibrosis type I diabetes type II diabetes or cachexia. However many corticosteroids have significant side effects or toxicities that can limit their use or efficacy. The F1Cs are useful to counteract such side effects or toxicities without negating all of the desired therapeutic capacity of the corticosteroid. This allows the continued use or a modified dosage of the corticosteroid e.g. an increased dosage without an intensification of the side effects or toxicities or a decreased corticosteroid dosage. The side effects or toxicities that can be treated prevented ameliorated or reduced include one or more of bone loss reduced bone growth enhanced bone resorption osteoporosis immunosuppression increased susceptibility to infection mood or personality changes depression headache vertigo high blood pressure or hypertension muscle weakness fatigue nausea malaise peptic ulcers pancreatitis thin or fragile skin growth suppression in children or preadult subjects thromboembolism cataracts and edema. Dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols for the F1C would be essentially as described herein. An exemplary dose of F1C of about 0.5 to about 20 mg kg day is administered during the period during which a corticosteroid is administered and optionally over a period of about 1 week to about 6 months or more after dosing with the corticosteroid has ended. The corticosteroids are administered essentially using known dosages routes of administration and dosing protocols see e.g. 54edition 2000 pages 323 2781 ISBN 1 56363 330 2 Medical Economics Co. Inc. Montvale N.J. However the dosage of the corticosteroid may optionally be adjusted e.g. increased about 10 to about 300 above the normal dosage without a corresponding increase in all of the side effects or toxicities associated with the corticosteroid. Such increases would be made incrementally over a sufficient time period and as appropriate for the subject s clinical condition e.g. daily corticosteroid dose increases of about 10 to about 20 to a maximum of about 300 over about 2 weeks to about 1 year.

Such corticosteroids include hydrocortisone cortisol corticosterone aldosterone ACTH triamcinolone and derivatives such as triamcinolone diacetate triamcinolone hexacetonide and triamcinolone acetonide betamethasone and derivatives such as betamethasone dipropionate betamethasone benzoate betamethasone sodium phosphate betamethasone acetate and betamethasone valerate flunisolide prednisone fluocinolone and derivatives such as fluocinolone acetonide diflorasone and derivatives such as diflorasone diacetate halcinonide dexamethasone and derivatives such as dexamethasone dipropionate and dexamethasone valerate desoximetasone desoxymethasone diflucortolone and derivatives such as diflucortolone valerate fluclorolone acetonide fluocinonide fluocortolone fluprednidene flurandrenolide clobetasol clobetasone and derivatives such as clobetasone butyrate alclometasone flumethasone and fluocortolone.

In some clinical conditions the F1Cs can inhibit activated T lymphocytes in vivo and they can inhibit the expression or biological activity of one or more of TNF IFN IL 6 IL 8 or insulin like growth factor 1 receptor IGF 1R or IL 6 receptor. The compounds are thus useful to treat prevent or ameliorate conditions where this is a component of pathology. Such conditions include inflammation conditions such as psoriasis psoriatic arthritis osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The compound can thus ameliorate the inflammation e.g. by inhibiting expression of one or more of TNF IFN IL 6 IL 8 or IGF 1R. Also the compounds can inhibit unwanted T cell activity. They can thus ameliorate one or more psoriasis symptoms such as skin scaling skin thickening keratinocyte hyperproliferation deficient filaggrin expression B. Baker et al. 1984 111 702 deficient strateum corneum lipid deposition or they can improve a clinical assessment such as the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index. The F1Cs can be delivered to a subject with psoriasis using topical or systemic formulations as described herein. Topical formulations include gels lotions and creams e.g. as described herein. Daily or intermittent administration of the compound can be used essentially as described herein. The use of the F1Cs is optionally combined with one more current psoriasis treatments e.g. topical emollients or moisturizers tars anthralins systemic or topical corticosteroids vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol methotrexate etretinate acitretin cyclosporin FK 506 sulfasalazine ultraviolet B radiation optionally combined with one or more of a topical corticosteroid tar anthralin emollient or moisturizer or ultraviolet A plus psoralen. Such additional treatments essentially would use known dosages and routes of administration which are applied e.g. within a month before during or within a month after a treatment course with a F1C.

Treatment with a F1C is conducted on human cystic fibrosis CF patients e.g. 18 years of age or older who may have two or more of the following characteristics 1 sweat chloride 60 mEq L e.g. by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test 2 homozygosity for the F508 genetic mutation or heterozygosity for 2 well characterized mutations e.g. as described herein associated with CF 3 FEV 40 predicted at screening 4 SaO 90 at screening 5 ability to perform pulmonary function tests and 6 clinical stability with no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection or current pulmonary exacerbation. The treatment regimen consists of 1 2 3 4 or 5 consecutive days of once daily dosing of a F1C or placebo equivalent followed by a 40 day observation period. Daily dosages are about 10 150 mg day e.g. about 25 mg day 50 mg day 75 mg day or 100 mg day. The F1C is administered as described herein such as by a parenteral route e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous delivery or by transmucosal delivery e.g. buccal or sublingual. A follow up visit will occur 6 weeks after the last treatment course to collect final samples for safety and activity. Patients receive e.g. 3 treatment courses over a 14 week period 6 treatment courses over a 28 week period or more courses of treatment over a longer period. F1Cs that are used include 3 hydroxy 16 bromo 17 oxoandrostane 3 hydroxy 16 bromo 17 oxoandrostane hemihydrate 3 16 dihydroxy 17 oxoandrostane 3 16 dihydroxy 17 oxoandrostane 3 16 17 trihydroxyandrostane or 3 16 17 trihydroxyandrostane or another F1C disclosed herein. The patients are optionally monitored for the status of their condition or in improvement of one or more CF symptoms after dosing e.g. reduction in the numbers of neutrophils in bronchiolar or alveolar lavage samples e.g. about a 30 40 50 or greater reduction or levels of one or more CF related inflammation markers e.g. reduced levels or activity of IL 6 IL 8 IKK kinase or neutrophil elastase or in the reduced occurrence severity or progression of infections such as a infection.

A cyclodextrin formulation containing a F1C is prepared by mixing a sulfobutyl cyclodextrin and the F1C in one or more liquids such as ethanol DMSO N methylpyrrolidine pyridine or water. The sulfobutyl cyclodextrin contains one or more butyl sulfonate or O CH SONa moieties typically about 5 6 or 7 per cyclodextrin molecule. F1Cs that contain a positive charge are especially helpful in forming complexes with the multiple negative charges of sulfobutyl cyclodextrin. For parenteral formulations the maximum concentrations could be achieved at about the maximum cyclodextrin concentration that is still syringable about 50 w v. The F1C can be added to a solution of sulfobutyl cyclodextrin at a molar ratio of about 1 1 e.g. 0.5 1 to about 2 1 and stirred with or without heat for up to about 1 week to form the complex. The solution is optionally filtered or sterilized before filling in vials or injection delivery by any route. The vials can be sterilized by radiation or by sterile filtration. An exemplary preparation is made using 500 grams of sulfobutyl cyclodextrin about 230 mmoles combined with about 230 mmoles of the F1C. Solutions containing about 20 80 mg mL of the F1C are typically obtained. For pharmaceutical formulations the complex is prepared under GMP compliance conditions. The dried complex is prepared by lyophilization and can be reconstituted e.g. using sterile 0.9 NaCl. The cyclodextrin complex can also be dried for preparation of formulations for oral or transmucosal administration or reconstituted with water for parenteral delivery e.g. by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. F1Cs that are used include 3 17 dihydroxyandrost 5 ene 3 17 dihydroxy 16 fluoroandrost 5 ene 3 7 17 trihydroxyandrost 5 ene 3 hydroxy 3 methyl 17 aminoandrost 4 ene 3 hydroxy 3 methyl 17 aminoandrost 4 ene and 3 hydroxy 17 aminoandrost 5 ene.

The capacity of formula 1 compounds to limit or inhibit inflammation or symptoms of inflammation is shown using animal models for inflammatory bowel disease. In an exemplary protocol groups of 3 male Wistar rats 180 20 grams fasted for 24 hours before 2 4 dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid DNBS or saline challenge are used. Distal colitis is induced by intra colonic instillation of 0.5 mL of an ethanolic solution of DNBS 30 mg in 0.5 mL of a 30 ethanol in saline solution after which 2 mL of air is injected through the cannula to ensure that the solution remained in the colon. The volume used is 0.1 mL per injection of 2 and 20 mg mL of a F1C in a liquid formulation which is administered by subcutaneous injection once a day for 6 days. The formulation contained 100 mg mL of the F1C in a non aqueous suspension e.g. 2 benzyl alcohol w v 0.1 Brij 96 w v and equal volumes of PEG 300 and propylene glycol. Concentrations of 2 mg mL and 20 mg mL are obtained by diluting the 20 mg mL formulation with vehicle that lacked the F1C.

The first F1C dose is given 30 minutes after DNBS challenge. Sulfasalazine 30 mg mL in 2 Tween 80 in distilled water is administered orally PO once a day 10 mL kg day for 7 days the first two doses beginning 24 hours and 2 hours before DNBS challenge. The presence of diarrhea is recorded daily by examining the anal area. Animals are fasted for 24 hours prior to being sacrificed. Animals are sacrificed on day 7 or day 8 and their colons are removed and weighed. Before removal of the colon signs of adhesion between the colon and other organs are recorded. Also the presence of ulcerations is noted after weighing of each colon. The net change of colon to body weight BW ratio is normalized relative to saline challenged baseline group. A 30 decrease in net colon to body weight ratio is considered significant.

The capacity of F1Cs to modulate delayed type hypersensitivity DTH is determined in mice. Groups of five female BALB cByJ mice 20 25 grams are anesthetized and 100 L of a 3 solution of oxazolone is applied on day 0 to the shaved abdomen and dried. Seven days later on day 7 the mice are challenged by applying 5 L of oxazolone topically to each side of the right ear. The F1C at about 20 100 mg mL in vehicle is administered by subcutaneous injection 2 mg day one time on day 6 24 hours before the oxazolone challenge. The vehicle as a non aqueous suspension of the F1C in e.g. 2 benzyl alcohol w v 0.1 Brij 96 w v and equal volumes of PEG 300 and propylene glycol.

Dexamethasone in saline 0.2 mg mL is administered daily for 9 days day 1 to 7 first dose 24 hours before sensitization last dose at challenge by subcutaneous injection 0.01 mg dose 50 L injection . On Day 8 24 hours following the oxazolone challenge both the right and left ear thicknesses are measured using a micrometer caliper and the differences are determined. The differential ear thickness is measured as an indicator of the DTH response to topical oxazolone challenge. The DTH response is expressed as the difference in the thickness mm between the right and the left ears for each animal.

The differential ear thickness in animals receiving vehicle alone is 0.225 mm and treatment with dexamethasone high dose or cyclophosphamide reduced the DTH response 0.144 mm and 0.092 mm respectively .

The recruitment of lymphocytes to areas of inflammation and angiogenesis involves specific receptor ligand interactions between cell surface adhesion molecules CAMs on lymphocytes and the vascular endothelium. The adhesion process in both normal and pathological settings follows a multi step cascade that involves intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM 1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 VCAM 1 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 E selectin expression on endothelial cells EC . The expression of these molecules and others on the vascular endothelium determines the efficiency with which leukocytes may adhere to the local vasculature and extravasate into the local tissue during the development of an inflammatory response. The local concentration of cytokines and growth factor participate in the modulation of the expression of these CAMs.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine and stimulates all three CAMs on endothelial cells. It may be involved in a wide variety of inflammatory responses often resulting in a pathological outcome. The capacity of a formula 1 compound to mediate a suppression of TNF induced CAM expression can be examined. A modified ELISA assay which uses Ecs as a solid phase absorbent is employed to measure the amount of CAM expression on TNF treated Ecs when co stimulated with a member of the FGF family of proteins. To perform the experiment human umbilical vein endothelial cell HUVEC cultures are obtained from pooled cord harvests and maintained in growth medium EGM 2 Clonetics San Diego Calif. supplemented with 10 FCS and 1 penicillin streptomycin in a 37 C. humidified incubator containing 5 CO. HUVECs are seeded in 96 well plates at concentrations of about 1 10cells well in EGM medium at 37 C. for 18 24 hrs or until confluent. The monolayers are subsequently washed 3 times with a serum free solution of RPMI 1640 optionally supplemented with 100 U mL penicillin and 100 mg mL streptomycin and treated with a given cytokine and or growth 5 factor s for 24 h at 37 C. Following incubation the cells are then evaluated for CAM expression.

HUVECs are grown in a standard 96 well plate to confluence. Growth medium is removed from the cells and replaced with 90 L of 199 Medium 10 FBS . Samples for testing and positive or negative controls are added to the plate in triplicate in 10 L volumes . Plates are incubated at 37 C. for either 5 h selectin and integrin expression or 24 h integrin expression . Plates are aspirated to remove medium and 100 L of 0.1 paraformaldehyde PBS with Ca and Mg is added to each well. Plates are held at 4 C. for 30 min. Fixative is then removed from the wells and wells are washed 1 with PBS Ca Mg 0.5 BSA and drained. Do not allow the wells to dry. 10 pL of diluted primary antibody is added to the test and control wells. Anti ICAM 1 Biotin Anti VCAM 1 Biotin and Anti E selectin Biotin are used at a concentration of 10 pg ml 1 10 dilution of 0.1 mg ml stock antibody . Cells are incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. in a humidified environment. Wells are washed 3 with PBS with Ca Mg and 0.5 BSA. Then add 20 pL of diluted ExtrAvidin Alkaline Phosphotase 1 5 000 dilution to each well and incubate at 37 C. for 30 min. Wells are washed 3 with PBS with Ca Mg and 0.5 BSA. 1 tablet of Nitrophenol Phosphate pNPP is dissolved in 5 mL of glycine buffer pH 10.4 . 100 pl of pNPP substrate in glycine buffer is added to each test well. Standard wells in triplicate are prepared from the working dilution of the ExtrAvidin Alkaline Phosphotase in glycine buffer 5 pL of each dilution is added to triplicate wells and the resulting AP content in each well is 5.50 ng 1.74 ng 0.55 ng 0.18 ng. 100 pl of pNNP reagent is then be added to each of the standard wells. The plate is incubated at 37 C. for 4 h. A volume of 50 L of 3M NaOH is added to all wells. The results are quantified on a plate reader at 405 nm. The background subtraction option is used on blank wells filled with glycine buffer only. The template is set up to indicate the concentration of AP conjugate in each standard well. Results are indicated as amount of bound APconjugate in each sample.

The effects of the formula 1 compounds on memory learning motor function or the status of a neurological condition or neurodegeneration condition are assayed using standard methods. For example aged two year old mice are tested in the Morris water maze procedure by training the mice to locate a pedestal in less than 15 seconds in three consecutive trials. Immediately upon completion of training one group of mice is treated with a formula 1 compound 5 30 mg kg and a second group is treated with a placebo. The treatment comprises one two or three intraperitoneal subcutaneous intramuscular or intravenous injections of the formula 1 compound and the vehicle placebo. The injections are given once per day. Two weeks after treatment the time to rescue is timed in the Morris water maze procedure and the control result is compared to the placebo control. The use of Morris water maze and other procedures to measure the effect of various conditions or compounds on learning memory or neurological conditions have been described see e.g. R. Gerlai 1996 19 177 181 J. L. W. Lau et al. 2001 98 4716 4721 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 348 489 6 251 942 and 6 277 886.

Scopolamine induced amnesia is examined essentially as follows. Groups of 13 to 16 C57BL76 mice about 35 gm are trained in the Morris water maze procedure to locate a pedestal in less than 15 seconds in three consecutive trials. Immediately upon completion of training the mice in each of three groups are treated with scopolamine 1 mg kg scopolamine plus a formula 1 compound at one or more dosages e.g. about 5 50 mg kg and scopolamine plus a placebo. The treatment comprises one two or three intraperitoneal subcutaneous intramuscular or intravenous injections of the formula 1 compound and the vehicle placebo. The injections are given once per day. Six days after treatment the average time sec to rescue is timed using the Morris water maze procedure and the results from each group are compared. Results for a F1C such as 3 17 dihydroxy 16 fluoroandrost 5 ene or 3 hydroxy 17 aminoandrost 5 ene are optionally compared to the results that are obtained in these protocols using another control compound e.g. S N propargyl 1 aminoindan or nefiracetam or another F1C.

The capacity of F1Cs to limit injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion is determined in an animal model essentially as follows. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 130 170 g are randomly assigned to no pre treatment vehicle pre treatment or formula 1 compound pre treatment using one or more dosages e.g. about 1 10 mg kg. Animals are treated with vehicle or F1C the day before and the day of surgery. Anesthesia is induced with intraperitoneal pentobarbital 60 70 mg kg . The rats are placed on a heating pad and body temperature is maintained at about 36 C. Detection of the cremaster muscle on its neurovascular pedicle is performed essentially according to conventional techniques e.g. Anderson G. L. et al. 1988 36 56 63 Siemionow M. et al. 1991 7 183 197 Siemionow M. et al. 1993 18A 963 971.

Briefly a skin incision is made from the anterior iliac spine to the tip of the scrotum. The testis with cremaster muscle intact is then dissected away from the scrotum. An opening of 1 cm is made on the ventral surface of the cremaster and the testis and spermatic cord are removed. Under a microscope the neurovascular pedicle consisting of the pubic epigastric arteries vein and genitofemoral nerve is then completely isolated by dissecting to the origin of the vessels from the external iliac artery and vein. The front wall of the cremaster muscle sac is opened and the island cremaster muscle flap is prepared for intravital videomicroscopy. The rat is secured on a tissue bath and the cremaster muscle flap is spread over the coverglass in the opening at the bottom of the bath and fixed with 5 0 silk sutures. It is then transilluminated from below using a fiber optic tungsten lamp. The muscle is kept moist and covered with impermeable plastic film. The tissue bath designed specifically for temperature control is filled with 0.9 saline and the temperature maintained at between 35 36 C. The microscope is equipped with a color video camera. The video image of the microcirculation is displayed on a 19 monitor where the final magnification is 1800 . Measurement of microvascular activity is recorded after isolation of the muscle to establish the pre ischemia baseline. After proper positioning of clamps to completely shut down blood flow to the muscle flap the duration of the ischemic period is six hours. Following removal of clamps to induce reperfusion injury activity in the microvasculature is measured at e.g. 30 60 and 90 minutes post reperfusion. In all experimental subjects ischemia is followed by reflow and then by an initial period of flow of blood through the microcirculation. This burst of circulatory activity is followed by marked reperfusion injury that induces loss of flow.

One or more of the following parameters are used to evaluate the state of the cremaster muscle microvasculatory system prior to ischemia and after reperfusion. The density of perfused capillaries in each of three flap regions is measured by counting the number of flowing capillaries in proximity to the preselected post capillary venule. Nine visual fields of capillaries are counted at each postcapillary venule site for a total of 27 fields per cremaster muscle flap.

A leukocyte count in postcapillary venules is taken using video scans of three pre selected post capillary venules in proximal middle and distal flap regions. For each venule the number of leukocytes rolling through the lumen the number adhering to the endothelium and the number migrating across the endothelium over a two minute period are recorded. Results are optionally obtained for rollers strikers and diapedesis.

Red blood cell velocities in first order and second order arterioles are measured. Red blood cell velocities are recorded in the main arterioles of the cremaster flap using an optical Doppler velocimeter. Results are obtained for velocity of venous and arterial blood.

In an exemplary protocol six rats are untreated and six rats are pre treated with vehicle. Under conditions of six hours of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion the absolute number of rolling sticking and transmigrated leukocytes is determined within 60 minutes of reperfusion and at 90 minutes. Rats are pre treated with a formula 1 compound by subcutaneous injection the day before and the day of surgery to measure any protective effect of the therapy. One or more of the three parameters are determined and are compared to normal values. The endothelial adherent properties compared to baseline values are optionally determined using numbers of rolling sticking and transmigrating leukocytes. Red cell velocities in second order arterioles are compared to normal rates of flow at e.g. 90 minutes post reperfusion.

The capacity of F1Cs to limit hypoxia induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is demonstrated using an animal model essentially as follows. Isolated perfused ferret lungs are an established animal model to study secondary pulmonary hypertension. In brief male ferrets are anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium and the chest is opened. Stainless steel cannulae are secured in the left atrium and pulmonary artery and the pulmonary artery and the aorta are ligated. The lungs are perfused with a mixture of autologous blood and Krebs Henseleit buffer in a circulating manner at a constant rate of about 85 mL min. The perfusion circuit includes a perfusate reservoir a roller perfusion pump filter and a heat exchanger. The perfusion system is made of e.g. tygon tubing which is used for connections and for passage through the perfusion pump. The temperature of the perfusate is kept about 37 38 C. and the pH is maintained at 7.35 to 7.40 by adding sodium bicarbonate to the reservoir as needed. The venous reservoir is placed below the lowermost portion of the lung.

The lungs are ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture of 5 CO 4 O and 91 Nby a tracheotomy with a Harvard animal respirator for 30 minutes. The animals are ventilated with a tidal volume of 30 mL at a rate of 18 breaths min. and with 2 cm of HO positive end expiatory pressure. For measurements pulmonary arterial left atrial and tracheal pressures are monitored using Gould Statha P231D pressure transducers or an equivalent connected to the inflow circulation and recorded on e.g. a Grass polygraph. After 30 minutes of ventilation with hypoxic gas mixture a formula 1 compound in a dose between about 5 25 mg kg body weight is added to the reservoir and perfusate is allowed to perfuse the ferret lungs for 1.5 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure is measured until the end of the experiment i.e. a total of two hours. Pressure that remains at or near basal level indicates the vasodilatory effect of the F1C in pulmonary circulation that is otherwise constricted in response to hypoxia. The effects of the F1Cs can be compared to the effects and duration of nitric oxide a therapeutic agent that is optionally used in this model as a control.

A series of tests is run in triplicate using BALB c mouse spleen cells to demonstrate the effect of the F1Cs and hydrocortisone Hycort on cellular proliferation in the absence of a mitogen. Cultures of spleen cells are prepared and F1Cs are added at e.g. 0.1 0.5 1 and 5 M. Suitable controls are used. Twenty four hours after setup about 50 Ci H thymidine is added to each cell. Four to six hours later the cells are harvested and counted on a scintillation counter.

Spleen cells are obtained from normal BALB c mice and prepared as a single cell suspension at a concentration of about 1 10cells ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L glutamine 5 10M 2 mercaptoethanol 20 g ml gentamycin sulfate and 1 Nutridona NS Boehringer Mannheim . Individual aliquots of cells are then pulsed for 30 minutes at 37 C. with selected concentrations of formula 1 compounds. After pulsing the cells are washed several times in balanced salt solution resuspended in fresh medium and then dispensed into 24 well culture plates with a stimulatory concentration of anti CD3 e.g. Leo et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84 1374 1987 . After a 24 hour incubation period culture supernatants are harvested for assessment of proliferation or cytokine production e.g. IL 2 IL 3 or IL 4 using e.g. the method of Mossman J. Immunol. Meth. 65 55 1983 . 100 control titers of IL 3 IL 2 or IL 4 from normal stimulated splenocytes are obtained exemplary values may be about 640 units mL or IL 2 and 160 units mL for IL 4.

Effects of formula 1 compounds and Hydrocortisone on Proliferation in the Presence of a Mitogen. A series of spleen cell cultures is run using a formula 1 compound and or hydrocortisone with cell cultures to which concanavalin A is added. Preliminary tests on cultures to which concanavalin A is added at concentrations of 10.0 5.0 2.5 and 1.0 ng mL. All tests on the effects of invention compounds on cultures stimulated with concanavalin A are performed with concanavalin A at e.g. about 2.5 ng mL. A mitogen such as ConA generally increases cell proliferation and the glucocorticoid steroid GCS can decrease proliferation. Detectable partial or complete reversal of the inhibitor effects of hydrocortisone indicate an anti glucorticoid effect by the formula 1 compounds.

Effect of formula 1 compounds on IL 3 production. Exemplary formula 1 compounds are characterized for their effect on the level of the cytokine IL 3 expression by spleen cells in tissue culture and for their capacity to reverse the effects of a GCS in IL 3 expression. The spleen cell cultures are prepared in accordance with the general method above. After 30 hours the level of IL 3 in the supernatants of the cultures was measured using the IL 3 ELISA kit manufactured by EndoGen Inc. Boston Mass. A GCS such as hydrocortisone will generally suppress the production of IL 3 and the invention compounds are examined for their capacity to modify this effect. The IL 3 expressed by cells in culture may be recovered from the media containing IL 3 by known methods such as single or sequential reverse phase HPLC steps on a preparative HPLC column.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE is demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with many pathological and clinical similarities with multiple sclerosis MS . EAE is thus a recognized animal model for human autoimmune conditions such as MS. F1Cs such as 3 7 dihydroxy 17 aminoandrost 5 ene and 3 hydroxy 17 aminoandrost 5 ene are tested for their capacity to delay the onset of EAE or to reduce its symptoms. Female SJL mice 5 animals per group are immunized with 150 to 200 g of PLP 139 151 peptide CFA to induce EAE. Starting 7 days before injection of the peptide the animals are given daily injections s.c. of the compounds 3.0 mg in 0.1 mL vehicle or vehicle alone for 33 days. The vehicle consisted of a suspension of the formula 1 compound in saline and carboxymethylcellulose. Delayed onset reduced peak clinical score from 5.2 0.6 to 2.8 1.8 and cumulative disease index 60 of EAE and prevention of or significant attenuation of relapses are measured. Reduced numbers of PLP 139 151 specific T cell responses and reduced numbers of TNF producing cells in the CNS indicate reduced disease progression or severity. Reduced production of autoimmune Th 1 associated cytokines is consistent with restoration of a more normal Th 1 Th 2 immune balance and or with reduction of inflammation in this model.

The efficacy of the formula 1 compounds to treat other autoimmune conditions can be determined by incorporating their use with suitable animal models or assay methods e.g. collagen induced arthritis as a model for human autoimmune polyarthritis e.g. L. K. Myers et al. 2002 102 185 191 A. Matejuk et al. 2002 143 313 319 S. Thornton et al. 165 1557 1563 . The effect of the compounds on markers of inflammation such as TNF MIP 1 IL 13 IL 15 IL 17 or IL 18 e.g. reduced expression or activity is optionally observed in any autoimmune or inflammatory condition.

The effect of 16 bromoepiandrosterone BrEA on transcript levels in cells in vitro was studied using a microarray to allow simultaneous monitoring of the expression of many genes to allow detailed analysis of the molecular pathways involved in biological responses to the compound.

In general microarray technology works by covalently linking short DNA sequences that are complementary to the transcripts of many different genes on a single slide or array chip. mRNAs from test and control samples are generated and labeled with one or more colored fluorescent dyes or probes. The probes are hybridized with the array which is then scanned by laser. The color and intensity of the fluorescent signal at each spot denotes relative expression level of each gene. The capacity of other F1Cs described herein e.g. a F1C in compound group 1 2 3 4 or 5 to modulate gene expression is characterized in a similar manner.

The array used in the experiment described below contained about 12 000 known genes. The experiment used U937 human promonocytic leukemia cells that differentiate to monocyte macrophage cells in the presence of phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate PMA . The U937 cells were PMA treated and then exposed to BrEA for 1 hr 2 hrs or 4 hrs followed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide LPS stimulation for 1 hr 2 hrs or 4 hrs. The level of transcripts of the genes on the array was measured at the time points using RNA prepared from BrEA treated and control no BrEA cells. U937 cells were plated at 1 10cells mL in the presence of 3 ng mL PMA Sigma Catalog 8139 for 48 hrs. Cells were then treated with either 10 M BrEA or DMSO vehicle for 1 hr 2 hr and 4 hrs. At each time point cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted using Qiagen Rneasy kit according to manufacturer s specification. Total RNA samples were then analyzed by Mergen Ltd. San Leandro Calif. www.mergen.com to perform microarray assay.

For the microarray assay Dnase treated total RNA 20 micrograms was reverse transcribed using an oligo dT T7 promoter primer consisting of the nucleotide binding sequence for the T7 RNA polymerase followed by 24 thymidine nucleotides . This was followed by second strand synthesis. The reaction mixture was then treated with Rnase I to digest the remaining RNA. The double stranded cDNA was phenol chloroform extracted and used as template for in vitro transcription T7 MEGAscript Ambion Inc. to generate biotin labeled cRNA probes. These probes were hybridized overnight at 30 C. with continuous agitation to Mergen s ExpressChip HO5 DNA Microarray System catalog number HO5 001 containing 12 000 genes. The arrays were then washed and hybridized probes were detected using Mergen s cyanine 3 fluorescent dye conjugated protein. Chips were imaged using an Affymetrix 417 418 form Affymetrix Genetic MicroSystems www.affymetrix.com and spot intensity was quantitated using ImaGene from BioDiscovery Inc. www.biodiscovery.com .

The results showed that BrEA was capable of substantially up regulating a number of genes. A number of genes were differentially regulated by BrEA based on two criteria 1 the expression level of any particular gene in a BrEA treated sample is at least two fold higher than that of the control treated sample and 2 the expression level of any particular gene in a BrEA treated sample is significantly higher than background. The up regulation of many of these genes most apparent at 4 hr after treatment at which time roughly 700 genes were within the above criteria. Some examples are shown in the following list. The ratios given in the list are from BrEA treated cells compared to control cells not treated with BrEA.

As seen from the data shown above BrEA was capable of inducing an increase in the level of transcription of a number of genes. These increases ranged from about a 2 fold increase to an increase of greater than about 1700 fold. For some genes levels of mRNA increased from a nearly undetectable level to a very high level. For genes that are modulated by the formula 1 compounds the level of mRNA protein or one or more biological activities associated with the gene product can thus include an increase or a decrease of at least about 3 fold at least about 5 fold at least about 10 fold at least about 20 fold at least about 50 fold or at least about 100 fold. This increase or decrease may occur for 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more of the affected genes.

Pathways through which BrEA may mediate its effects include one or more of the following. At 1 hr transcripts of USF1 c Fos EGR1 and CuI1 were increased. CuI1 activates NFkB1p50. At 2 hrs USF1 increases FCAR transcript levels. At 4 hrs c Fos C EBP stimulate transcription of RANTES NF B1p50 IL6 ICAM1 TSG TNFAIP6 and IL1 . NF B1p50 RelA induces IL 2R IL6 GRO2 and GRO3. At 5 hrs USF1 increases HO1 transcript levels. Alternatively at 4 hrs Jun B is also increased and c Fos JunB JunB ATF3 increase c Jun. c Fos c Jun increases ATF 3 MMP1 TNF and TSG 6 TNFAIP3 . Elevated AP1 or EGR1 increases TGF . ATF 3 c Jun c Fos increase MMP3. Activity associated with the presence of the NFkBp50 RelA complex increases IL 8. NFkBp50 STAT5A and STAT5B induce IL2R interleukin 2 receptor . STAT5B Induces CDKN1A. IFN R2 induces T bet. Other formula 1 compounds will generally affect one or more of these pathways in a similar manner.

In general the genes showing the greatest increases in expression belong to the following families chemokines GRO2 GRO3 SCYA1 SCYA4 SCYA20 and SCYA8 cytokines and their receptors IL1RN IL1B IL15RA and IL23A TNF related induced genes TRAF1 GG2 1 TNFAIP2 TNFAIP3 and TNFAIP6 and members of several different signal transduction pathways e.g. MAP3K5 STAT5A SSI 1 RGS16 and NF BIA . Changes in the expression level of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 or more of these genes or other genes described herein are useful as a screening assay or method to analyze other test compounds or other formula 1 compounds. The assay can identify the relative potency of the test compound compared to the activity of BrEA or a formula 1 compound or the assay can identify a distinct subset of the activities seen with BrEA or another formula 1 compound for example.

As discussed above BrEA was found to increase immunity in a non inflammatory cellular context e.g. in the absence of LPS here but BrEA decreased inflammation when the cells were in the presence of a strong inducer of inflammation. Thus BrEA was capable of mediating both apparently contradictory activities by context specific regulation of activities. The formula 1 compounds act differently in different tissues depending on the physiological condition of cells or tissues in a subject or cells or tissues in vitro. In multiple systems both in animals and in humans the formula 1 compounds appear to drive immune function toward homeostasis. This was observed in the context of HIV where BrEA stimulated immune response in a condition of immune suppression. But in the context of autoimmunity the formula 1 compounds generally limit unwanted autoimmune responses. Depending on the state of the target cell genes will be regulated in a manner that optimizes desired immune responses while limiting unwanted immune responses. Responses to formula 1 compounds in resting cells e.g. at vaccination will be different than responses in activated cells e.g. chronic inflammation .

Screening assays using a formula 1 compound or another compound would include any method that measures the expression level of one or more of these genes in the presence of a test compound as compared to their expression in the absence of the test compound and or compared to the expression seen with BrEA or another formula 1 compound. This can be done by microarray essentially as described above as well as by mini or custom array on a focused list of genes such as the list above and optionally including 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 or more of the genes disclosed herein quantitative PCR assays such as eXpres Profiling or real time PCR www.altheatech.com and Northern blot analysis. In some cases when a target gene product is a secreted protein such as SCYA1 measuring protein level in the culture media for cells in tissue culture by ELISA could also be used as a screening assay. Also cells for this type of analysis can be obtained from a subject who has been dosed with a formula 1 compound or another test compound. In this case the cells could be obtained from blood e.g. white blood cells or from bone marrow lymph tissue spleen tissue or thymus tissue.

It will be appreciated that the methods and compositions of the instant invention can be incorporated in the form of a variety of embodiments some of which are disclosed herein. It will be apparent to the artisan that other embodiments exist and do not depart from the scope of the invention. Thus the described embodiments are illustrative and should not be construed as restrictive.

For any of the uses of formula 1 compounds described herein e.g. in any of the examples above the results or biological effects that are obtained using individual formula 1 compounds are optionally compared to the results or biological effects that are obtained using a reference formula 1 compound such as 3 17 dihydroxyandrost 5 ene 3 7 17 trihydroxyandrost 5 ene or BrEA. A reference F1C can serve as a positive control or negative control for modulation of gene transcription or activity. Other known modulators of a gene whose biological activity is associated with a symptom or clinical condition of interest could also be used as a reference control with or without a reference F1C control. Such comparisons provide guidance for using the formula 1 compounds in the different methods or clinical conditions. Such comparison information allows e.g. tailoring of dosages dosing schedules routes of administration or drug interactions with other therapeutic treatments in any selected application for the F1Cs.

The effect of F1Cs on transcript or gene product levels in cells in vitro is studied in vitro using a cell type of interest e.g. the murine macrophage cell line designated RAW264.7 RAW cells . For the RAW cells the cells are maintained in a suitable medium e.g. RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 FBS standard Penn Strep antibiotic solution and 2 mM glutamine. The T1C is dissolved in a suitable solvent e.g. DMSO or pyrrolidone to generate a 10 mM stock solution. For DMSO solutions appropriate dilutions are made to give a F1C final concentration in culture media of about 1 nM to about 10 M with a final DMSO content of no more than 0.1 v v. The cells are induced with LPS at 100 ng ml stock solution in water diluted in serum free culture media .

In a typical protocol on day 0 the cells are plated at a density to reach a sub confluent state of greater than about 75 confluency on the following day. For 6 well plates about 500 000 to 700 000 cells well are plated. On the following day day 1 the cells are treated with the F1C or vehicle e.g. DMSO with or without LPS for selected times e.g. 0.5 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 16 24 36 48 hours. After incubation cells are harvested with a cell scraper and total RNA is extracted to generate samples for PCR analysis. 1 mL of culture media is optionally saved at 20 C. for future ELISA analysis to determine gene transcript levels. On day 2 cells are harvested after e.g. 24 hr of F1C in DMSO treatment. LPS induction is started in cells pre treated with F1C in e.g. DMSO. Exemplary treatment conditions and time points for cell harvesting are as follows
