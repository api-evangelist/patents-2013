This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 693 894 filed Aug. 28 2012 the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. M67854 10 C 6502 awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense and under Contract No. W912HQ 11 C 0031 awarded by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program of the U.S. Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Copper beryllium alloys are widely used in a variety of applications such as aerospace bushings and machine gun liners. Exposure to beryllium however can cause an often fatal lung illness. Thus the art has developed a need for alloys including but not limited to beryllium free alloys with mechanical and tribological properties competitive to those of copper beryllium alloys.

Aspects relate to an alloy and a manufactured article comprising the alloy as described herein. It should be understood that the disclosure is not limited in application to the details of construction and the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description. Other aspects and embodiments will be apparent in light of the following detailed description.

As used herein terms such as face centered cubic or FCC hexagonal close packed or HCP primary carbide and L1phase include definitions that are generally known in the art.

Any recited range described herein is to be understood to encompass and include all values within that range without the necessity for an explicit recitation. Use of the word about to describe a particular recited amount or range of amounts is meant to indicate that values very near to the recited amount are included in that amount such as but not limited to values that could or naturally would be accounted for due to instrument and or human error in forming measurements.

In a general sense the inventors have unexpectedly found new compositions of beryllium free alloys that achieve nano scale precipitation strengthening in a cobalt based FCC matrix. It is contemplated that the low stacking fault energy of the cobalt based FCC matrix in an alloy with more than about 10 Cr in weight percentage results in good wear resistance and a high work hardening rate. The disclosed alloys include a suitable content of chromium to provide good resistance to corrosion and erosion. Known cobalt based alloys such as ACUBE 100 by Carpenter Technology Corporation achieve strength predominantly through warm working with a nominal composition in weight percentage of 28 Cr 5.5 Mo 0.7 Mn 0.6 Si 0.17 N 0.05 C up to 1 Fe up to 1 Ni and the balance Co and incidental elements and impurities. The applicable product size of ACUBE 100 is thus typically limited to less than 4 inches in diameter. Moreover when tempered at 700 C. 850 C. ACUBE 100 forms HCP precipitates that can significantly reduce ductility. Other known cobalt based alloys such as the Stellite alloys are strengthened by primary carbides that also can limit ductility and formability. In contrast the disclosed alloys are strengthened by precipitates that are about 100 nm or less in diameter.

Referring to in an aspect the disclosure relates to an alloy that generally includes a low misfit nanostructure in a cobalt based FCC matrix. Such alloys would be useful for manufactured articles including but not limited to the main landing gear lugs for attaching the wings and vertical tail hinge assembly of an aircraft. Additionally the alloys would be useful for manufactured articles such as gun barrels and liners. The alloys would also be useful for numerous other applications wherein a low misfit nanostructure in a cobalt based FCC matrix is desired. As illustrated in a set of suitable alloy properties can be selected depending on the desired performance of the manufactured article namely environmental friendliness bearing strength wear resistance damage tolerance formability and corrosion resistance. Suitable alloy properties include non toxicity strength of about 830 MPa to about 1240 MPa without requiring warm working or cold working a low coefficient of friction a good resistance to galling and fretting high toughness and corrosion resistance. These alloy properties can be achieved by structural characteristics such as an FCC matrix that avoids transformation to HCP and shows a low stacking fault energy and solid solution strengthening a low misfit nanostructure such as of an L1phase with a suitable size and fraction the nanostructure avoiding embrittling phases a grain structure with a suitable grain size and pinning particles avoiding cellular reaction at the grain boundaries and a solidification path that ends in a eutectic phase. Alloys exhibiting these structural characteristics can be accessed through the sequential processing steps shown on the left of . The microstructural features affected during the processing steps are connected by lines to each processing step.

The nanostructure in the disclosed alloys can be an L1or phase based on CoTi. The disclosed alloys can reduce the lattice parameter misfit between the precipitate phase and the FCC matrix and thereby substantially avoid discontinuous grain boundary reactions or cellular growth reactions at the grain boundaries. It is contemplated that the interphase misfit and the precipitation of HCP NiTi particles can result in discontinuous grain boundary reactions or cellular growth reactions at the grain boundaries. The disclosed alloys include a suitable content of vanadium iron or tungsten or a combination thereof to reduce the interphase misfit and thereby substantially avoid discontinuous grain boundary reactions or cellular growth reactions at the grain boundaries. The vanadium iron and or tungsten atoms can partition at least in part to the CoTi based precipitate and reduce the lattice parameter misfit. For example the lattice parameter of the FCC matrix in the disclosed alloys is about 0.356 nm and Fe V and or W are expected to reduce the L1lattice parameter from about 0.361 nm of pure CoTi to 0.359 nm or less to reduce the lattice parameter misfit.

Still referring to in a further aspect the disclosure relates to an alloy that generally stabilizes the FCC matrix. The FCC matrix in cobalt based alloys is metastable compared to the HCP structure and therefore there is a tendency for FCC to transform to HCP at temperatures ranging from room temperature to a higher tempering temperature. The disclosed alloys include suitable contents of iron and nickel to substantially prevent the transformation from FCC to HCP while avoiding the formation of detrimental phases such as the FeTi Laves phase and the NiTi phase.

In embodiments the disclosure relates to an alloy comprising by weight about 10 to about 20 chromium about 4 to about 7 titanium about 1 to about 3 vanadium 0 to about 10 iron less than about 3 nickel 0 to about 10 tungsten less than about 1 molybdenum and the balance of weight percent comprising cobalt and incidental elements and impurities. It is noted that the embodiments described herein include a variation in each constituent of plus or minus ten percent of the recited value or values. It is also understood that the alloys described herein may consist only of the above mentioned constituents or may consist essentially of such constituents or in other embodiments may include additional constituents.

To select compositions with a suitable microstructure solidification paths and thermodynamic equilibria at various temperatures can be calculated with thermodynamics calculation packages such as Thermo Calc software version N offered by Thermo Calc Software AB of Sweden and a cobalt based database that QuesTek Innovations LLC developed based on open literature data.

A melt was prepared with the nominal composition in weight percentage of 18 Cr 5.9 Ti 4 Fe 1.8 V 1 Ni and the balance Co and incidental elements and impurities. As described above this example alloy includes a variance in the constituents in the range of plus or minus ten percent of the mean nominal value. The alloy in this example was arc melted as a button. For some applications the alloy can be prepared by investment casting. The as melted button was subjected to a homogenization and solution heat treatment at about 1060 C. and tempered at about 850 C. As illustrated in alloy B86 tempered at about 850 C. for about 8 hours shows annealing twins indicative of an FCC matrix with low stacking fault energy. The sample tempered at about 850 C. for about 8 hours is substantially devoid of discontinuous grain boundary reactions cellular growth reactions or unusual particles at the grain boundaries . As illustrated in the sample tempered at about 850 C. for about 24 hours also is substantially devoid of discontinuous grain boundary reactions cellular growth reactions or unusual particles at the grain boundaries . Referring also to scanning electron microscopy shows the annealing twins for a sample tempered at about 850 C. for about 24 hours at a higher magnification compared to . Referring also to the sample tempered at about 850 C. for about 24 hours shows precipitates that are about 100 nm or less in diameter. The nano scale particles are regularly shaped and aligned indicative of being coherent with the matrix.

Referring to the Vickers hardness number of alloy B86 increases from about 310 in the homogenized state to about 377 following tempering for about 24 hours at about 850 C. As shown in the following Table I these hardness values are estimated to correlate to about 970 and about 1240 MPa in ultimate tensile strength UTS at room temperature respectively which is a significant improvement over known alloys like the Stellite alloys or ACUBE in the non worked condition. For example cast Stellite 21 may achieve about 710 MPa in UTS powder metallurgy Stellite 21 may achieve about 1000 MPa in UTS cast Stellite 25 is fractured limited due to low ductility and therefore UTS is not reported L605 with the nominal composition in weight percentage of 10 Ni 20 Cr 15 W 1.5 Mn 0.33 C 3 Fe 0.4 Si and the balance Co and incidental elements and impurities is a common modification of Stellite 25 for wrought products with higher ductility and the UTS is 862 MPa at room temperature. It is contemplated that the strength of alloy B86 could be further increased through optional cold working.

A melt was prepared with a measured composition in weight percentage of 17.5 Cr 7.7 Fe 5.2 Ti 2.6 Ni 2.2 V and the balance Co and incidental elements and impurities. This example alloy includes a variance in the constituents in the range of up to plus or minus two weight percents. The alloy was vacuum induction melted and vacuum arc remelted to a cylindrical billet measuring about 10.2 cm in diameter and weighing about 13.6 kg. The as cast billet was subjected to a homogenization and solution heat treatment at about 1050 C. for 72 hours. An outer layer of the billet was removed resulting in a round bar measuring about 8.9 cm in diameter. The round bar was hot rolled at Special Metals Huntington W. Va. The hot rolling was performed at about 1000 C. for a reduction ratio of about eight to one resulting in a round cornered square bar measuring about 3.2 cm in one edge. Specimens were excised from the hot rolled bar and subjected to a sub solvus heat treatment and an aging heat treatment.

As listed in the following Table II the aged alloy 1A shows a UTS comparable to a copper beryllium alloy according to aerospace material specifications AMS 4533 at a much higher elongation compared. The wear resistance of the aged alloy 1A is significantly improved compared to the Cu Be alloy as demonstrated by lower coefficients of friction volume loss and wear rate.

It is understood that the disclosure may embody other specific forms without departing from the spirit or central characteristics thereof. The disclosure of aspects and embodiments therefore are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive. While specific embodiments have been illustrated and described other modifications may be made without significantly departing from the spirit of the invention. Unless noted otherwise all percentages listed herein are weight percentages.
