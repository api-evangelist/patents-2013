This application is a division of application Ser. No. 12 402 002 filed Mar. 11 2009 issuing as U.S. Pat. No. 8 556 031 on Oct. 15 2013 which is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 12 335 958 filed Dec. 16 2008 now abandoned both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties for all purposes.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N00024 03 C 5115 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to a tether device. More particularly the present invention relates to a tether device and method for tethering a user to a hull of a vessel to enable a user to draw him or herself toward the inward sloping portions of the vessel s hull to perform painting and other maintenance and repair tasks.

When ships and other vessels are floating in water and the hull of the vessel requires painting and or other maintenance and repairs a maintenance person must be lowered over the side of the vessel in a support harness to access the exterior side surface of the hull to perform the service. Some portions of the hull slope inward from the point of suspension. To reach these areas a secondary support must be used to draw the maintenance person close enough to the inward sloping portions of the hull to perform the task.

Permanently welded clips are provided on the hulls of vessels where tethering is required to perform painting and or other hull maintenance and repairs. The clips are accessed by the maintenance person using a grappling hook. The person then sequentially hooks on and off the clips to move along the hull. This requires a great deal of manual dexterity and increases safety risk during these maneuvers.

The use of welded clips has several disadvantages. The vessel s hull is weakened by the clip welding process due to heating. The discontinuities on the exterior surface of the hull promote corrosion because the paint film is less durable in these areas. Many ships and vessels have in excess of 100 clips welded to the exterior surface of the hull.

Disclosed herein is a tether device comprising a magnetic base a pole having a first end attached to the magnetic base and a connector or clip attached at a second end of the pole the connector or clip for removably connecting the tethering device to a user.

Also disclosed herein is a method for tethering a user to a hull of a vessel. The method comprises the steps of providing a tether device comprising a magnetic base a pole having a first end attached to the magnetic base and a connector or clip attached at a second end of the pole connecting the connector or clip to the user and engaging the magnetic base with the hull of the vessel.

In one embodiment as shown in the magnetic base comprises a housing and one or more electromagnets disposed within the housing . The housing includes a top wall at least one side wall depending from the top wall and a bottom wall The top and side walls of the housing form an internal compartment for containing the one or more electromagnets . The electromagnets are powered by a power source. In one embodiment the power source may comprise a battery disposed in the internal compartment of the housing with the electromagnets . In an alternative embodiment the power source may comprise an alternating current source. The current source may be obtained from the vessel with suitable electrical power isolation to preclude a shock hazard. A switch arrangement may be provided for allowing a user to selectively connect and disconnect the power source to and from the electromagnets to respectively activate and deactivate of the magnetic base . A protective covering may be disposed on the bottom wall to protect the exterior surface of the vessel s hull from damage when the tether device is placed thereon. The protective covering may be of any suitable material for preventing marring of a hull s exterior surface. Examples of such materials include without limitation felt or other fabrics plastic natural or synthetic rubbers and polymeric foams. In a preferred embodiment the protective covering comprises the natural or synthetic rubber mentioned earlier because it provides a high degree of friction to prevent sliding.

When activated by the switch arrangement the one or more electromagnets should have sufficient magnetic strength to retain the tether device to the hull of the floating vessel when tethering the user thereto.

Referring again to the tethering pole is capable of being telescopically extended and collapsed to provide a variably adjustable length to suit stand off distance requirements. In one embodiment the telescopically adjustable tethering pole comprises a mount fixedly attached e.g. welded riveted screw fastened etc. to the top wall of the magnetic base housing two or more telescopically engaged tubes and the outer tube of which is fixedly connected or pivotally connected e.g. a ball and socket or like arrangement as shown in to the mount and a solid rod telescopically disposed within the inner tube The pole may be adapted and dimensioned to provide friction between the outer and inner tubes and and between the solid rod and inner tube to maintain the length of the pole once it has been extended or collapsed to a desired length. Alternatively the pole may include internal locking rings such as those found on photographic tripods to maintain the length of the pole once it has been extended or collapsed to a desired length. The outer tube may be fixedly connected to the mount using any suitable method. For example one or more set screws may be used for fixedly connecting the outer tube to the mount or the outer tube may be threaded into the mount . The outer tube may also be pivotally connected to the mount using any suitable method. For example a ball and socket ball joint arrangement shown in may be used for pivotally connecting the outer tube to the mount . The connector or clip may be fixedly attached to a free end portion of the rod . The connector or clip may comprise a quick release hook or in another embodiment a solid loop and a carabiner to allow for attachment and release.

As shown in the tether device allows a user to draw him or herself toward the inward sloping portions of the vessel s hull to perform painting and other maintenance and repair tasks while the vessel is floating on water . The tether device may also be used to work on non sloped sections of the vessel s hull . In one embodiment the user attaches the connector or clip of the tether device to the user s suspension harness clothing footwear helmet belt and other articles worn denoted generally by reference numeral by the user . After the connector or clip has been attached to the user the user is lowered over the side of the floating vessel adjacent to a sloped section of the hull of the floating vessel . The user then activates the electromagnets of the magnetic base by way of the switch arrangement and extends the tethering pole to attach the tether device via the magnetic base to the sloped section of the hull at a selected location thereof and pulls himself or herself toward the hull of the vessel by collapsing the tethering pole and locking the pole to the desired length. Once the tether pole is collapsed the user may attach a strap shown in to the magnetic base and disconnect the tethering pole to allow for greater freedom of movement while performing tasks.

When work at that location of the vessel is completed the user deactivates the electromagnets of the base via the switch arrangement thereby releasing the magnetic base and thus the tether device from the hull of the vessel . If desired the user can then relocate the magnetic base of the tether device to another location of the hull and repeat the procedure described immediately above. Once work on the vessel has been completed and the user is back on the vessel or dock the connector or clip may be disconnected from the user s suspension harness clothing belt footwear helmet and other worn article .

In an alternate embodiment the electro magnets may be replaced by one or more permanent magnets. As in the previous embodiment the one or more permanent magnets should have sufficient magnetic strength to retain the tether device on the hull of the floating vessel when tethering the user thereto. In this embodiment magnetic base of the tethering device may be attached and released from the hull of the floating vessel thru mechanical leverage.

In another alternate embodiment the tethering pole may comprise a single tube instead of the two or more telescopically engaged tubes as previously described. The single tube may be fixedly or pivotally connected to the mount and a solid rod with a connector or clip fixedly attached to a free end portion thereof may be telescopically disposed within the tube.

The tethering pole in still another alternate embodiment may comprise a fixed length solid shaft. A first end of the shaft may be fixedly or pivotally connected to the top wall of the magnetic base housing. The connector or clip may be fixedly attached to the free end portion of the rod.

While the foregoing invention has been described with reference to the above various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly all such modifications and changes are considered to be within the scope of the appended claims.
