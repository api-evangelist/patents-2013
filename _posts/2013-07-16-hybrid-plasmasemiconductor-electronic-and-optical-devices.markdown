This invention was made with government support under Grant No. FA 9550 07 1 0003 awarded by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Fields of the invention include microplasma and macroplasma generation. Applications of the invention include semiconductor devices optoelectronics photonics microelectronics and plasma electronics.

Modern electronics rely on solid state materials and solid state semiconductors in particular. However plasma based electronic devices assumed a significant role in communications and display systems in the first half of the 20century. Vacuum tubes were previously used to amplify and switch signals but have been largely replaced by solid state devices. Vacuum tubes continue however to be employed in specialized applications such as in the final amplifier of high power radio transmitters.

Macroplasma devices have also been used in older communications and display systems. One example is the plasma electron tube such as the OA OB OC and OD series of rare gas plasma voltage regulators that was widely incorporated into audio equipment as well as the power supplies of RF transmitters and receivers. Other examples include plasma switches and the 866A and 872 mercury plasma high voltage rectifiers that found application in early RF transmitters. Another example is the Nixie tube a neon plasma based device that was an essential component of alphanumeric displays for a number of decades in the twentieth century.

Subsequent applications of plasmas to electronics or displays have often required imposing external voltages or magnetic fields so as to influence the electromagnetic field distribution in the plasma. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 765 073 discloses a field controlled plasma discharge display element serving as a light source element in plasma discharge electrostatic printers. The display element includes a pair of discharge electrodes and a third electrode positioned external and proximate to the discharge electrodes for the purpose of generating a control electric field. This control electric field is able to vary the intensity of the plasma discharge and its spatial distribution by distorting the shape of the discharge electric field. In this and other similar devices a degree of control over the properties of a plasma is exerted by an auxiliary device or structure where auxiliary indicates that the added device or structure is not required for sustenance of the plasma. Soclof U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 399 summarizes typical prior devices that inject electrons into vacuum with a reverse biased pn junction and subsequently accelerate and collect the electrons with an anode.

Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic representations that will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art of the description that follows. Features can be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis and features may not be to scale. Artisans will recognize broader aspects of the invention from the description of the preferred embodiments.

An anode for the plasma collector can be fabricated from any conducting or semiconducting material including metals Group IV and Group III V semiconductors organic semiconductors etc. Other embodiments of the invention employ negative electron affinity NEA materials to reduce the cathode fall voltage associated with the collector plasma. The device of for example can be fabricated from n type and p type diamond. Since the p type diamond can exhibit NEA and serves as the cathode of the collector plasma as well as the base of the transistor the NEA will lower the cathode fall voltage. Consequently embodiments of the invention can serve to tailor the cathode fall voltage in nonequilibrium plasmas. The result is a reduced operating voltage for the collector plasma.

The anode in the transistor is illustrated as having a general plate shape but it can also take on a wide variety of shapes including a plate pin cone ring mesh etc. The voltage sources and can provide a DC voltage and or a time varying waveform such as a sinusoidal pulsed or other type of time varying voltage waveform. The voltage source can be of course be realized as a DC component that is part of an integrated power supply with the voltage source that supplies a time varying waveform i.e. the voltage source may include voltage source or also provide the function of voltage source . Suitable plasma media that permit generation of the plasma include gas es vapor s or a combination thereof. In addition to providing the electronic function of a semiconductor to act as the collector of the transistor the macro or microplasma also generates emissions in the infrared visible and or ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. A solid state base and emitter complete the transistor. The base is preferably thinner than the emitter as a thin base tends to minimize recombination losses. The wavelength of the plasma emissions can be tailored using different gas es and or vapor s . The plasma collector shown in is integral to the entire device. The plasma collector serves the same purpose as the n type semiconductor region in the collector of a conventional solid state npn transistor except that the plasma collector is additionally capable of emitting light.

The base collector junction is reverse biased. The imposition of a voltage onto the plasma collector anode produces an electric field within the collector as illustrated in the operational diagram of . This field is oriented such that electrons tunneling through or surmounting the narrow potential barrier at the base collector interface will be transported to the anode. Owing to the physical interface between the n type vapor phase plasma collector and the p type base a plasma sheath lies at the collector base junction and the sheath electric field penetrates a distance into the base that is dependent on the doping level of the base . This intense electric field across the collector base junction assists the tunneling of electrons having diffused from the emitter base junction through the potential barrier at the collector base junction.

The pn junction in devices of the present invention can be forward biased in which case the insertion of the plasma between the base and the anode narrows the potential barrier through which electrons from the base tunnel. This occurs as a result of the plasma sheath that serves as an interface between the solid state semiconductor base and the bulk plasma . Most of the potential difference imposed on the plasma appears across the sheath thereby producing electric field strengths at the surface of the base i.e. base collector junction much greater than those readily produced with an anode in vacuum. In a microplasma operating at atmospheric pressure for example the electric field strength in the plasma sheath is on the order of hundreds of kV cm. The strong electric field in the present invention steepens the slope of the tunneling barrier that faces the plasma thereby making the barrier narrower. Aside from emitting light yet another advantage of the plasma BJT of is that electrons entering the plasma from the transistor base are multiplied in the plasma by avalanche. No analogous mechanism exists in a vacuum. In summary the intense electric field in the sheath of the plasma collector facilitates electron tunneling through the potential barrier shown in . The avalanche process multiplies the electrons emerging from the base resulting in an enhancement in the emission of light from the plasma . It is noted that the ions in the sheath are accelerated toward the base where electrons are produced by secondary emission. This also contributes to the current in the collector .

The dielectric in preferred embodiments such as is silicon dioxide and the substrate is device quality silicon. Other exemplary suitable materials for the dielectric include silicon nitride aluminum oxide yttrium oxide or CVD grown dielectrics such as diamond and multilayer dielectric stacks. Also other device quality materials such as Group III V semiconductors can be used in place of silicon for the substrate. The specific choice of dielectric is dependent upon several factors including the material of the substrate the dielectric breakdown strength and the film quality porosity uniformity etc. that can be achieved with inexpensive deposition processes.

The device can be fabricated from silicon on insulator SOI wafers or on a p type wafer. In the case of fabrication from SOI substrates the SOI wafer includes two silicon wafers that sandwich a layer of silicon dioxide. The oxide is grown on one wafer and then is bonded to the other silicon wafer. Typically the thicker of the two is referred to as the handle wafer or layer. This is usually several hundreds of microns thick. The typical range of the thickness of the sandwiched oxide is nominally 0.5 m 5 m. The other silicon layer of the SOI structure is commonly referred to as the device wafer or layer. The thickness of this layer can vary from as little as 1 m to the same thickness as that of the handle wafer.

A cross sectional diagram of another preferred embodiment npn hybrid plasma transistor is shown in . The difference in this embodiment from the embodiment is the position of the external collector anode and accordingly emitter with changes in the position of the contacts. This embodiment illustrates the principle that the plasma collector can be a macroplasma instead of a microplasma. In the embodiment of the macroplasma is not confined laterally and can occupy a substantial volume tens of cmto liters . There is no upper or lower size limit to the device in general. The limiting factor to device operation is when the electric field at the cathode upper surface of base layer is sufficiently intense to cause either avalanche breakdown of the collector base junction and or punch through. Punch through occurs when the electric field at the cathode is sufficiently strong to cause the collector base depletion region to extend to the emitter base junction. In the embodiment the layer does not have to be conducting and materials such as glass and ceramics can be used. Alternatively the layer can be completely omitted.

The voltages and gas pressures required for the embodiment of the are dependent upon three factors the shape geometry of the anode the gap between the anode and the p type silicon base the identity of the gas and its pressure. As an example an anode base gap of 1 mm will require a neon or argon pressure in the range of nominally 10 100 Torr. Larger gaps require lower gas pressure and vice versa. With a sufficiently small anode base cathode gap typically less than about 400 m operation at atmospheric pressure is possible. In the illustrated embodiment an enclosure encloses a plasma medium within the anode base gap. shows another embodiment transistor that is a modified version of the embodiment and includes an extra dielectric layer that isolates the walls of the microcavity from the plasma to protect the walls from the plasma. In the embodiment charge can build up on the microcavity walls which impacts the voltage current characteristics of the device.

Metal oxide field effect transistor MOSFET transistors can also be formed in accordance with the invention and three preferred embodiment MOSFET transistors of the invention are shown in B and C respectively. Each of these embodiments is a hybrid plasma semiconductor device in which a generated plasma or microplasma serves to control a conducting channel of the transistor. In a MOSFET transistor includes separate n source and drain regions which can be fabricated by diffusion into the surface of an n type substrate immediately below the surface of the substrate . A p type region is between the source and drain regions but in an opposite side of the substrate . The p type region is isolated from a second gate electrode by a gate dielectric film . The gate function is achieved by a plasma generated by a voltage potential applied by an anode and the plasma influences channel formation. The plasma is generated in the region between the n source and the anode and is isolated from portions of the substrate including the drain region and a channel region between the source and the drain by a dielectric film . During operation the plasma charges the exterior surface of the dielectric film negative because of electrons deposited on the surface of the dielectric film . This charge accumulation on the dielectric film as a result of the plasma serves the same purpose as a conventional gate in a solid state MOSFET since the negative charge build up will induce a depletion region underneath the dielectric film between the source and drain . If the plasma electron density is sufficiently high charge on the dielectric film will cause the depletion region to change to an inversion p type region that will eventually pinch off the MOSFET. Consequently the plasma serves to regulate the flow of current of the MOSFET. Application of a voltage to the gate electrode serves to tune the width of the conduction channel. The plasma can be modulated by the modulation of power provided to the anode thereby modulating the charge deposited on the dielectric film and varying the width of the depletion region and the conductivity of the conducting channel under the top oxide layer. That is the plasma serves as a gate to control a conduction channel induced between the n type source and drain regions. The MOSFET in is operating in depletion mode. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the device is capable of operation in either depletion or enhancement modes.

If the electrodes and above and below the cylindrical plasma channel device are fabricated in the form of rings then the embodiment of can also serve as an optical amplifier or laser. Forming laser gain could be achieved with installation and alignment of mirrors on either end of the device outside the electrodes and . Gases and gas mixtures suitable for laser action are well known in the art. The devices of can be photosensitive because the plasma is capable of absorbing incoming microwave and optical radiation.

The devices in can be modified by backside processing to add a cavity and diffuse a p type region near the channel. is a cross sectional diagram showing in detail one embodiment of the diffused p type region for the secondary gate of in the n type semiconductor . Processing of an n type semiconductor wafer begins by etching the wafer from the backside to create a microcavity in the spatial region in which the location of a secondary gate is desired. After forming the p type region by diffusing an appropriate dopant into the wall of the etched cavity then dielectric film is deposited or grown on both sides of the wafer. Finally the metal layer secondary gate electrode is deposited within the cavity . The cavity on the wafer backside brings the p type region in closer proximity to the top surface of the wafer where the plasma induces the conduction channel.

Plasma bipolar junction transistors of the embodiment of have been fabricated at the University of Illinois and tested successfully. Preliminary data were obtained with the simple circuit of . In the symbol adopted for the npn hybrid plasma transistor is almost identical to that for a conventional npn bipolar transistor except for the solid dot and semicircle inserted into the collector lead. In the last century the presence of a solid dot within the symbol for an electron tube indicated that the tube was gas filled thus generating a gas phase plasma suitable for voltage regulation modulation or switching illustrates an amplifier circuit that is based upon the hybrid BJT transistor. This simple circuit allows for both DC and AC signals to be applied to the base.

The data of were obtained with the same npn plasma BJT that yielded the results of . In this situation Vvarying from 0.7 V to approximately 1.5 V the plasma is completely extinguished when Vfalls below 0.5 V. It is interesting to note that ibecomes negative prior to extinguishing the plasma. This is the result of photocurrent generated at the base collector junction by light emission from the plasma as exemplified by the return of ito zero once the plasma is fully extinguished. Artisans will appreciate that electron hole pairs are produced in the base near the collector base junction only by photons produced by the collector that have an energy greater than the bandgap energy of the base semiconductor.

The embodiments include an additional thin conducting metal layer facing the plasma . This conducting layer is ideally but not necessarily thinner than the mean free path of the electron in the layer. The conducting layer e.g. a metal layer is able to passivate the surface of the solid state semiconductor p type base and or reduce degradation of the surface of the solid state semiconductor while still allowing electrons to be injected into the plasma . In addition the conductive layer can inhibit phototransistor operation and associated positive feedback effects. The metal can occupy anywhere from a small region of the plasma cathode surface up to as much as the entire surface. illustrates qualitatively the variation of the energy of the conduction band edge E throughout the n p n plasma BJT of .

Electronic circuits can be formed with pluralities of devices of the invention. Standard semiconductor fabrication techniques are capable of producing arrays of microcavities patterns of active regions and arrays of electrodes etc. and are similarly capable of producing arrays of hybrid plasma semiconductor devices of the invention for any of the above illustrated embodiments. is a simple diagram illustrating an array of hybrid plasma semiconducting devices of the invention that can be interconnected for example to form complex operational circuits. Devices of the invention can be employed to replace semiconductor transistors vacuum tubes photodetectors and light emitters in electronic circuits such as amplifiers switches photodetectors oscillators and other types of devices that will be apparent to artisans.

Although embodiments have been shown in which a plasma replaces the n type collector of an npn BJT it should be emphasized that a second plasma could also replace the n type emitter. In this case the emitter base bias will likely be larger than that for the embodiments of and for example in which both the emitter and base are semiconductors. However since both the emitter and collector in the double plasma embodiment are plasmas and the base region thickness is less than the diffusion length of electrons a plasma emitter n type semiconductor base p type plasma collector n type BJT is expected to be able to tolerate large power loadings. Another possibility is to use a semiconductor as the collector and emitter regions and have the plasma serve as the n type base in a pnp plasma BJT. Finally it should be noted that other embodiments of the invention utilize plasmas in which massive negative ions such as I are the dominant negative charge carrier. If the dominant positive charge carrier is a light ion such as the proton H then the electrical characteristics of the plasma will be largely dictated by the positive ions electronegative plasma . Thus the plasma will resemble p type semiconductor material and pnp plasma semiconductor transistors can be realized. The version of such a transistor would be a p n p plasma device.

While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it should be understood that other modifications substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be determined from the appended claims.
