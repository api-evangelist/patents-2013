title: Systems and methods for collaborative storytelling in a virtual space
abstract: User-submitted content (e.g., stories) may be associated with descriptive metadata (intersection metadata), such as a timeframe, location, tags, and so on. Story content is presented in a virtual space, such as a forum, chatroom, or the like. Users submit collaborative content as the story is presented in the virtual space. The collaborative content is synchronized to presentation of the story. An author may replay the presentation and synchronized collaborative content and/or select portions of the collaborative content for inclusion in the story.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 542 531 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COLLABORATIVE STORYTELLING IN A VIRTUAL SPACE filed Jul. 5 2012 for Peter Rinearson which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 504 648 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COLLABORATIVE STORYTELLING IN A VIRTUAL SPACE filed Jul. 5 2011 for Peter Rinearson and which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 114 959 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING INTERSECTIONS USING CONTENT METADATA filed May 24 2011 and which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 347 815 entitled INTERSECT filed May 24 2010 for Peter Rinearson each of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.

This disclosure relates to user submitted content and in particular to maintaining associations between user submitted story content and commentary.

Websites and or web services featuring user submitted content are becoming increasingly popular and are among the most heavily trafficked websites on the Internet. Content submitted to such websites is often transient and can be lost or removed over time. Moreover given the high volume of user submitted content it may be difficult to find content of interest to particular users.

As will be described below the value of user submitted content may be increased by associating the content with descriptive metadata including but not limited to intersection metadata such as timeframe and location . As used herein content user submitted content and or a content item may refer to any content or content item known in the art including but not limited to text images video audio executable code markup language attachments or the like. In some embodiments the intersection metadata may include a timeframe and or location among other things . The timeframe and location metadata may be used to group the content of a particular user into a chronology identify intersections between an intersection criteria e.g. timeframe and or location and content provide for convenient browsing and or searching within dynamic intersection spaces and so on.

The teachings of the disclosure may be implemented using a generalized network accessible service which may be configured to allow users to author contribute upload and or publish user submitted content manage content collections e.g. storylines present content including user submitted content search or browse user submitted content manage user profile or account information maintain user privacy settings manage access control preferences and so on as disclosed herein. Accordingly the network accessible service may comprise one or more computing devices datastores e.g. databases computer readable storage media directories and the like communications interfaces and other hardware and or software components.

Users may access the network accessible service using a computing device such as a personal computer a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a kiosk a cellular phone a Smartphone a handheld computer a notebook computer a netbook a tablet computer or the like. User access may be provided via any communication mechanisms known in the art including but not limited to a Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP network e.g. the Internet a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN a Virtual Private Network VPN a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN a wireless network e.g. radio IEEE 802.11 a combination of networks and so on.

In some embodiments the network accessible service may provide various user interfaces adapted for display on the various types of computing devices described above. The interfaces may be implemented using any user interface mechanism known in the art. The interfaces may be provided as Hyper Text Markup Language HTML interfaces Virtual Reality Modeling Language VRML interfaces text interfaces e.g. TELNET audio interfaces Accessibility interfaces e.g. a11y interfaces and so on. Alternatively or in addition the network accessible service may be configured to interact with one or more dedicated client application s which may be special purpose applications installed on a user computing device and or operating as plug ins to other applications e.g. operating as a browser application plug in an applet or app or the like .

In some embodiments a network accessible service may be implemented as a website a computing system comprising one or more server computing devices . The website may be configured to provide interfaces and or interface components in a browser renderable format such as HTML. However as discussed above the disclosure is not limited in this regard and could be implemented using any interaction technique known in the art.

A contributor may submit a story to a network accessible service e.g. website . As used herein a story may comprise content one or more content items and associated descriptive metadata including intersection metadata . A story may contain one or more content items which as described above may include but are not limited to images video text audio executable code and the like. Accordingly as used herein a story refers to a single content item e.g. a single picture a collection of content items or the same of different types e.g. photos with accompanying text multi media content metadata external content e.g. linked imported or referenced content or the like. For example a story may consist of metadata that is not linked to any particular content item but which conveys that a person was present or interested in a particular time location and or subject matter represented by the metadata regardless of the story content if any story metadata may determine the timeframe and or location of the story in the absence of any story content. A story may consist of metadata that is linked to or otherwise references external content such as content that is not stored on and or maintained by the network accessible service. For example a story may consist of a link or reference to a blog post or article on an online newspaper plus metadata potentially including time and or location about the post or article. Story content e.g. story content items may comprise user submitted content user authored content linked content e.g. content submitted by other users and or available at network accessible locations such as other websites or services or the like as described above. A story may be associated with metadata such as a timeframe location information people identified as story participants people identified as finding the story of interest identification of the story contributor descriptive tags rating information and so on. The timeframe and location metadata of a story may be used as intersection metadata in that they determine an intersection of time and place.

Timeframe metadata may specify the prevailing time of a story. In some embodiments the timeframe may indicate the timeframe during which the events described in a story took place. The story timeframe may be determined by the story contributor. For example the timeframe of a story about a sporting event e.g. football game may comprise the time from the kickoff to the end of the game a story about a particular play may be assigned a different timeframe e.g. the last thirty seconds of the game and the timeframe of a story about a fan s experience at the game may start when the fan arrives at the parking lot to tailgate and end in the middle of the first half when the fan becomes sick and has to leave. Alternatively or in addition timeframe metadata may be used to indicate a time period during which the story is relevant and in some cases may be open ended. For instance the timeframe of a story about the contributor s life in a particular town may begin at the time the contributor moves to the town and may not be assigned an ending point until the contributor moves away.

In some embodiments the timeframe may be expressed using an alias. For example a contributor may not want to let other users know his her true age. Therefore in a story describing the contributor s high school graduation the timeframe may be specified as simply graduation day or senior year. The timeframe alias may be associated with an actual timeframe. However access to the actual timeframe may be limited to certain trusted users e.g. the contributor s family and friends . As will be discussed below the use of an alias to specify story metadata contributor timeframe location or the like may determine how other users can find the story. For example a user may not be able to find the story based on timeframe unless the user has access to the actual time of the story.

Story location metadata may indicate the prevailing location of a story. In some examples the location may identify where the events described in the story took place. For example a story about a sporting event may specify the location of the stadium. The location may be specified at varying levels of detail or granularity. For instance the location metadata of a sporting event story may indicate the section and or row where the contributor was sitting. Alternatively the location may be specified more broadly to include a region around the events e.g. the entire stadium the city in which the game was played and so on . Location metadata may describe where an event or other story took place or alternatively it may describe the vantage from which the event was observed or the story told. For example when Central Park in New York City is observed and photographed from the Empire State Building the location metadata may describe either or both of the subject Central Park or vantage Empire State Building . Location metadata may be used to indicate that the story took place at multiple locations. For instance a story about a marathon may include location metadata that encompasses the race course. In some embodiments the location may be tied to the timeframe information e.g. to allow the metadata to reflect the contributor s progress through the race course over time . As will be discussed below the location of a story and in particular the granularity of a story s location information may determine inter alia how the story is presented to users on network accessible service e.g. website and or included in intersection spaces.

Although in some cases the location of a story may be a real world location such as an address or set of coordinates the disclosure is not limited in this regard. A story may be associated with a virtual location in place of and or in addition to a real world location. A virtual location may or may not exist in the real world. In some cases a virtual location may provide a more accurate description of a story location than any physical location could. A virtual location may identify a particular chatroom a fictional location e.g. Narnia a location within a virtual world such as the Playstation Home network or Second Life or the like. For instance a story pertaining to a battle in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game MMOG may be associated with the game location where the battle took place e.g. the dungeon of Thor in place of or in addition to the player s home address. Similarly a story about a conversation in a chatroom or other virtual space e.g. Second Life chatroom Skype call etc. may be associated with virtual location e.g. in the namespace of the virtual space such as a name of the chatroom an address in Second Life or the like .

In some embodiments users collaborate on story content in a virtual space such an online forum Skype conversation instant messenger etc. Story content is presented in the virtual space and contributors submit collaborative content e.g. commentary and or annotations which is synchronized to the presentation and or to story content itself. An author may selectively incorporate the collaborative content into the story which is associated with intersection metadata and consumed by the network accessible system disclosed herein. The intersection metadata of the story may comprise a real world time and or location associated with the story as well as intersection criteria identifying the virtual space. For example intersection metadata of a video chatroom conversation between participants in New York California and Nevada may identify the physical locations of the participants may identify the virtual space in which the collaboration took place e.g. the URL of the chatroom etc. and or identify the location of events pertaining to the story content itself.

In some cases stories occurring in the real world may be assigned a virtual location identifier or alias. The location of a story describing a trans Atlantic flight may be assigned a virtual location identifying the particular flight e.g. Delta flight 2548 as opposed to the geographical area traversed thereby. Similarly stories relating to experiences while at sea during a cruise may be assigned a virtual location identifying the cruise ship e.g. the Celebrity Infinity rather than and or in addition to the geographical location of the cruise ship. In some cases an authority may define and or maintain a namespace of virtual addresses e.g. in a similar way a map maker defines the namespace for physical locations . For instance an airline or cruise ship operator may maintain an address namespace to identify particular flights and or cruises. Similar namespaces may be developed for virtual worlds such as MMOG worlds chatrooms or the like.

Like the timeframe aliases discussed above location aliases may be used to control access to private sensitive or not fully public information. For example a user may define a home alias to refer to his her home address. When contributing stories pertinent to the home location the contributor may identify the location using the home alias as opposed to providing his her actual address. The contributor may determine who may have access to his her actual address information.

Users that the contributor trusts may be allowed to access the actual address of the home alias. Other users who the contributor may not trust may only have access to the home alias. As will be described below access to the actual location of a story may determine whether the story appears in a particular intersection space. For instance a user who has access to the contributor s actual home address not just the alias home will be able to find the story by its actual location by specifying a particular location of interest that includes the contributor s home address . Other users who do not have access to the contributor s home address will not be able to find the story by location in this way.

Participant metadata may be used to identify persons pertinent to the story such as those persons present and or involved in the events described in the story. Similarly interested persons metadata may identify the people e.g. users who have indicated an interest in the story or whom the contributor believes will be interested in the story such as persons who were in a location pertaining to the story during a timeframe of the story as indicated by story metadata. Contributor metadata may identify the user who contributed the story and or who participated in or provided assets used in the story. Descriptive tags may provide a concise set of descriptor for the story.

As discussed above in some embodiments a story location may refer to the location where the events described in the story took place. In some cases the story location may be different than the contributor s location. For example the contributor may contribute a story describing an event he she did not attend e.g. a story about watching a LiveAid concert the contributor watched from at home . The location of the story may be the location of the LiveAid concert and not the contributor s home. Alternatively the story may be associated with multiple locations. For example the contributor s story may describe a LiveAid concert party the story may therefore be associated with both the location of the party as well as the location of the LiveAid concert. In another example the location s associated with the story may be a combination of real and virtual locations. For example a contributor may host a LAN party at his home to play a MMOG the location of a story describing the LAN party may include the host s home as well as various virtual location s within the MMOG.

In some embodiments a user may select descriptive tags from a tag library of commonly used tags each of which may have an establishing meaning. Alternatively or in addition the user may define his own descriptive tags which may be any word or nonsense term that is useful to the user. In some embodiments the contributor may ascribe a meaning to the user defined tag by associating it with tags that have a well defined meaning. For example a user defined tag foo fighter may be associated with tags grunge rock rowdy and the like. The tags associated with the user defined tags may be used when as discussed below story content is identified and or filtered using descriptive tag metadata. For example the foo fighter tag may match with one or more of the associated tags such that a search for content marked as grunge will find the story and conversely when the user searches for items marked with foo fighter stories tagged with grunge rock and or rowdy may be identified.

A story may be associated with one or more contributors. The story contributor s may identify the one or more users who contributed to the story. The contributors may be identified individually and or as members of a group and such a group may in some instances be associated with a specific storyline. In some embodiments when a story is displayed by the network accessible service e.g. website the display may include an indicator of the story contributor s . The display may comprise a byline a photo of the contributor a link to the contributor s profile or the like. Various examples of a story display interface comprising an indicator of the story contributor are described below in conjunction with .

A contributor may contribute a story under an alias or pseudonym. The contributor may use the alias to publish a story without exposing his her identity. A contributor may however make his her true identity known to certain selected circles. For example a contributor may wish to publish a story on an embarrassing or sensitive topic with which the user may not want to be associated. In this case the contributor may use an alias to which no other user has access. In another example a contributor may publically publish a story pertaining to a controversial political issue. The contributor may want to hide his her true identify from the general public but may allow his her political friends circle to access his her identity behind the alias. Accordingly a user may specify multiple aliases each of which may be available within different circles or completely private .

As will be discussed below users may be allowed to comment on and or rate user submitted content. These ratings may be aggregated to form a user reputation or contributor rating. Examples of systems and methods for establishing and or displaying a contributor rating are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 540 171 entitled Systems and Methods for Calculating and Presenting a User Contributor Rating Index and filed Aug. 12 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

When a contributor applies an alias to a story story ratings may accrue to the alias and or the contributor himself. As such the alias may have its own user alias specific contributor rating which may be accessible independently. Alternatively or in addition ratings on stories submitted under a contributor s alias may flow to the contributor himself. Accordingly ratings for stories submitted by the contributor under an alias may be used to determine the contributor s overall rating. However the source of the ratings that flow through from an alias may be hidden from those users who are not authorized to access the alias.

The interface may include one or more inputs adapted to allow users to enter and or edit user contributed content such as a title contributor indicator images and or other media types such as video audio etc. text metadata described below and so on. As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art the interface could be adapted to include any type of input adapted to receive and or edit any type of content as such the interface should not be read as limited in this regard.

The title input may be used to provide a title to the story. As will be described below in some embodiments suggestions for a title may be derived from story text story intersection metadata location time descriptive tags etc. .

The interface may include a contributor indicator input which may be used to identify the story contributor and as such may be pre populated with the user name or other identifier of the story contributor. The contributor may modify the contents of the input to display a contributor alias which may be used to hide the identity of the contributor to other users and or selectively expose the contributor s identity within certain circles according to contributor defined access controls and or allow the story to be visible on one or more storylines that have different names identities . Accordingly the input may include a selection control e.g. a drop down box listing or other interface comprising contributor defined aliases which may set as the story byline via input . In some embodiments when the contributor enters text other than his her username into the input a new contributor alias may be created for use with the story.

The image input may allow a user to upload and or edit story images. The input may include scaling cropping and or other image editing features. Alternatively or in addition the input and or the other inputs of the interface may link to other assets hosted on other network accessible storage locations. For example images may be hosted at an image hosting website video hosted on a video hosting website and so on. Such assets may be linked and or embedded into the story and or may be imported and stored with other story content by the network accessible service e.g. website .

Although the interface is depicted as including a particular set of content inputs arranged as depicted in e.g. title byline images text and so on the disclosure is not limited in this regard. The interface or other interfaces may be adapted to include any number of story content inputs and or editing interfaces including but not limited to inputs configured to receive and or edit video audio interactive content e.g. Flash video applications and so on in any layout or ordering.

The interface may include inputs adapted to receive story metadata such as a timeframe input and a location input . The timeframe input may be capable of receiving an indication of a timeframe of the story the timeframe may specify a story starting time and or an ending time or may be open ended . The story timeframe may indicate the timeframe during which the story occurred indicate when the story was relevant or valid e.g. I lived in Seattle from 1980 to 1992 or the like. In some embodiments the start and or end time of a story may not be determined at the time the story is contributed. As such the input may be configured to accept open ended timeframe information e.g. accept timeframes that lack a start time and or an end time . Timeframe information may be specified at a later time via a story editing interface which may be similar to the interface .

The location input may be configured to receive location information as a particular address region set of coordinates or the like via a text input not shown . In some embodiments a story location may be specified using a map interface as shown in . The map may be a virtual map or index into a set of virtual locations as described above. The location input may include a set of location bookmarks which may keep a record of user defined story locations. In some embodiments the bookmarks may correspond to location aliases for which the contributor may specify access controls discussed below . Virtual locations may be defined within a particular namespace. Accordingly in some embodiments the location input may include additional map like interfaces or inputs not shown configured to allow users to specify a virtual address in an appropriate namespace.

In some embodiments the timeframe and or location information may be obtained from content uploaded as part of the story. For example an image received via the input may include timestamp and or location information as Exchangeable Image File Format EXIF data. The embedded timestamp and or location information may be used to seed the timeframe and or location inputs and or . Alternatively or in addition seed timestamp and or location information may be extracted from other story content such as video content text content or the like. For example natural language processing or other suitable text processing techniques may be used to extract time and or location information from story text which is used to seed the timeframe and or location inputs and or .

In some embodiments the interface may include a storyline input . As will be discussed below storylines may be used to determine how particular stories appear or are arranged within the network accessible service e.g. whether the stories are associated with a contributor lifeline and or whether the stories are included under other storylines . A storyline may be specified via a text input and or a lookup mechanism through which previously used and or defined storylines may be selected. In some embodiments a story may be included in multiple storylines in the example the story is included in the contributor s life storyline My Life and a Theater storyline which may be a contributor defined storyline describing the contributor s experiences at the theater.

In some embodiments the interface may include a descriptive tag input to associate descriptive tags with the story. For example the contributor may tag a story about a youth soccer game with soccer sports and youth tags a theater story with Theater Evening and Leisure and so on. The descriptive tags may be user defined and or selected from a tag library e.g. using a search or lookup function of the input as described above. As will be discussed below the descriptive tags may be used within the network accessible service e.g. website to provide for browsing and or searching within story content. For example stories within a particular intersection space may be identified and or filtered according to their respective descriptive tags.

In some embodiments the story title may be automatically determined from the story tags and or other story metadata . For example the title of a story tagged with soccer and game and having a location of Smith Park may be titled Smith Park Soccer Game. The contributor may edit the story title as he she sees fit. After receiving title text via the input changes and or additions to the descriptive tags and or other story content may not change the title .

The interface may include a participants input through which the contributor may identify one or more people who are pertinent to the story e.g. persons who participated in the events described in the story . For example in a story describing a dinner party the participants input may be used to identify the people or a subset of the people who attended the party. Story participants may be specified using a text entry field of the input and or using a lookup control which may allow the contributor to search through a set of users he she has identified in the past may comprise a directory of registered users or the like. In some cases a story participant may not have an account with the network accessible service e.g. website . In some embodiments an unregistered user may be represented as a semblance. As will be discussed below a semblance may be a contributor defined representation of another person who may or may not be a registered user of the service. In some embodiments when a previously unregistered user who was previously represented as a contributor defined semblance registers a user profile participant metadata and or other metadata previously associated with the contributor defined semblance may be reassigned so that it is associated with the registered user profile. In some embodiments this is achieved by merging the semblance with the profile of the registered user in another embodiment it is achieved by merging the semblance with a different semblance of the referenced individual and in yet another embodiment the semblance is maintained but its subject is identified unambiguously by being linked with the profile of the registered user.

In some embodiments the contributor may identify story participants in other ways. For example a story participant may have been captured in one of the story images . The contributor may identify the participant in the photograph using a region selection . The contributor may associate the selected region with a user or semblance as discussed above to include the person as a story participant. In some embodiments image or region may be used to represent the participant in the story participant metadata e.g. as in participant indicator . As will be described below users of the network accessible service e.g. website may establish a profile which may include one or more graphical depictions of the user e.g. user avatars . In some embodiments participants who have been identified e.g. tagged in a story image may use the image or image region as his her profile avatar. If the participant is not associated with a registered user e.g. is a semblance the image may be stored to identify the semblance in the story and or in other contexts e.g. when the semblance is identified as a participant in other stories etc. .

In some embodiments the interface may include an interested persons input which may be used to identify users who may be interested in the story but may not be story participants. For example the contributor may contribute a story regarding a news event a link or other item of general interest. Accordingly neither the contributor nor anyone the contributor knows may be properly identified as participants in the story. Instead the contributor may identify persons that may be interested in the event and or the contributor s story about the event . Potentially interested people may be identified as described above e.g. using a text input a lookup or directory and so on . Similarly the contributor may contribute a story about an event in which other persons who did not attend the event may be interested. For example the contributor may contribute a story about his child s recital including audio and or video of the event the child s grandparents may be identified as potentially interested persons since they may be interested in the story but did not attend the event e.g. are not proper story participants . In another example a contributor may write a story including a story that refers to an address on the Web that contains third party content that reflects interests rather than activities and identify other individuals who may hold a similar interest. In one embodiment a user may designate potentially interested persons for a story they did not contribute by tagging the individual much as they would tag an individual they identified as being a participant in a story that the user did not contribute.

The interface may be configured to prompt the contributor to indicate whether he she is a story participant and or interested person. Based upon the response the contributor or alias thereof may be added as a participant and or interested person.

The interface may include a story type input which may allow the contributor to select from various different story types. Selection of a story type may determine the default layout and or input options in the interface . For example a status story may be automatically tagged with a status descriptive tag in the input and may include a shorter text entry area . The selection of a biography story type for example may cause the interface to display a more complete set of input options such as multiple photograph upload locations multiple text inputs e.g. for title summary etc. sparker question prompt s discussed below and so on. In some embodiments different story types may be associated with different interfaces or templates. For example the biography story type may include an interface adapted to facilitate authoring biographical stories. The biography story interface may include a wizard type interface configured to guide the contributor through the authoring process e.g. including appropriately selected sparker question prompts .

A rating story type may include rating inputs e.g. sliders drop down boxes etc. which may be used to rate the subject of the story or content items thereof . For example a story that reviews a restaurant could contain a review of the restaurant or of elements described in the story such as the food or service of the restaurant. This type of story might include a control that allows a rating to be assigned and optionally displayed for example the rating might be expressed as a series of stars. The rating may pertain to the object of the story e.g. the restaurant as opposed to the story itself. Story types may further be divided into those that have the storyteller primarily as a participant in an activity and those that have the storyteller primarily as a party interested in a topic. The status of a story as a participant story or interested story could be expressed in various ways including but not limited to an explicit label a logo or other graphical treatment or the inclusion of the storyteller in a list of one or more individuals who are participants or interested with respect to the story.

Other story types such as the news story type may have certain security and or access control implications. As will be discussed below users who have been tagged as participants in a story may request to be removed therefrom. For example a user may not want others to know that he she was at a particular event or the user may have been misidentified maliciously or by mistake . If the story is a non news story and in some embodiments and or circumstances even if it is a news story the request for removal may be granted automatically. However in some embodiments if the story is identified as news it is treated by rules that tend to preserve the rights of the storyteller because the subject of the story is presumed to be a public figure or the events and circumstances described in the story are assumed as public or newsworthy. When a story is tagged as news participants especially participants who are not minors may not be given the absolute right to be removed. Instead assuming the news tag is not withdrawn or removed a participant might only be able to have himself or herself removed if it is determined that the participant was misidentified and or there are other extenuating circumstances. Users who are tagged as participants in a story may be given the right to submit comments on the story may have the right to comment . In some embodiments participant comments may only be removed if the corresponding participant is untagged or de identified as a story participant. User ratings of a story that a contributor designates as news may be evaluated in part as to whether the news designation is warranted or instead whether the designation is perceived as a ploy to tag individuals who are not rightly the subject of news coverage and who choose to be untagged if the story were not labeled as news. It is anticipated that a contributor who is perceived as abusing the right to label a story as news will see their reputation decline and with it their power to effectively abuse others. In some embodiments the disapproval of members of the public regarding the nature of the contributor s tagging practices will be expressed with the story.

An importance input may allow the user to provide an indication of the relative importance of the story from the user s perspective. As will be discussed below some stories may be identified as life changing marker events. These types of stories may be prominently displayed in the life of the contributor. Other events may be displayed less prominently. Accordingly the input may allow a user to specify how important the story is in his her opinion the input may comprise a continuum e.g. from 1 to 10 or a set of tags e.g. inconsequential routine minor significant critical life changing marker and so on . Alternatively or in addition an input may allow the user to provide an indication of the duration of the importance or relevance of the event. This can be thought of as the zoom level or highlight level of a story. A particular story about a bowling party might only be a highlight of a day or week but a story about a wedding reception might be a highlight of a year decade or lifetime the story about the bowling party might not appear in a storyline that was zoomed out to show a year or longer but the story of a wedding reception might appear even on a storyline that covers decades.

The contributor may apply access privileges to the story using the input . In some embodiments access to story content and or access to private story information such as location and or timeframe information may be predicated upon circle membership. Selection of a public publication may make the story available to all users of the network accessible service e.g. website . Alternatively the contributor may specify that the story is only to be available to a certain circle of users or that one or more elements of a story such as its exact location the presentation of certain photographs or the ability to see the tags and or captions of photographs may be limited to people belonging to one or more circles of users. A circle may comprise a group of one or more users that the contributor trusts to some degree or the people associated with a storyline. Circles may also be used to group users by the type of content they should receive e.g. friends as opposed to family . For example a family circle may comprise the contributor s family members a work circle may comprise the contributor s co workers a friends circle may comprise the contributor s friends and so on. The contributor may define the circles and determine circle membership when using his or her own circles. In some embodiments the user may be granted permission to use the circle of a different person or organization. The contributor may define any number of different circles corresponding to any number of different sets of relationship or intended audiences. The contributor may add remove circle users at any time or change the number and identity of the circles that have permission to consume a story. A user may be included in more than one circle e.g. a co worker may also be a friend . In one embodiment circles may be public which means that anybody looking at a user s profile can see the name of the public circle or circles and the person or people in those circles private which means that only the contributor who owns the circle can see who is in it or restricted which means that only the owner contributor and certain other people such as the other people in the circle can see who is in the circle . Using the input the contributor may select which circles should have access to the story. In one embodiment the contributor may select not only from among his or her own circles but also from among the public or restricted circles of others to the extent the contributor is a member of the restricted circles of others .

The interface may include a set of control inputs including a publish input which when selected may cause the story content and associated metadata to be made available to other users via a network in accordance with the access controls specified via the input . The interface may also include a save draft input which may save the story to be edited and or published later and or a cancel input to cancel the story discard the story content and or story metadata .

As discussed above in some embodiments the interface or other interface s may include prompts configured to inspire the contributor. The prompts referred to as sparker questions may be configured to spark the contributor s memory to inspire user submitted content. Therefore rather than simply placing the would be author before a blank page or interface waiting for a memory to present itself the contributor may come into the interface with an idea of what to contribute. The interface includes an exemplary sparker question prompt which as discussed below may be selected according to contributor profile and or other user contributed content e.g. intersection metadata other user contributed stories etc. and or information about the user obtained from other sources such as from FACEBOOK or other social networking service . In some embodiments a sparker question is presented as part of the contribution interface in some embodiments a sparker question is presented elsewhere outside the interface and leads the user to a contribution interface and in some embodiments a sparker question is placed both elsewhere and in the interface e.g. placed in a image input to suggest a photo or the like .

Some sparker question prompts may generally apply to all types of users e.g. did you ever get caught in the rain when was your first kiss and so on . Other sparker questions may be selected according to the contributor s profile information. As will be discussed below users may be associated with a profile which may indicate the user s age marital status familial status education level employment status interests hobbies and so on. The profile information may include information imported from other social media. The profile information may indicate which type of life milestones or life experiences the user is likely to experience at his her particular stage in life. Accordingly the profile may be used to determine the stage of life of the contributor. For example the profile of a user may indicate that she is a 23 year old divorced female with two kids. This user may be likely to have experiences related to raising children as a single mother e.g. school experiences play dates for the children daycare experiences and so on which may be significantly different than the experiences of other users e.g. a 70 year old retiree . Accordingly the sparker questions for the 23 year old female user may be significantly different than the questions posed to the 70 year old retiree. For that matter the sparker questions for a 23 year old divorced female with two children may differ from the questions for a 23 year old married female with two children a 23 year old married female without children or a 47 year old divorced female with two children and so on.

Changes to user profile information may prompt sparker questions. For example a change to the user s familial status e.g. a new child on the way may prompt sparker questions regarding plans for the new child experiences during pregnancy and so on. As will be discussed below in some embodiments a user s profile information may be tied to a relevant timeframe. For example a user s favorite song may be different in 2005 than it was in 2003. The user profile may include all of the user s favorite song preferences each associated with the timeframe during which the particular preference was valid e.g. from 1999 2001 the user s favorite song was A from 2002 2005 the user s favorite song was B and so on . Sparker questions may be derived from the history of changes in the user s profile e.g. why did your favorite song change from A to B in 2002 .

Other sparker questions may be prompted by content submitted by the user. For example the user may contribute a story describing a funeral which may prompt sparker questions related to the user s experiences with the deceased e.g. what do you wish you had learned from your grandfather before he died . The content used to identify sparker questions may be selected from the descriptive tags applied to the story and or provided via descriptive tag input . In some embodiments as descriptive tags are applied via the input relevant sparker questions may be presented in line as the user authors portions of the story in the interface . Other story metadata such as timeframe and or location may be used to identify relevant sparker questions. For example a story taking place far from the contributor s home may prompt sparker questions configured to elicit writing about the contributor s experiences traveling to the location and so on. In another example a record of interaction with one or more people whether on Intersect or other social media may prompt questions about those people.

In some embodiments the sparker question prompt includes a rating input through which the user provides feedback regarding sparker questions. The rating feedback may be used to select relevant sparker questions for the user and or select relevant sparker questions for other users in a similar stage of life.

At step information about the contributor may be accessed. The information may comprise user profile information content submitted by the contributor content harvested from one or more third party sources e.g. FACEBOOK TWITTER etc. and the like. As discussed above the user profile may comprise information describing the contributor. Entries in the user profile may be associated with a relevant timeframe which may reflect the changes to the user profile over time. Contributed content may include stories and associated metadata submitted by the contributor.

At step the information described above may be analyzed to identify a stage of life of the contributor. A stage of life may be assigned based on the age of the individual. A number of different stage life states may be identified potentially including but not limited to Caterpillar Early Child age 0 5 Socializer Child age 5 12 Shapeshifter Early Adolescent age 13 14 Tester Adolescent age 15 18 Parachuter Incoming Early Adult age 18 23 Explorer Early Adult age 23 28 Homesteader Navigator Independent Adult Part 1 age 33 36 Strider Independent Adult Part 2 age 36 40 Seeker Incoming Midlife Adult age 40 45 Mediator Midlife Adult Part I age 45 50 Mentor Midlife Adult Part II age 50 60 Discoverer Mature Adult age 60 70 Generator Senior Adult age 70 80 and Celebrator Elderly Adult age 80 .

The stage of life may provide some indication of the types of sparker questions that are likely to be relevant and or helpful to the user. In addition information regarding the user s place in life e.g. collection of life experiences which may include stage of life may be used in the selection of the sparker questions. For example in some cases two people may be of a similar age but be in very different places in life due to having different life changing marker events. For example a 23 year old divorced single mother is in a very different place in life than a single 23 year old post graduate student the place in life information of the user may be evaluated to select appropriate sparker questions for each user.

As will be discussed below the life experiences indicative of a user s place in life may be identified to the network accessible service by marking certain events as life changing marker events or milestones and or by examining other user submitted content and or metadata . For instance in the interface disclosed above a contributor may indicate his her opinion of the importance of a story e.g. life changing which may be used to identify a marker event. Alternatively or in addition marker events may be determined from the user profile information as discussed above e.g. marital status education level etc .

As will be discussed below identifying a user s stage and or place in life may be used to identify user affinities e.g. users in the same stage and or place may have a lot in common and as such may be introduced to one another through the service .

In some embodiments user disposition information discussed below may be used to select sparker questions. Some of the disposition indicators may apply for a limited period of time. For example a bereaved disposition may be identified for a contributor who has recently indicated through a profile update or contributed content that a close relative has died and may be removed after a certain time e.g. six months . The stage of life place in life and or disposition information discussed above may be identified for the contributor and used at steps and to select appropriate sparker questions for the contributor.

At step a datastore comprising a set of sparker questions may be accessed. The sparker questions may each be associated with a particular set of one or more stage of life indicators which may specify which stage of life is likely to benefit from the question. Accordingly a sparker question regarding experiences raising children may be associated with mother and or father indicators a dating question may be associated with single and or divorced indicators and so on.

At step a plurality of candidate sparker questions may be identified by matching the stage of life place in life and or disposition information of the contributor determined at step to the stage of life indicators of the sparker questions accessed at step . The matching may comprise ranking the sparker questions according to a degree of correlation between the contributor s stage of life and the sparker question indicators. In some embodiments the matching of step may be configured to prevent the same sparker questions from being constantly repeated. For example when a particular sparker question is presented the contributor may indicate whether the sparker question was helpful and or whether the contributor would like to see similar questions. In some embodiments the matching of step may further comprise a feedback component discussed below in which the contributor provides feedback regarding which sparker questions were helpful and which were not. The feedback information may be used to match other sparker questions and or to exclude certain unhelpful sparker questions in the future. The feedback may be used to remove a stage of life place in life or other classification s from the contributor a never remarried divorced contributor may not be interested in ever writing about dating experiences . Sparker questions similar to those identified as helpful may be used in further iterations of the method .

At step one or more of the identified sparker questions may be presented to the contributor in an interface such as the contribution interface . In other embodiments a sparker question or a group of sparker questions may be formed into a story template or story outline which the user may be prompted to complete. The outline may be presented in an interface such as the interface in which certain fields are pre populated and or the sparker questions are pre populated in the text entry field .

At step the user may provide feedback regarding a sparker question s presented at step . The feedback may indicate whether the sparker question was attractive and or effective at promoting the contributor to author content. The feedback may further indicate whether the contributor would like to see the question or similar questions in the future. The feedback may be stored in a datastore in association with the sparker questions and or the contributor s profile. As discussed above the feedback may be used when a next set of sparker questions are selected from the contributor.

Referring back to the text entry field may include a sparker question prompt . The sparker question prompt may include the text of a sparker question describe your first kiss as well as a feedback input . The contributor may author a response to the sparker question in line with the prompt . In some embodiments the prompt may act as an interface element e.g. text box to encapsulate the text related to the prompt to allow the contributor to keep track of which text was added in response to which sparker question s . In addition the text included in the prompt interface element may be used along with the feedback input to evaluate the efficacy of the prompt . In other embodiments the prompt may be removed if when the user enters text in the text field or selects other components on the interface .

Although the sparker question prompt is shown on the contribution interface the disclosure is not limited in this regard. Sparker question prompts could be displayed on any number and or types of different interfaces. For example a sparker question prompt may be displayed while the user views a story submitted by another contributor or while the user views content from or the identity of a user of a social media site such as FACEBOOK . In this case the sparker question prompt may ask whether the user has had an experience similar to the viewed story in the same timeframe and or location . The sparker question prompt may link the user to an interface e.g. interface which may be pre populated with a relevant set of content e.g. timeframe location descriptive tags prompt and so on .

As will be described below in some embodiments an interface may display a plurality of stories. The stories may be displayed in various different formats including a link badge format. Examples of a link badge display format are described below in conjunction with . A link badge format may include a photograph thumbnail if available taken from the story a story title a byline a text excerpt from the story an abbreviated list of story participants story intersection identifiers and so on. In some embodiments the content included in a story link badge may be automatically selected from the story. For example the first image in the story or a first frame of a story video may be selected for the thumbnail the first portion of the story title may be selected for the link badge title the first paragraph may be used as the excerpt and so on. Alternatively or in addition the contributor may explicitly author the link badge and or portions of the link badge. depicts one example of an interface for authoring a link badge. The interface may be displayed in connection with the contribution interface described above. For example the link badge authoring interface may be displayed along the sidebar of the interface with other inputs of the interface . Alternatively the interface window may be displayed on top of the interface e.g. as a selectively displayed overlay window .

In some embodiments the interface may include a title input which may be used to specify a title for the link badge. The title input may be pre populated with the contents of the title input of the underlying story or a portion of the contents of the title input of . The title input may change as the contributor edits the title of the story via input . The contributor may edit link badge title input to change the way the title is displayed in the link badge e.g. to be more concise in accordance with the smaller display format of the link badge . In some embodiments once the contributor explicitly edits the title input it may no longer be tied to the underlying story e.g. may no longer update responsive to changes to the story title .

The interface may include a link badge image input which may be used to select an image if any or image region to display in connection with the story link badge. The image may be selected from the underlying story or from some other source. In some embodiments the input may be pre populated with the first or primary image of the story if any . As the primary story image changes e.g. as story images are added removed in the interface the image input may be updated accordingly. In some embodiments however once the contributor explicitly selects the link badge image via the input changes to the story may no longer be reflected in the input . The link badge image input may include a scaling control which may be used to scale and or crop the image or image region in the link badge.

In some embodiments the interface may include a byline input which may be provided to allow the contributor to modify the contributor indicator of the story as displayed in the link badge . The byline input may be used to specify a contributor alias to hide the contributor s true identify from other users in the link badge as discussed above and or to remove the byline from the story link badge. In other embodiments the story byline may not be modifiable. The byline input may be pre populated and or be updated according to the contributor indicator information provided via the contribution interface via input . Once the contributor explicitly selects a byline via the input however the input may no longer update in response to changes in the underlying story.

The interface may include a text summary input to specify the primary text if any to be displayed in the link badge. The text input may be pre populated with a portion of the story text e.g. the first paragraph of the text input . The text input may be tied to the underlying story text until the contributor explicitly edits the text in the input .

In some embodiments the interface may include an intersection display input which may be used to specify how various intersection criteria of the story are displayed in the link badge. As will be discussed below intersection criteria may comprise story metadata such as story location timeframe contributor descriptive tags and the like. For example a particular intersection identifier may read intersection of Smith Park and 5 50 PM to 7 20 PM Jan. 4 2009 or soccer at Smith Park . . . and so on. The intersection identifier input may be tied to the underlying story metadata until the contributor explicitly edits the identifier or elects to remove the identifier from the link badge . In some embodiments the intersection identifier may not be modifiable. When displayed in link badge format and or in a story display such as the display of the story indicator may link to an interface configured to display other stories that intersect with the story e.g. stories in the intersection space of the story .

In some embodiments the interface may include additional inputs to modify other story elements and or metadata for display in link badge format including but not limited to story participants interested people descriptive tags storyline story type importance and so on.

In some embodiments the network accessible service e.g. website may provide search and or browse features discussed below to allow users to find story content using the metadata associated therewith such as the story timeframe and or location. These features may allow users to identify intersections between stories and particular timeframes and locations including the current time and location or other criteria . As used herein a time and location intersection referred to generally as an intersection refers to a similarity or overlap between the timeframe and location of a story a timeframe and or location of interest referred to generally as intersection criteria . For example intersection criteria may define a timeframe and or location of interest to a particular user such as the then current time and place the here and now or the time and place a youth sporting event took place. The intersection criteria may be provided by a user via a search or browsing interface such as the interfaces described below in conjunction with . Alternatively the intersection criteria may be derived from another story e.g. the intersection criteria may be derived from the intersection metadata of the story . In other examples intersection criteria may be derived from a current location of the user and or the current time as indicated by a computing device of the user such as a mobile phone portable computer tablet or the like .

In response to the intersection criteria components of the network accessible service e.g. website may be configured to identify one or more intersecting stories which are stories having metadata that intersects with the intersection criteria. For example the intersecting stories may include stories that have time and location metadata that overlaps with the time and location of the intersection criteria. The stories may be presented to the user in an interface and may be ordered based on a relevance metric discussed below . For example when a long timeframe is used and the content is ordered based on relevance or ratings the resulting intersection space may include best of stories for the specified location such as the most highly regarded reviews of a restaurant over a long time period.

The intersection criteria may be expressed as a timeframe and location . Like the locations and or the location intersection criteria may be specified with varying specificity the criteria may be expressed as a location point e.g. an address or location coordinate or as a larger region. Stories having metadata that overlaps the intersection criteria and may be identified as intersecting stories.

In the example the story may be identified as an intersecting story. The timeframes and intersect with the timeframe intersection criteria and the locations and intersect with the location intersection criteria only story intersects with respect to both time and location .

In some embodiments the intersection criteria and may be dynamically modified by the user. For instance a user may expand or shift the timeframe of the intersection criteria to overlap the timeframe which may cause the story to intersect with the modified intersection criteria and . Similarly the user may expand or shift the location portion of the intersection criteria to overlap the location which may cause the story to intersect with the modified intersection criteria and .

In some embodiments the timeframe and or location or other metadata of a particular story e.g. story may be used to identify other intersecting stories. In the example the stories and may intersect with one another with respect to time and location since their timeframe and location metadata overlap. Intersections between stories may be identified by deriving intersection criteria from a first story e.g. story and using the derived intersection criteria to identify other intersecting stories e.g. story . As will be discussed below story to story intersections may be used to identify shared interests between users and or to aggregate stories related to similar events.

Although describes intersection criteria based on a timeframe and location TL intersection criteria the disclosure is not limited in this regard. For example TL intersection criteria may be combined with other metadata criteria to filter the intersecting stories. The criteria may be based on any type of story metadata including but not limited to story participant s story contributor s descriptive tags interested person s story type importance relevance to intersection criteria story ratings a metric quantifying a quality of the story or contributor and so on. For instance TL intersection criteria may be combined with descriptive tag criteria to identify a subset of the intersecting stories that relate to a particular event e.g. are tagged with a particular descriptive tag . For example TL intersection criteria may be combined with a soccer tag to identify stories related to soccer games that took place at a particular time and location.

Other types of intersection criteria may be predicated upon other types of metadata. For example timeframe and contributor intersection criteria TC intersection criteria may be used to identify the stories contributed and or borrowed by a particular user during a particular timeframe story borrowing discussed below . In another example timeframe and participant intersection criteria TP intersection criteria may be used to identify stories in which a particular user was a participant during a particular timeframe. As could be appreciated by one of skill in the art the teachings of the disclosure could be adapted to use virtually any combination of metadata to identify and or filter intersecting stories.

At step one or more stories and associated metadata may be received. Each of the stories received at step may comprise one or more content items and associated metadata such as a timeframe location participants contributor s descriptive tags and so on. The stories may have been contributed and or authored using an interface provided by a network accessible service e.g. website such as the interface of .

At step the one or more stories and associated metadata may be stored on a datastore e.g. database directory or the like and made available for access by users via a network such as the Internet. In one example one or more of the stories may pertain to a youth sporting event. The stories may include photographs of the participants which may be of interest to other event attendees.

At step intersection criteria may be received. The intersection criteria may comprise a timeframe and location e.g. may be TL intersection criteria . The intersection criteria may be received from a user via a user interface e.g. via the interfaces and or described below in conjunction with . The timeframe of the intersection criteria may comprise a chronological range having a starting point start time and or an ending point ending time . The location of the intersection criteria may identify a location or region of interest. The location may identify a real world location e.g. an address set of coordinates etc. or virtual a location in a virtual space a mobile location an alias or the like . The location may be specified at varying levels of detail or specificity e.g. as a particular address a block a neighborhood a region and so on .

Continuing the example above the intersection criteria received at step may be provided by a user interested in the youth sporting event. Accordingly the intersection criteria may identify the timeframe and location of the event e.g. Apr. 12 2008 from 2 30 PM to 4 40 PM at Smith Park .

At step the method may query the datastore to identify stories that intersect with the timeframe and location of the intersection criteria. Continuing the youth sporting event example the intersecting stories identified at step may comprise the stories available to the method e.g. stored in the datastore that occurred within the specified location e.g. Smith Park during the specified timeframe Apr. 12 2008 2 30 PM to 4 40 PM .

Step may further comprise filtering the intersecting stories. As discussed above intersection criteria may include additional constraints which may be used to filter intersecting stories. For example to find intersecting stories related to the youth sporting event the stories may be filtered using a soccer descriptive tag a participant filter may be used to identify the stories in which a particular user appears and so on.

At step the stories identified at step may be presented to the user in an interface. The results may comprise a list of stories that intersect with the provided intersection criteria and or satisfy one or more additional filter constraints. In some embodiments the results may be ordered relative to one another in the interface such that the stories that are most likely to be of interest to the user are more prominently displayed e.g. displayed near the head of the list or stories . Examples of systems and methods for ordering intersecting stories are discussed below.

Although describes identifying intersections with respect to timeframe and location the disclosure is not limited in this regard the teachings of the disclosure could be used to identify intersections of any type. For instance timeframe contributor intersection criteria may be used to identify stories contributed and or borrowed by a particular user during a particular timeframe timeframe participant intersection criteria may be used to identify stories in which a particular user appears and so on.

The intersection criteria described above may be used to define an intersection space. As used herein an intersection space may refer to a virtual companion space that may aggregate content that intersects with a particular set of intersection criteria. Accordingly an intersection space may refer to a particular junction of timeframe and location such as Apr. 12 2008 from 2 30 PM to 4 40 PM and Smith Park. An intersection space may act as a home page to document activities occurring at the park during the specified timeframe. Of course an intersection space may be defined more broadly. For example an intersection space may be defined along a very long timeframe e.g. unlimited timeframe to chronicle the history of a particular location e.g. chronicle the history of a particular building or institution . Alternatively an intersection space may be limited to the here and now to provide a real time display of stories told potentially from various vantages pertaining to the time and location of the user. Different levels of metadata specificity may determine which stories are included in an intersection space and how the stories are displayed and or ordered therein.

In one illustrative example a contributor may create a story regarding a trip to the summit of Mt. Rainier on Jul. 10 2003 at 10 15 AM. The timeframe of the story may include the short time the contributor actually spent on the summit e.g. 30 minutes may comprise the entire day of the hike or some other timeframe e.g. the weekend of the trip the month of July 2003 the season and so on . Similarly the location of the story may be provided at varying levels of specificity the location may be the summit area itself the area traversed during the summit approach the mountain range the entire state of Washington and so on.

The timeframe and or location metadata assigned to the story may determine what other stories will intersect with the story s intersection space. For example if the contributor assigns the 30 minute timeframe to his story the story may not intersect with the story of another hiker who summited Rainier at 1 20 PM on the same day and specified a similarly specific timeframe for his story . If the contributor were to specify a broader timeframe however such as the entire month of July 2003 the intersection space of the contributor s story may include other stories occurring during the month of July 2003 including the story of the 1 20 PM summit.

The location metadata may similarly define the scope of the intersection space. For instance if the contributor were to specify the location of his story as a small area in the vicinity of the summit the story may not intersect with the story of another hiker who stopped short of the summit and specified a similarly narrow location . If the contributor used a broader location such as the entire mountain range the resulting intersection space would include other hikes to the summit as well as other experiences that may be unrelated to a summit attempt.

As discussed above in some embodiments the location of a story may be virtual such as a location within a MMOG a cruise ship a business name or the like. For example an intersection space of a restaurant may chronicle the events occurring at the restaurant despite the fact that the restaurant may have changed locations several times during its history. Since the intersection space is defined with respect to the restaurant as opposed to a particular location or address the intersection space may follow the restaurant as it moves from place to place. Similarly an intersection space specified with respect to a particular cruise ship may follow the cruise ship s movements may be referenced by name as opposed to a particular real world location .

An intersection space may be specified with respect to other types of intersection criteria such as story contributors story participants and the like. For example an intersection space may chronicle the stories involving a particular set of participants during a particular timeframe e.g. the stories involving a youth soccer team . As will be discussed below these types of intersections may be formed into a storyline which may chronicle a particular set of related stories. The intersection space of a particular contributor may comprise all the stories contributed or borrowed by the contributor over his her lifetime. Accordingly a contributor intersection space may represent the lifetime storyline of a particular user.

Like the story content and metadata discussed above an intersection space may be submitted to a network accessible service e.g. website and stored on a datastore thereof e.g. database directory or the like which may provide an interface e.g. a webpage to display intersection spaces. For example the network accessible service e.g. website may provide an interface dedicated to the intersection space of the summit of Mt. Rainier and the month of July 2003. The intersection space interface may act as a repository of the stories related to a particular time and place. Alternatively or in addition an interface through which users may dynamically determine an intersection space may be provided e.g. interface of discussed below .

The interface may include a timeframe control upon which a timeframe indicator may be manipulated to dynamically select a timeframe of interest to select the prevailing timeframe . The timescale or time span covered by the timeframe control may be shown by timeframe indicators which in some embodiments may comprise labels identifying the year month day hour or the like currently displayed in the timeframe control . In alternate embodiment the labels could indicate the age of an individual institution event or other storyline discussed below . The timeframe control may include a time scale input which may be used to selectively increase or decrease the time scale of the timeframe control . For example a user may use the input to zoom in until the control spans only few seconds or zoom out until the control spans a series of decades. As illustrated in the timeframe may specify a start time and an end time. In other embodiments however the timeframe may be manipulated such that there is no pre defined start or end time. At the start and or end points the control may comprise timeframe browsing inputs and which may allow a user to shift the timeframe control forward or backwards in time respectively.

In some embodiments the timeframe control may include a story indicator region which may comprise one or more indicators of stories that intersect with the timeframe selection and other intersection criteria such as location and the like . As will be discussed below the region and or indicators may be configured to display stories according to relative importance density heat relative rating and so on.

Although a timeframe control is depicted in and the interface is not limited in this regard other timeframe inputs could be used under the teachings of this disclosure such as text input fields clock controls calendar controls or the like. The timeframe control or other timeframe control element may reference an absolute time a virtual time or a relative time including an age or duration . For example the start time of the control may be specified using an alias e.g. the day the contributor was born and the timeframe control may display times as an offset from the relative time. In this way a contributor may hide his her real age while allowing users to browse his stories chronologically.

A location control may be used to specify a location of interest . The location may be specified with respect to a single point or address or as an area or region . The control may include a location scale control which may be used to change the scale of the map to zoom in to a particular neighborhood or zoom out to a state country or continent . Although a map is depicted in the interface the interface is not limited in this regard other inputs could be used under the teachings of this disclosure. For example a text input could be used to enter address or coordinate information. The locations may be in the real world or within a virtual location namespace. Accordingly in some embodiments a virtual address namespace or map could replace a real world map and so on.

The timeframe and location information provided via the controls and may define intersection criteria which may be used to identify an intersection space. The timeframe of the intersection space may be the timeframe specified using the timeframe control and the location of the intersection space may be the location or region entered via the location control . The interface may display indicators of the stories that intersect the intersection space in a display region . The intersecting stories may be identified as described above in conjunction with e.g. by comparing timeframe location and or other story metadata to the intersection criteria provided via the interface such as the timeframe and or location or . As will be described below the stories in the region may be ordered according to which stories are likely to be of the most relevance to the user.

In some embodiments the interface may include a title . The title may be predetermined. For example if the interface is configured to display a particular intersection space e.g. the history of a location the title may be the name of the location. For dynamically selected intersection spaces such as the intersection space depicted in the title may be determined based upon the content of the intersecting stories. For example the title may be selected from a set of prominent descriptive tags associated with the stories in the intersection space e.g. if the story tags are predominantly summer and vacation the title may be set to summer vacation . An example of a dynamic tag cloud is described below in conjunction with element .

Stories may be displayed within the region in various ways. In some embodiments stories may be displayed in a link badge format. The link badge format of a story may include a scaled image of the story a story title a byline indicting the story contributor a text selection from the story an intersection indicator and so on. The intersection indicator may identify the intersection criteria used to include the story in the intersection space e.g. identify the timeframe and or location of the story . As discussed above the content of the link badge elements and or and or other link badge elements not shown may be automatically selected from the story content and or may be authored by the story contributor e.g. using a link badge authoring interface such as interface of . In other embodiments the interface may display the stories in different ways e.g. a list a set of thumbnails or the like. Therefore the interface should not be read as limited to any particular way of displaying story indications.

The interface may further comprise one or more metadata display and or filtering elements which may be used to display story metadata and or filter the stories in the intersection space filter the stories included in the region . In the example the interface includes a contributor element a participants element an interested persons element a story type element a descriptive tag element e.g. dynamic tag cloud and a rating element . The interface however is not limited in this regard and could be extended to include any number and or type of filtering controls configured to filter the intersection space based on any type of story content and or metadata.

The contributor element may filter stories based upon the story contributor. In some embodiments the contributor element displays the contributors of the stories in the intersection space. The contributor indications may include a count of the number of stories submitted by each contributor. Selection of a particular set of one or more contributors may filter the intersection space such that only stories submitted by the specified contributors are included therein stories contributed by other unselected contributors may be removed.

A participants element may be provided to filter the intersection space based upon which participants appear therein. The participants element may be pre populated with a union of the participants of all the stories in the intersection space. The participant indicators may include a count or other indicator of their respective prevalence in the intersecting stories. The intersection space may be filtered to include only those stories that include a particular set of one or more participants . The interface may further comprise an interested persons element which may operate similarly to the participants element e.g. may display a union of the interested persons associated with the stories in the intersection space and or provide for filtering of the intersection space by selected interested persons .

In some embodiments the interface may include a story type element which may filter the intersection space by story type. The story type element may be pre populated with indications of the story types of the stories in the intersection space. The story type indicators may include respective counts indicating how many stories of each type are in the intersection space. Selection of one or more story types may filter the intersection space by story type only stories of the selected story type s will remain in the intersection space.

In some embodiments the interface may include a descriptive tag element dynamic tag cloud which may be pre populated with a dynamic tag cloud of the intersecting stories the dynamic tag cloud may comprise a union of the descriptive tags of the stories in the intersection space and included in the region . A tag may be expressed in language pictures a combination picture s and language or the like. The dynamic tag cloud displayed in the element may indicate the relative tag prevalence. For example tags that appear in many different stories may be displayed prominently e.g. in a large bold font whereas tags other tags may be less prominently displayed e.g. in a smaller font . Alternatively or in addition a story count may be displayed in connection with each tag. The user may select one or more tags in the descriptive tag input or tag cloud to cause only stories that have the selected tags to be included in the intersection space.

The interface may include a rating element configured to filter the intersecting stories by rating regardless of whether the rating is expressed explicitly. The rating element may be pre populated with an indicator of an average or mean or other rating of the stories in the intersection space. The user may set a rating threshold and any stories that fall below the threshold may be filtered from the intersection space.

As described above the controls and may be manipulated to dynamically modify the intersection criteria of the intersection space which in the example is timeframe and location. Accordingly as a user manipulates the controls and or the stories included in the intersection space may change and or the relative ordering of the stories in the region may change. Other elements of the interface may similarly change. For instance the contributor element may be re populated to reflect changes to the intersection space e.g. remove indicators of contributors whose stories are no longer in the intersection space update contributor counts add new contributors and so on . The participants element interested persons element story type element descriptive tag element dynamic tag cloud rating element and or other elements not shown may be similarly updated. For example as the stories in the intersection space change the tags in the tag cloud displayed in the descriptive tag element may be updated added removed etc. . Likewise the relative prominence of the tags may change for instance a skiing tag e.g. skiing which was prominent during a winter timeframe may become less prominent when the timeframe is shifted into the summer.

The timeframe control of the interface may provide an inverted tag cloud display . The inverted tag cloud may display a set of tags associated with a selected region of the timeframe control . For example the user may hover an interface cursor over a particular location on the timeframe control . The hover location may specify a particular timeframe within the timeframe control . When the cursor is hovered for a pre determined time the inverted tag cloud display may be shown. The inverted tag cloud display may comprise the descriptive tags of stories if any having a timeframe that intersects and or is proximate to the timeframe in the timeframe control over which the cursor is hovering. A user may move the cursor over the timeframe to see how the story tags change over time.

Frequently an intersection space will be defined based on the combination of time and place assigned to a particular story the user will be able to see other stories that happened at the same time and place as the particular story. Alternatively or in addition the user may manipulate the controls elements and or to select an intersection space comprising stories related to a very specific event. For example the user may be interested in accounts of a traffic accident. The user may manipulate the controls and to specify the timeframe and location of the crash. The resulting intersection space may include stories that are relevant to the accident have intersecting timeframe and location metadata . The user may further refine the intersection space by selecting accident or crash descriptive tags in the descriptive tag element .

In another example a user may define a broader intersection space in order to explore the character of a particular location address business stories involving a particular set of participants or the like. For instance the user may want to investigate the reputation of a park to determine whether it would be a suitable place to take his child. In this case the user may specify a large timeframe the last decade and may include a fairly large region the park and surrounding neighborhoods . The user may further specify descriptive tags of interest such as crime mugging and so on. The resulting stories may give the user an idea of how much crime has taken place in the area.

As discussed above an intersection space may act as a home page or virtual companion space for a particular set of stories e.g. stories sharing a common set of intersection criteria such as timeframe and location . Therefore in some embodiments an intersection space interface such as interface may be fixed to particular intersection criterion. For instance the network accessible service e.g. website may provide an interface dedicated to chronicling the history of a particular location. The location control of the dedicated interface may be fixed to the location of interest e.g. park hotel etc. . The timeframe control of the interface may remain dynamic or may be similarly restricted. For example the starting time of the timeframe of an interface dedicated to the history of a particular hotel may be limited to the date that construction on the hotel began. In another example such as an intersection space dedicated to a youth sports team the timeframe control may be fixed to a particular range e.g. the little league season and the location control may be fixed to particular location s e.g. the venues where the team practices and plays . As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art the teachings of this disclosure could be adapted to provide any number of dedicated intersection space interfaces directed to any number and or type of intersection criteria.

In some embodiments the network accessible service e.g. website may provide an interface configured to display an intersection space dedicated to a particular contributor or about a topic of interest to the owner of the storyline. The intersection space may comprise stories that have been contributed and or borrowed by the contributor over a particular timeframe and as such may represent a life storyline for the contributor. The intersection space may further comprise stories in which the contributor has appeared as a participant and or the contributor has expressed an interest. As will be described below the contributor may borrow stories from other contributors which will cause the borrowed stories to appear on a storyline owned by the contributor and or may cause the stories to appear in the contributor s intersection space. Similarly a user may be identified tagged as an interested user in one or more stories. The contributor may borrow these stories to include them the contributor s intersection space.

The interface includes a timeframe control that as discussed above may be used to select a timeframe . Selection of the timeframe may define a timeframe contributor intersection space TC intersection criteria . Indications of the stories that intersect with the TC intersection criteria may be displayed in region in a link badge format . The interface may further comprise one or more metadata elements which may be used to display and or filter the intersecting stories according to story metadata such as story contributor story participants interested persons story type descriptive tags rating and so on. Although not shown in the interface may include a location input or display like the location input of which may be used to identify a location of interest to define a timeframe contributor location intersection space . The intersection space interface by comprise a title identifying the contributor e.g. Peter s Life .

The interface may further include a context pane . The context pane may comprise a tab or other interface element configured to display a chronological profile of the contributor or of the topic of the contributor s storyline. As discussed above a user profile under the teachings of this disclosure may include chronologically tagged profile information profile information may be associated with a particular timeframe . Therefore unlike traditional user profiles that provide only an instantaneous picture of the user the user profiles taught herein may provide a user profile chronology. For example a user profile attribute such as marital status may be different at different times of a contributors life the contributor starts out as single gets married in 1994 is divorced in 1998 and is remarried in 2004. The marital status of the user may include each of these attributes single married divorced remarried each associated with a respective timeframe. Other milestone type life events such as educational status employment status and the like may be similarly tied to a chronology. For example chronological profile attributes may show the progression of the contributor s musical or artistic taste over time. User defining information such as a motto favorite quote or the like may be tied to a chronology as may the contributor s physical attributes height weight health chronic disease etc. . For example the user may indicate that from 2003 to 2005 he she was fighting cancer and from 2006 onward is a cancer survivor. The user profile may comprise a plurality of contributor avatars each associated with a different respective timeframe. Accordingly the profile photos may illustrate changes in the appearance of the contributor over time. As used herein an avatar may refer to any depiction of a user graphical or otherwise . Therefore an avatar may refer to a photograph a caricature a drawing or illustration a video clip renderable content or the like.

The chronological profile may include a timeframe indicator that shows the relevant time period covered in the profile from Apr. 4 2005 to Oct. 5 2005 . The timeframe indictor may correspond to the timeframe of the timeframe control . The contents of the chronological profile may comprise the profile entries that intersect with the timeframe attributes that were valid during the specified timeframe . The content may include the profile photo that corresponds to the timeframe . If multiple attributes are valid during the timeframe each valid attribute may be displayed e.g. marital status may display as married divorced on date . Alternatively only the most recent least recent most prevalent or similar profile attribute may be displayed as determined automatically or by the user . For example if the contributor was married on the last day of a three month timeframe marital status may be married. Alternatively since during most of the timeframe the contributor was single the status may indicate single. The disclosure contemplates many different mechanisms for selecting and or prioritizing chronological information e.g. method of and as such this disclosure is not limited to any particular technique for selecting chronological profile information.

The context pane may further include an age display element as a tab or other interface element . Therefore although the age display element is shown as a separate component window it may be included as selectable tab of the context pane . The age display element may be configured to display a chronologically comparison between the contributor s life to the life of another user or prominent person . The age used for comparison purposes may be the age of the contributor at the timeframe specified in the timeframe control . The age display element may include an indicator of the relevant time period which may comprise the comparison age discussed above. The age display element may compare the stories and or profile information of the contributor at the identified age to stories and or profile information of another user. Accordingly the chronological context of the other user may be shifted to correspond to the contributor s age. For example the life events of Abraham Lincoln may be time shifted to correspond to the chronology of the contributor. Relevant results may be presented in a display area . For example if the contributor is age 22 in the timeframe contributor s profile and or stories may be compared to Abraham Lincoln s life events at age 22 at age 22 Abraham Lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the Sangamon River to New Salem . This information may be juxtaposed to the contributors profile information for example the contributor may have recently graduated from college and is moving to a new town for his her first job. It would be understood by one of skill in the art that any manner of age or chronology based comparisons could be included in the age display element .

The context pane may further include a general context display element as a tab or other interface element . Therefore although the age display element is shown as a separate component window it may be included as selectable tab of the context pane . The general context display element may include a timeframe indicator which may correspond to the timeframe control . A display area of the element may include general context information relevant to the indicated timeframe . The display area may include newsworthy events top songs including listen or purchase links what other notable lives were doing at the time what members of the contributor s circle were doing and so on.

As discussed above a contributor may borrow stories from other contributors. In some embodiments a contributor may be a tagged as a participant and or as an interested person in a story contributed by another user. The contributor may be informed of the story via a message a display element or the like and may be given the opportunity to accept or reject the tag. In addition the contributor may be prompted to view and or borrow the story. As will be discussed below rejecting a participant or interested person tag may cause the contributor to be removed from the story metadata e.g. be unlinked from the story accepting the tag may cause the contributor to be associated with the story e.g. be displayed in participant or interested person story metadata and so on . Borrowing the story may cause the story to be included in the contributor s intersection space. Accordingly the story may appear with other stories contributed by the contributor. When a story is borrowed the borrower may specify access controls for the story as if the story were contributed and or authored by the borrower. The contributor may specify that the story is to be available publicly or only within one or more circles. Accordingly access to a story may be predicated on a multi tiered system. A first tier may be determined by the original story contributor e.g. whether the participants may have access to the story . The story participants that borrow the story may include their own set of access controls e.g. additional tiers of access . For example the original contributor may specify that a story is to be accessible to his family circle. A user who borrows the story may choose to publish the story to a different group of people e.g. his friends circle .

Multi tiered access control may be leveraged to publish stories in a mixed trust environment. For example a group of parents whose children play on the same soccer team may not have personal relationships with one another they may however have a trust relationship with the coach. The parents may choose to restrictively share stories related to the soccer team with the coach who may borrow the stories. The coach who has a trust relationship with the other parents may publish the stories to a parents circle. In this way all of the parents may get access to soccer related stories while preserving their individual privacy and without individually establishing trust relationships with each of the other parents . Alternatively if the coach makes the circle public or otherwise visible to its members members could borrow the coach s circle and use it as a target for other published stories.

The original contributor of a story may control how certain story information is disseminated in the multi tiered access scheme described above. For example the original contributor may refer certain story metadata timeframe and or location using aliases. The actual data associated with the aliases may be available only to the user s friends circle. Therefore even if a friend publicly shares a story other users accessing the story may not have access to the underlying timeframe and or location information.

In some embodiments the original story contributor may have additional controls over story sharing. For example the user may not allow the story to be borrowed and or the user may define to whom the story may be accessible. These types of access controls may be tied to the story to prevent the story from being made available outside of a specified group of people outside of a specified circle .

As illustrated above in an intersection space may include a plurality of intersecting stories displayed in the region . The story indications displayed in the region may be ordered according to the likelihood that the story will be relevant to the user. Stories considered more important relevant to the user may be displayed more prominently within the region e.g. at the head of a list in a larger bold font or the like . The likelihood that a story is relevant may be based on comparisons between the story metadata and the intersection space criteria and or metadata filters.

The interface may identify the story contributor in a byline display . The byline may display a profile avatar photo of the contributor. The byline display may comprise a link to an interface configured to display other stories of the contributor such as interface discussed above . If the contributor specified an alias and the viewer of the interface is not authorized to access the contributor alias the byline may not identify the user by his her username but instead an alias may be depicted and a different avatar if any may be displayed. The link component of the byline may link to stories submitted under the alias name or the link may be disabled .

The interface may display an intersection component which may display metadata describing the story such as a timeframe indicator and or a location indicator . The timeframe indicator may be depicted on a timeframe control not shown as text as in indicator or the like. The story location metadata may be depicted on a map interface or in some other way such as text as a virtual location an alias or the like . The story location may be identified as a region and or location point . The intersection component may comprise a link to access other items at the story intersection e.g. to access stories that intersect with the story based on the story metadata such as timeframe location participants and the like .

If the story timeframe and or location metadata are expressed as aliases and the viewer of the interface is not authorized to access the actual value of the aliases the location and or timeframe indicators and or may be hidden or depicted as their alias values. Accordingly the intersection link may be disabled and or may be directed to a limited set of stories having the same contributor alias.

The interface may include a participants element that displays indications of the story participants as identified by the story contributor including the contributor if applicable . The participant indicators may comprise links to the respective participants profiles discussed below or a link to an interface depicting the participants stories e.g. in an interface such as the interface discussed above . Interested persons indicators may similarly display indications of the persons identified as being interested in the story. The interface may include a story type element to display the story type and a descriptive tags element may be to display the story tags.

In some embodiments the interface may comprise a comments display element which may be configured to display user submitted comments pertaining to the story. As will be discussed below users identified as story participants and or interested persons in displays and or may have a right to comment on the story. Comments submitted by story participants and or interested persons may be prominently displayed in the element to prevent participant comments from being drowned out by other commentary . A comment input component may be provided to receive user submitted commentary.

A rating input and display element may be provided to allow users to rate various aspects of the story. In some embodiments the rating input may comprise a multi factor rating input. Examples of such inputs are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 539 789 entitled Systems and Methods for Aggregating Content on a User Content Driven Website filed Aug. 12 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments the interface may include a plurality of rating inputs each adapted to rate a different aspect of the story e.g. story content story metadata descriptive tags etc. . In some embodiments for example users may rate the relevance of descriptive tags. Examples of such rating inputs are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 969 407 entitled Relevancy Rating of Tags filed Jan. 4 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments user ratings may be used to form an overall contributor rating which may be displayed in connection with the contributor s profile. Examples of contributor rating indices and related displays are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 540 171 which is incorporated by reference above. In some embodiments the weight given the contributor s ratings of other user submitted content may be based at least in part on the contributor s rating. Examples of systems and methods for calibrating user submitted ratings are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 540 163 entitled Systems and Methods for Calibrating User Ratings filed Aug. 12 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

At step the method may be initialized as described above. Initializing may comprise accessing a datastore comprising a plurality of stories each associated with metadata such as a timeframe location and so on.

At step intersection criteria may be received the intersection criteria may comprise a location and timeframe of interest. The intersection criteria may be received in response to user interaction with one or more user interface components such as the timeframe and or location controls discussed above. Alternatively the intersection criteria may be provided by another device or process. For instance the intersection criteria may be derived from current location and or time information provided by a computing device and or mobile communication device e.g. mobile phone computer etc. . In other examples the intersection criteria is derived from the intersection metadata of a content item of another story such as a photograph or from another story e.g. to find other stories that intersect with a particular story .

At step the method may identify a plurality of stories that intersect with the received intersection criteria. As discussed above the intersecting stories may be identified by comparing intersection metadata of the stories to the received intersection criteria. Step may further comprise comparing the stories to one or more filters e.g. descriptive tags participants etc. .

At step the intersecting stories identified at step may be assigned a relative order. The order may be determined by comparing the intersection criteria and or filters to the story metadata. In some embodiments each intersecting story may be assigned a respective relevance score. The relevance metric may quantify an empirically determined likelihood that the story will be relevant to a user viewing the intersection space. In some embodiments the relevance metric may be determined by combining relevance metrics of different story metadata. For example a story may be assigned a timeframe relevance metric a location relevance metric and so on which may be combined into an overall relevance metric used to order the stories. The relative relevance metrics may be weighted with respect to one another. For example the location relevance metric may be more heavily weighted in some situations than the timeframe relevance metric.

At step the intersecting stories may be presented in a user interface in the order determined at step .

Although the method is described as ordering stories as are methods and discussed below one of skill in the art would recognize that the chronological and or location based ordering disclosed herein could be applied to any content item associated with chronological information. Therefore this disclosure should not be read as limited to ordering only certain types of content.

At steps and the method may be initialized intersection criteria may be received and a plurality of intersecting stories may be identified as described above.

At step the timeframe of each of the stories may be compared to the intersection criteria timeframe referred to as the prevailing time to determine a relative ordering of the stories and or to assign a timeframe relevance metric thereto.

In some embodiments the stories may be ordered or the timeframe score may be set according to a relative start time metric. In this case stories having a start time that is after the start time of the prevailing timeframe are ordered before stories having a start time that is before the start time of the prevailing timeframe. The stories that start after the prevailing timeframe are ordered chronologically based on proximity to the prevailing start time . The stories that begin before the prevailing timeframe are ordered in reverse chronological order again based on proximity to the prevailing start time .

In other embodiments stories may be ordered according to an absolute start time metric. In this case the stories may ordered according to the absolute value of the difference between story start time and prevailing start time regardless of whether the story start time begins before or after the prevailing start time. Referring to the order using absolute start time is since it is the most proximate to the prevailing start time and .

In other embodiments a timeframe metric may be used. The timeframe metric may quantify how closely the prevailing timeframe corresponds to the timeframe of a story e.g. a comparison of the scale of the timeframes . The timeframe correspondence may be determined as a sum or other combination of an absolute value difference between the story start time and prevailing start time and the story end time and prevailing end time. Referring to order according to the timeframe metric begins with story which most closely corresponds to the intersection criteria timeframe followed by and . As illustrated above the timeframe ordering assigns importance based upon comparisons between the scale of the story and intersection criteria timeframe. Additional detail regarding timeframe and or time scale comparisons is provided below in conjunction with .

Referring back to although the method is described using a particular set of exemplary timeframe comparison techniques one of skill in the art would recognize that method could be extended to incorporate any time and or timeframe comparison technique known in the art. Therefore method is not limited to the exemplary timeframe comparisons disclosed above.

After the timeframe ordering of the stories is determined and or a timeframe relevance metric is assigned to each of the stories the flow may continue to step where the ordered stories may be presented to a user in an interface and or additional ordering processing may occur e.g. at step of .

At steps and the method may be initialized intersection criteria may be received and a plurality of intersecting stories may be identified as described above.

At step the location of each of the stories may be compared to the intersection criteria location referred to as the prevailing location to determine a relative ordering of the stories and or to assign a location relevance metric thereto.

In some embodiments the stories may be ordered or the location score may be set according to a proximity metric. In this case stories may be ordered according to the proximity of the center of the story location to the center of the intersection criteria location. As used herein the center may refer to a particular point location within a region e.g. the center of a circle or square region . If a location is specified as a particular point or address the center is the particular point or address.

In other embodiments stories may be ordered according to an area of overlap order that corresponds to the area of overlap between the intersection criteria location and the story locations. Referring to the story completely overlaps the intersection criteria location and as such is ordered first followed by and .

In other embodiments stories may be ordered according to the ratio of story location area to the area of overlap between the story location and intersection criteria location. Under this metric stories that have extremely broad locations may be ordered lower than stories that have an area that more closely resembles the intersection criteria area. Referring to the story may be placed first in the order since it has a high ratio of overlap area to total area 1 to 1 story is ordered next and story which has an extremely broad location is ordered last.

In another example the location score is calculated using a Euclidian norm e.g. an L or L norm . The area of a story or location intersection criteria may be defined using a 4 value tuple s w n e in which s is a southern extent of the area e.g. latitude of southern side of the bounding box w is the western extent of the area e.g. longitude of the western side of the bounding box n is the southern extent and e is the eastern extent. Location intersection criteria may be represented as a query location tuple q q and the location of a story may be similarly represented as a story location tuple s s. The location score between intersection criteria and a story may be based upon the Euclidian distance therebetween the Euclidian L norm per Equation 1 

Equation 1 quantifies the difference between the area of the query location intersection criteria q and the location of the story story location s . Small values of dindicate greater spatial similarity. The stories and may be ordered according to the Euclidian distance value d as described above. As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art Equation 1 could be modified to calculate a Euclidian distance or an equivalent value in other coordinate systems and or in other dimensions. For example Equation 1 may be adapted to calculate the distance between two or more volumes in 3 space. Accordingly the disclosure should not be read as limited in this regard.

In another embodiment the spatial relevance or importance of a story is determined using a spectral clustering or spectral partitioning approach. In this approach the intersection criteria location is deemed to be the kernel of a spectral partition. The distance between the kernel and each story is expressed using a distance matrix D per Equation 2 Eq. 2

The resulting matrix D is a real symmetric matrix having an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. The first leading eigenvector describes the principle behavior of the data the story with respect to the kernel and the second leading eigenvector describes the behavior of the first leading eigenvector. Accordingly the signs of the entries in the second leading eigenvector provide a natural partition of the story location metadata.

With the partitions of the stories determined the partition that is closest to the kernel according to a distance metric such as the Euclidian L1 norm described above is identified as most spatially important. depicts examples of location partitioning such as spectral partitioning . The boundary represents an initial location intersection criteria. As depicted in the initial location does not intersect any of the stories and or . The initial intersection criteria is expanded as described below to the boundary which does intersect the location intersection metadata of a number of stories. A distance matrix D for the stories within boundary is calculated and used to partition the stories into partitions and .

The stories are assigned a relative importance based upon the distance between their respective partition and the kernel boundary or original intersection criteria boundary . As shown in the partition is closer than the partitions and or and as such is identified as the most important.

In some embodiments the story partitions may be further leveraged to filter and or select stories for inclusion in the intersection space. For example stories that are in the same partition may be considered to be relevant to one another and as such are treated as a group. Stories may be included and or excluded from the intersection space by partition membership. In example depicted in only the most important partition is included in the intersection space which results in new location intersection criteria boundary . In other examples the N most relevant partitions are included in the intersection space and or modifications to the location intersection criteria e.g. boundary are adapted according to partition distribution. Alternatively or in addition partitions may be included and or excluded from the intersection space based upon a partition distance metric and or in accordance with intersection space constraints such as a maximum story threshold and or a sufficiency threshold. Although the disclosure provides several exemplary mechanisms for determining story importance the disclosure is not limited in this regard and could be adapted to incorporate any suitable unsupervised machine learning technique community detection or cluster analysis including but not limited to hierarchical clustering partitional clustering e.g. k means clustering quality threshold clustering etc. modularity maximization principle component analysis alternative spectral clustering and or partitioning techniques or the like.

Referring back to although the method is described using a particular set of exemplary location comparison techniques one of skill in the art would recognize that method could be extended to incorporate any location and or area comparison technique known in the art. Therefore the disclosure is not limited to the exemplary location comparisons disclosed above. The partition that is closest to the kernel according to the Euclidian distance described above or some other distance metric may be selected as the most relevant or important subset within the intersection space.

After the location ordering of the stories is determined and or a location relevance metric is assigned to each of the stories the flow may continue to step where the ordered stories may be presented to a user in an interface and or additional ordering or other processing may occur e.g. at step of .

As discussed above the order in which stories appear in an intersection space may be determined by comparing the story timeframe to the prevailing timeframe of the intersection space. Timeframe information may also be used to maintain the visibility of important stories within a prevailing timeframe. As used herein an important story may be a story that is likely to be highly relevant and or of interest to a user. Maintaining the visibility of an important story may comprise placing important stories at the head of a story list e.g. region if prominently displaying the important stories filtering unimportant stories from the intersection space or the like.

A timeframe selection control such as the control of may be scalable a user may zoom in to view a detailed timeframe spanning a single day hour or minute or zoom out to view a timeframe that spans a significantly longer timeframe e.g. months years decades etc. As the user zooms out and or otherwise increases the size of a prevailing time more items may be included in the resulting intersection space. Conversely when the user zooms in a smaller number of stories may intersect the prevailing time. In either case it may be important to highlight important stories within the prevailing timeframe that are likely to be of interest to the user.

The identification of important stories may be similar to a level of detail interface on a map. The information displayed on the map may be appropriate to the map scale. When the view of a map is zoomed out low level details such as city names local roads and the like are hidden since their inclusion would render the map unreadable and higher level features are displayed such as state lines major roadways and the like. Conversely when a user zooms in the display may replace the higher level features with more detailed features such as city names county lines and the like in accordance with the more detailed map scale.

A similar phenomenon may occur as a user explores the intersection space of particular stories. As discussed above a user may browse chronological content stories using intersection criteria such as a particular timeframe of interest also referred to as a prevailing timeframe or more generally as intersection criteria . The stories in an intersection space may be filtered by their relative importance. In some embodiments important stories may be included in a particular results set or displayed in an interface while other less important stories may be excluded. As used herein the importance of a story can refer to metadata associated with the story itself e.g. an importance value set by the user and or to the relevance of a story to a particular set of intersection criteria. For example the relative importance of an item within a prevailing timeframe may be quantified by inter alia comparing a timeframe associated with the item to the prevailing timeframe. When there is a high correlation between a scale of the item s timeframe and the scale of the timeframe of interest the item may be identified as potentially important. Conversely when the scale of the item s timeframe and the prevailing timeframe differs the item may be considered to be less important. Accordingly story importance may be intersection criteria specific a story that is highly important in a first intersection space may be less important in a second intersection space e.g. due to differences in the intersection criteria of the intersection spaces .

For example consider the stories illustrated on the chronology of . Each of the stories is associated with a respective timeframe story may describe coffee with a friend and may have a short timeframe of less than an hour story may relate to the birth of a child and may span a few months late pregnancy until the child is taken home from the hospital story may describe the purchase of a new car and may span the three 3 years that the contributor owned the car story may describe a routine lunch with a client that covers a few hours story may describe a week sick in bed story may describe the contributor s experience attending a play with his wife and may span approximately four 4 hours and story may describe life at 1021 Biglong Street where the contributor lived for six 6 years.

As illustrated in the timeframe of the stories may differ significantly from one another however each story timeframe intersect with a particular timeframe e.g. a week .

A user may browse the items based upon a particular prevailing timeframe of interest. In some examples the user may browse the stories using an intersection space interface such as the interfaces and or described above in conjunction with .

The user may specify a broad prevailing timeframe such as the 10 year span which includes the week that intersects all of the stories . Important stories may be identified within the prevailing timeframe by comparing the story timeframes to the prevailing timeframe . Given that the selected prevailing timeframe is fairly broad 10 years it may be determined that the stories that have a similarly broad timeframe will be more important than shorter duration stories the broader timeframe stories are more appropriate to the level of detail specified by the user in the prevailing timeframe . Accordingly in the context of a 10 year timeframe stories and or may be considered more important than stories and or which have much narrower timeframes and may be less appropriate to the level of detail specified by the user .

When a user specifies a different timeframe a different set of stories may be identified as important. For example when a user specifies a narrower timeframe such as the timeframe that spans approximately three months medium termed stories such as the story about the birth of the son and or a week sick in bed may be identified as more important than the longer termed stories and or . Although the stories and intersect with the timeframe they may be considered to be less important in the context of the narrower prevailing timeframe specified by the user less appropriate to the more specific level of detail indicated by timeframe . Similarly the stories with the shortest timeframes the coffee with a friend lunch with a client and or attending a play may be less important since their timeframes are still significantly smaller than the timeframe of interest and or the timeframe of stories and . Conversely when a highly specific timeframe is specified a timeframe of a few days the shorter termed stories such as coffee with a friend lunch with a client and or attending a play may be considered to be more important than the other stories and or since the stories and or are more appropriate to the highly detailed timeframe specified by the user.

As described above timeframe scale comparisons may be used to quantify the importance of items such as stories within a particular prevailing timeframe or chronology. However the disclosure is not limited to timeframe comparisons and could be extended to include any comparison metric s known in the art. For example criteria such as item timeframe scale discussed above timeframe correlation item location item repetition frequency item content item type e.g. news story biographical story review etc. item quality metrics access metrics borrow metrics user provided importance indicator and so on may be used to determine relative item importance.

Item timeframe scale may be determined by comparing a scale of the item timeframe to a scale of the prevailing timeframe as discussed above. Item timeframe correlation may quantify the extent to which the item timeframe and the prevailing timeframe overlap. Examples of timeframe correlation metrics are disclosed above in conjunction with method of .

Item location metrics may quantify the correlation between an item location and a prevailing location if specified . Like the timeframe comparisons discussed above in conjunction with method of a location metric may quantify the proximity and or overlap between an item location and a location of interest. A location metric may also compare the scale of the item location how specifically the item location is defined to the scale of the location of interest. The scale comparison may be performed similarly to the timeframe scale comparison s discussed above.

An item repetition metric may quantify how often an item is repeated e.g. coffee with a friend . In some embodiments item repetition may be identified automatically using item metadata e.g. such as identifying a repeating item timeframe location descriptive tags or the like . Alternatively or in addition a contributor may explicitly mark an item as repeating e.g. mark the item as part of a storyline as discussed below . In some embodiments a repeating item may be considered to be less important than less frequent items.

An item content metric may quantify relevance based on the quantity and or type of content in an item story or the mechanism used to create the story. For example a story comprising only a few short lines may be considered to be less important than a story that includes a large amount of text and or other multimedia content e.g. photos video audio etc. . However a story comprising only a few short lines that was created using a mobile application may be considered more important than a story comprising only a few short lines that was created using a Web browser interface because mobile applications are better suited to telling shorter stories and thus a short story created on a mobile device may be deemed to be more likely to be important than a short story told via a browser interface. Alternatively or in addition a story contributed to the system via an Application Programming Interface API or via email may be deemed to have more or less significance than a story created natively.

Item type criteria may quantify item importance based on item type e.g. story type . For example a status story type a simple story that relates what the contributor was doing at a particular time e.g. going to the store may not be considered as important as a biographical or news story type.

Item quality metrics may identify items that have been highly rated by other users higher rated items may be considered more important that lower rated items. An access metric which may quantify how many times a particular item has been viewed may be used to identify important stories. Similarly the number of times a story has been borrowed by other users may be indicative of story importance.

In some embodiments the item contributor may provide his her own importance indicator. The indicator may be expressed on a continuum such as from 1 to 100 or using a set or pre defined identifiers e.g. routine frequent minor significant life changing critical and so on . An input configured to receive an item importance indicator may be included on a contribution interface such as the interface of . In some embodiments user provided identifiers may be displayed in a timeline indicator as milestones or marker events. When determining relative story importance stories indicated as a milestone or marker event may be given a high importance rating.

At step the method calculates a location area ordering of the intersection space. Step may comprise calculating the area of overlap distance Euclidian distance spectral partitioning or other location area metric resulting in an ordering that is based upon the spatial relevance location importance of the stories to the intersection criteria e.g. as described above in conjunction with .

At step further ordering is applied using a timeframe metric e.g. as described above in conjunction with resulting in an ordering based upon temporal relevance timeframe importance .

At step a composite ordering for the stories is determined. In some embodiments the composite ordering comprises partitioning the stories using a spectral partitioning technique assigning corresponding importance scores at step and then ordering the stories within each partition at step . In these embodiments the spatial relevance weighs more heavily in the ordering than the temporal relevance. In other embodiments the temporal ordering of step may be more heavily weighted. For example the order of steps and may be reversed and the initial ordering e.g. partitioning of the stories may be based upon temporal relevance. The order within each cluster may be determined according to the relative spatial relevance of the stories therein.

In some embodiments the spatial and temporal importance scores are combined using a scoring system each story is assigned a respective score based upon its spatial and temporal relevance with respect to the intersection criteria. At step the scores are combined to calculate a composite importance of the story which is used to order the stories in the intersection space. In some embodiments the temporal and spatial scores may be weighted equally. Alternatively the scores may be weighted according to a user preference e.g. provided as part of the intersection criteria weighted based upon the intersection criteria and or based upon the nature of the intersection space. For example intersection criteria that includes a finely grained timeframe a few hours and a broad intersection space may indicate that the user is more interested in the timeframe of story content than the location. Therefore the temporal relevance of step may be weighted more heavily than the spatial relevance of step in the composite ordering at . Alternatively if the timeframe is very broad and the location is highly specific the relative weighting may be reversed e.g. to weight the spatial relevance more highly than the temporal relevance . In another example the weights may be based upon the density of the intersection space. The intersection space may be dense with respect to timeframe and sparse with respect to location and the relevance scores may be weighted accordingly e.g. weighted in proportion to the relative density of the stories in the intersection space . Although particular mechanisms for calculating a composite ordering at step are described the disclosure is not limited in this regard and could be adapted to use any suitable technique determining a composite ordering known in the art. Moreover the disclosure is not limited to ordering story content by spatial and or timeframe relevance the systems and methods disclosed herein could be adapted to order story content using other intersection criteria such as metadata tag relevance social relevance and so on.

In some embodiments stories are indexed using the story intersection metadata. The indexing may occur as the stories are received or edited. Alternatively or in addition indexing may occur periodically e.g. during low load conditions at pre determined times etc. . The up front indexing may provide for more efficient searching and or browsing within the intersection space. In some embodiments stories are indexed by location using a hierarchical partitioning or clustering technique. The indexing may allow stories to be selected for inclusion in an intersection space based upon partition membership as opposed to evaluating each story individually. The indexing may further comprise indexing stories by timeframe using similar techniques e.g. timeframe based partitioning or clustering .

In some embodiments the indexing includes partitioning or clustering stories based upon the scale of the story intersection metadata stories pertaining to similarly sized areas and or timeframes may be grouped together. The scale indexing may be used to efficiently determine intersection inclusion and or to relative story importance as described above.

At step a prevailing timeframe may be received. The prevailing timeframe may be part of intersection criteria and as such may define an intersection space comprising a plurality of items stories . The prevailing timeframe may be received via an interface as part of a query or browse operation. For example the prevailing timeframe may have been provided via the timeframe control described above in conjunction with .

Step may further comprise receiving and or determining an item threshold. The item threshold may determine how many items are to be returned e.g. return no more than ten results . Alternatively or in addition the threshold may comprise an importance threshold. Items that intersect with the prevailing timeframe but do not meet the importance threshold may not be returned and or presented by the method .

At step a plurality of items that intersect the prevailing timeframe may be identified. An intersecting item may be an item having a timeframe that overlaps the prevailing timeframe received at step . In some embodiments the intersecting items may be identified as described above in conjunction with .

At step a relative importance of the identified items may be determined. The relative importance of an item may be determined by comparing the scale breadth of the item timeline to the scale of the prevailing timeline as discussed above.

In some embodiments determining relative importance may comprise calculating and or combining a plurality of importance metrics for each item including but not limited to timeframe scale timeframe correlation item location item repetition frequency item content item type item quality item access item borrows source of the item user provided indicator s and so on. As discussed above two or more of the metrics discussed above may be combined into an importance metric of an item. In some embodiments the combination may comprise applying different respective weights to each of the metrics.

At step the method may determine whether the number of items identified at step exceeds an item threshold and or whether the importance metric of any of the identified items fails to satisfy a relevance importance threshold. If so the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step items may be removed from the result set until the result set satisfies the item threshold. The items may be removed in reverse order of their relative importance or relevance such that the items having the lowest value or score are removed first. In addition any items that fail to satisfy the importance metric may be removed. In some embodiments step employs the spectral partitioning techniques described above in which stories are partitioned based upon their spatial relationship to the intersection criteria. Stories are selected for inclusion in the intersection space based upon partition membership. For example stories in the closest N partitions may be included while stories in other partitions are excluded.

At step the remaining items may be provided to a user in an interface. The items may be presented by their relative importance more important items may be displayed more prominently than less important items e.g. at the head of an item list in a larger bolder font or the like .

In some embodiments the intersection space of a set of intersection criteria is filtered to remove outlying results. The filtering may be determined dynamically from the intersection criteria itself. For example minimum and maximum area values may be calculated from the intersection criteria. Equation 3 provides exemplary mechanisms for calculating a minimum area area value and a maximum area area value 

In Equation 3 q represents location intersection criteria and area q represents the area of the location intersection criteria. The constant values of Equation 3 and 4 have been determined by testing and experience. The disclosure is not limited in this regard however and could be adapted to use different constant values and or different techniques for calculating areaand or areavalues. Similarly Equation 3 and 4 discussed below could be adapted for other coordinate systems intersection criteria or the like.

The intersection space may be filtered using the minimum and maximum area values per Equation 4 area area area 

In Equation 3 the intersection space of a query IS q includes a story s when the area of the story area s is greater than area q value and less than area q value.

In some embodiments the filtering of Equation 3 is iterative and or dynamic based upon a sufficiency threshold or other metric. For example the sufficiency threshold may be initially set to fifty 50 stories. If the filtering of Equation 3 results in fewer than fifty stories the areavalue may be iteratively lowered until the sufficiency threshold is met and or the areavalue goes to zero. Alternatively or in addition the areavalue may be similarly modified.

At step the intersecting stories are filtered using minimum and maximum area parameters. Step comprises calculating areaand areaparameters for the intersection criteria as described above. Step further comprises calculating the area or accessing a pre calculated area of the stories identified at step . Stories having an area less than areaor greater than areamay be filtered from the intersection space.

Alternatively or in addition the intersecting stories may be filtered using a spectral partitioning technique. As described above in conjunction with Equation 2 and spectral partitioning may comprise partitioning stories in the intersection space into respective partitions using a distance matrix. Stories are then filtered based upon their partition membership. Story partitions may be included or excluded as a whole. Stories in partitions that are closer to the intersection criteria may be retained in the intersection space whereas stories in other partitions are filtered. The number of partitions included in the intersection space may be based upon the sufficiency threshold of step e.g. enough to satisfy the threshold a maximum story threshold e.g. threshold of step in or another metric.

At step the method determines whether the filtered intersection comprises a sufficient number of stories e.g. based on a sufficiency threshold such as the sufficiency threshold of step as described below in conjunction with . If so the flow continues to step otherwise the flow continues to step .

At step the filter parameters e.g. areaand area are modified to increase the number of stories in the filtered intersection space. The modifications of step may comprise increasing areaand or decreasing area. The modified filter parameters are then used at step to filter the intersection space of step .

At step and when a sufficient number of filtered intersecting stories are identified the intersecting stories are presented to a user in an intersection interface. The stories may be ordered relative to one another according to relative importance and or relevance as described above.

Although examples of filtering based upon location are described herein the disclosure is not limited in this regard and could be adapted to filter an intersection space using other types of intersection criteria such as timeframe e.g. minimum and or maximum timeframe and so on.

In some embodiments step identifies intersecting stories using pre determined story index information. The story index may index stories by location timeframe or other intersection criteria e.g. participants interested persons descriptive tags etc. . The stories may be indexed when submitted to the network accessible service or at another time e.g. on a periodic schedule during low load conditions etc. . The indexing information may be used to efficiently identify stories for inclusion in the intersection space determine relative story importance filter stories e.g. based upon relative importance scale or the like and so on. In some embodiments the story index partitions stories by location timeframe location scale timeframe scale or the like as described above.

At step the set of intersecting stories identified at step is compared to a sufficiency threshold. The sufficiency threshold determines the minimum number of stories for an intersection space. The sufficiency threshold may be a single story e.g. one or some other pre determined value e.g. fifty stories .

In some embodiments the sufficiency threshold of step is determined dynamically from the intersection criteria of step and or the metadata associated with the intersecting stories identified at step . Accordingly step may comprise determining and or calculating a dynamic sufficiency threshold value. The dynamic sufficiency threshold of step may be determined according to the granularity of the intersection criteria and or the density of the intersecting stories. For example an intersection criteria that is defined broadly e.g. large location footprint and or broad prevailing time and or is defined within a dense area of potentially intersecting stories may indicate that the user is interested in a large number of stories and as such the sufficiency criteria may be set to a high value e.g. fifty to one hundred stories . In other examples the sufficiency criteria may be set to a low value in accordance with narrowly defined intersection criteria e.g. narrow location footprint and or timeframe and or is defined within a sparse area of potentially intersecting stories.

If the intersecting stories identified at step satisfy the sufficiency threshold at step the flow continues to step otherwise the flow continues to step .

At step the intersection criteria is modified to increase the number of intersecting stories. The modification of step may comprise incrementally broadening the intersection criteria of step e.g. applying a scaling factor to time and or location intersection criteria . In some embodiments the modification maintains the center of location and or time intersection criteria while expanding the extent of the criteria. For example scaling a prevailing timeframe spanning one 1 hour e.g. timeframe from 2 PM to 3 PM on May 2 2001 by a factor of two 2 results in a timeframe spanning two 2 hours e.g. from 1 30 PM to 3 30 PM on May 2 2001 . Similar scaling operations may be applied to other intersection criteria e.g. modifying a location bounding box or area radius expanding participating persons using social connections expanding metadata tag and or rating criteria and so on.

In some embodiments the modifications of step may be adapted according to the intersection criteria and or underlying intersection space. For example if the intersection space is dense with respect to the intersection criteria the scaling factors or other modifications of step may be relatively small to avoid the case where the modified intersection criteria returns too many results e.g. more than the threshold of step of . Modifications in a sparse intersection space may be larger to satisfy the sufficiency threshold.

The modifications to the scaling factors of step may be intersection criteria dependent. For example the location density of the intersection space may exceed the timeframe density of the intersection space e.g. stories are dense with respect to location but not to time . In this case the modifications to location intersection criteria may be relatively small as compared to the modifications to the timeframe criteria.

In some embodiments the modifications of step are calculated using an iterative expansion of the intersection criteria. At each iteration the intersection criteria is recursively expanded until a sufficient number of stories are found and or an iteration limit is reached. In some embodiments the expansion factor is proportional to the intersection criteria. Equation 5 is an example of an iterative expansion of location and timeframe intersection criteria max 3.70514 0.45368 log square root over area 1.2 max 2.853 0.2 log duration 1.1 Eq. 5

In Equation 5 qrepresents the intersection criteria query . The i notation indicates the current iteration of the intersection criteria since the expansion is recursive each iteration operates on the intersection criteria as modified in the previous interaction . The area q represents a function that calculates the area of the location intersection criteria and the duration q represents a function that calculates the duration of a timeframe of the intersection criteria. The constant values in Equation 5 were selected by testing and experience. The modified intersection parameters are calculated by applying the scaling factors per Equation 6 Eq. 6 

In Equation 6 qrepresents expanded location intersection criteria and qrepresents expanded timeframe criteria. The modified intersection criteria calculated at step e.g. qand q is used to identify intersecting stories at step .

Although examples of modifications to timeframe location and or social intersection criteria are described herein the disclosure is not limited in this regard and could be adapted to modify other types of intersection criteria such as metadata tags e.g. to include related tags rating metadata and so on.

The intersection criteria modified at step is used to identify a new set of intersecting stories at step and the flow continues to step as described above. In some embodiments the method iterates over steps and until the sufficiency threshold of step is satisfied and or an iteration threshold is met.

At step and when the sufficiency threshold is satisfied the intersecting stories are presented to a user in an intersection interface. The stories may be ordered relative to one another according to relative importance and or relevance as described above.

Although not depicted in in some embodiments the method includes a threshold comparison step such as step of that limits the maximum number of intersecting stories presented at step and or a filtering step such as step of . Moreover steps of the methods and or may be combined to generate an intersection space that includes a maximum story limit as in method one or more filtering parameters as in method and or the sufficiency threshold of method .

At step the relative importance of each story in the intersection space is determined. The relative importance of the stories may be calculated using the location and or timeframe comparisons described above. In some embodiments the comparison comprises partitioning the stories using the spectral partitioning techniques described above in conjunction with Equation 2 and .

Step comprises determining whether the intersection space satisfies one or more thresholds. The thresholds may include a sufficiency threshold defining a minimum number of stories to be included in the intersection space and or a maximum threshold defining a maximum number of stories to be included in the intersection space. Step may further comprise an iteration threshold that limits the iterations of the modifying steps and or filtering steps and .

If step indicates that the thresholds are satisfied and or the iteration threshold has been reached the flow continues to step . If step indicates that the intersection space does not satisfy a sufficiency threshold comprises too few stories the flow continues to step . If step indicates that the intersection space does not satisfy a maximum story threshold includes too many stories the flow continues to step .

At step the intersection criteria is modified as described above e.g. using a scaling factor . The modification of step may comprise expanding the intersection criteria to include nearby stories in the intersection space. A nearby story is a story that does not technically intersect with the intersection criteria but may be still be relevant e.g. has intersection metadata that is similar or close to the intersection criteria . The modification of step may comprise scaling the intersection criteria using proportional scaling factors as described above in conjunction with and or Equations 5 and 6 described above. Upon modifying the intersection criteria the flow continues to step where the modified intersection criteria is used to identify a broader intersection space and proceeds as described above.

At step the intersection space is refined to remove stories therefrom. Step may comprise removing stories in order of their relative importance as in step of . Alternatively or in addition step may comprise filtering the intersection space using one or more filtering criteria e.g. minimum area maximum area etc. . Step may further comprise partitioning the stories using a spectral partitioning technique. Accordingly at step the stories in the intersection space are partitioned e.g. using a distance matrix per Equation 2 the closest partitions are identified and one or more partitions are selected for inclusion in the intersection space.

The intersection space refined at step and or broaden through the modification of the intersection criteria at step may be evaluated at step to determine whether the intersection space satisfies the thresholds as described above. If the intersection space includes too many stories the intersection may be further refined at step . If the intersection space does not satisfy the sufficiency threshold the refinements of step may be modified as described above in conjunction with step of and or the intersection criteria may be modified at step .

When the intersection space satisfies the thresholds and or an iteration threshold is reached the flow continues to step where the intersection space is presented to a user. Step may further comprise ordering and or highlighting stories by order of importance as determined at step .

As discussed above stories in an intersection space may be ordered by relative importance. The importance of a story may quantify the degree to which the intersection metadata of the story corresponds to the intersection criteria. More important stories may be prominently displayed in the intersection space. In addition to prominently displaying important stories in a set of results important stories or items may be prominently displayed on a timeframe control such as the timeframe controls of . In addition a timeframe control may be configured to display a dynamic timeframe. A dynamic timeframe may display different time granularities depending upon the number of intersecting items therein. For example if a particular three year time span includes only a few items the time span may be constricted in that area to conserve display space. Conversely if a particular time span includes many relevant items that time span may be dilated in the display area in order to better depict the items. In some embodiments the areas of time constriction and or time dilation may be presented in different ways to indicate to the user that a change to the time scale has been made e.g. the background of the region s may be modified .

The timeframe control may include a timeframe selector that is used to select a timeframe of interest a prevailing timeframe . As the timeframe of interest changes e.g. as the timeframe control and or timeframe selector are manipulated to select different prevailing timeframes the stories included in the resulting intersection space may change. Referring to these changes may cause a different set of stories to be included in the region and or different metadata to be displayed in the elements and so on as described above.

The timeframe display may be labeled with a time scale. As discussed above when zoomed in the labels and on the timeframe display may be expressed as minutes within a particular hour e.g. label may read 11 AM and label may read 28 indicating the 28th minute of 11 AM . At other levels of granularity the labels and may reflect a different time scale. For example the timeframe display may span the hours of a day and the labels and may read Jul. 12 2008 and 3 PM respectively. When the timeframe display spans one or more months the labels and may read July 2009 and 16 respectively. When the timeframe display spans one or more years the labels and may read 2009 and Nov respectively. When the timeframe display spans one or more decades the labels and may read 2000s and 2009 respectively. Although a particular set of timeframe ranges time spans and respective labels and are disclosed herein the timeframe control is not limited in this regard and could be adapted to display any time span using any type of labeling known in the art. Moreover other timeframe controls such a calendar control or the like could be used under the teachings of this disclosure. The timeframe controls may reference an absolute timeframe a virtual timeframe a relative timeframe e.g. years since the contributor s birth where the birth year is not defined or the like.

A user may move the timeframe display in time by directly manipulating the display e.g. clicking and or sliding the display using the zoom controls to change the time span or scale of the control and or using browse controls and to shift the control forward or backward in time. On a touch screen gestures and touches may be used to give user input to the timeframe display. A keyboard can be used as well. For example in one embodiment the Left and Right keys scroll time backwards and forwards respectively and the Up and Down keys expand and contract the duration of time displayed. Likewise holding the Shift key may cause a selected region to expand rather than change in response to a command that otherwise would change the prevailing time.

The timeframe control may include a story indicator region which may comprise indications of where particular items e.g. stories fall within the timeframe of the timeframe control . Accordingly the story indication region may be tied to the timeframe control such that the timescale and or range displayed in the timeframe control corresponds to the chronology of the story indications . The timeframe range on the display at which a particular story indication is shown indicates the timeframe of the item e.g. the indicator may correspond to a story having a timeframe comprising the time indicated by the labels and .

In some embodiments the story indication region may comprise a heat or density map. As used herein a heat map may refer to a modification of regions within a timeframe control or story indication region to indicate the quality of the items therein. For example the items within the region of the story indication region may be highly rated as determined by user submitted ratings or another ratings source . The appearance of the intersection indications in the region or a background area of the region may be modified to indicate that the region comprises hot content e.g. modified to have a brightly colored background . The appearance of regions e.g. region that comprise poorly rated content may be modified to appear cool e.g. modified to have a darker background .

As used herein a density map may be used to indicate the relative density of intersecting items within a particular time span in the timeframe display . In some cases the scale of the timeframe display may be such that the display intersects with a large number of items. There may be so many intersecting items that it may be impractical to show indicators for each one. Therefore in certain portions of the story indicator region a density map may replace individual story indicators or may be displayed along with a plurality of story indicators where it is not practical to display each indicator a single indicator may be used to represent a plurality of intersecting items. Like the heat indicators discussed above a density may change the appearance of certain regions of the timeframe display and or story indication region according to the relative density of intersecting items therein. Regions comprising more intersections may be displayed in hot colors whereas regions comprising fewer intersections may be displayed in cooler colors. In some cases the timeframe range and or story indication region may be displayed concurrently on different portions of the timeframe display and or story indication region . Alternatively or in addition the heat and density maps may be displayed in different ways the heat indicator may modify the appearance of the story indicators and the density map may modify a background of the story indication region or timeline display .

As illustrated in the description of a density map chronological Items may not be uniformly distributed in time. Certain regions of a timeframe may include many items whereas other regions may include only a few or none . For example a contributor may primarily contribute stories about his her summer vacations. Accordingly the summer months of a timeline may be tightly packed with intersecting items whereas other times are virtually empty. When viewing this contributor s items within a multi year timeframe it may be difficult to distinguish individual items due to this temporal clustering the story indications may be tightly clustered in certain regions of the story indication region while other regions are empty . In some embodiments the timeframe control may comprise a dynamic timescale adapted to account for disparity in item time distribution.

As discussed above some items such as stories or the like may be ordered by relative importance. See methods and above. The relative importance of an item may be determined empirically by comparing the item or item metadata e.g. story timeframe location etc. to intersection criteria such as a prevailing timeframe as displayed by a timeframe control . The comparison may further comprise comparing item properties such as quality access count and the like. Alternatively or in addition item importance may be specified by the item contributor. For example the contributor may mark an item as critical life changing. These events may be classified as milestones or marker events. 

Marker events may be used to indicate life altering watershed events that may have a permanent effect on the contributor s life. Examples of marker events may include but are not limited to marriage bar mitzvah a first trip out of the country childbirth graduation and the like. A marker event may relate to something that having happened remains true for the remainder of the contributor s lifetime. Since marker events may be defined by the contributor they may relate to virtually any experience. For example tasting gelato for the first time for many people may not be particularly significant but for some people e.g. a chef may represent a life changing moment e.g. the moment the contributor decided to become a chef . Marker events may be embodied as a story. A story may be identified as a marker event in a contribution interface such as the interface of e.g. using importance input and or selecting a marker event story type in input . In some embodiments the relative importance of items displayed in the timeline control may be used to select a dynamic time scale as described above. For example important items may be weighted more heavily when determining whether to compress or dilate a particular time region.

Marker events may be prominently displayed within a chronology such as the timeframe controls and or described above. depicts one example of a timeframe control configured to display items of varying relative importance. The appearance of the story indicators in the story indicator region may be modified to reflect the relative importance of the items represented thereby. In some embodiments a height or size of the indicators may indicate their importance. The indicator may represent a relatively important item and as such may be more prominently displayed e.g. may be taller than other less important indicators . Alternatively or in addition the indicator may be displayed in a different color or width. The indicators of less important items may be displayed less prominently. For example the indicator may correspond to a relatively unimportant item and as such may be shorter or of a less prominent color than other indicators . As discussed above item importance may be determined based upon a prevailing timeframe. Accordingly as the timeframe control is manipulated e.g. to change the time scale move within the chronology or the like the relative importance of the items may change causing a corresponding change to the indicators .

Indicators of the most important items e.g. marker events may be displayed prominently. The indicator may represent a marker event. In some embodiments the indicator may be selectable and or may comprise a selectable area which when selected or hovered over by a cursor may cause an additional display element to appear. The display element may display a link badge of the marker event story may provide a short description of the marker event or the like.

At step the method may start and be initialized as described above. At step a request for a timeframe control may be received. The request may be issued responsive to a user interaction with an interface such as the interface and or of . In some embodiments the request may include a timeframe of interest the request may indicate that the timeframe control is to display a timeframe having a particular start time and a particular end time . Alternatively or in addition the timeframe of interest may be received responsive to user manipulation of a timeframe control responsive to the user manipulating zoom controls browse controls or the like .

At step a set of items intersecting with the timeframe to be covered by the timeframe control may be identified. The items may be identified as described above e.g. by comparing a timeframe of the item s to the timeframe of the timeframe control .

At step a time distribution of the identified items may be evaluated to identify sparse regions and or dense regions. In some embodiments step may comprise evaluating ratings of the identified items. As discussed above item ratings may be used to mark hot or cold areas on a timeline control.

At step the method may determine whether a time scale of the control should be altered. In some embodiments the determination of step may comprise determining whether the sparse regions identified at step are sufficiently sparse that compression would not render them unsuitable for use. The determination may comprise calculating a compression threshold which may be based upon the number of items in the sparse region s to a desired level of compression. The compression threshold may indicate how much a particular region may be compressed before item density becomes too great e.g. item density may not exceed a particular compression threshold . Step may further comprise calculating a dilation threshold for dense regions which may quantify how much dilation would be required to reach a desired item density. The threshold s may be compared to determine whether changing the time scale would result in a net benefit e.g. improve the dense regions by dilation while not rendering the sparse regions unusable as a result of excess compression . The comparison may comprise comparing the compression threshold to the dilation threshold of various regions. If neither threshold can be satisfied the time span may be unchanged or the approach representing the best result may be selected. The best result may be the result that provides some improvement to the sparse regions but not reaching a dilation threshold while minimizing adverse effects on the compressed regions while perhaps exceeding a compression threshold . In some embodiments the relative importance of the items is used to weight the thresholds and or to determine whether to modify the time scale. For example the dilation threshold of a region comprising important items may be increased to ensure that the indicators for these important items are adequately displayed perhaps to the detriment of other less important indicators . Similarly the compression threshold of a region comprising important e.g. a marker event may be increased to prevent the region from being compressed in favor of other less important item indicators.

If the method determines that the timescale is to be modified the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step a dynamic timescale for the timeframe control may be determined. As discussed above the dynamic timescale may compress sparse regions of the timeframe and dilate dense regions. The degree to which each region is compressed or dilated may be based on the compression dilation thresholds described above.

At step a timeframe control may be provided for presentation to a user. Step may comprise providing a timeframe directive to a control including a dynamic time span providing item indicators for display on the control and so on. Step may further comprise determining whether to display intersecting items as individual indicators or in some other way such as composite indicators density regions or the like. For example if all of the regions are considered to dense exceed a dilation threshold and there are no sparse regions to compress the method may consolidate item indicators into composite indicators and or depict intersecting items within density regions discussed above.

Step may further comprise marking regions by rating and or by density. In some embodiments item ratings evaluated at step may be used to mark certain regions of the timeframe control as hot and or cold. Marking a region may comprise directing a display component to modify an appearance of one or more display components e.g. modify the background color of a region of the story indication region of . Region density may be similarly marked.

As discussed above a contributor may submit content such as stories to a network accessible service e.g. website where they may be stored and made available to other users. The contributor may establish a profile which may comprise information describing the user and may include such information as profile avatar e.g. graphical image such as a photo representing the user contact information citizenship residency age birthday marital status preferences musical artistic etc. and so on.

In some embodiments and as discussed above in conjunction with user profile information may be tied to a chronology. Accordingly a user profile may include multiple copies of a particular attribute each associated with a different respective timeframe. For example the marital status of a user may be single until Nov. 3 2003 be married from Nov. 4 2003 to Dec. 1 2009 and be divorced from December 2 onward. Other user profile attributes may change over time. For example a user profile may comprise a plurality of profile images each graphically representing the user during a different timeframe. The images may be photos taken at different times in the user s life e.g. me at 20 at 22 at 30 at 45 and so on . User preferences such as favorite movie musical genre and the like may be tied to particular timeframes. In some embodiments as new preferences are entered the old preferences replaced thereby are automatically assigned an end time and the new preference is automatically assigned a start time. These time values may be the time the new preference was received or some other user defined time. Similarly user profile information that is determined by the other users e.g. contributor ratings etc. may be tied to a timeframe changes in a contributor s ratings over time may indicate that the user s content is improving. Although a particular set of user profile attributes are discussed herein it would be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the teachings of this disclosure could be applied to any type of profile information. As such this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular set of profile attributes.

The interface may include one or more profile edit controls each comprising a respective timeframe control and input . The edit control may specify which profile attribute is to be edited thereby e.g. indicate that the control edits the marital status user profile attribute . Alternatively or in addition the edit control may comprise a profile selection input to allow the user to select different profile attributes for editing.

The input may be configured to receive user profile information entered by the user. The input may be configured to receive text graphical images video audio multimedia content and the like. Like the timeframe controls described above timeframe controls of the timeframe control may be used to select a particular timeframe and or may include zoom and or browse controls and the like . The selected timeframe may indicate the timeframe during which the profile attribute entered in the input is valid. The control may include a save input and or a cancel input . The save input may cause the timeframe and profile attribute value entered via the input to be submitted to and or stored at the network accessible service e.g. website and included in the user s profile. The cancel input may discard the contents of the control . In some embodiments the profile edit control may include an access control input which may be used to specify which users are allowed to access the user profile information.

In some embodiments the control may include an access control input which may be used to determine which of the user s circles are to be allowed to view the attribute value the value entered via . The access control input may include an alias input which may be used to indicate an alternative alias attribute value to display to users who do not have access to the attribute value e.g. the alias of a marital status attribute value may be not disclosed or the like .

In one example wherein the edit control is used to enter a marital status user profile attribute a user may select a timeframe spanning his birth date until Nov. 3 2003 and enter single in the input . The user may then select a different timeframe e.g. spanning Nov. 4 2002 to Dec. 1 2009 and enter married in the input . Finally the user may enter divorced in the input and specify an open ended timeframe beginning on Dec. 2 2009.

The user may specify other attributes in a similar manner. Each attribute may be tied to a different respective timeframe using the timeframe control or some other mechanism . Accordingly the user profile may comprise multiple copies of the same user profile attribute each associated with a different timeframe. Accordingly each user profile attribute may be stored in connection with a respective timeframe start time and or end time . User profile information may therefore be referenced chronologically and or by a prevailing timeframe. In addition the user profile information may be associated with access controls which may indicate which users are to be allowed to access which attributes or attribute updates .

For example in a prevailing timeframe spanning 1998 to 2002 the marital status attribute of the user profile discussed above would be single. During a different prevailing time spanning 1998 to Nov. 2 2003 the marital status may be married and during the prevailing time spanning 1998 to Nov. 5 2003 the marital status may be divorced. The user may want to hide the fact that he was divorced in 2003 from everyone but those in his family circle. Therefore when entering the divorced attribute the user may specify via the access control input that only his family circle is to be allowed to see the divorced attribute. When the prevailing timeframe includes Nov. 3 2003 only the users in the family circle may see divorced all other users may continue to see married. 

As illustrated above in some embodiments the selection of which attribute to display may be based on access controls or attribute freshness e.g. the latest or most recent value within the prevailing timeframe may be displayed . In other embodiments other selection mechanisms may be used for instance the attribute having the most overlap with the prevailing timeframe may be displayed.

At step the received user profile information comprising the user profile attributes and respective timeframes may be stored in a datastore such as a database directory or the like. Receiving user profile information may further comprise generating user profile information. For example a user rating may be generated from a plurality of user submitted ratings. The user rating may be associated with a respective timeframe e.g. the user s contributor rating was 4 10 from Nov. 3 2008 to Apr. 3 2009 .

At step a request for user profile information may be received. The request may specify a prevailing timeframe.

At step user profile information that intersects with the prevailing time may be identified. More than one attribute may intersect with the prevailing time. In some embodiments the most recently edited or freshest attribute may be selected. Alternatively the different comparison metric may be used. For example the attribute having the highest degree of overlap may be selected.

Step may comprise evaluating access controls associated with the user profile attributes. If the user requesting the user profile information is not allowed to access a particular attribute an alternative attribute value may be selected e.g. the next most recent attribute .

At step the user profile attributes may be returned to requester for display in an interface such as the interface element discussed below.

As discussed above a user profile may comprise one or more profile photos representing a user or other graphical representations . In some embodiments the appearance of a user avatar may change in response to the user s disposition preferences and or interests. A user may set his her disposition manually e.g. using a user profile authoring interface such as the interface discussed above . Alternatively or in addition the user s disposition may be inferred by from the content submitted by the user. For example the network accessible service e.g. website may determine that the user is in a happy disposition when the user submits stories having a particular theme and or associated with a particular set of descriptive tags e.g. positive tags such as fun happy great etc. . Comments and other user submissions may indicate the user s disposition. For example if a significant proportion of content reviews submitted by the user are negative or contain negative language the user may be identified as being grumpy or sad. 

Other user activities may be evaluated to identify user disposition. For example the time distribution of the user s contributions to the network accessible service e.g. website may be indicative of whether the user is socially active e.g. a drop off in user contributions may indicate that the user is becoming withdrawn whereas an uptick may be a sign that the user is more socially active . The timeframe and or location of submitted content may be similarly indicative of user disposition. For example timeframe and or location may indicate that the user is on vacation partying a lot many stories occurring during the late evening hours or the like.

After determining the user s emotional disposition the user profile avatar may be updated accordingly a user identified as happy may be depicted with a user profile photo tagged with happy or dynamically modified to appear happy e.g. different background colors etc. . Similarly modifications may be made to cause the user s avatar to appear grumpy or sad. In some embodiments a user profile may comprise a plurality of profile avatars which as discussed above may each be associated with a respective timeframe. In addition the profile avatars may be tagged with a disposition happy sad grumpy etc. . Accordingly modifying the appearance of the profile avatar may comprise selecting an appropriately tagged avatar.

In some embodiments other users may comment on other users disposition. For example if a first user were to flame a second user in a comment or story the second user may submit a report indicating the first user is grumpy. Conversely if the first user is polite in his her comments to the second user the second user may submit a report indicating that the first user is friendly or happy. If multiple reports of similar dispositions for the first user are received from different source the first user may be identified as having the reported disposition.

Other user dispositions aside from emotional state or attitude may be determined from user submitted content. For example the user s current interests may be inferred if the user submits a large number of sports related stories the user may be identified as a soccer fan. The user s avatar may then be dynamically updated to indicate this status e.g. the photo or avatar may include a soccer ball graphic may be displayed on a soccer field or the like . Other preferences such as music preferences artistic taste travel affinity or the like may be similarly depicted.

Similarly user profile attributes and or user modeling information discussed below may be used to dynamically modify the appearance of a user profile avatar including an avatar that is a caricature. Examples of such attributes include height weight relationship status marital status musical and other preferences activity and so on.

At step the method may start and be initialized as described above. At step user profile information may be received which as discussed above may comprise one or more user avatars or photos each associated with a particular timeframe and or tagged with a particular disposition. At step the avatars may be stored on a datastore in association with user profile information for the user.

At step user submitted content may be received. The user submitted content may comprise user contributed stories photographs comments tags and the like. In some embodiments step may comprise receiving an explicit disposition indicator from the user himself. Similarly step may comprise receiving reports on the user s disposition from other users.

At step the content received at step may be evaluated to identify a user disposition. The user disposition may refer to an emotional state of the user and or current user preferences or interests. The identified user disposition may be determined by combining inferences obtained from user submitted content user indicator of his her disposition user profile and or modeling information and or reports from other users. Each of these sources may be assigned a relative weight and combined to determine an overall user disposition.

Step may further comprise identifying user interest or preference dispositions. As discussed above user interests and preferences may be identified by searching for commonly used descriptive tags and or other content submitted by the user such as user profile information user modeling information and the like.

At step a user avatar may be selected and or modified to reflect the user disposition identified at step . In some embodiments an avatar may be selected from a plurality of avatars each tagged with a particular disposition. If the user has a single avatar the avatar may be modified to reflect the user disposition. The modifications may comprise modifying the color content of the avatar modifying an appearance of the avatar brightness contrast saturation etc. changing a background of the avatar or the like.

Step may further comprise adding user interest and or preference indicators to the avatar. These indicators may comprise overlays labels or other display elements included on or around the user s avatar. For example if the user has shown an interest in travel to Paris the avatar may include the Eiffel tower or other prominent landmark in the background. A user who has indicated an interest in a particular sport or activity may be depicted with an associated item e.g. a soccer ball boat paintbrush hiking boots or the like . The user avatar may be modified account to any number of different user dispositions interests and or properties. For example if the user has recently lost weight as indicated by his her user profile the avatar may be thinned. If the user is married the avatar may be shown with a wedding band if the user has identified a favorite movie the avatar may be updated with assets from the movie and so on. Changing the prevailing timeframe has the potential to change the configuration and attributes of the avatar reflecting the evolving condition of the user being represented.

At step the avatar selected and or modified at step may be made available to other users of the network accessible service e.g. website . The avatar may be made available in a user profile display element e.g. display element of in an about me page provided by the website or the like.

As discussed above access controls may be applied to user submitted content to control which users are able to access the content. Access controls may be specified with respect to one or more user defined circles. A circle may comprise a set of one or more users with which the user has a particular relationship. A family circle may comprise the user s family members in the user community of the network accessible service e.g. website a friends circle may comprise the user s friends a co workers circle may comprise the user s co workers a Facebook Friends circle may comprise a user s friends on FACEBOOK and so on. Alternatively or in addition a circle may be associated with people who are invited to view a story or a storyline the invitation taking any number of forms those forms including a link to the story or storyline that confers temporary or permanent membership in a circle or rights equivalent or nearly equivalent to membership and so on. Any number of different circles defining any number of different levels of trust and or relationships may be defined. In some embodiments a user may be added to two or more circles e.g. a co worker may also be a friend . A user may change circle membership at any time.

Access controls may be applied to any type of content submitted by a contributor including but not limited to story content story metadata user comments user profile information and the like. In some embodiments access controls may be applied chronologically. For example a user may be a friend for a pre determined timeframe e.g. from Dec. 2 1998 to Jan. 4 2004 the user may have access to friend content that falls within the friend timeframe. The user may not be allowed to access content marked for access by friends that falls outside of the friend timeframe or extends before or after the friend timeframe .

In some embodiments access controls may be applied chronologically such that a particular set of access controls may apply to all user submitted content pertaining to a particular timeframe. Some users may not want certain periods of their life to be revealed to the public. For example a high school student may want to hide their embarrassing elementary school years from view a partner in a second marriage may want to make private the years of the first marriage and their status during that time . A college student job seeker may want to obscure all but their current life activities and so on. An access control policy of this type may apply the same set of access controls to user submitted content pertaining to a specified e.g. Jan. 1 1976 to Jun. 30 1980 . In some embodiments these chronological access controls may be set as defaults on individual stories which the contributor may selectively modify on an item by item basis. Alternatively the chronological access control may be implemented as an additional access control layer which may be applied in addition to other access controls.

As discussed above aliases may be used to control access to personal or private information. Locations may be protected by an alias the user s home address may be assigned an alias of home. Timeframes may be similarly aliased the user s high school graduation date may be aliased as graduation or senior year. Similarly the contributor s name e.g. user name may assigned an alias. In some embodiments an alias may be tied an underlying piece of actual data. For example the home address alias may be tied to the actual location of the user s home the graduation alias may be tied to the user s actual graduation date and so on. Alternatively in embodiments where the user may never want the actual information to be released an alias may not be associated with any actual data.

The user may determine which users if any should have access to the data using the circle based access controls discussed above. For example the user may specify that only members of the family circle may access his actual name his home address a particular photo or photos the tags of a photo or story the caption of a photo or certain text of a story and so on. Access controls on items story and or item metadata may determine whether other user may access user submitted content. Of course if a contributor has marked a story as family only a user who is not in the family circle may not be able to access it. However if a user has marked a story as public but has used an alias to specify the story location which is only available to those in the contributor s family circle a public user may not be able to find the story by location or view the location of the story if when the public user finds the story in a different way . Similar access controls may be used to limit browsing based on contributor name when a contributor alias is used timeframe and so on.

At step a contributor may create one or more circles each circle may comprise one or more users. A circle user may be another user of the network accessible service e.g. website . Alternatively a user may be a semblance discussed below identified by a name distinguished name email address alias or the like. A semblance may refer to a user that is not yet a member of the network accessible service e.g. website therefore when the user joins using the specified distinguished name or other relatable information the user may automatically be added to the specified circle. In some embodiments adding a user to a circle who is not yet a member of the website has not registered an account may cause an invitation message to be sent to the user e.g. Joe has added you to his circle register to see what he has to say . Step may comprise storing the circles and indications of the users therein in a datastore such as a database directory or the like.

In some embodiments step may comprise establishing one or more aliases. As described above an alias may be a user defined term that may be linked a particular data item. The user may specify any number of aliases corresponding to any number of data items including but not limited to a timeframe a location a name a profile attribute e.g. photograph marital status etc. metadata or the like.

Although circle and alias creation is depicted as a step a user may be able to create edit and or remove circles and or aliases at any time. Therefore the disclosure should not be read as limited to a particular ordering and or timeframe for circle and or alias creation.

At step the contributor may submit content to be made available on the network accessible service e.g. website . The content may comprise a content item such as a photograph text video a story collection of items or the like. The content may further comprise descriptive intersection metadata such as a timeframe location descriptive tags participant indicators a rating or the like. In some embodiments a content item may be associated with an alias. An alias may comprise data that is to be publically available the alias and data that is to be made available to certain permitted users the data underlying the alias . As will be discussed below the permitted users may be identified by circle membership.

The content or portions thereof received at step may be associated with respective access controls. In some embodiments content item access control may be expressed permissively e.g. allow circles A B and C to access this content . Alternatively content item access control may be expressed exclusively e.g. allow the content to be accessed by all users except the following circles or groups . Content item access control may be permitted to people who click on a link or to people who can be authenticated as having a certain status on a social media site such as being a FACEBOOK friend or a TWITTER follower. Access controls may be used to specify how certain portions of the content are displayed. For example the access control of a location alias may indicate the true location is only shown to users in the contributor s family circle all other users see only the alias value e.g. Joe s house. .

At step a request for content submitted by the contributor may be received. The request may be received from a particular user or may be received anonymously from an unregistered user . The request may reference a single content item or a collection of content items e.g. a story .

At step the method may determine whether the request can be granted or which portions of the request may be granted . Access may be determined by comparing the access controls associated with the item s to the user. For example if a requested content item is marked as being available only those in the contributor s family circle the contributor s family circle may be queried to determine whether the requesting user is a member. If not the request may be denied and the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step . If a collection of content items is requested access controls of each item may be evaluated and the user may be permitted access only to the items the user is allowed to see.

Step may further comprise determining which version of a content item the requester is allowed to access. For example one or more of the requested items may be associated with an alias. The determination of step may comprise determining whether the user should have access to the alias version or the actual value of the item s .

At step the content items the requesting user is permitted to access may be presented in an interface. At step the user may be informed that he she is not authorized to access the requested content items.

At steps the method may start and be initialized a contributor may create one or more circles and or aliases and user submitted content may be received at the network accessible service e.g. website as described above.

At step a request for an intersection set of intersecting stories may be received e.g. a request for an intersection space . The request may comprise intersection criteria such as a prevailing timeframe location or the like. The request may be received responsive to user interaction with an interface such as the interfaces and or if .

At step the method may iterate over each of the stories identified at step to determine whether the story should appear in the intersection space.

At step one of the stories may be examined to determine whether it should be included in the intersection space. The determination may be based upon story access controls as described above. The determination may also be based upon the visibility of story metadata. For example if story was identified using timeframe location contributor or other metadata for which the contributor has specified an alias and the requesting user does not have access to the actual value of the alias the story may be excluded from the intersection space. If the story was identified using other metadata to which the user has access the story may be included in the intersection space. If the story is to be removed from the intersection space the flow may continue to step where the story may be removed from the intersection space otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step the method may determine whether there are additional intersection stories to evaluate. If so the flow may return to step where a next story in the intersection space may be evaluated to determine whether it should removed.

At step the stories remaining in the intersection space may be presented to the user in an interface. Step may comprise selecting appropriate alias values for each of the remaining stories. The alias values may be selected using circle based access controls as described above.

As discussed above in some embodiments a user may borrow a story of another user. In some embodiments when a story is borrowed the original contributor maintains control over its content and who can see a story or a link or other reference to a story. In these cases borrowing a story causes the story to be available in a storyline only for those people who have permission to see it such as people in a specific circle or circles . In other embodiments when a story is borrowed the borrowing user may apply his her own set of access controls thereto. Accordingly the borrowing user may share a story more broadly than the original contributor. As discussed above multi tiered access control may allow content to be shared through a community connector. A community connector may be a user who has a particular relationship with a disparate group of people. One example of a community connector is a youth soccer coach. Each of the parents may have a relationship with the coach but may not necessarily have relationship with one another. The parents may want to share content related to the soccer team but may not want to share it publically. In this case the parents may each share their soccer related stories with the coach who in turn may borrow the stories and set appropriate access controls to share the stories with the other parents whom the coach has added to a team circle.

In some embodiments however the ability of a story borrower to further disseminate a story may be limited. For example the contributor may publish the story to only his family circle but someone in his family circle may publish the story publically against the contributor s wishes. The original story contributor may prevent a story from being disseminated too broadly using aliases as described above. When borrowed the contributor s originally applied alias access controls may remain with the story. Therefore even when shared publically users outside of the family circle may not have access to story metadata. In this way other users may be kept from stumbling upon the story. Moreover the use of aliases may hide sensitive or private information in the story from anyone outside of the contributor s family circle. Therefore even through the story is available to the public it may be difficult to find and may not expose sensitive information about the contributor.

In some embodiments the original contributor may limit how a borrowed story may be shared. For example the contributor may specify that a story may be borrowed but cannot be shared beyond the original circle. In this way the users who borrow the story in effect import the family circle of the original contributor. Alternatively or in addition the original contributor may be given the right to apply exclusive access controls to the story. As discussed above exclusive access controls may be used to specify users who may not access certain content. The exclusive access controls may stay with a story and may limit how other users can share it when borrowed. For example the borrower s permissions may be applied along with the original contributor s exclusive rules such that even if the borrower allows the story to be published publically it will be prevented from being disseminated to users in the exclude directive which may comprise a public identifier excluding all users .

The methods and may be adapted for use with borrowed content. In the case of step of method the determination of whether to grant a user access to content may be based upon access controls applied by the borrower and not the original contributor. However when the item is provided to the requester the selection of which version of an alias item may be predicated on the alias access controls of the original contributor not the borrower who may be unable to change the access controls associated with borrowed aliases .

The method may be similarly modified. The determination of step may be predicated upon whether the user has access to the story according to the access controls provided by the borrower. However availability of the metadata used to identify the story in the intersection space e.g. the timeframe location contributor or the like may be determined according to the alias access controls set by the original story contributor. Similarly when a story is presented to the user the selection of which version of an alias item is to be displayed may be determined by the access controls set by the original story contributors. In embodiments in which the original contributor retains control over how his content is shared by borrowers methods and or may be similarly modified the determination steps and or may be based on access control restrictions set by the original contributor . In some embodiments the borrower of a story may augment it by commenting on why they borrowed it or by adding new or substitute metadata. For example if the original contributor of a story on a concert listed certain friends as participants in the story a borrower might add new or substitute participants to reflect their experience at the concert.

As discussed above a contributor may tag other users of the network accessible service e.g. website as participants in a story. When a user is tagged as a participant the story may appear in a list of stories pertaining to the user e.g. may appear in the user s life page . A user may borrow the story which as described above may make the story available to those within the borrowing user s circles or available publically .

In some cases however a user may wish to be un tagged from a story the user may not want to appear as a story participant . In some cases requests to remove participants from a story may be automatically granted. In some embodiments the determination of whether to automatically grant participation removal may be based on the story type. A user may not have the right to be removed from certain stories such as news stories without cause. However to mitigate this users identified as story participants may be given the right to comment on a story.

In some embodiments a user may modify the way he she is identified as a story participant. For example a user may request to be identified in the story using an alias. When so identified only the certain permitted users may be able to see the user s true identity. The access control directives e.g. circles controlling access to the participant alias may be determined by the participant and not the story contributor. As above however in certain stories users identified as participants may not be allowed to be referenced by alias without cause.

At step user submitted content may be received at the network accessible service e.g. website . The content may comprise a story contributed and or authored using an interface such as interface of . The content may comprise metadata including metadata identifying one or more story participants. The story participants may be identified using a user profile identifier a distinguished name or any other identifying information. In some embodiments the network accessible service e.g. website may provide an interface to facilitate the identification of other users e.g. a user directory .

Step may further comprise storing the content in a datastore of the network accessible service e.g. website and making the content available to other users via one or more presentation interfaces. In some embodiments step may comprise notifying the participants that a story in which they are identified is available on the network accessible service e.g. website . The notification may be made via an email message user profile message displayed in the user s My Life interface or the like.

In some embodiments users identified as story participants may be given the right to comment on the story. The notification discussed above may inform the users of this right and provide a link to access and or comment on the story. Since the story participants have a right to comment the original story contributor may not be able add remove or edit the story comments submitted by the participants. In addition a comment section of the story may prominently display participant comments to prevent these comments from being drowned out by other comments.

At step a request to remove a user as a story participant or modify how the user is identified in the story e.g. replace the user s name with an alias .

At step the method may determine whether the user s participant status may be automatically modified. The determination may be based upon the story type. If the story is a news story then users may not be automatically removed. The determination may further comprise evaluating a reputation metric associated with the contributor. As will be discussed below the results of participant arbitration may be stored in association with a contributor. If the contributor has shown a history of erroneously or maliciously tagging story participants the user s request may be automatically granted even if the story is tagged as news or as another news type story . Similarly a reputation metric associated with the participant may be evaluated. If the participant has repeatedly attempted and failed to have himself herself removed from news stories the reputation metric of the contributor may be less likely to provide for automatic removal. If the user can be automatically removed the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step the user s participation status may be modified per the request of step . Modifying participation status may comprise removing the user as a story participant or using an alias to represent the user. In some embodiments removal as a story participant may cause any story comments submitted by the user to be removed or displayed less prominently just as other story comments .

Step may comprise recording the removal in a datastore such that subsequent views of the story may omit the participant. The datastore may be updated to prevent the contributor from re adding the user as a story participant without the user s express permission.

At step the user may be informed that the request to be removed as a story participant could not be automatically granted. The user may be informed of the reason e.g. the story is news and may be notified of the right to comment on the story. In some embodiments the user may be linked to a participant arbitration process in which the user may present evidence that he she should not be included in the story. The evidence may be used to indicate that the user was not actually at the events described in the story. For example the user may submit a picture to show that he she was misidentified in a story photo e.g. the user is not the person depicted in a particular tagged photo . Alternatively or in addition the user may present evidence that the contributor misidentified the user by mistake or to harass the user. The story contributor may be allowed to provide information in support of the user remaining as a story participant.

At step the method may determine whether to grant the request given the information received at step . The determination may be made automatically. For example image processing software may determine that the user is likely not the same person as the participant tagged in a story photo. Similarly the method may determine that the user was probably not involved in the story events using other information e.g. another story submitted by another user or the user himself or that the story cannot reasonably be construed as news. The determination of step may require the intervention of another user an arbiter . The arbiter may be selected or randomly selected from the users of the network accessible service e.g. website user community or may be a staff member. In some embodiments the arbitration of step may comprise comparing a reputation metric of the user to the reputation metric of the contributor. Although the comparison may not be definitive the relative reputation metrics may be used to weight the arbitration process to one side or the other.

If the arbitration step determines that the user s participation status may be modified the flow may continue to step . If not the flow may return to step where the user may continue to attempt arbitration or appeal directly to the contributor. Similarly if after arbitration the user is removed as a participant the contributor may attempt to re add the user through an arbitration process e.g. the user may be removed but the flow may return to step to determine whether the user can be re added .

The results of the participant arbitration may be stored in a datastore and or associated with a user profile of the user and or the contributor. If the method determined that the user was actually a participant and or that the request was superfluous the user s reputation metric may be decremented. Similarly if the contributor falsely claimed that the story was news or it is determined that the user was misidentified unintentionally or otherwise the contributor s reputation metric may be decremented. Conversely if the user and or contributor provided valid information in good faith and in a timely manner their respective reputation metrics may be incremented regardless of the outcome of the arbitration step .

In some embodiments if a contributor s reputation metric reaches a low threshold the user may be prevented from tagging users in his her stories. Repeated abuses may result in the contributor being banned from the network accessible service e.g. website .

The stories and related metadata submitted to the network accessible service e.g. website by a contributor may be indicative of the contributor s life experiences interests preferences and the like. In some embodiments user submitted content may be used develop a user model of the contributor. Unlike the user profile discussed above which is primarily provided by the contributor himself a user model may be determined or inferred from the content submitted by the contributor. Accordingly as used herein a user model may refer to a set of one or more user interests preferences and other contributor descriptive information determined from content submitted by the contributor. In some embodiments a user model may comprise one or more personality classifications or tags describing the contributor e.g. the contributor is a traveler an art lover etc. .

At step content submitted by the contributor may be received at the network accessible service e.g. website . As discussed above a contributor may submit various different types of content including but not limited to user submitted content items e.g. text photographs video stories etc intersection metadata e.g. timeframe location descriptive tags participants interested person s circle membership etc commentary ratings and the like. Similarly the contributor s activity on the network accessible service e.g. website may be considered user submitted content. For example searches submitted by the user may be indicative of a user s interests as may be the contributor s browsing activity.

At step the user submitted content may be evaluated to develop a user model. Step may comprise identifying common themes in the user submissions such as commonly used descriptive tags common story locations or the like. The evaluation may further comprise identifying user habits by identifying repeating stories. For instance the contributor may have lunch with a friend at a particular restaurant once a month which may indicate that the contributor values long term relationships and enjoys the type of food served at the restaurant . The timeframe distribution of user submissions may indicate when the user is most active the user may be identified as a summer person if a majority of his her contributions are in the summer months. Stories related to particular locations may indicate that the user enjoys certain types of activities e.g. stories about skiing trips to the theater climbing etc. .

Less formal user submissions such as commentary ratings and the like may be leveraged to form a user model. Positive comments and or reviews on certain stories may indicate that the user has an interest in the story topic even if the contributor has not yet written about the topic. For instance the contributor may provide positive commentary and ratings of stories pertaining to mountaineering which although the contributor has never tried himself may be of interest to the contributor. Similarly user browsing or search activity may be used to model the user. For instance searches for particular topics timeframes and or locations may be used to identify user interests or affinities.

At step the user modeling information identified at step may be stored on a datastore and made available for further processing such as user recommendations user affinities discussed below and the like. For example if the user model indicates that the contributor has an interest in a particular topic or location stories on the topic or location may be recommended to him.

In some embodiments the further processing of step may comprise displaying modeling information to the user or another interested user . For example and as discussed above a user profile avatar may be updated responsive to user modeling information. Modeling information may be used to show various different summaries of user activity. For example a map may be populated with the locations that the contributor visited within a particular timeframe e.g. using a timeframe control such as the controls and or disclosed above or another timeframe input . Other displays for presenting user modeling information may include contributor timeframe densities showing the density of user submitted content by time contributor rating over time contributor disposition over time prevailing descriptive tags e.g. as in a dynamic tag element such as the elements discussed above and so on. As could be appreciated by one of skill in the art the teachings of this disclosure could be adapted to present user modeling information in any number of different ways using any number of different display elements therefore the disclosure should not be read as limited in this regard.

In some embodiments user submitted content may be used to identify user affinities. User affinities may be identified by comparing user profile and or user modeling information of two or more users. Affinity identification may further comprise comparing the content submitted by two or more user contributors. Stories submitted about the same locations timeframes or topics may be used to identify specific shared experiences or similar life events even if they took place at different places and or times . For example both users may have both lived in the same town growing up may have graduated from the same university in the same year or at different times both may have lost a parent when they were young even though the loss occurred at different times and or at different locations and so on.

Accordingly identifying user affinities may include but is not limited to comparing user profile information comparing user modeling information comparing user submitted content and the like. Each type of comparison may identify a different set of user affinities user profile comparisons may identify affinities in the ways that the users describe themselves user model comparisons may identify affinities inferred from the content submitted by the users and the user submitted content may be used to identify shared experiences between the users.

User affinities may be identified responsive to a request from one or more users. For example a first user may query the network accessible service e.g. website to identify his her affinities with another specific user e.g. show me what I have in common with Joe Jackson . Alternatively an affinity query may be more open ended e.g. show me the users with whom I have the most in common .

At step an affinity query may be received. The query may be received from a user who has submitted content to the network accessible service e.g. website . The query may specify a particular user as a target of the query e.g. what do I have in common with user X .

At step user profile information may be compared. The comparison may comprise identifying similarities affinities in the user profiles. For example the comparison may determine whether the users share the same taste in music are of a similar age if the age information of user X is available to the requester and so on. In addition a user profile comparison may compare the circle membership of the users. The circle comparison may be used to identify shared friends or more distant relationships e.g. you are a friend of a friend of user X or your friend is in X s family circle .

As discussed above user profiles under the teachings of this disclosure may comprise chronological user profile information in which different attributes may be tied to different respective timeframes. Accordingly the comparison at step may comprise a chronological comparison to compare the users over time. For example it may be determined that both users liked the same band during high school. This shared preference may be identified as a musical affinity despite the fact that the musical preferences of the users has diverged over time.

At step user modeling information of the users may be compared. As discussed above user modeling information may be determined or inferred from the content submitted by the users. Accordingly the comparison may identify shared preferences that the users have not yet identified in themselves. Step may further comprise comparing a disposition of the users discussed above in conjunction with .

At step the content submitted by the users may be compared. The comparison may comprise identifying shared experiences between the users e.g. a trip to the same locations at similar or different times . Shared experiences stories may be identified using the metadata associated therewith. Shared experiences may be identified by comparing story location metadata the stories occurred in the same place comparing story timeframe stories occurred at the same time involved some shared participant s shared interested person s described using similar tags or any other story content or metadata. The comparison of user submitted content may further comprise comparing commentary and or ratings submitted by the users.

Access to other users stories or user profile information discussed above may be limited by access controls such as circle membership. Therefore in some embodiments some affinities may not be identified if the requesting user does not have access to the other users stories profile information or metadata aliases. Alternatively the comparison may identify the affinity but may hide the underlying information from the user the user may be informed of a location affinity but may not be told what that affinity is .

At step the results of the affinity comparison may be provided to requester. The results may be presented in an interface for display to the user in a browser or other application. As described above step may comprise any number of different displays and or presentation types to display any number of different user affinities. For example the affinity comparison may comprise a map showing the locations in common between the two users. The locations in common may be identified even if the users were not there at the same or similar timeframes e.g. user 1 visited Prague in 2003 and user 2 visited in 2008 the location intersection may still represent a user affinity. Other displays such as the prevalence of particular descriptive tags story types and so on may be displayed. The timeframes of affinities may be displayed in some embodiments. Two people may be fans of the Beatles but their enthusiasms may have started and or ended on different dates and been of different durations. The age at which a user acquired or lost an affinity may also be compared indicating for example that one person was a fan of Harry Potter books from age 5 to 12 while another was a fan from ages 33 35. These affinities can be compared and contrasted for two or more people indeed all of the people who are public fans of Harry Potter might be able to see how their ages and dates compared to those of other fans.

Although depicts identification of user affinities based on user profile user modeling and user submitted content in other embodiments only one or more of these comparisons may be made. For example a user may only be interested in identifying shared experiences and as such only the comparison between user submitted content may be made.

Users with which a particular user shares a high degree of affinity may be potential friends of the user e.g. included in one or more circles of the user . In some embodiments a user affinity process may continually search for potential user affinities. If or when a high degree of user to user affinity is identified the identified users may be introduced to one another via a private introduction. As will be described below a private introduction may be configured to introduce users to one another without compromising the users privacy.

As discussed above users may protect the information submitted to the network accessible service e.g. website using access controls aliases and the like. It may be difficult to identify user affinities using only public information. In some embodiments both public and access controlled information may be used to identify user affinities while maintaining the privacy of the access controlled information. Accordingly user to user affinities may be identified without exposing any private user information.

In one embodiment a user may be allowed to opt in or opt out of affinity matching. For instance a user may not be interested in identifying affinities with other users or being identified thereby . If a user opts out of affinity matching his her protected data may not be used. If a user does not opt out or explicitly opts in private data may be used to identify potential user affinities. Alternatively a user may be given the opportunity to completely opt out of affinity matching e.g. may indicate that they wish to be excluded from affinity matching even if it involves only public information .

At step a request to identify user affinities may be received. The request may be received from a particular user or may be received as part of an automated affinity identification process. In some embodiments the request may include affinity criteria such as location age and the like. These criteria may be used to reduce the search space for the affinity matching. For example a user may want to identify user affinities only with local users users who reside in the same area as the user .

At step a pool of affinity candidate users may be identified. The user pool may be identified using the affinity criteria discussed above if any .

At step an affinity metric may be calculated for each user in the user pool. Calculating the affinity metric may comprise iterating over steps and and for each user.

At steps and user profile user model and user submitted content may be used to identify user affinities as described above.

At step a user affinity metric may be calculated using the affinities identified at steps and or . The metric may quantify the individual affinities into an overall affinity metric for the user. Certain affinities may be weighted higher than others e.g. a life experience affinity may be weighted higher than a high school music preference affinity . The affinity metric may also take into considerations any affinity conflicts between the users. An affinity conflict may be conflicting preferences or interests between the users. For example one user may be identified as a social conservative and the other may be a flaming liberal. While this conflict alone may not definitively preclude identification of a user affinity it may reduce the overall affinity score. Like the affinities discussed above affinity conflicts may be given different weights e.g. a political conflict may be weighted higher than a favorite type of food conflict .

At step if there are more users in the pool to process the flow may return to step where the affinity score of a next user may be determined otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step indications of high affinity users if any may be provided to the user. Step may comprise comparing the user affinity metrics to an affinity threshold metrics that fall below the threshold may not be provided to the user. Alternatively or in addition the user affinity metrics may be ordered such that only the highest affinity users are returned e.g. only the top five .

In some embodiments the user affinity indications may be provided in an interface to the user. Each affinity may include a link to a profile of the other user and may indicate the affinity score. Alternatively the affinity indications may be anonymous. For example the indication may indicate only that you have a high affinity with user redacted click here to connect with them. The message may be sent to both users and the identity of the users may not be revealed until both users agree to be introduced to one another. In some embodiments the introduction may comprise identifying the users to one another e.g. linking to the users respective user profiles . The introduction may further comprise indications of the areas of affinity between the users e.g. you both enjoy riding horses hiking lived in Magnolia . . . and so on .

In some embodiments a user may be looking for a particular person he she encountered at particular place and or within a particular timeframe e.g. at an intersection . In other embodiments the user may not remember the location where the specific location took place e.g. may not remember the name of the bar only that it was in downtown Seattle . Similarly the user may not remember the exact timeframe only that the missed connection occurred sometime during a particular day or week. In some embodiments the user may also have additional information which may be used to reduce the search space for the missed connection. For example the user may remember that the person was named Julie and was about 25 years old. Similarly the user may know the identity of other people who were also at the event. These other people may be registered at the network accessible service e.g. website and may be identified in stories describing the event.

In some embodiments the user may contribute a story about the missed connection or the event generally and specify a participant or interested person as a missed connection. As will be described below the systems and methods disclosed herein may attempt to identify a user corresponding to the missed connection using the story metadata and or the metadata of other stories. Alternatively the user may issue a query to the network accessible service e.g. website to attempt to identify the missed connection. The query may include the intersection criteria described above e.g. the timeframe the location participants interested persons descriptive tags and so on .

If one or more potential missed connections is identified the users may be introduced to one another via an anonymous introduction process. In some embodiments the introduction process may proceed as described above where the users are presented with a prompt to be introduced to the one another. Neither user profile may be exposed until both agree to the introduction. In some embodiments an introduction may include a mutual authentication step in which the users may verify that the other person is who they remember from the missed connection. The mutual authentication process may be performed without exposing the identity or other private information of either user. Several examples of mutual authentication processes are described below including a photo line up discussed below connection related questions and so on.

At step a request to identify a user may be received at the network accessible service e.g. website from a user. The request may be received via a search interface and or responsive to the user specifying a missed connection participant or interested person in a story e.g. specifying a missed connection in the participant input of . The request may specify the timeframe the missed connection occurred the location of the missed connection and the like. The request may include additional criteria such as the identity of other users at the missed connection descriptive tags of the missed connection e.g. dinner party identifying information about the missed connection e.g. the person is female named Julie and is about 25 and so on. If the request was submitted as a missed connection story participant interested person s the timeframe location and other metadata may be derived from the story itself.

At step a set of candidate missed connection users may be identified. In some embodiments the candidate missed connection users may be identified using the stories that intersect the metadata provided in the request the information received at step . The contributor s and or participants in the stories may be identified as candidate missed connection users.

In some embodiments stories that did not occur at the specified timeframe or location may also be inspected for candidate missed connection users. For example if a particular user regularly submits stories related to the missed connection location e.g. a bar the user and the participant s in the user s bar stories may be included in the set of candidate missed connection users. The users may be included even if the particular user did not contribute a bar story during the missed connection timeframe the timeframe received at step since it is possible and even likely that the user was at the bar at the time but simply neglected to contribute a story for that particular night.

At step if no candidate missed connection stories or users have been identified the flow may continue to step where the user may be notified no one was identified. The notification may comprise a prompt to broaden the request parameters e.g. increase the timeframe location or the like . When a broadened request is received the flow may return to step .

At step the candidate missed connection users may be filtered by the user s additional criteria discussed above. In some embodiments the filtering may be soft. For example the user may think that the missed connection s name was Julie but is not completely sure. Therefore when filtering on this criterion nonconforming users may be retained as missed connection candidates. Other criteria such as the missed connection s gender may be hard filters such that any missed connection candidates who do not conform to the criteria are automatically removed as candidates. The criteria may relate to story metadata in which the candidate user appears. For example the request may have indicated that the event was a dinner party at a particular restaurant. Another story also tagged as a dinner party may conform to the criteria whereas a story tagged as laser tag may fail the criteria. The user may specify which of the criteria are hard and or soft in the request of step .

In some embodiments filtering may comprise assigning a candidate likelihood metric to each of the users which may quantify the likelihood that a particular user is the missed connection. The likelihood metric may be determined using the filtering criteria described above matches may increase the user s likelihood metric and misses may decrease the metric. Candidate users who fail hard criteria and or whose likelihood metric falls below a threshold may be removed as candidates.

As discussed above if the users have opted in to be identified private story metadata and or user profile information may be used in the identification and or filtering steps and or . However if a user has opted out from using private data to identify affinities or missed connections the private data may not be used. Similarly if a user has opted out from missed connection identification the user may be excluded from the candidate list at steps and or .

If at step and after the filtering of step no candidate missed connection users remain the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step indications of the one or more candidate missed connection users may be presented to the requesting user. The candidate missed connection users may be displayed anonymously e.g. the username profile and other information even if public may not be exposed . In some embodiments if there are more than a threshold number of candidates the method may request that the user provide additional missed connection criteria to reduce the list to a manageable number. For example the list may be in a dynamic user interface in which the requesting user can specify additional criteria as it comes to mind and see the changes to the resulting list e.g. show only the users who are named Julie or whose name starts with J .

The display of step may comprise a link to be introduced to the missed connection. In some embodiments the link may operate as described above the users may be introduced after both users anonymously agree to the introduction. In other embodiments the introduction may comprise a mutual authentication process.

At step a request for mutual authentication may be received. The request may be received from a user selecting a missed connection or affinity link and may identify two or more users who are to be introduced to one another.

At step the method may determine whether the users have specified that mutual authentication is required for introductions. In some embodiments users may have privacy settings indicating how introductions are to take place. An outgoing user may accept introduction requests without mutual authentication or prior approval. Other more private users may require explicit approval or mutual authentication. If neither user requires pre approval or mutual authentication the flow may continue to step where an introduction may take place otherwise the flow may continue to step .

At step an approval or authentication method may be selected. As discussed above many different forms of mutual authentication or approval may be provided including but not limited to a photo lineup anonymous questions limited approval or the like. The selection of step may be predicated on user preferences and or the availability of user profile information. For example if one of the users to be introduced prefers not use to photo introductions or does not have a profile picture or the profile photo is not public then a photo lineup may not be possible unless the user agrees to provide a photo for the purposes of the method .

At step the selected approval or authentication method may be implemented and the results determined. If the results indicate that an introduction is to take place the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step where the user s may be notified that the introduction was rejected.

At step the users may be introduced to one another. The introduction may comprise the users exchanging user profile information links . Introduction may further comprise identifying the timeframe location interested person s and or participants at the missed connection event e.g. We met at Sally s dinner party .

At step the method may issue a query to each of the users. The query may be automatically generated or may be authored by another user. The query may ask the users if they would like to be introduced and if so provide for mutual user authentication. For example the query submitted to a candidate missed connection may read Another user is looking for someone who might be you would you like to be introduced They claim to have met you at timeframe location . If so do you recognize them here . If the response is positive the missed connection requester may receive the following query Redacted would like to be introduced do you recognize this person here . The query may comprise a photo lineup including a set of selected photos along with the photo of the other user. If the users can pick each other out of the lineups the users may be introduced otherwise the introduction may fail.

In another example the query may comprise one or more questions in place of or in addition to a set of photos. The question s may be used to authenticate that the other user is the subject of the missed connection. The question s may be authored by the users to be introduced. For example the query to a candidate missed connection may read Another user is looking for someone who might be you you would like to be introduced If so please respond to the following user provided question . The requesting user may receive a similar query.

At step the method may determine whether the users accepted the invitations to be introduced and or the mutual authentication step was successful. If so the flow may continue to step where the user may be introduced as described above e.g. as in step of otherwise the users may be notified of the failure and or given an opportunity to re try the introduction at step .

At step the method may start and be initialized as discussed above. At step a story describing a missed connection may be received and published on the network accessible service e.g. website . The story may identify the timeframe and or location of the missed connection may include text describing the missed connection may include descriptive tags or the like. The story may include a respond input to allow a user who thinks that he she is the missed connection mentioned in the story to be introduced to the story contributor.

At step upon receiving the request the responder may be prompted to for authentication by identifying the contributor in a photo lineup or by some other mechanism series of questions authored by the contributor .

If the authentication of step is successful the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step where the parties may be notified of the failure and the flow may continue at step when a next request for introduction is received. In some embodiments once a responder has failed the authentication step of the user may be prevented from retrying or may be prevented from retrying more than a threshold number of times . This may prevent a user from guessing the identity of the contributor by elimination.

At step the story contributor may be prompted to pick the responder s photo from a lineup or otherwise authenticate that the responder s identity. If the contributor successfully identifies the responder the flow may continue to step where the contributor and the responder may be introduced as described above otherwise the flow may continue to step where the users may be notified of the failure and or allowed to re try the introduction.

As discussed above a user submitted content such as stories and the like may be associated with a contributor and optionally one or more participant and or interested persons. Some story participants and or interested persons may be members of the network accessible service e.g. may have registered an account with the service . Registered users may appear in connection with a story as shown in and or may have the right to comment on the story.

In some cases however a user tagged as a story participant or interested persons may not have account e.g. may be an unregistered user . As discussed above in some embodiments these users may be represented using a semblance. As used herein a semblance may refer to a representation of another person created by someone other than the person himself herself. Semblances may be used for various purposes. For example a semblance may be created by a story contributor to represent a story participant who is not yet a member of the service. In another example a semblance may be used to represent a person who is a member of the service has a user account but the contributor may not want to directly reference the person s account. In another case a semblance may be used to represent a person who cannot register an account with the network accessible service e.g. website such as a minor a person with a disability a deceased person a virtual person such as a video game character an entity in a virtual world a business entity a corporation or the like.

In some embodiments a semblance may be used to represent something other than a person. As will be discussed below stories or other content related to a non person may be included in a storyline which may be searched and or browsed chronologically or using other associated metadata as described above. For example a semblance could represent an event a project e.g. construction of a building the Apollo space program etc. a physical object such as a car airplane cruise ship or the like a piece of property a region a piece of software an industry a business e.g. a local business a large corporation or the like legislation a social or political movement e.g. the tea party civil rights movement etc. a political party or the like.

In some embodiments the creator of the semblance may create a semblance user profile that comprises the same data as an actual user profile. In some embodiments the contents of the semblance user profile may be adapted according to the entity represented thereby e.g. a project or corporation profile may include a different set of profile information than a profile representing a person . Accordingly a semblance may be assigned an avatar preferences contact information etc. The user who created the semblance may be allowed to control the contents of the semblance profile. In some embodiments the responsibility and or control over a semblance may be shared among two or more users. For example the semblance may represent the child of two users both of which may be able to control the semblance. In another example a semblance may represent a common ancestor of two or more users each of which may have a say in how the semblance is represented on the network accessible service e.g. website . In some embodiments conflicts may be resolved by a vote among the users having control over the semblance and or each user may have the power to veto changes to the semblance. In other embodiments one user may be assigned to be an arbiter of the information about a semblance. The arbiter may be the first user to create the semblance and or may be selected by other interested users e.g. by community consensus . In some embodiments a semblance may represent a prominent person entity or set of events e.g. Abraham Lincoln the tea party building the Golden Gate Bridge or the like . In this case one or more experts as identified by the network accessible service may be assigned to arbitrate semblance information.

The features described above e.g. intersections affinities and so on may be implemented using semblances. For example a user may intersect with a semblance in the same way or in a similar way the user would intersect with another user. A semblance may have a life timeline or storyline similar to the life timeline interface of and may appear as a participant and or interested person in stories and so on.

In some embodiments a semblance may be associated with access controls. The access controls applied to a semblance may operate similarly to access controls on stories aliases and the like described above. For example a semblance may be accessible only within certain contributor defined circles. This may prevent a semblance representing a minor from being seen by the public e.g. only the members of the contributor s family circle may have access to the semblance . Accordingly when the semblance is identified as a story participant the participant indicator showing the semblance may only be displayed when the story is viewed by a member of the contributor s family circle. Similarly only family circle members may have access to the semblance profile information if any .

In some embodiments semblances may be merged with one another. Merging may be used to combine multiple representations of the same person or thing. For example one or more contributors may create multiple semblances representing the same person or thing e.g. using different name variation spellings or the like . The different semblances may be associated with different sets of stories making it difficult to find the all of the stories or other content associated with the semblance. Merging may occur between the semblances created by the same user and or between semblances created by different users. After a merger of the semblances of a single user the resulting merged semblance may comprise the combination of the information of the merged semblances. References to the semblance as a story participant and or interested person may point to the merged semblance. Similarly storylines involving the semblance may be combined e.g. as discussed below . In some embodiments profile information avatar picture contact information etc. of the merged semblances may be combined into the merged semblance. Conflicts may be manually resolved by the user and or the merged semblance may include two copies of the conflicting information to be resolved by the user at a later time . If the semblances were created by different users the user may determine how the merged semblance is to be controlled or arbitrated therebetween e.g. shared control of both users such as veto power majority control control by a single user or the like .

At step the method may receive a request to merge the two or more semblances. The request may identify the semblances to be merged. The request may further comprise an indication of how the merged semblance is to be managed or arbitrated e.g. controlled by a single user multiple users or the like .

At step the multiple semblances may be combined into a merged semblance. Step may comprise updating references in stories or other content to reference the merged semblance. Step may further comprise combining semblance profile information if any into the merged semblance. If conflicts in the profile information exist they may be manually arbitrated by the user s e.g. using prompts or other means specified in the request of step and or the conflicting information may be stored in the merged semblance to be resolved at a later time.

In some embodiments a semblance may graduate to a full user. For example a child who was represented by a semblance by his her parents may inherit the semblance and convert it into a full user account. The conversion may take place by the user s who created the semblance issuing a request to the network accessible service. In response the network accessible service may update the semblance to represent a user and or may provide new login credentials or other registration materials to the owner of the new user account.

In another example a person may create his her own account. The person may be represented as a semblance by one or more other users. When the user creates the new account he she may be prompted to associate the account with existing semblances. The association may be automatically identified by comparing properties of the new user to properties of the semblance s . Alternatively or in addition the users who created the semblance s may have issued an invitation to the new user which may allow for an automatically association to be made between the new user account and the semblances e.g. using an invite code or other identifier . In some embodiments and if allowed by the new user profile information from one or more of the semblances may be used to pre populate the new account.

When the new account is created and one or more corresponding semblances are identified references to the semblances in certain contributor stories may be updated to reference the newly updated account. In some embodiments the updating may occur automatically and or may require approval of the new user and or approval of the story contributor s . For example at registration time or after registration the user may be presented with a list of automatically identified stories comprising similar names to the newly registered user s name and may query the new user to indicate which story name combinations refer to him her. The new user may indicate which semblances should be updated and in some embodiments the stories may be automatically updated to reference the new account. Alternatively the story contributors may be given the opportunity to accept or reject the changes.

At step the user associated with the semblance s may register an account with the network accessible service. Account registration may comprise providing user identifying information such as user name first and last age interests preferences and the like as discussed above.

At step one or more semblances associated with the user account may be identified. The identification may comprise searching for users having the same or similar name or the like. In some embodiments the identification may further comprise filtering the results based on user identifying information of the semblances such as age name and the like. If the user created the user account in response to an invitation e.g. in an email having an invitation code generated at step the user may be automatically added as a story participant without performing steps below . In some embodiments semblance profile information may be used to pre populate portions of the created user profile upon approval of the new user .

At step the identified semblances may be presented to the new user. The semblances may be presented with indicators of which contributors created and or have used the semblance s the nature of the stories in which the semblances appear and so on. The user may indicate which of the semblances represent the user and or may indicate which semblances and or stories with which the user does not want to be associated.

Step may further comprise receiving verification from the story contributor s . In some embodiments once the new user identifies which semblances represent him her the method may transmit a verification message to the story contributors requesting to update the contributor s references to the semblance s with a reference to the user profile. In some cases the contributor may refuse e.g. the contributor may determine that the new user is not the person he intended the semblance to represent and or may prefer to continue using the semblance . If the contributor chooses not to use the new account the contributor may continue to use the semblance s otherwise the contributor s references to the semblance s may be updated to reference the identified user profile.

At step the stories in which the unregistered user appeared and that were indicated and verified by the contributor at step may be updated to associate the participant with the user profile.

At step a contributor may create and or reference a semblance representing a particular person. The contributor may reference the semblance in user contributed content such as a story or the like e.g. the semblance may be used to represent a story participant and or interested person . Step may comprise storing the content and semblance reference on a datastore of the network accessible service e.g. website .

At step the contributor may identify a user profile of the person represented by the semblance s . The contributor may therefore issue a request to the network accessible service to replace references to one or more identified semblance s with references to an identified user profile.

At step the method may determine whether the contributor s references to the identified semblance s may be updated to reference the identified user profile. As discussed above users may have the right to be removed as participants and or interested persons of certain stories. Therefore in some embodiments the owner of the user profile the user represented thereby may be prompted to confirm that he she is willing to appear as a participant and or interested person in the contributor s stories. In some embodiments the decision may be made on a story by story basis. Therefore the prompt of step may include indicators e.g. link badges links or the like identifying the stories with which the user profile would be associated. In some embodiments approval to add a user as a participant and or interested person may be controlled by a user policy e.g. always allow me to be added to stories by user X always prompt me always exclude me etc. . Examples of such policies are described below in conjunction with . If such policies exist they may be applied at step . If no policy exists the user may be prompted for configuration before associating the user profile with the storie s . While awaiting confirmation the references to the semblance may be retained or removed . Alternatively even if a policy exists the user may be prompted since the change at step could include a large number of stories which may be outside of the scope of the policies .

If at step the method determines that the update can take place within one or more of the contributor s items the flow may continue to step otherwise the flow may continue to step where the contributor may be informed that the user rejected the change.

At step one or more references to the identified semblance s may be replaced with a reference to the identified user profile. Step may comprise modifying a datastore on which the contributor s items are stored. Step may further comprise removing the identified semblance s since the person represented thereby is now associated with an actual user profile . Alternatively the semblance s may be retained but may not be referenced in any user contributed content .

As discussed above user submitted content may be associated with various types of metadata which may determine how the content is presented and or browsed on the network accessible service e.g. website . For example the content submitted and or borrowed by a particular contributor may be displayed in a life interface such as the interface of . Other intersection space interfaces may display stories related to a particular location set of participants or the like.

In some embodiments user submitted content may be organized by storyline. As used herein a storyline refers to a collection of content such as stories photos metadata or information imported from other social media. The selection of content for a storyline is under the control of the owner or owners of the storyline and may consist of content created by an owner of a storyline content borrowed or imported by the owner linked or referenced content or the like. Often a storyline will have a name that describes the unifying theme of the content if there is a unifying theme. For example the content submitted by particular contributor over his lifetime may be a My Life storyline of the contributor and have as its name the name of the person. Like an intersection space a storyline is a collection of stories and other content but in some embodiments a storyline has a fundamental difference from an intersection space. A storyline is curated by a person or potentially people who have the right to create stories and also borrow the stories of others. It is under control of the owner of the storyline with respect to which stories are included although borrowed content may in some embodiments be editable by the original creator of the story thereby creating the opportunity for a story that has been borrowed to be changed subsequently in some way that is unattractive to the borrower . A storyline therefore is under control of a storyteller storyline owner . In contrast an intersection space is not under control of a particular user or owner. An intersection space shows whatever content qualifies to appear although the content may be filtered according to reputation and other criteria making it in a sense under the control of the consumer rather than the creator of content. For example all stories from all storytellers about a concert in a park would show up at the intersection space corresponding to the time and place of the concert except to the extent that stories might be filtered out because they have been flagged as objectionable come from low credibility storytellers come from strangers or fail some other test e.g. low rating etc. . Accordingly the intersection space may be considered as crowd sourced content with no owner whereas a storyline comprises curated content and an owner. For example a user could create a storyline about the concert or the concert series or the musical act that is performing in the park and borrow into that storyline selected stories from the intersection space and elsewhere. Like the intersection space this storyline would include stories about the concert but unlike the intersection space it would contain only those stories created or selected by the owner of the storyline. In some embodiments there is a one to one relationship between user accounts and storylines in other words each user has a storyline and in other embodiments a user account may have multiple storylines or no defined storyline.

The interface of described above is an example of an interface configured to display the life storyline of a contributor. A life storyline may include other story lines such as a travel storyline a storyline of the contributor s experiences at the theater a storyline for a hobby a storyline for a vacation a storyline for items of interest and so on.

In some embodiments storylines may be configured to automatically borrow stories from a specific intersection spaces e.g. may be presented within an interface such as and or described above or that meet some other criteria such as being returned as a search result for a term or terms. A storyline may be a story itself and or may include a collection of stories. An example of a storyline interface is described below in conjunction with .

In some embodiments storylines may be nested hierarchically and or may be used to organize a contributor s life storyline. For example all of the stories pertaining to one of the contributor s hobbies e.g. horseback riding may be included in a storyline. The top level story and or one or more especially notable horseback riding related stories may appear in the contributor s life storyline whereas the others may not. In some embodiments a story may appear in more than one storyline because it was assigned to one or more storylines as part of the story creation or editing processes. The relationship between stories and storylines may be defined in story metadata using inter alia the storyline input of . In some embodiments a story may appear in more than one storyline because it was borrowed into second and subsequent storylines. For example a story created for the Vacation storyline might be borrowed into a My Life storyline. In some embodiments a story may be assigned automatically to storylines based on metadata such as a tag. For example a story included in the My Life storyline may appear in the contributor s life storyline e.g. in the interface of whereas a story that does not include the My Life storyline tag may not. Referring to the horseback riding example the top level horseback riding storyline which may itself be a story may be tagged within the My Life and horseback riding storylines. The constituent stories however may be tagged only with the horseback riding storyline. Accordingly only the top level horseback riding story may appear in the contributor s My Life storyline and the other horseback riding related stories may be hidden unless the viewer drills down to the horseback storyline.

In some embodiments storylines with a common owner may have different permissions. For example one storyline may be devoted to public stories while other storylines are devoted topics that are restricted to certain circles or users and still other storylines are not shared at all. In some embodiments storylines may be devoted to content that has been imported via APIs or other means from other social media services or web sites and these storylines may be public or private. For example a storyline might be devoted to tweets posted on TWITTER and this storyline might be public so that everybody can see the tweets arranged over time or it might be restricted or private. The owner of the storyline might choose to borrow certain of the tweets from the TWITTER oriented storyline to a more general storyline that has a wider audience or is public. In this way a user can import various kinds of content into one or more storylines that may not be public and pick and choose from among the items on the storyline s which content they want to display on a different storyline about their life.

In some embodiments a storyline may be developed collaboratively. For example the parents of little league baseball players may contribute little league related stories to a storyline dedicated to their team. A high school may develop a set of stories describing their senior class and so on.

Other storylines may be used to chronicle someone else s life such as the life of a semblance. For example one or more contributors may create a storyline for one or more ancestors. In some embodiments of this a story may appear in a storyline because the creator of the story is considered to be a member or contributor to the collaborative storyline.

Storylines may be used to express other types of stories that may be of a different scope and or focus than the life of a single person or contributor. In one example one or more contributors may develop a storyline chronicling the history of a location business entity or the like. The stories may or may not appear in the My Life storylines of any of the contributors. However all the stories may be included in a storyline tailored to the subject matter of the stories. For example a collection of stories chronicling the history of a restaurant may all be tagged with a Joe s Diner storyline tag e.g. using the input of . Using the storyline tags the network accessible service may identify the Joe s Diner stories and display them within a storyline interface e.g. like the interface . The Joe s Diner storyline may include one or more nested storylines as described above. For example a sub storyline may chronicle each different ownership phase of the restaurant another nested storyline may comprise stories of the restaurant at different locations e.g. stories occurring when the restaurant was at location A stories occurring when the restaurant was at location B and so on . The storylines may overlap one another for example a particular story may be in the restaurant storyline may be included in an ownership storyline and be in one of the restaurant location storylines.

In another example a storyline may chronicle the history of a particular piece of property. Like the restaurant storyline described above the property storyline may be contributed by one or more users but the stories may not necessarily appear in their My Life storylines but instead may be grouped by storyline tag into the property storyline. The storyline may include stories describing the original inhabitants of the property e.g. members of the Navajo tribe describe the first Western settlers cover the gold rush years and so on up to the present day. In another example a storyline may describe a particular program such as the history of a large scale project e.g. the design and installation of Cristo s Fence a large scale art installation that required city approval private land owner participation and so on the Apollo space program or the like.

In some embodiments a storyline may be created and or maintained by a particular user e.g. the storyline curator . Other users may publish stories tagged or otherwise associated with the storyline and the curator may determine whether the stories should be included therein either before or after the stories are initially published to the storyline. The curator may reject stories that do not belong in the story line are not relevant and or not of sufficient quality . The curator may import stories by borrowing the stories as described above. In some embodiments a storyline may be curated by two or more users a user community who may make shared decisions regarding storyline content.

As described above a storyline may be presented within an interface such as the interfaces and or described above. The interface may be adapted to display stories having a particular storyline tag. Therefore the stories that are available for display in the storyline may be identified by using intersection criteria that includes the storyline tag e.g. using method .

In some embodiments the interface may include a storyline title which may be provided via an interface similar to the interface described above in conjunction with . As discussed above a storyline may itself be a story in the sense that it has an overview story associated with it. As such in some embodiments the interface may include story display elements such as a title text display content item display e.g. image display and or image thumbnails and so on. The storyline content may be contributed and or edited using an interface such as interface of .

The stories comprising the storyline may be identified by a storyline tag as described above. In addition the stories on the storyline may be browsed and or search according to other story metadata including but not limited to timeframe using timeframe selector of the timeframe control location using location identifiers and or of location control contributors by selecting contributors in the contributor element participants by selecting participants in the participant element interested persons by selecting interested persons in the interested persons element story type by selecting story types in the story type element descriptive tags by selecting tags in the tag element by rating by specifying a rating threshold in the rating element and so on. The controls and or elements and or may operate as described above in conjunction with .

As described above stories that are to be included in the storyline may be identified by a storyline tag which may be applied by a story contributor borrower and or a storyline curator as described above. Indications of the stories that are in the storyline and the intersection space defined by the other controls elements of the interface discussed above may be displayed in the region . The region may display intersecting stories as link badges as depicted in as a list or by some other method s .

In some embodiments storylines may appear to the user to be nested within one another. For example the Joe s Diner storyline may include nested storylines chronicling particular aspects of the restaurant e.g. management changes location changes etc. . The nested storylines may be included in the region if they are tagged with the top level storyline tag . In some embodiments an entry that represents a storyline e.g. includes one or more constituent stories may be distinguished from other stories in the region . For example and as shown in the storyline may be displayed as a stack of stories. Like the other stories in the region the storyline indicator may include a title byline or curator identifier link badge text and so on. A user may select the storyline indication to browse the stories therein the stories in the nested storyline . Accordingly in some embodiments when a user selects the link badge indicator the user make be linked to another interface similar to the interface comprising the stories tagged with the storyline tag of the storyline represented by . Similar storyline indicators may be included in the regions described above in conjunction with .

In some embodiments a story may have an associated storyline comprising one or more constituent stories that are components or details of the story. The story gives the big picture or overview of the content in the storyline. For example the story might be an overview of a summer vacation and the associated storyline might contain stories and other content from the vacation. The story may therefore be thought of as an Overview or Front Page of the associated storyline. The Overview story of the storyline may serve as a tag for all of the constituent stories in the storyline. In some embodiments this association may be maintained in a datastore of the network accessible service by associating the storyline tag with the Overview story e.g. a storyline data structure may include a reference to the Overview story . Referring to the example each story in the storyline may be tagged with the about this storyline story depicted as elements and .

In some embodiments a storyline may itself include story content e.g. the Overview story content may be part of the storyline itself . This may be implemented by linking a storyline datastructure to user contributed content items e.g. the storyline may be a story itself . The associated story may be used to represent the Overview or Front Page of the storyline as described above. Accordingly the stories that are tagged with the storyline may each have access to the Overview story e.g. through the storyline tag . In some embodiments the Overview story may contain various kinds of data and metadata. For example the overview of a person s life might include a biography and or general photographs and or general video and it might show the person s most recent stories favorite stories and most highly rated stories. It might show a feed of the person s most recent tweets or comments they have made on the stories or photographs of others. It might contain usage statistics such as a record of the number of stories told or commented on or awards badges of honor for certain kinds of participation and or contributions. It might contain profile information as described above such as musical or literary preferences or links to the presence of the individual on other media including social media. In short it would be a place to go to find out the latest and best about the person.

In some embodiments content from specific storylines and overview pages could be used as feeds that other users could subscribe to. These feeds from specific users and storylines would complement other feeds that might contain popular recent topical geographically focused or otherwise distinctive aggregations of content from multiple storylines. In some embodiments these feeds could be brought together potentially a home page so that a consumer of content could see what was recent or of importance to the owners of specific storylines.

As described above a user may create a storyline related to any topic including a storyline comprising his her life events this story line may comprise the stories contributed and or borrowed by the user. The My Life or You storyline may be displayed in an interface provided by the network accessible service such as the interface described above in conjunction with . depicts another example of an interface for presenting a My Life storyline. The example comprises the stories contributed and or borrowed by Peter Rinearson. The interface includes a timeframe control which may operate similarly to the timeframe controls and described above. The Interface includes metadata describing stories included in the Peter Rinearson intersection space including Contributor s Story Types Tags Participants Milestones which may include stories identified by the contributor as being life changing marker events Context Profile and so on. The interface includes a Locations element which comprises a list of the locations visited by the contributor over the selected timeframe .

The intersections link may allow the user to see how his her life intersects with the life of another user. Examples of such intersections are described above in conjunction with . The intersections may include information about common locations locations both users have visited or are at the moment visiting people the users know in common age comparisons life event comparisons stages of life and so on. A messages link may display messages and or notifications for the user such as requests for introductions discussed above in conjunction with .

As discussed above the stories included in an intersection space the My Life storyline may change as the user changes the prevailing timeframe of the timeframe control . shows the result of changing the prevailing timeframe from a very broad prevailing timeframe to a narrower prevailing timeframe comprising a few days in March 2010. also shows an example of a chronological user profile display comprising preferences for the contributor during the prevailing timeframe .

Referring to a page options element may be used to filter the stories displayed in the interface according to access control settings story participant tags e.g. show only stories in which Peter Rinearson is a participant show different types of context information as discussed above in connection with and so on. also shows the result of expanding the contributor element which as discussed above may show the contributors of the stories in the intersection space as determined by the prevailing timeframe .

As discussed above the My Life storyline depicted in may be associated with an Overview story which may provide an overview of the contributor s life. In some embodiments stories that are tagged or otherwise associated with the Overview story may be included in the My Life storyline. The stories in the contributor s intersection space e.g. the stories contributed and or borrowed by the contributor may be tagged with the Overview story which may provide a Here s who I am introduction to the contributor. depicts one example of an interface for presenting an Overview story of a contributor. The overview story interface may be accessible via the interface by selecting the Front Page link shown on the interface selecting an indicator of the contributor and or by accessing the contributor s profile or via some other link. As illustrated in the overview story may summarize the storyline which in the example comprises an overview of Peter Rinearson s life.

As discussed above a contributor may create storylines other than the My Life storyline. The contributor may have one or more parallel storylines for their interests hobbies and the like and or to represent other events entities movements as discussed above . For example the contributor may create a storyline about his her summer vacation. Stories pertaining to the summer vacation may be included in the Vacation storyline and or the contributor s My Life storyline by tagging the stories with a Vacation storyline tag and or associating the stories with a Vacation Overview story. Accordingly in some embodiments a storyline may be a story itself. Therefore tagging a story with the Vacation storyline may comprise tagging the story with the Vacation Overview story. The vacation story storyline may comprise and or be associated with an Overview or Front Page story as described above which may provide a summary of the summer vacation events e.g. included a trip to Disneyland camping in Yosemite and so on .

The vacation storyline may include one or more nested storylines. For example the story about the trip to Disneyland may itself be a storyline comprising stories about the contributor s experiences at the park. These stories may be tagged with the Disneyland trip story storyline the Vacation story storyline and or the My Life story storyline. As described above the storyline associations may determine which storylines will include the story e.g. if tagged with the My Life story storyline the story may be included in the My Life storyline and so on . In some embodiments nested storylines may be distinguished from a story in the intersection space e.g. may be displayed as a stacked set of stories as in .

Associating a story with more than one storyline may comprise associating the story with more than one Overview or Front Page story. For example if a contributor tags another user e.g. Joe as a story participant Joe s overview story may serve as a tag for the contributor s story. If Joe accepts the tag then the contributor s story may appear in Joe s My Life storyline. Accordingly the contributor s story becomes a constituent of Joe s life story even as Joe s overview story is already a constituent of the contributor s My Life storyline and potentially of the storylines of other users. Alternatively or in addition Joe may borrow the story into a different storyline that is not about Joe s overall life but rather about a different aspect of Joe s life about an organization an event or so forth.

In another example a Story A may be about the contributor s life may be the contributor s Overview or Front Page story and Stories B C D and E may be stories about parts of the contributor s life. Stories B C D and E may be tagged with Story A either implicitly or because the contributor did so explicitly . When the contributor accesses Story A the network accessible service may include a link to and or display component to present the storyline that contains Stories B C D and or E. When a user accesses Story B or Story C D or E Story A may be presented as a tag to helps define the individual story.

For instance Story E may be about taking a family trip to Disneyland. As already noted Story E may be tagged with Story A indicating that it is part of the storyline associated with the overview Story A which is about the contributor s life . The contributor may author a Story X about waiting in line for tickets at Disneyland Story Y which is about having lunch and Story Z about being called up on stage to sing before a crowd Disneyland. The contributor may associate Stories X Y and Z with the story storyline of Story E to indicate that these stories are all part of the Disneyland storyline. Accordingly when Story E is presented by the network accessible service the interface may include an indication that there is a storyline available that includes other stories e.g. Stories X Y and Z .

Because Story Z is about a big event e.g. singing on stage the contributor may decide to make this story appear in his her main e.g. My Life storyline The contributor may tag Story Z the My Life storyline tag which as discussed above may be Story A the Overview story of the contributor s life . Accordingly the Story Z may be included in the My Life storyline of the contributor Story A as well as the Disneyland storyline Story E . By contrast the less prominent stories about waiting in line at Disneyland e.g. Story X or about having lunch at Disneyland Story Y may not be tagged with Story A the My Life storyline and as such may not appear in the My Life storyline. The My Life storyline may however include the story storyline about Disneyland e.g. Story E through which the Stories X Y and Z may be accessed.

A circle component may be configured to provide for the display and or editing of user circles A C. A user may add new circles using an add control may delete circles using respective delete controls A C may modify circle membership and the like. Users and or semblances may be added or removed from the circles A C using respective controls and A C. The circle add controls A C may include respective user directory controls A C to allow the user to add circle members from a user directory and or from one or more user defined semblances.

An alias component may provide for the display and or editing of user defined aliases. The component may comprise timeframe aliases comprising timeframe aliases identifiers and associated timeframes the timeframes represented by aliases which may be expressed in absolute time virtual or relative time not specified or the like and or access controls . The access control input is used to specify the circle s if any that have access to the timeframes associated with the aliases identifier .

The timeframe aliases may comprise timeframe browser controls which when selected may cause a time selection component to be displayed for selection of an alias timeframe . The selection component not shown may comprise a timeframe control such as the controls and or described above a calendar control text entry field or the like. The access controls may determine which circles if any are allowed to access the timeframes of the respective timeframe alias identifiers .

The component may comprise location aliases which may provide for the display and or editing of user defined location aliases. The location aliases may comprise location alias identifiers associated locations the locations represented by the location aliases which may expressed as a real location an address a region a virtual location not specified or the like and or access controls . The location aliases may comprise a timeframe browser control which when selected may cause a location selection component to be displayed e.g. a location control such as the controls described above a virtual map a text entry or the like . The access controls may determine which circles if any are allowed to access the locations addresses of the respective location alias identifiers .

The component may comprise contributor aliases which may provide for the display and or editing of user defined contributor aliases. As discussed above contributor aliases may be used to hide the true identity of the contributor of a story or other content from other users of the network accessible service website . Accordingly the contributor aliases may comprise one or more contributor alias identifiers and corresponding access controls . The access controls may specify which circle s if any may access the contributor s true identity when the respective contributor alias identifier is used.

The component may comprise profile aliases which may provide for the display and or editing of user define profile alias. The profile aliases may comprise user profile alias identifiers and corresponding profile attribute values and or corresponding access controls . The profile alias identifiers may be alias values used in connection with a user profile which may be tied to corresponding actual user profile value of the attribute . For example the user may specify that a cartoon image is to be displayed as his her profile avatar unless the user accessing the profile is in the specified circle s e.g. in the family circle . The profile aliases may include a browse or search control through which the user specifies attribute values to display for each alias .

Although not shown in the alias component could include add and or remove controls buttons or other interface elements to add and or remove entries from each of the timeframe aliases location aliases contributor aliases and or profile aliases .

A tagging policy component may provide for the display and or management of user tagging policies. The tagging policies may control how the user may be identified in stories contributed by other users of the network accessible service e.g. whether the user can automatically be tagged as a participant and or interested user in others stories .

A participant policy may define how participant tags are to be handled. In the example depicted in a default participant policy may exist which may be that the user is prompted before being added as a participant to any story. Therefore if none of the participant policies applies to a particular participant tag the default policy may be implemented and the user may be prompted before being added as a participant. In other embodiments the default policy may be policy where the user is identified as a participant but does not borrow the story unless the user explicitly indicates. Alternatively the user may specify a default participant policy in the component not shown .

The participant policy may identify one or more users and or groups that the user trusts to make accurate and or tasteful participant tags. When the user is tagged as a participant in content submitted by one of these users the user may automatically accept the participant tag and borrow the story. The policy may further comprise a directive specifying how the borrowed story is to be shared not shown e.g. share the borrowed story as public and or within one or more user defined circles . The component may include controls to add and or remove users and or circles from the policy .

The participant policy may identify one or more users and or groups that the user will allow to automatically tag him her as a participant but whose content the user will not automatically publish. Accordingly when the user is tagged as a participant in content submitted by one of these users the user may automatically accept the participant tag but not borrow the story. The component may include controls to add and or remove users and or circles from the policy .

The participant policy may list users and or groups whose participant tags are automatically rejected by the user. As above the component may include controls to add and or remove users and or groups from the policy .

The control may further comprise an interested person policy . The interested person policy may comprise similar policies not shown to the participant policies and or described above. For example an interested person policy may include policies identifying users and or groups whose interested person tags are automatically accepted and whose stories are automatically borrowed may be provided may include a policy to automatically accept interested person tags from certain users and or circles but not automatically borrow the stories and or policies to automatically reject interested person tags from specified users and or circles.

In some embodiments each time a user is tagged as a story participant and or interested person the user may be prompted whether to accept the tag and borrow the story accept the tag but not borrow the story and or to reject the tag. Each of these options may include an indicator allowing the user to set a corresponding policy rule. For example if the user wishes to always reject tags from the identified user an input on the prompt may be provided to always reject tags from user X. Similarly an input to always accept and or always accept and publish may be provided. These prompts may be used to generate the policy information depicted in component on the fly. 

A component may provide for the display and or editing of a global chronological access control policy. A global access control policy may apply to all stories having a particular set of attributes such as timeframe. As discussed above in some embodiments access to user content content may be specified within pre defined time ranges. A specified policy may be applied to all user contributed or borrowed within a particular timeframe. For example a user may want to hide the content related to his high school years from view until he eventually moves away from his home town . A chronological access control policy may be configured to express this policy information the timeframe may specify the timeframe comprising the user s high school years and the corresponding access control policy may indicate that no one is to have access to the content. In another example a particular timeframe may be available to one or more circles e.g. the user s family circle and in another example the content associated with the timeframe may be available publically per access control . The timeframe inputs and or may comprise respective timeframe input selectors which as described above may comprise a timeframe control calendar selector or the like. The access control inputs and or may be used to specify one or more user defined circles individual users specify no users and or circles or the like.

Although the component describes a global access control policy based on timeframe the disclosure is not limited in this regard. Other global access controls could be used under the teachings of this disclosure. For example a global access control policy may be defined with respect to locations descriptive tags participant s interested person s and so on. For example a location related global access control policy could automatically mark all stories occurring in the contributor s home as available only to the family circle. Similarly a participant global access control policy could set all stories in which the contributor s children are participants to family access only and so on.

The apparatus may comprise an analysis module which may be configured to analyze user submitted content metadata and or user interactions with the apparatus to determine user stage of life disposition identify user affinities identify intersections and so on as described above. The analysis module may make the results of the analysis available to the other modules e.g. interface module for display.

In some embodiments the apparatus may include an access control module which may control access to user submitted content user profile information and the like as described above. Accordingly the access control module may store records on the datastores of user defined circles aliases and the like. User registration user profile user modeling and other information may be maintained by a user module . The user module may store the user information described above on the datastores . The apparatus may use the computing devices datastores and or modules and or to implement the features described above.

The user interface module may be configured to provide user interfaces and or user interface components to users via the network . The user interface module may provide for displaying the interfaces described herein e.g. authoring interfaces intersection interfaces story interfaces and so on .

The intersection module is configured to receive a request or query for an intersection space from a user or other entity via the network . The query may include intersection criteria comprising a timeframe and or location of interest. The intersection criteria may further comprise descriptive tags participant tags rating criteria and so on.

The intersection module may be configured to select stories for inclusion in an intersection space corresponding to the query. As discussed above a story may be included in the intersection space when the intersection metadata of the story matches the intersection criteria. The intersection module may leverage the storage module analysis module access module and or user module to generate the intersection space.

In some embodiments the intersection module modifies the intersection criteria when the intersection space includes less than a threshold number of stories e.g. less than a sufficiency threshold . The modifications may comprise expanding the intersection criteria such that more stories will be included in the intersection space. The modifications may include scaling timeframe and or location criteria by a proportional scaling factor.

In some embodiments the intersection module filters the intersection space when the intersection space includes more than a threshold number of stories and or to filter the stories included in the intersection space as a result of modifications to the intersection criteria. The filtering may comprise comparing minimum and or maximum area values spectral partitioning or the like.

In some embodiments the intersection module applies access controls to determine whether a user requesting the intersection space has access to certain intersecting stories. The access control decisions may be implemented by the access control module and may comprise determining user circle membership using the user module . The intersection space may filter story content such as location identifiers participant identifiers and the like according to access control policies as described above.

The intersection module may be further configured to assign a relative importance to the stories in the intersection space. The relative importance may be based upon how closely the intersection metadata of the story corresponds to the intersection criteria e.g. the relevance of the intersection metadata to the intersection criteria . The importance may also be based upon user defined indicators of story importance.

The intersection space generated by the intersection module may be presented to a user in an interface generated by the interface module and or displayed in an application operating on a user computing device. The intersection space may comprise story indicators e.g. in link badge list or another format . The story indicators may be displayed according to their relative importance.

Users may collaborate on story content through the network accessible service . In some embodiments an author presents story content to users in a virtual space such as a chatroom Skype call forum online presentation instant messaging service or other suitable interface provided by the network accessible service or third party service. Users may contribute commentary and or annotations collaborative content as the story content is presented. The collaborative content is synchronized with the presentation of the story content in the virtual space. The author of the story may selective incorporate the collaborative content into the story. Collaborative content may be submitted by different people at different times e.g. in different virtual spaces to different audiences . The collaborative content may include but is not limited to text video images audio or the like.

In some embodiments the network accessible service or other third party service records the collaborative content as the story content is presented in a virtual space. The recording may comprise associating the collaborative content with story content e.g. synchronizing audio commentary to a video . The collaborative content may therefore be synchronized to the story content as the story is told in the virtual space. Alternatively or in addition the collaborative content may be associated with particular story content items. For example collaborative content pertaining to a particular photo may be synchronized with display of the photo in the virtual space or otherwise associated with the story photo . In another example collaborative content pertaining to a particular scene in a video is synchronized with display of the scene. Accordingly recording the collaborative content may comprise recording metadata identifying the portion s of the story to which the collaborative content pertains.

Collaborative content may comprise metadata that identifies a timeframe and or a time offset with respect the presentation of the story in the virtual space and or within particular story content items e.g. five minutes into a video . In another example collaborative content may reference a time before or after a timeframe of the story. For example collaborative content may describe the results of story events or may setup events in a story.

Collaborative content may be submitted by respective contributors. When story content is presented in a virtual space each contributor may submit a stream of collaborative content e.g. a running commentary . The network accessible service associates each of the multiple streams with the story content and a respective contributor or device . The commentary streams may be selectively played back with the story content. For example a user may review the story content with the synchronized collaborative content of one or more selected contributors. Alternatively a user may play back the entire presentation along with the synchronized collaborative content of each contributor.

The author of the story content may selectively incorporate portions of the collaborative content into the story or leverage the collaborative content to author a story . As such portions of the collaborative content may become part of the story. Incorporating collaborative content may comprise converting the content into another form e.g. converting voice into text etc. . Alternatively or in addition collaborative content may be included in a separate story or storyline that is associated with the story content. Accordingly when the story content is shown again it may include selected portions of the collaborative content.

In some embodiments collaborative content is received via a story presentation interface of the network accessible service . Referring back to a user accessing a story may collaborate on the story via the comment input . In another example the comment input is adapted to include inputs to specify a timeframe of the collaborative content and or to specify a story content item to which the collaborative content pertains e.g. to indicate that the collaborative content pertains to a particular photograph . The story author may selectively incorporate the commentary into the story as described above.

In some embodiments story content is presented in a virtual space such as an interface of the network accessible service and or through another service such as a chatroom Skype call forum online presentation instant messaging service or the like. Users collaborate on the story through commentary and or annotations submitted as the story is presented in the virtual space e.g. as the story is being told . The collaborative content is recorded and synchronized with the presentation of the story content in the virtual space. Accordingly when story content is presented in a virtual space the network accessible service or other third party service records multiple streams of collaborative content that may be synchronized with the story e.g. synchronized to the story as it was told in the virtual space . For example a user may present a story of a dance recital in a virtual space e.g. a Skype call . The story may include one or more photos of the recital a text or audio description of the recital a video of selected numbers and the like. As the story is presented users of the virtual space submit collaborative content such as audio commentary on the recital text commentary photos of their own etc. The presentation of the story in the virtual space is recorded along with the multiple streams of collaborative each from a different respective contributor . The collaborative content may be synchronized to the presentation of the story within the virtual space for example a comment on a particular story photo is synchronized with the time the photo was shown.

The author may selectively incorporate the collaborative content such that the next time the story content is presented the selected collaborative content is included at the appropriate time according to the synchronization described above . In some embodiments an author accesses the recording of the presentation of the story content along with the synchronized collaborative content to author the story. In this example the author acts as a curator to distill the original story content and collaborative content into a story. Alternatively the story content and selected portions of the collaborative content may be maintained in a collaborative content storyline or the like.

At step and as the story content is presented in the virtual space the method receives collaborative content pertaining to the story content from one or more contributors. The contributors may include the audience of the virtual space and or the author of the story content. The collaborative content may comprise content of any type including text video audio e.g. voice video etc. The collaborative content may be received through the virtual space or via another sideband communication interface e.g. email separate audio channel etc. .

At step the method records the collaborative content received at step and associates the collaborate content with the story content presented at step . The collaborative content may be associated with respective contributors. Accordingly step may comprise storing a plurality of streams of collaborative content and associating each stream with a respective contributor. Step further comprises synchronizing the collaborative content streams with presentation the of the story content in the virtual space as described above.

At step the author of the story content selects collaborative content to include in the story. Step may comprise the author selecting portions of each of one or more streams of collaborative content. The selected collaborative content may be incorporated as story content such that the collaborative content is included the next time the story content is presented in a virtual space. In some embodiments step comprises converting collaborative content into another format. For example audio or video commentary may be converted into text an image may be incorporated into a video slideshow or the like. The incorporation may comprise identifying the contributor of the collaborative content as an author or contributor to the story and or giving the contributor the right to edit and or comment on the collaborative content.

At step the story content including the selected collaborative content is presented to a user in an interface or virtual space e.g. the interface of . The collaborative content may be synchronized with the story content and or associated with particular story content items as described above. In some embodiments the collaborative content may be distinguished from content of the story author e.g. using highlighting or other interface elements . At step the flow ends.
