The subject matter described herein relates generally to online services and more particularly to user content access management and control of user information residing in computer software.

Online services are becoming more prevalent. Users of very young ages to very old ages are communicating with each other using one or more online services as well as storing information and data online e.g. storing and backing up data sharing images and videos etc. .

After online services are first used however users do not always continue to access the services. For example a user may abandon or stop using one image sharing site and start using another image sharing site. A user may stop using a college focused service after graduation from college. A user may die or be incapacitated and cease accessing online services. Additionally many online services are accessible through applications installed on mobile devices which are then authorized to access these online services. However mobile devices are susceptible to being lost damaged or stolen resulting in an authorization no longer accessible to the user of the account.

These inactive accounts zombie accounts inaccessible authorizations zombie authorizations no longer used applications zombie applications and lost damaged or stolen devices zombie devices collectively referred to herein as subscriptions can pose a burden on system infrastructure as resources must be used to support subscriptions that are no longer active. Further these subscriptions may also pose a potential source for breaches of the user s privacy i.e. person information financial information private date etc. if the subscriptions become susceptible to third party access. Further these subscriptions may also continue to take actions such as posting automatic updates sending automatic replies or indicating a user s support for goods and services.

Zombie accounts that have scheduled activity or apps that can act on a user s behalf may make it appear that the user is still alive and active causing great trauma to the recipients of messages or viewers of social media posts e.g. deceased user s account application or mobile device continuing to auto post to their wall that they ve been using an app for 2 full years on the apps anniversary because it was scheduled by the app in advance . Thus there is a need for identifying and categorizing subscriptions that have become inactive so that subsequent actions may be taken.

One aspect of the present application may include a computer implemented method comprising identifying user subscriptions that meet at least one criterion of a plurality of criteria for detecting subscriptions that are no longer active classifying the user subscriptions into a first group and a second group where the user subscriptions in the first group have at least one context factor associated with the at least one criterion and matching the user subscriptions of the second group with data of unavailable users to produce a third group of user subscriptions where the user subscriptions of the third group are matched with some of the data of unavailable users.

Another aspect of the present application may include a non transitory computer readable medium having stored therein computer executable instructions for identifying user subscriptions that meet at least one criterion of a plurality of criteria for detecting subscriptions that are no longer active classifying the user subscriptions into a first group and a second group where the user subscriptions in the first group have at least one context factor associated with the at least one criterion and matching the user subscriptions of the second group with data of unavailable users to produce a third group of user subscriptions where the user subscriptions of the third group are matched with some of the data of unavailable users.

Another aspect of the present application may include at least one computing device comprising storage and a processor configured to perform identifying user subscriptions that meet at least one criterion of a plurality of criteria for detecting subscriptions that are no longer active classifying the user subscriptions into a first group and a second group where the user subscriptions in the first group have at least one context factor associated with the at least one criterion and matching the user subscriptions of the second group with data of unavailable users to produce a third group of user subscriptions where the user subscriptions of the third group are matched with some of the data of unavailable users.

The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing identifying inactive accounts or zombie accounts .

Additionally the methods and processes described in this application can also be used to identify and handle applications and devices that are no longer being actively used and may have become inactive applications i.e. zombie apps and lost damaged or stolen devices i.e. zombie devices .

Criteria that could be used to detect subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices that are no longer active are not particularly limited and may include duration of time between successive logins or access attempts duration of time between use of an application associated with a user subscription duration of time between new authorizations of applications to access user accounts etc.

After user subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices are identified based on at least one criterion in the identified user subscriptions are classified into either a first group or a second group based on the presence of context factors associated with the criteria in . Specifically each of the identified user subscriptions is classified into the first group if at least one context factor is present and is classified into the second group if the no context factors are present.

Context factors may include information associated with the account app or device indicating a user s prior access habits or history such as the user has previously gone or regularly goes extended periods of time without accessing the account information indicating the nature of the account app or devices such as the account is a medical records account that is usually accessed only a few times each year or the account is a student application only used when school is in session or the device is a work device used only during work weeks information indicating the nature of the content stored in by the account app or device such as the stored content is archived records being stored for posterity and information regarding the current season or time of year such as it is the weekend or it is summer or winter break of the school .

This context information may be used to indicate a reason that the subscription associated with the accounts apps or devices may not have been accessed for extended periods of time or which may justify why the criteria for detecting a subscription is no longer active were present. Thus subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices having a context factor are classified in the first group indicating a low likelihood that the subscriptions have become inactive. Conversely subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices not having any context factors are classified as in the second group indicating further investigation may be necessary.

Any subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices classified in the second group in are matched with data of unavailable users or devices to produce a third group of user subscriptions. More specifically databases or lists of unavailable users or devices are used to identify and classify some of the subscriptions in the second group into a third group which match the database or list content. The data of unavailable users or devices can come from a variety of sources including publicly available obituary or death notice information databases of accounts that have been identified by users as having been abandoned or hijacked databases from telecom providers identifying mobile devices that have been returned repossessed or reported lost stolen or damaged. Of course additional sources of data of unavailable users or devices may also be used as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

Based on the data of unavailable users or devices some of the subscriptions previously classified in group may be reclassified as group because they have a higher likelihood that the subscriptions are associated with accounts apps or devices have become inactive i.e. zombie accounts apps or devices than subscriptions in group or group .

As discussed below a variety of actions can be taken based on the classification of user subscriptions or app device as group group or group .

Once the time since last action by the user is determined in the determined time T since last action by the user is compared to a threshold time value at . The threshold time value can be predetermined by system administrators can be selected by the user based on user settings or can be dynamically determined based on at least one of the type of account app or device and the nature of data being stored in by the account app or device. For example the threshold time value could be determined by settings customized by the user or could be default values based on the type of account app or device or the type of data e.g. 30 days for stored emails 6 months for social media 2 years for stored personal records etc. .

If the determined time T since last action by the user is less than the threshold value the process returns to which is repeated until the determined time T exceeds the threshold value. If the determined time T is greater than the threshold the process continues to so that the subscription can be further analyzed.

Any subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices that were determined to have time since last action T greater than the threshold i.e. T Threshold in are examined to determine if there are any context factors that might justify or explain extended duration of time since last action in .

As discussed above context factors may include information associated with the account app or device indicating a user s prior access habits or history such as the user has previously gone or regularly goes extended periods of time without accessing the account information indicating the nature of the account app or devices such as the account is a medical records account that is usually accessed only a few times each year or the account is a student application only used when school is in session or the device is a work device used only during work weeks information indicating the nature of the content stored in by the account app or device such as the stored content is archived records being stored for posterity and information regarding the current season or time of year such as it is the weekend or it is summer or winter break of the school .

The foregoing are merely examples of context information and other types of context information may be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The context information may be used to indicate a reason or explain why the subscription associated with accounts apps or devices may not have had any activity for extended periods of time or which may justify why the criteria for detecting a subscription is no longer active were present.

If a subscription is associated with an account app or device is found to have at least one context factor in the subscription is classified into a first group i.e. group in . Classification into this first group could indicate that there is a relatively low likelihood that the subscription associated with an account app or device has become inactive. Once a subscription is classified into the first group in a first action may be taken in . Actions taken in may reflect an understanding that the subscription has having a low likelihood of having become inactive.

Examples could include sending a verification notification to the user indicating that the account had been determined to identified has having an extended period with activity requesting further information from the user or requiring a user provide additional information during next subscription access attempt i.e. if the subscription relates to an authorized application on a mobile device requiring the user to reauthorize the application next time the application is activated requiring have the user reauthenticate the device prior to being able to use the device .

Additionally as subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices classified into group may have a low likelihood of having become inactive action taken in may also include simply waiting an additional period of time and repeating the process of and discussed above to determine if circumstances have changes and the subscription should be reclassified into groups or discussed below i.e. no context factors are present and likelihood the subscription has become inactive have increased .

Conversely if a subscription associated with an account app or device is found to not have any context factors in the process continues to where the subscription is matched against compiled data of users or devices identified as being unavailable in . As discussed above the data of unavailable users or devices can come from a variety of sources include publicly available obituary or death notice information databases of accounts that have been identified by users as having been abandoned or hijacked databases from telecom providers identifying mobile devices that have been returned repossessed or reported lost stolen or damaged. Of course additional sources of data of unavailable users may also be used as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

If a subscription associated with an account app or device is found to not match the compiled data of unavailable users or devices in the subscription is classified as into a second group i.e. group in . Classification into this second group could indicate that there is a moderate likelihood that the subscription is associated with an account app or device that has become inactive. Once a subscription associated with an account app or device is classified into the second group in a second action may be taken in . Actions taken in may reflect an understanding that the subscription associated with accounts apps or devices has a moderate likelihood of having become inactive.

Examples could include restricting automatic actions by the subscriptions associated with accounts apps or devices such as sending automatic emails or automatic updates notifications on social media restricting viewability of the subscription by others such as viewable only to certain contacts rather than the world requiring that the user reauthorize applications or mobile devices disabling automatic updating of applications or devices or plug ins until user has reauthorized the apps or device and limiting locations of storage of account application or device data to centralized servers rather than local servers provided for quicker access. Of course other actions may be taken based on the subscription associated with accounts apps or devices being classified as having a moderate likelihood of having become inactive as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

If a subscription is found to match the compiled data of unavailable users or devices in the subscription is classified as into a third group i.e. group in . Classification into this third group could indicate that there is a relatively high likelihood that the subscription is associated with an account app or devices has become inactive. Once a subscription is classified into the third group in a third action may be taken in . Actions taken in may reflect an understanding that the subscription associated with accounts apps or devices has a high likelihood of having become inactive. Examples could include preventing automatic actions by the subscriptions such as sending automatic emails or automatic updates notifications on social media blocking viewability of the subscription by others i.e. no one other than user can view archiving the subscription and deleting from main servers deleting applications associated with the subscription from mobile devices disabling the device sending notifications to the user s contacts and transferring the contents of the account to other contacts of the user. Of course other actions may be taken based on the subscription being classified as having a having a high likelihood of having become inactive as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

In some implementations process discussed above may be implemented with different fewer or more blocks. Process may be implemented as computer executable instructions which can be stored on a medium loaded onto one or more processors of one or more computing devices and executed as a computer implemented method. Further the one or more computing devices may include servers storing and maintaining the user subscriptions. Additionally the one or more computing devices may include applications running on a mobile device that communicate with servers storing and maintaining the user subscriptions.

An example of one or more devices may be computing device described below in . Devices may include but are not limited to a computer e.g. a laptop computing device a mobile device e.g. smartphone or tablet a television a device associated with a vehicle a server computer computing devices storage devices and .

For example a mobile device may passively or actively monitor when a user most recently used an application associated with a user subscription and when the duration since the most recent access exceeds a threshold may notify or communicate with a server associated with the subscription. The server or the mobile device may then determine whether any context factors are present that may justify the period of inactivity.

Further the server or the mobile device may then attempt to match the subscription to available data regarding unavailable users. Based on the context factor determination and the matching to unavailable user data the server and mobile device may take action as discussed above with respect to process . In some implementations devices may be considered user devices e.g. devices used by users to access services and or issue requests such as on a social network . Devices may be devices associated with service providers e.g. used by service providers to provide services and or store data such as webpages text text portions images image portions audios audio segments videos video segments and or information thereabout .

For example a user e.g. Alice may access view and or share content or a webpage using user device or on a social network supported by one or more devices . A recipient e.g. Bob may access and or view Alice s shared content using device or .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled to input user interface and output device interface . Either one or both of input user interface and output device interface can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input user interface may include any device component sensor or interface physical or virtual that can be used to provide input e.g. buttons touch screen interface keyboard a pointing cursor control microphone camera braille motion sensor optical reader and or the like .

Output device interface may include a display television monitor printer speaker braille or the like. In some example implementations input user interface and output device interface can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device . In other example implementations other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input user interface and output device interface for a computing device .

Examples of computing device may include but are not limited to highly mobile devices e.g. smartphones devices in vehicles and other machines devices carried by humans and animals and the like mobile devices e.g. tablets notebooks laptops personal computers portable televisions radios and the like and devices not designed for mobility e.g. desktop computers other computers information kiosks televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto radios and the like .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled e.g. via I O interface to external storage and network for communicating with any number of networked components devices and systems including one or more computing devices of the same or different configuration. Computing device or any connected computing device can be functioning as providing services of or referred to as a server client thin server general machine special purpose machine or another label.

I O interface can include but is not limited to wired and or wireless interfaces using any communication or I O protocols or standards e.g. Ethernet 802.11x Universal System Bus WiMax modem a cellular network protocol and the like for communicating information to and or from at least all the connected components devices and network in computing environment . Network can be any network or combination of networks e.g. the Internet local area network wide area network a telephonic network a cellular network satellite network and the like .

Computing device can use and or communicate using computer usable or computer readable media including transitory media and non transitory media. Transitory media include transmission media e.g. metal cables fiber optics signals carrier waves and the like. Non transitory media include magnetic media e.g. disks and tapes optical media e.g. CD ROM digital video disks Blu ray disks solid state media e.g. RAM ROM flash memory solid state storage and other non volatile storage or memory.

Computing device can be used to implement techniques methods applications processes or computer executable instructions in some example computing environments. Computer executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media and stored on and retrieved from non transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more of any programming scripting and machine languages e.g. C C C Java Visual Basic Python Perl JavaScript and others .

Processor s can execute under any operating system OS not shown in a native or virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit application programming interface API unit input unit output unit Subscription identifying unit context factor determining unit unavailable user data matching unit and inter unit communication mechanism for the different units to communicate with each other with the OS and with other applications not shown . For example Subscription identifying unit context factor determining unit and unavailable user data matching unit may implement one or more processes shown in . The described units and elements can be varied in design function configuration or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some example implementations when information or an execution instruction is received by API unit it may be communicated to one or more other units e.g. logic unit input unit output unit Subscription identifying unit context factor determining unit and unavailable user data matching unit .

For example subscription identifying unit may identify subscription meeting one or more criteria for detecting subscriptions that are no longer active after input unit has detected a user indication or feedback regarding the criteria for detecting subscriptions. Further input unit may use API unit to communicate the user indication to Subscription identifying unit . Subscription identifying unit may via API unit interact with context factor determining unit to identify subscriptions having at least one of the criteria and detect any context factors present. Further using API unit Subscription identifying unit may interact with unavailable user data matching unit to match identified subscriptions not having context factors against the data of unavailable users to classify the subscriptions and take further action.

In some instances logic unit may be configured to control the information flow among the units and direct the services provided by API unit input unit output unit Subscription identifying unit context factor determining unit and unavailable user data matching unit in some example implementations described above. For example the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be controlled by logic unit alone or in conjunction with API unit .

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed.

For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
