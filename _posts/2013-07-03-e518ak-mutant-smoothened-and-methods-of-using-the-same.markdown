title: E518A/K mutant smoothened and methods of using the same
abstract: The emergence of mutations in tyrosine kinases following treatment of cancer patients with molecular-targeted therapy represents a major mechanism of acquired drug resistance. Here, we describe a mutation in the serpentine receptor, Smoothened (SMO), which results in resistance to a Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor in medulloblastoma. A single amino acid substitution in a conserved glutamic acid residue of SMO maintains Hh signaling, but results in the inability of the Hh pathway inhibitor, GDC-0449, to bind SMO and suppress the pathway. The invention provides screening methods to detect SMO mutations and methods to screen for drugs that specifically modulate mutant SMO exhibiting drug resistance.

No. 61 389 995 filed Oct. 5 2010. The specifications of each of the foregoing applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted via EFS Web and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy created on Jul. 3 2013 is named CIBT221102 Seq.txt and is 16 819 bytes in size.

The present invention relates to isolated mutant SMO nucleic acids and proteins related to chemotherapeutic resistance of tumors and methods of screening for compounds that bind to SMO mutants or modulate SMO activity and to cancer diagnostics and therapies and in particular to the detection of mutations that are diagnostic and or prognostic and treatment of drug resistant tumors.

Molecular targeted cancer therapeutics have shown impressive activity in the clinic. Some of the best noted examples include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib in Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia CML or KIT PDGFR mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumors GISTs and erlotinib in EGFR mutant non small cell lung cancer NSCLC Krause D. S. and R. A. Van Etten 2005 353 2 172 187 . Treatment with these agents has led to dramatic anti tumor responses in patient populations harboring these molecular abnormalities. However despite the impressive initial clinical responses most patients eventually progress due to the acquisition of drug resistance Engelman J. A. and J. Settleman 2008 18 1 73 79 . Identification of mechanisms of resistance have consequently opened the door to more rational drug combinations and the development of second generation inhibitors that can potentially overcome or avoid the emergence of resistance.

Medulloblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum that represents the most common brain malignancy in children Polkinghorn W. R. and N. J. Tarbell 2007 4 5 295 304 . Despite improvements in survival rates the debilitating side effects of adjuvant radiation represent a major clinical challenge thus supporting the need for new molecular targeted therapies.

The Hedgehog Hh signaling pathway has been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Constitutive Hh signaling most often due to underlying loss of function mutations in the inhibitory receptor PTCH1 has been demonstrated in approximately 30 of sporadic cases Zurawel R. H. et al. 2000 27 1 44 51 Kool M. et al. 2008 3 8 e3088 Dellovade T. et al. 2006 29 539 Rubin L. L. and F. J. de Sauvage 2006 5 1026 . Mice heterozygous for Ptch1 Ptch1 can spontaneously develop medulloblastoma and treatment with Hh pathway inhibitors results in tumor elimination and prolonged survival Goodrich L. V. et al. 1997 277 5329 1109 1113 Romer J. T. et al. 2004 6 3 229 240 . However it has recently been observed that a patient treated with the novel Hh pathway inhibitor GDC 0449 initially showed a dramatic response to treatment Charles M. Rudin et al. 2009 . submitted only to fail to have a durable response to treatment and a relapse of the tumor.

There is an urgent need in the art to find compounds that modulate SMO activity in such mutant SMO proteins to overcome drug resistance upon treatment with GDC 0449. There is further a need to a method to diagnose patients who may be resistant to treatment either through natural variation of their SMO genotype or through acquired mutation and resistance.

The techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are generally well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art such as for example the widely utilized methodologies described in Sambrook et al. 3rd. edition 2001 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y.

For purposes of interpreting this specification the following definitions will apply and whenever appropriate terms used in the singular will also include the plural and vice versa. In the event that any definition set forth below conflicts with any document incorporated herein by reference the definition set forth below shall control.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments an antibody is purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by for example the Lowry method and in some embodiments to greater than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of for example a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using for example Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

 Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.

The variable region or variable domain of an antibody refers to the amino terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as VH. The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as VL. These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen binding sites.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions HVRs both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three HVRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the HVRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains antibodies immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in for example Abbas et al. 4th ed. W. B. Saunders Co. 2000 . An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule formed by covalent or non covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.

The terms full length antibody intact antibody and whole antibody are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain an Fc region.

A naked antibody for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen binding site. In one embodiment a two chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv scFv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six HVRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment contains the heavy and light chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see e.g. Pluckth n in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York 1994 pp. 269 315.

The term diabodies refers to antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 1993 01161 Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations e.g. naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler and Milstein 256 495 97 1975 Hongo et al. 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in Cell Hybridomas 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 phage display technologies see e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1992 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 and technologies for producing human or human like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences see e.g. WO 1998 24893 WO 1996 34096 WO 1996 33735 WO 1991 10741 Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 and 5 661 016 Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 Morrison 368 812 813 1994 Fishwild et al. 14 845 851 1996 Neuberger 14 826 1996 and Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATIZED antibodies wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin recipient antibody in which residues from a HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a HVR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and or capacity. In some instances FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see e.g. Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 . See also e.g. Vaswani and Hamilton 1 105 115 1998 Harris 23 1035 1038 1995 Hurle and Gross 5 428 433 1994 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 982 321 and 7 087 409.

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 . See also van Dijk and van de Winkel 5 368 74 2001 . Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled e.g. immunized xenomice see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 regarding XENOMOUSE technology . See also for example Li et al. 103 3557 3562 2006 regarding human antibodies generated via a human B cell hybridoma technology.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six HVRs three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . In native antibodies H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See e.g. Xu et al. 13 37 45 2000 Johnson and Wu in 248 1 25 Lo ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2003 . Indeed naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See e.g. Hamers Casterman et al. 363 446 448 1993 Sheriff et al. 3 733 736 1996 .

A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

HVRs may comprise extended HVRs as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 or 89 96 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. supra. Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc. according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain approximately residues 1 107 of the light chain and residues 1 113 of the heavy chain e.g Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The EU numbering system or EU index is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region e.g. the EU index reported in Kabat et al. supra . The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system e.g. see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 640 323 Figures for EU numbering .

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . In one embodiment an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies may be produced using certain procedures known in the art. For example Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and or framework residues is described by for example Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody which partially or fully mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.

 Growth inhibitory antibodies are those that prevent or reduce proliferation of a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibody binds. For example the antibody may prevent or reduce proliferation of cancer cells that express Smo or mutant in vitro and or in vivo.

Antibodies that induce apoptosis are those that induce programmed cell death as determined by standard apoptosis assays such as binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies .

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

The term Fc region herein is used to define a C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226 or from Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus thereof. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during production or purification of the antibody or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed antibody populations with no K447 residues removed and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

A functional Fc region possesses an effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include Clq binding CDC Fc receptor binding ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays as disclosed for example in definitions herein.

A native sequence Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region non A and A allotypes native sequence human IgG2 Fc region native sequence human IgG3 Fc region and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.

A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification preferably one or more amino acid substitution s . Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide and most preferably at least about 90 homology therewith more preferably at least about 95 homology therewith.

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see e.g. Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed for example in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein.

The term Fc receptor or FcR also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known see e.g. Ghetie and Ward. 18 12 592 598 1997 Ghetie et al. 15 7 637 640 1997 Hinton et al. 279 8 6213 6216 2004 WO 2004 92219 Hinton et al. .

Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates to which the polypeptides with a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2000 42072 Presta describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also e.g. Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function s . Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 or U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 Presta may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include PBMC and NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system Clq to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences polypeptides with a variant Fc region and increased or decreased Clq binding capability are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 B1 and WO 1999 51642. See also e.g. Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The term Fc region comprising antibody refers to an antibody that comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the antibody or by recombinant engineering of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody. Accordingly a composition comprising an antibody having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise an antibody with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate see e.g. Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . To establish conditions for the assay MICROTITER multi well plates Thermo Scientific are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbent plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of the anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 57 4593 4599 1997 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. about 65 hours to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 TWEEN 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 l well of scintillant MICROSCINT 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.

According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE 2000 or a BIACORE 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIACORE Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 to 5 g ml 0.2 M before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 TWEEN 20 surfactant PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. Association rates kon and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIACORE Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . If the on rate exceeds 10Msby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM AMINCO spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

An on rate rate of association association rate or k according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE 2000 or a BIACORE 3000 system BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. .

The term substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values for example one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values .

Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping groupmoieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH2 formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl.

The term encompasses full length unprocessed SMO as well as any form of SMO that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of SMO e.g. splice variants or allelic variants. Mutant Smo as used herein refers to SMO having a mutation in the carboxy terminal portion of transmembrane 7 of SMO at position 518 of human SMO.

As used herein treatment and variations such as treat or treating refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease alleviation of symptoms diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease preventing metastasis decreasing the rate of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder.

An individual subject or patient is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments the vertebrate is a mammal. Mammals include but are not limited to farm animals such as cows sport animals pets such as cats dogs and horses primates mice and rats. In certain embodiments a mammal is a human.

The term pharmaceutical formulation refers to a preparation which is in such form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective and which contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would be administered. Such formulations may be sterile.

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount encompasses an amount in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount would be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell such as a cell expressing SMO either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells such as a cell expressing SMO in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C.

A mutant Smo antagonist is a compound that inhibits the biological activity of a SMO having an amino acid substitution at position 518 of human SMO that changes the wild type glutamic acid at this position to any other amino acid. The biological activity of SMO is the ability to transducer a signal upon stimulation with hedgehog to activation of Gli transcription factor.

The nucleic acids of the invention include isolated mutant SMO encoding sequences. The nucleic acids comprise a sequence that is at least 80 identical to the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 3 and which contain at least one mutation from this sequence to encode any amino acid at position 518 other than glutamic acid E . In some embodiments the nucleic acid encodes alanine A or lysine K at position 518. In some embodiments the nucleic acid has at least one mutation from the parental wild type SMO at nucleotide 1552 1553 and or 1554. In some embodiments the percent identity is 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 with SEQ ID NO 3 providing that there is at least one mutation at position 1552 1553 and or 1554. The invention also contemplates fragments of such nucleic acids that span the region of the mutations described above in fragments that are at least 20 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments the nucleotide fragments are 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 nucleotides in length. The fragments may be any length that spans the region of the mutations described above up to the full length mutant SMO encoding nucleic acid molecule. Isolated mutant SMO and fragments thereof may be used for example for hybridization to generate primers and probes for the prognostic and diagnostic assays of the invention and for expression in recombinant systems such as to generate mutant SMO protein or portions thereof for use as immunogens and for use in assays of the invention as described herein .

The invention provides nucleic acid probes which may be used to identify the mutant SMO nucleic acid molecule in the methods of the invention. Nucleic acid samples derived from tissue suspected of having a mutant SMO or from tissue wherein the status of SMO is unknown may be screened using a specific probe for mutant SMO using standard procedures such as described in Sambrook et al. MC A LM Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 1989 . Alternatively the nucleic acid encoding SMO may be amplified from the tissue and probed with a specific probe of the invention to determine the presence of absence of mutant SMO. PCR methodology is well known in the art Sambrook et al. supra Dieffenbach et al. PCR P A LM Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 1995 .

Nucleotide sequences or their complement encoding mutant SMO have various applications in the art of molecular biology including uses as hybridization probes and in the generation of anti sense RNA and DNA probes. Mutant SMO encoding nucleic acid will also be useful for the preparation of mutant SMO polypeptides by the recombinant techniques described herein wherein those mutant SMO polypeptides may find use for example in the preparation of anti mutant SMO antibodies as described herein.

The full length mutant SMO nucleic acids or portions thereof may be used as hybridization probes for identifying mutant SMO.

Optionally the length of the probes will be about 20 to about 50 bases. The hybridization probes may be derived from at least the mutant region of the full length mutant SNO nucleotide sequence.

By way of example a screening method will comprise isolating the coding region of mutant SMO using the known DNA sequence to synthesize a selected probe of about 40 bases. Hybridization probes may be labeled by a variety of labels including radionucleotides such as P or S or enzymatic labels such as alkaline phosphatase coupled to the probe via avidin biotin coupling systems. Labeled probes having a sequence complementary to that of the mutant SMO gene of the present invention can be used to screen libraries of human cDNA genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of such libraries the probe hybridizes to. Hybridization products may be resolved on polyacrylamide gels. In addition the SMO mutations may be determined using the method described in the Examples. Hybridization conditions including moderate stringency and high stringency are provided in Sambrook et al. supra.

Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to the known sequences for SMO and mutant SMO. Sequence identity at the carboxy terminal region of transmembrane domain 7 can be determined using methods known in the art.

Other useful fragments of the SMO encoding nucleic acids include antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a single stranded nucleic acid sequence either RNA or DNA capable of binding to target mutant SMO mRNA sense or mutant SMO DNA antisense sequences. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides according to the present invention comprise a fragment of the coding region of mutant SMO DNA containing the mutation region. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides preferably from about 14 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in for example Stein and Cohen 1988 48 2659 and van der Krol et al. 1988 6 958.

Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means including enhanced degradation of the duplexes premature termination of transcription or translation or by other means. Such methods are encompassed by the present invention. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of mutant SMO proteins wherein those mutant SMO proteins may play a role in the resistance of cancer in mammals to chemotherapeutics such as GDC 0449. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar phosphodiester backbones or other sugar linkages such as those described in WO 91 06629 and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo i.e. capable of resisting enzymatic degradation but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.

Specific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful for inhibiting expression of mutant SMO proteins include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non natural internucleoside linkages. Oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification and as sometimes referenced in the art modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.

It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide. The present invention also includes antisense compounds which are chimeric compounds. Chimeric antisense compounds or chimeras in the context of this invention are antisense compounds particularly oligonucleotides which contain two or more chemically distinct regions each made up of at least one monomer unit i.e. a nucleotide in the case of an oligonucleotide compound. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation increased cellular uptake and or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA DNA or RNA RNA hybrids. By way of example RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H therefore results in cleavage of the RNA target thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide inhibition of gene expression. Consequently comparable results can often be obtained with shorter oligonucleotides when chimeric oligonucleotides are used compared to phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides hybridizing to the same target region. Chimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides modified oligonucleotides oligonucleosides and or oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Preferred chimeric antisense oligonucleotides incorporate at least one 2 modified sugar preferably 2 O CH O CH at the 3 terminal to confer nuclease resistance and a region with at least 4 contiguous 2 H sugars to confer RNase H activity. Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers. Preferred gapmers have a region of 2 modified sugars preferably 2 O CH O CH at the 3 terminal and at the 5 terminal separated by at least one region having at least 4 contiguous 2 H sugars and preferably incorporate phosphorothioate backbone linkages. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures include but are not limited to U.S. Pat.

Other examples of sense or antisense oligonucleotides include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties such as those described in WO 90 10048 and other moieties that increase affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence such as poly L lysine . Further still intercalating agents such as ellipticine and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.

Antisense or sense oligonucleotides may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method including for example CaPO mediated DNA transfection electroporation or by using gene transfer vectors such as Epstein Barr virus.

Suitable ligand binding molecules include but are not limited to cell surface receptors growth factors other cytokines or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell.

Alternatively a sense or an antisense oligonucleotide may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by formation of an oligonucleotide lipid complex as described in WO 90 10448. The sense or antisense oligonucleotide lipid complex is preferably dissociated within the cell by an endogenous lipase.

Antisense or sense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 nucleotides in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 570 580 590 600 610 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 700 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 780 790 800 810 820 830 840 850 860 870 880 890 900 910 920 930 940 950 960 970 980 990 or 1000 nucleotides in length wherein in this context the term about means the referenced nucleotide sequence length plus or minus 10 of that referenced length.

Nucleotide sequences encoding a mutant SMO can also be used to construct hybridization probes for mapping the gene which encodes that SMO and for the genetic analysis of individuals with genetic disorders. The nucleotide sequences provided herein may be mapped to a chromosome and specific regions of a chromosome using known techniques such as in situ hybridization linkage analysis against known chromosomal markers and hybridization screening with libraries.

A potential mutant SMO antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using antisense technology where e.g. an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example nucleic acids encoding mutant SMO herein are used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription triple helix see Lee et al. 1979 6 3073 Cooney et al. 1988 241 456 Dervan et al. 1991 251 1360 thereby preventing transcription and the production of mutant SMO. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the mutant SMO Okano 1991 56 560 OAIGE CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the mutant SMO. When antisense DNA is used oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation initiation site e.g. between about 10 and 10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence are preferred.

Potential antagonists of mutant SMO include small molecules that bind to the site occupied in wild type SMO by GDC 0449 thereby blocking the biological activity of mutant SMO. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide like molecules preferably soluble peptides and synthetic non peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds.

Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see e.g. Rossi 1994 4 469 471 and PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 published Sep. 18 1997 .

Nucleic acid molecules in triple helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single stranded and composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple helix formation via Hoogsteen base pairing rules which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one strand of a duplex. For further details see e.g. PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 supra.

These small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed hereinabove and or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art. Examples of the small molecules that may be used as mutant SMO antagonists are compounds having the following structural formulas 

The invention provides isolated mutant SMO proteins. Wild type human SMO is shown in SEQ ID NO 1. Mutant human SMO is shown in SEQ ID NO 2 wherein amino acid 518 is shown as X which with respect to this application stands for any amino acid other than glutamic acid E . In some embodiments the X is alanine A or lysine K . Mutant SMO and fragments thereof may be produced in recombinant systems as is well known in the art using the mutant SMO nucleic acids described herein. Such nucleic acids may be incorporated into expression vectors as are well known in that art and transfected into host cells which may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells depending on the proposed use of the protein. Full length or fragments of mutant SMO in which the fragments contain at least the carboxy terminal portion of transmembrane domain 7 and amino acid 518 of SEQ ID NO 2 may be used as immunogens to produce antibodies of the invention or to purify antibodies of the invention for example.

In one aspect the invention provides antibodies that bind to SMO particularly mutant SMO. In one embodiment an anti SMO antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment an anti SMO antibody is an antibody fragment e.g. a Fab Fab SH Fv scFv or Fab fragment. In one embodiment an anti mutant SMO antibody is a chimeric humanized or human antibody. In one embodiment an anti SMO antibody is purified. In certain embodiments a composition is a pharmaceutical formulation for the treatment of cancer.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments see Hudson et al. 2003 9 129 134.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.

The invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody. See e.g. Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. See e.g. Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequence s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by CDR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or CDR residues of non human origin.

Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In certain embodiments bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies. In certain embodiments one of the binding specificities is for SMO and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of SMO. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express SMO. These antibodies possess a SMO binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent such as e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published May 13 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion for example is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3regions. In certain embodiments the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In one embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking method. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. In certain embodiments the dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. In certain embodiments a multivalent antibody comprises or consists of three to about eight antigen binding sites. In one such embodiment a multivalent antibody comprises or consists of four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain for example two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 n VD2 X2 n Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two for example four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

In some embodiments an antibody of the invention is a single domain antibody. A single domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments a single domain antibody is a human single domain antibody Domantis Inc. Waltham Mass. see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 248 516 B1 . In one embodiment a single domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid e.g. alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition deletion or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See e.g. Wright et al. 1997 15 26 32. The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates e.g. mannose N acetyl glucosamine GlcNAc galactose and sialic acid as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the stem of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.

For example antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached directly or indirectly to an Fc region. Such variants may have improved ADCC function. See e.g. US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibody variants include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 WO2002 031140 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells see e.g. Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 Kanda Y. et al. 94 4 680 688 2006 and WO2003 085107 .

Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides e.g. in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. and US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. . Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. .

In certain embodiments an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Such substitutions may occur in combination with any of the variations described above.

In certain embodiments the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . Non limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 see e.g. Hellstrom I. et al. 83 7059 7063 1986 and Hellstrom I et al. 82 1499 1502 1985 5 821 337 see Bruggemann M. et al. 166 1351 1361 1987 . Alternatively non radioactive assays methods may be employed see for example ACTI non radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry CellTechnology Inc. Mountain View Calif. and CytoTox 96 non radioactive cytotoxicity assay Promega Madison Wis. . Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assaymay be performed see for example Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 Cragg M. S. et al. Blood 101 1045 1052 2003 and Cragg M. S. and M. J. Glennie 103 2738 2743 2004 . FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art see for example Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Other antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions. More substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions are provided in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened e.g. for a desired activity such as improved antigen binding decreased immunogenicity improved ADCC or CDC etc.

Modifications in the biological properties of an antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions that affect a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have modified e.g. improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody which may be conveniently generated using phage display based affinity maturation techniques. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein e.g. the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity . In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification scanning mutagenesis e.g. alanine scanning can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art including those described herein and variants with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished Clq binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 648 260 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00 42072 Presta and WO 2004 056312 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased Clq binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 WO99 51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

In another aspect the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region wherein the modifications facilitate and or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168.

In yet another aspect it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. thioMAbs in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties such as drug moieties or linker drug moieties as described further herein. In certain embodiments any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine V205 Kabat numbering of the light chain A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain and S400 EU numbering of the heavy chain Fc region.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

In another embodiment conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube Kam et al. 102 11600 11605 2005 . The radiation may be of any wavelength and includes but is not limited to wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.

Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 and further described e.g. in Hongo et al. 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 and Ni 26 4 265 268 2006 regarding human human hybridomas.

Additional methods include those described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 189 826 regarding production of monoclonal human natural IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines. Human hybridoma technology Trioma technology is described in Vollmers and Brandlein 20 3 927 937 2005 and Vollmers and Brandlein 27 3 185 91 2005 .

For various other hybridoma techniques see e.g. US 2006 258841 US 2006 183887 fully human antibodies US 2006 059575 US 2005 287149 US 2005 100546 US 2005 026229 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 078 492 and 7 153 507. An exemplary protocol for producing monoclonal antibodies using the hybridoma method is described as follows. In one embodiment a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of a polypeptide comprising mutant SMO or a fragment thereof and an adjuvant such as monophosphoryl lipid A MPL trehalose dicrynomycolate TDM Ribi Immunochem. Research Inc. Hamilton Mont. . A polypeptide comprising mutant SMO or a fragment thereof may be prepared using methods well known in the art such as recombinant methods some of which are further described herein. Serum from immunized animals is assayed for anti mutant SMO antibodies and booster immunizations are optionally administered. Lymphocytes from animals producing anti mutant SMO antibodies are isolated. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.

Lymphocytes are then fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell. See e.g. Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Myeloma cells may be used that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Exemplary myeloma cells include but are not limited to murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium e.g. a medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells. Preferably serum free hybridoma cell culture methods are used to reduce use of animal derived serum such as fetal bovine serum as described for example in Even et al. 24 3 105 108 2006 .

Oligopeptides as tools for improving productivity of hybridoma cell cultures are described in Franek 111 122 2005 . Specifically standard culture media are enriched with certain amino acids alanine serine asparagine proline or with protein hydrolyzate fractions and apoptosis may be significantly suppressed by synthetic oligopeptides constituted of three to six amino acid residues. The peptides are present at millimolar or higher concentrations.

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing may be assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies that bind to mutant SMO. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells may be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA . The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can be determined for example by Scatchard analysis. See e.g. Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. See e.g. Goding supra. Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography. One procedure for isolation of proteins from hybridoma cells is described in US 2005 176122 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 919 436. The method includes using minimal salts such as lyotropic salts in the binding process and preferably also using small amounts of organic solvents in the elution process.

Antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are described generally in Hoogenboom et al. in 178 1 37 O Brien et al. ed. Human Press Totowa N. J. 2001 . For example one method of generating antibodies of interest is through the use of a phage antibody library as described in Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2004 340 5 1073 93.

In principle synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region Fv fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption elution. Any of the antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region Fc sequences described in Kabat et al. Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3.

In certain embodiments the antigen binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable V regions of about 110 amino acids one each from the light VL and heavy VH chains that both present three hypervariable loops HVRs or complementarity determining regions CDRs . Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage either as single chain Fv scFv fragments in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short flexible peptide or as Fab fragments in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non covalently as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . As used herein scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as Fv phage clones or Fv clones. 

Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be searched for antigen binding clones as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

In certain embodiments filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer e.g. as described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as Fab fragments in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al. 19 4133 4137 1991 .

In general nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti mutant SMO clones is desired the subject is immunized with mutant SMO to generate an antibody response and spleen cells and or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti mutant SMO clones is obtained by generating an anti mutant SMO antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system such that mutant SMO immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against mutant SMO. The generation of human antibody producing transgenic mice is described below.

Additional enrichment for anti mutant SMO reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing mutant SMO specific membrane bound antibody e.g. by cell separation using mutant SMO affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome labeled mutant SMO followed by flow activated cell sorting FACS .

Alternatively the use of spleen cells and or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal human or non human species in which mutant SMO is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species such as human mouse rat lagomorpha luprine canine feline porcine bovine equine and avian species etc.

Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments including VH and VL segments are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers matching the 5 and 3 ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al. 86 3833 3837 1989 thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA with back primers at the 5 end of the exon encoding the mature V domain and forward primers based within the J segment as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 and in Ward et al. 341 544 546 1989 . However for amplifying from cDNA back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al. 9 88 89 1991 and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al. . 86 5728 5732 1989 . To maximize complementarity degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or Sastry et al. 1989 . In certain embodiments library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as described in the method of Orum et al. 21 4491 4498 1993 . For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 .

Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH gene segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Tomlinson et al. 227 776 798 1992 and mapped reported in Matsuda et al. 3 88 94 1993 these cloned segments including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 . VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al. 89 4457 4461 1992 . Human V and V segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Williams and Winter 23 1456 1461 1993 and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires based on a range of VH and VL folds and L3 and H3 lengths will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V gene encoding DNAs germline V gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors and the vectors recombined in vitro e.g. as described in Hogrefe et al. 128 119 126 1993 or in vivo by combinatorial infection e.g. the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present about 10clones . Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity Kof about 10M .

Alternatively the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or assembled together by PCR and then cloned e.g. as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv scFv repertoires. In yet another technique in cell PCR assembly is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al. 20 3831 3837 1992 .

The antibodies produced by naive libraries either natural or synthetic can be of moderate affinity Kof about 10to 10M but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. 1994 supra. For example mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error prone polymerase reported in Leung et al. 1 11 15 1989 in the method of Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 or in the method of Gram et al. 89 3576 3580 1992 . Additionally affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 published 14 Mar. 1996 described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 . This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities of about 10M or less.

Screening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known in the art. For example mutant SMO can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin coated beads or used in any other method for panning phage display libraries.

The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized mutant SMO under conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally the conditions including pH ionic strength temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or by alkali e.g. as described in Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or by mutant SMO antigen competition e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Phages can be enriched 20 1 000 fold in a single round of selection. Moreover the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.

The efficiency of selection depends on many factors including the kinetics of dissociation during washing and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics and weak binding affinities can be retained by use of short washes multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics and good binding affinities can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 and in WO 92 09690 and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 .

It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities even with affinities that differ slightly for mutant SMO. However random mutation of a selected antibody e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques is likely to give rise to many mutants most binding to antigen and a few with higher affinity. With limiting mutant SMO rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated mutant SMO but with the biotinylated mutant SMO at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for mutant SMO. The high affinity binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads. Such equilibrium capture allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.

Anti mutant SMO clones may be selected based on activity. In certain embodiments the invention provides anti mutant SMO antibodies that bind to living cells that naturally express mutant SMO such as GDC 0449 resistant tumor cells. In one embodiment the invention provides anti mutant SMO antibodies that bind to the same region as that bound by GDC 0449 in wild type SMO. Fv clones corresponding to such anti mutant SMO antibodies can be selected by 1 isolating anti mutant SMO clones from a phage library as described above and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host 2 selecting mutant SMO and a second protein against which blocking and non blocking activity respectively is desired 3 adsorbing the anti mutant SMO phage clones to immobilized mutant SMO 4 using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize mutant SMO binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein and 5 eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step 4 . Optionally clones with the desired blocking non blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.

DNA encoding hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template . Once isolated the DNA can be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody encoding DNA include Skerra et al. 5 256 1993 and Pluckthun 130 151 1992 .

DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and or light chain constant regions e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. supra to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal such as human species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence s for hybrid full length heavy chain and or light chain is included in the definition of chimeric and hybrid antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments an Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence s for full or partial length human heavy and or light chains.

DNA encoding anti mutant SMO antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner chimeric or hybrid antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone derived antibodies of the invention.

Antibodies may also be produced using recombinant methods. For recombinant production of an anti mutant SMO antibody nucleic acid encoding the antibody is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

An antibody of the invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native antibody signal sequence the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase lpp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by e.g. the yeast invertase leader factor leader including and factor leaders or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader or the signal described in WO 90 13646. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter .

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up antibody encoding nucleic acid such as DHFR glutamine synthetase GS thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR gene are identified by culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. Under these conditions the DHFR gene is amplified along with any other co transformed nucleic acid. A Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in endogenous DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 may be used.

Alternatively cells transformed with the GS gene are identified by culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing L methionine sulfoximine Msx an inhibitor of GS. Under these conditions the GS gene is amplified along with any other co transformed nucleic acid. The GS selection amplification system may be used in combination with the DHFR selection amplification system described above.

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody of interest wild type DHFR gene and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. 282 39 1979 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1. Jones 85 12 1977 . The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly Leu2 deficient yeast strains ATCC 20 622 or 38 626 are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.

In addition vectors derived from the 1.6 m circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of yeasts. Alternatively an expression system for large scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for . Van den Berg 8 135 1990 . Stable multi copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of have also been disclosed. Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 .

Expression and cloning vectors generally contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding an antibody. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter lactamase and lactose promoter systems alkaline phosphatase promoter a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding an antibody.

Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Examples of suitable promoter sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phosphofructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.

Antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus Simian Virus 40 SV40 or from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. See also Reyes et al. 297 598 601 1982 on expression of human interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of a DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and . One preferred cloning host is 294 ATCC 31 446 although other strains such as B X1776 ATCC 31 537 and W3110 ATCC 27 325 are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.

Full length antibody antibody fusion proteins and antibody fragments can be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin that by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237 Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 199 Joly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523 Simmons et al. which describes translation initiation region TIR and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion. See also Charlton Vol. 248 B.K.C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2003 pp. 245 254 describing expression of antibody fragments in . After expression the antibody may be isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through e.g. a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g. in CHO cells.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody encoding vectors. or common baker s yeast is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However a number of other genera species and strains are commonly available and useful herein such as hosts such as e.g. ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 EP 244 234 such as and filamentous fungi such as e.g. and hosts such as and . For a review discussing the use of yeasts and filamentous fungi for the production of therapeutic proteins see e.g. Gerngross 22 1409 1414 2004 .

Certain fungi and yeast strains may be selected in which glycosylation pathways have been humanized resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See e.g. Li et al. 24 210 215 2006 describing humanization of the glycosylation pathway in and Gerngross et al. supra.

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms invertebrates and vertebrates . Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

Plant cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato duckweed alfalfa and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 959 177 6 040 498 6 420 548 7 125 978 and 6 417 429 describing PLANTIBODIES technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants .

Vertebrate cells may be used as hosts and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TRI cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 . Other useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells including DHFRCHO cells Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 and myeloma cell lines such as NS0 and Sp2 0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for antibody production see e.g. Yazaki and Wu Vol. 248 B. K. C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2003 pp. 255 268.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being among one of the typically preferred purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 1986 EMBO J. 5 1567 1575 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

In general various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research testing and clinical are well established in the art consistent with the above described methodologies and or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody of interest.

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugates or ADCs comprising an antibody conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. a protein toxin an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Immunoconjugates have been used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents i.e. drugs that kill or inhibit the growth or proliferation of cells in the treatment of cancer Lambert J. 2005 5 543 549 Wu et al 2005 23 9 1137 1146 Payne G. 2003 13 207 212 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 . Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery of a drug moiety to a tumor and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of unconjugated drugs may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. Mar. 15 1986 pp. 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in 84 A. Pinchera et al. eds pp. 475 506. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may exert their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin Aleurites fordii proteins dianthin proteins Phytolaca americana proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See e.g. WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 105 HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF disclosed in Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schr der and K.

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to 1I 2I 3I N acetyl 1I PSAG and I1 Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin Aleurites fordii proteins dianthin proteins Phytolaca americana proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tc99m or I123 or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcm or I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc.

5. Preparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates In the antibody drug conjugates ADC an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody p 1 to about 20 through a linker L . The ADC of the formula shown below may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein. Ab L D 

The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

In one aspect antibodies of the invention are useful for detecting the presence of mutant SMO in a biological sample. The term detecting as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue such as tumor tissue.

In one aspect the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of mutant SMO in a biological sample. In certain embodiments the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an anti mutant SMO antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti mutant SMO antibody to mutant SMO and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti mutant SMO antibody and mutant SMO.

In one aspect the invention provides a method of diagnosing a disorder associated with expression of mutant SMO. In certain embodiments the method comprises contacting a test cell with an anti mutant SMO antibody determining the level of expression either quantitatively or qualitatively of mutant SMO by the test cell by detecting binding of the anti mutant SMO antibody to mutant SMO and comparing the level of expression of mutant SMO by the test cell with the level of expression of mutant SMO by a control cell e.g. a normal cell of the same tissue origin as the test cell or a cell that expresses wild type SMO at levels comparable to such a normal cell wherein a higher level of expression of mutant SMO by the test cell as compared to the control cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased expression of mutant SMO. In certain embodiments the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a disorder associated with increased expression of mutant SMO. In certain embodiments the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder such as a cancer or a tumor.

Exemplary disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include but are not limited to medulloblastoma pancreatic cancer basal cell carcinoma.

Certain other methods can be used to detect binding of antibodies to mutant SMO. Such methods include but are not limited to antigen binding assays that are well known in the art such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays and immunohistochemistry IHC .

In certain embodiments antibodies are labeled. Labels include but are not limited to labels or moieties that are detected directly such as fluorescent chromophoric electron dense chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes or ligands that are detected indirectly e.g. through an enzymatic reaction or molecular interaction. Exemplary labels include but are not limited to the radioisotopes P C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP lactoperoxidase or microperoxidase biotin avidin spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals and the like.

In certain embodiments antibodies are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Immobilization may entail separating an anti mutant SMO antibody from any mutant SMO that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti mutant SMO antibody before the assay procedure as by adsorption to a water insoluble matrix or surface Bennich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 760 or by covalent coupling for example using glutaraldehyde cross linking or by insolubilizing the anti mutant SMO antibody after formation of a complex between the anti mutant SMO antibody and mutant SMO e.g. by immunoprecipitation.

It is understood that any of the above embodiments of diagnosis or detection may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti mutant SMO antibody.

In one aspect nucleic acid probesas described herein are useful for detecting the presence of mutant SMO nucleic acid in a biological sample. The term detecting as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue such as tumor tissue.

In one aspect the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of mutant SMO necoding nucleic acid in a biological sample. In certain embodiments the method comprises contacting nucleic acid from the biological sample with a probe as described herein and hybridizing the probe to the nucleic acid under conditions permissive for hybridization under stringent conditions and detecting whether a complex is formed between the probe and the nucleic acid sample.

The mutant SMO encoding nucleic acid may be detected using any methodology known in the art including but not limited to the use of probes as described herein or by PCR amplification rtPCR sequencing single strand conformational polymorphism SSCP differential restriction digestion of DNA hybridization or any other method known in the art.

In these methods detection of a mutant SMO as described herein cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased expression of mutant SMO i.e. resistance to treatment with a Smo inhibitor such as GDC 0449 . In certain embodiments the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a resistant tumor associated with expression of mutant SMO.

Exemplary disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include but are not limited to medulloblastoma pancreatic cancer basal cell carcinoma.

Mutant SMO may be detected in cell based assays as known in the art including but not limited to binding of a mutant SMO detecting antibody to the surface of a cell sample such as a tumor sample in vitro Immunohistochemical staining of histological preparations of tumor samples or tissue suspected of containing mutant SMO. Functional assays in which a tissue sample is contacted with GDC 0449 and hedgehog to determine whether Hh signaling occurs e.g. by measuring activation of pathway components expression of Gli and the like . Any functional assay using the Hh signaling pathway that can be disrupted using GDC 0449 may be used in the method of the invention to determine the presence of a mutant SMO.

The invention provides a method for screening for compounds that bind to mutant SMO. Without being held to any particular mode of operation it is expected that much in the way that GDC 0449 binds wild type SMO and doesn t bind mutant SMO a compound which acts as an inhibitor of mutant SMO would dind mutant SMO in the same region within the carboxy terminal portion of the transmembrane domain NO. 6 TM6 . Thus one may express this region of the mutant SMO protein and run binding assays using a library of compounds by any means known in the art. Also one may use a smaller library of compounds represented by variations of GDC 0449 using a modeling approach based on potential contact points of GDC 0449 and then modeling similar contact points for mutant SMO and variations of GDC 0449. Such modeling programs and algorithms may be any that are known in the art. Compounds that bind mutant SMO and wild type SMO may be identified that are inhibitors of both wild type and mutant SMO. Alternatively compounds may be discovered that bind to mutant SMO but which do not bind to wild type SMo and therefore are inhibitors only for mutant SMO.

In one embodiment the compounds to be screened are small molecule compounds such as variants of GDC 0449. In other embodiments the compounds that bind mutant SMO are antibodies that specifically recognize an epitope that is in the same region as the binding site of GDC 0449 to wild type SMO. In one embodiment the antibody binds to a region in the carboxy terminal portion of TM6 of mutant SMO and inhibits mutant SMO activity.

Compounds may alternatively or additionally be screened for their ability to inhibit mutant SMO activity. In these embodiments one may assess the ability of these compounds to inhibit hedgehog signaling in cells expressing mutant SMO. These assays may be performed in cells that have a hedgehog signaling pathway intact but which express a recombinant SMO bearing the mutation in place of or in addition to wild type SMO. In these assays one determines the ability of the cell to have active hedgehog signaling when incubated with hedgehog in the presence or ansence of the candidate inhibitor. If hedgehog signaling is inhibited in the presence of the candidate compound such compound is a hedgehog inhibitor. In some embodiments the cells express both wild type and mutant SMO and are incubated with GDC 0449 and a candidiate inhibitor. In other embodiments the cells express only mutant SMo and may be incubated with Hh and the candidate inhibitor alone i.e. in the absence of GDC 0449 . The compound is an inhibitor of mutant SMO if Hh signaling is reduced or inhibited in such cells.

The invention provides methods of treating a patient in having a hedgehog signaling dependent tumor that is resistant to chemotherapeutic compounds such as GDC 0449 with a compound that binds a mutant SMO.

An antibody of the invention may be used in for example in vitro ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic methods. In one aspect the invention provides methods for treating cancer inhibiting unwanted cellular proliferation inhibiting metastasis of cancer and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells either in vivo or in vitro the method comprising exposing a cell to an antibody of the invention under conditions permissive for binding of the antibody to mutant SMO. In certain embodiments the cell is a myelogenous leukemia cell a lung cancer cell a gastric cancer cell a breast cancer cell a prostate cancer cell a renal cell cancer cell and a glioblastoma cell. In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting an activity of mutant SMO the method comprising exposing mutant SMO to an antibody of the invention such that the activity of mutant SMO is inhibited.

In one aspect the invention provides methods for treating cancer comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of an antibody of the invention. In certain embodiments a method for treating cancer comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an antibody of the invention and optionally at least one additional therapeutic agent such as those provided below.

Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance an antibody of the invention may be co administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent and or adjuvant. In certain embodiments an additional therapeutic agent is an anti VEGF antibody.

Such combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations and separate administration in which case administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to simultaneously and or following administration of the additional therapeutic agent and or adjuvant. Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.

In one embodiment an antibody of the invention is used in a method for binding mutant SMO in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased mutant SMO expression and or activity the method comprising administering to the individual the antibody such that mutant SMO in the individual is bound. In one embodiment the mutant SMO is human mutant SMO and the individual is human.

An antibody of the invention and any additional therapeutic agent or adjuvant can be administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

The location of the binding target of an antibody of the invention may be taken into consideration in preparation and administration of the antibody. When the binding target is an intracellular molecule certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to be introduced into the cell where the binding target is located. In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be expressed intracellularly as an intrabody. The term intrabody as used herein refers to an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof that is expressed intracellularly and that is capable of selectively binding to a target molecule as described e.g. in Marasco 4 11 15 1997 Kontermann 34 163 170 2004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 004 940 and 6 329 173 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0104402 and PCT Publication No. WO2003 077945. See also for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

Intracellular expression of an intrabody may be effected by introducing a nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody or antigen binding portion thereof lacking the wild type leader sequence and secretory signals normally associated with the gene encoding that antibody or antigen binding fragment into a target cell. One or more nucleic acids encoding all or a portion of an antibody of the invention can be delivered to a target cell such that one or more intrabodies are expressed which are capable of binding to an intracellular target polypeptide and modulating the activity of the target polypeptide. Any standard method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell may be used including but not limited to microinjection ballistic injection electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation liposomes and transfection with retroviral adenoviral adeno associated viral and vaccinia vectors carrying the nucleic acid of interest.

In certain embodiments nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector may be introduced into a patient s cells by in vivo and ex vivo methods. In one example of in vivo delivery nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient e.g. at the site where therapeutic intervention is required. In a further example of in vivo delivery nucleic acid is introduced into a cell using transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . For review of certain gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 and WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein. In an example of ex vivo treatment a patient s cells are removed nucleic acid is introduced into those isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of a nucleic acid is a retroviral vector.

In another embodiment internalizing antibodies are provided. Antibodies can possess certain characteristics that enhance delivery of antibodies into cells or can be modified to possess such characteristics. Techniques for achieving this are known in the art. For example cationization of an antibody is known to facilitate its uptake into cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 019 . Lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the target protein may be advantageous. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. 90 7889 7893 1993 .

Entry of antibodies into target cells can be enhanced by other methods known in the art. For example certain sequences such as those derived from HIV Tat or the Antennapedia homeodomain protein are able to direct efficient uptake of heterologous proteins across cell membranes. See e.g. Chen et al. 1999 96 4325 4329.

When the binding target of an antibody is located in the brain certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody to traverse the blood brain barrier. Several art known approaches exist for transporting molecules across the blood brain barrier including but not limited to physical methods lipid based methods stem cell based methods and receptor and channel based methods.

Physical methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to circumventing the blood brain barrier entirely or by creating openings in the blood brain barrier. Circumvention methods include but are not limited to direct injection into the brain see e.g. Papanastassiou et al. 9 398 406 2002 interstitial infusion convection enhanced delivery see e.g. Bobo et al. 91 2076 2080 1994 and implanting a delivery device in the brain see e.g. Gill et al. 9 589 595 2003 and Gliadel Wafers Guildford Pharmaceutical . Methods of creating openings in the barrier include but are not limited to ultrasound see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002 0038086 osmotic pressure e.g. by administration of hypertonic mannitol Neuwelt E. A. Brain Barrier and its Manipulation Vols 1 2 Plenum Press New York 1989 permeabilization by e.g. bradykinin or permeabilizer A 7 see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 112 596 5 268 164 5 506 206 and 5 686 416 and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003 0083299 .

Lipid based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to encapsulating the antibody in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313 and coating the antibody in low density lipoprotein particles see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354 or apolipoprotein E see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692 .

Stem cell based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier entail genetically engineering neural progenitor cells NPCs to express the antibody of interest and then implanting the stem cells into the brain of the individual to be treated. See Behrstock et al. 2005 15 Dec. 2005 advanced online publication reporting that NPCs genetically engineered to express the neurotrophic factor GDNF reduced symptoms of Parkinson disease when implanted into the brains of rodent and primate models .

Receptor and channel based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002 0065259 2003 0162695 and 2005 0124533 activating potassium channels see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0089473 inhibiting ABC drug transporters see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0073713 coating antibodies with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0129186 and cationizing the antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 004 697 .

Antibodies of the invention would be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages described herein or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically clinically determined to be appropriate.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty or e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

It is understood that any of the above therapeutic methods may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti mutant SMO antibody.

Among the small molecule compounds that may be used to treat GDC 0449 resistant tumors due to a mutation in smoothened at amino acid position 518 are the following 

The small molecule is provided in an effective amount to inhibit mutant SMO activity without causing untoward effects on the subject to whom the compound is administered. The compound may be administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration.

It has recently been demonstrated that treatment of a medulloblastoma patient harboring widespread metastatic disease with the novel Hh pathway inhibitor GDC 0449 resulted in a dramatic and rapid response to treatment Charles M. Rudin et al. 2009 361 1173 1178 . GDC 0449 targets the G protein coupled like receptor Smoothened SMO which becomes activated following loss of PTCH1 Charles M. Rudin et al. 2009 361 1173 1178 Molckovsky A. and L. L. Siu 2008 1 20 .

Molecular profiling of this medulloblastoma patient s primary and metastatic tumor taken prior to treatment with GDC 0449 revealed an underlying somatic mutation in PTCH1 PTCH1 W844C as well as upregulated expression of Hh pathway target genes supporting the hypothesis that the tumor was driven by dysregulated Hh signaling C. M. Rudin et al. 2009 361 1173 1178 . The PTCH1 W844C mutation was not capable of suppressing SMO activity in a Hh responsive GLI luciferase reporter cell line C3H10T fibroblasts when co transfected together with wild type WT SMO indicating that this specific mutation can inhibit the ability of PTCH1 to repress SMO and thus lead to aberrant ligand independent activation of the Hh pathway. Despite the marked tumor shrinkage initially observed in this patient PET scans taken 3 months following initiation of treatment indicated disease progression. A fine needle aspirate of a progressing lesion was obtained for confirmation of disease recurrence and for subsequent molecular profiling to explore mechanisms of acquired resistance to GDC 0449. Sequencing of PTCH1 confirmed the presence of the previously detected homozygous PTCH1 W844C mutation accompanied by loss of heterozygosity.

To characterize the mechanism of relapse in the present application we evaluated the status of known components of the Hh pathway including SMO the direct target of GDC 0449.

Reagents and constructs. KAAD Cyclopamine was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. cat. K171000 . GDC 0449 was made at Genentech A. Molckovsky and L. L. Siu 2008 1 20 . All Hh inhibitors were stored as 30 mM stocks in 100 DMSO Sigma at 20 C. Human SMO human PTCH1 transcript variant 1b GenBank NM 000264.3 and eGFP were cloned into pRK5 BD Biosciences and expressed from the CMV promoter. Point mutations were introduced with the QuikChange II Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene Cat. 200524 and a FLAG tag was introduced at the carboxy termini of wild type and mutant human SMO by PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity from Invitrogen Cat. 11304 011 Murone et al. 1999 9 76 84 previously described the Hh luciferase reporter Gli BS and the Renilla transfection control plasmid pRL TK are from Promega Cat. E2241 . All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Data were either displayed as raw counts or were normalized to SMO WT after subtraction of background values obtained from untransfected cells .

FACS analysis of SMO mutants. FACS analysis to determine the cell surface expression of SMO mutants was performed as previously described. The percent SMO positive cells were normalized to SMO WT controls.

E518 is important for SMO inhibition by GDC 0449. We previously reported two mutations of a conserved aspartic acid residue in SMO that interfere with GDC 0449 binding and its ability to suppress tumor growth without dramatically altering the signaling activity of this protein Yauch R. L et al. 2009 326 572 574 . We used an alanine scan mutagenesis approach to identify additional residues in SMO critical for GDC 0449 binding . Assuming that GDC 0449 binds SMO in a manner reminiscent of GPCRs binding to their ligands we mutated regions known to be important for such interactions Rosenbaum D. M. et al. 2009 459 356 363 . These include transmembrane helices TM 3 TM5 TM6 and TM7 as well as adjacent amino acids in the extracellular loops. The entire 3rd extracellular loop of SMO was also included in our screen as it contains D473 at its start. We analyzed a total of 102 SMO mutants using loss of drug binding as a primary readout data not shown . Most of the 21 new SMO mutants found to be deficient in GDC 0449 binding were inactive and or not expressed at the cell surface. SMO E518A showed significant signaling activity despite the presence of 1 M GDC 0449 and proved to be partially resistant to GDC 0449 data not shown . We then introduced a more drastic amino acid substitution that reverses the charge at this position and which can be achieved through a single nucleotide change. This SMO E518K mutant has activity comparable to SMO WT yet is completely resistant to GDC 0449 up to 1 M data not shown . Thus we have identified E518 as a prospective novel mutation site in SMO that can confer resistance to GDC 0449.

A screen of chemically diverse HPIs identified several SMOE518K antagonists. To identify SMO mutant inhibitors as potential therapeutics for GDC 0449 resistant tumors we screened a panel of 53 antagonists representative compounds are shown in with potent activity against the wild type protein . These compounds were either identified in high throughput screens both in house and by others or were generated by hit to lead optimization of screening hits using traditional medicinal chemistry methods. C3H10T cells were co transfected with wild type or mutant SMO expression vectors together with a Gli luciferase reporter construct Murone M. et al. 1999 9 2 76 84 and pathway activation was measured in the presence or absence of 1 M compound. Interestingly the benzimidazole HhAntag Romer J. T. et al. 2004 6 229 240 was essentially equipotent against all SMO alleles despite several structural similarities with GDC 0449 indicating subtle differences in structure activity relationship SAR between these two compounds. Various C ring amide derivatives of GDC 0449 displayed weak potency against SMOD473H as exemplified by compound 1 refer to for A B and C ring nomenclature . By contrast many C ring amide derivatives of HhAntag retained potency data not shown demonstrating that the benzimidazole A ring found in HhAntag is superior to the 2 pyridyl A ring found in GDC 0449 at inhibiting this SMO mutant. Looking at other A ring substitutions quinazolines represented by compound 2 were found to be inactive while the bis amide compound 3 showed measurable activity despite having an identical C ring to GDC 0449. This general class of bis amides showed improved potencies against SMO D473H once the optimal substitution pattern was found exemplified by compounds 4 and 5. Although the C ring clearly contributes to inhibition of SMO D473H our SAR observations imply that A ring substitutions can improve potency most dramatically. Specifically an A ring with both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor as found in the benzimidazole HhAntag and the bis amide compounds 3 5 is preferred when binding to SMO D473H relative to a hydrogen bond acceptor alone. Conversely efficient inhibition of SMO E518K can be accomplished by replacing the C ring of GDC 0449 as compound 1 displays robust potency against this mutant. Furthermore SMO E518K is completely resistant to the natural plant alkaloid cyclopamine yet sensitive to the hyrazinoimine SANT 1 Chen J. K et al. 2002 99 14071 14076 while SMO D473H is partially resistant to both compounds corroborating the finding that there are different requirements for the inhibition of these two GDC 0449 resistant mutants. Although we routinely use HhAntag as a tool compound to block Hh signaling in mice this inhibitor is rapidly metabolized by human hepatocytes and is therefore not suitable as a therapeutic agent SEG unpublished observation . As our objective was to identify a SMO antagonist that might be capable of overcoming acquired GDC 0449 resistance in the clinic we focused our efforts on the bis amide class of inhibitors. Only three out of fourteen drug candidates from this group exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties in mice data not shown .
