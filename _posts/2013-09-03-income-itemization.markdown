This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 180 646 filed Jul. 28 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 527 376 and is also related by subject matter to that disclosed in the following commonly assigned applications the entirety of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 180 610 filed Jul. 28 2008 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 180 623 filed Jul. 28 2008 and each entitled Income itemization. 

An income tax is a tax levied on the financial income of persons corporations or other legal entities. The rates for different types of income such as personal earnings wages capital gains and business income may vary and some may not be taxed at all. In addition to United States federal income tax income tax may also be levied by individual states. The rates of state income tax vary from state to state. Not all states levy an income tax. In addition some states allow cities and or counties to impose income taxes above and beyond the federal and state income taxes. Some cities collect income tax on not only residents but non residents employed in the city. This tax can even be incurred when a non resident works temporarily in the city.

Many people receive payment of at least a portion of their income by direct deposit. Direct deposit is a banking term that refers to a system used to transfer money such as the Automated Clearing House ACH . ACH is the name of an electronic network for financial transactions in the United States. Payment into an account by direct deposit contains information pertaining to the amount of the deposit and the identification of the entity that made the deposit into the account i.e. the payor . Income payments received by direct deposit may incur a state city and or county income tax. Determining whether an income payment is subject to such income tax is burdensome complex and time consuming.

Information may be provided with a direct deposit a deposited check or other negotiable instrument and may be used to determine state city county and or other local income tax liability of a user. This information may be used by a financial institution to provide income itemization and income tax liability information to the user via a user computing device.

In an implementation based on information associated with the deposit the financial institution may determine where the user performed the work that triggered the income payment where the income payment took place what type of work is associated with the income payment etc.

In an implementation the user may revise the income itemization and income tax liability information or the data or rules underlying the income itemization and income tax liability information.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The financial institutions and each may be any type of entity capable of processing a transaction involving a negotiable instrument. For example financial institutions and may be a retail bank an investment bank an investment company a regional branch of the Federal Reserve a clearinghouse bank and or a correspondent bank. A negotiable instrument typically includes a type of contract that obligates one party to pay a specified sum of money to another party. Negotiable instruments may include a check a draft a bill of exchange a promissory note and the like.

The user may be an individual who owns the account that may be held at financial institution . The account may be any type of account for depositing funds such as a savings account a checking account a brokerage account and the like. The user may communicate with financial institution by way of a communications network such as an intranet the Internet a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a public switched telephone network PSTN a cellular network a voice over Internet protocol VoIP network and the like. Additionally the user may communicate with financial institution by phone email instant messaging facsimile and the like. Financial institutions and also may communicate with each other by way of the communications network .

In an implementation the user may receive payment from another individual or entity such as the payor in the form of a direct deposit that is drawn from the account at the financial institution . The user may authorize the payor to perform a direct deposit into the account . It is noted that although examples described herein may refer to a direct deposit that corresponds to a check the techniques and systems described herein are contemplated for and may be used for deposit of any negotiable instrument.

A user computing device may be associated with the user . The user computing device may be any type of personal computer PC or handheld computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a mobile phone for example. As described further herein the user may receive data directed to income itemization and income tax liability at the user computing device . An example user computing device is described with respect to .

The financial institution may receive a direct deposit data file representing a direct deposit from the payor to the user and may use any known processing software or other application s to obtain data from the direct deposit data file that may be used for income itemization and income tax liability information. Based on the information in the direct deposit data file the financial institution may determine where the user performed the work that triggered the income payment of the direct deposit where the income payment took place e.g. location of the payor the account and or the financial institution what type of work is associated with the income payment etc. This information may be used by the financial institution to provide income itemization and income tax liability information to the user via the user computing device .

The financial institution may include any combination of systems and sub systems such as electronic devices including but not limited to computers servers databases or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors databases storage drives registers cache random access memory RAM chips data buses or the like and or software components such as operating systems database management applications or the like. According to an embodiment the electronic devices may include a network based server that may process the direct deposit and may provide income itemization and income tax liability information to the user .

Upon receipt and approval of the direct deposit data file the financial institution may credit the associated funds to the account . The financial institution may then settle the direct deposit by debiting funds from the account and crediting funds to the financial institution .

It will be appreciated that the preceding examples are for purposes of illustration and explanation only and that an embodiment is not limited to such examples. For example the account and the account may both be held at financial institution in which case the direct deposit may be cleared internally.

In an implementation a direct deposit such as a payroll payment or a payment from a customer may be made through the Automated Clearing House ACH system. In accordance with the rules and regulations of ACH no financial institution may simply issue an ACH transaction whether it be debit or credit towards an account without prior authorization from the user . An ACH entry starts with the user authorizing the payor to issue ACH debit or credit to an account. The payor can be a person or a company such as one s employer . Depending on the ACH transaction the payor receives written verbal or electronic authorization from the user .

Once authorization is acquired the payor creates an ACH entry to be given to an originating depository financial institution ODFI which can be any financial institution that does ACH origination. This ACH entry is then sent to an ACH operator usually the Federal Reserve System and is passed on to the receiving depository financial institution RDFI the financial institution from which the check is drawn e.g. the payor s financial institution . If the payor s financial institution verifies the transaction the ACH service provider may settle the transaction by debiting the payor s financial institution and crediting the user s financial institution . The payor s financial institution may then debit the payor s account .

A standard entry class SEC code is a three letter code that identifies the nature of the ACH entry. PPD is a code for Prearranged Payment and Deposits and may be used for payroll direct deposits as well as for other types of deposits to the account .

In addition to the amount of a deposit and an identification of the entity that made the deposit the direct deposit information may comprise data such as the location where the work that triggered the income payment associated with the direct deposit took place the location where the direct deposit originated the type of work that the direct deposit is payment for etc. The financial institution may use that information to determine income tax liability information regarding the direct deposit. At some point such as at the end of a quarter or year for example the financial institution may provide information pertaining to the user s income tax liabilities based on the deposit information. The financial institution may provide a summary of where the user worked and how much money the user made so the user may pay the appropriate income taxes for the states cities counties etc. where the user has an income tax liability based on the income received via direct deposit. This is useful for direct deposits made from various jurisdictions e.g. states cities counties etc. where the deposits might invoke income tax liabilities for that jurisdiction. Thus details of a paycheck may be exposed to the financial institution and categorized by the financial institution .

In an implementation direct deposit may be performed by ACH. ACH has an addenda record that has a free form field where 80 characters are available. The free form field and or other fields in the ACH may be used to store the data such as the location where the work that triggered the income payment associated with the direct deposit took place the location where the direct deposit originated the type of work that the direct deposit is payment for etc. Location data may include one or more zip codes. The payor may enter information in the free form field that may identify where the work took place such as city county state zip code etc. The payor may provide an indication as to the portions of the income that are associated with particular types of work and or locations associated with the work that is associated with the direct deposit.

At some point such as monthly quarterly or yearly for example the financial institution may generate an income itemization and provide it to the user e.g. via the user computing device . The income itemization may comprise a report that provides an indication of income the user earned over the year via direct deposit and where it was earned who the payor was and for what type of work it was for etc. Information pertaining to income taxes and or income tax liability in the various locations e.g. states cities counties etc. identified on the income itemization may be provided along with estimates of income taxes owed and links to one or more websites that may be helpful in determining and or paying income taxes for example.

In an implementation the financial institution may determine information for an income itemization from checks that are presented for deposit either physically or electronically. The financial institution may extract the account number and routing number from a check that is deposited by the user . The routing number is a nine digit number located on the bottom left hand corner of the check. A unique routing number is typically assigned to every financial institution in the United States. The account number and routing number information may be used to determine a location where the income was earned or the payor is located. Information pertaining to the location may be provided to the user . The user may modify the location information as desired and the financial institution may store any revisions. For checks received in the future having the same account number and or routing number the location information as revised by the user may be used. At some point an income itemization may be provided to the user listing the income from the deposited checks and the location that each deposit corresponds to.

In an implementation the institution system may receive direct deposits and other deposits e.g. electronic checks paper checks etc. extract data from them to determine information that may be used to determine the income tax liability information for the user and provide that information to the user . The institution system may use any known data extraction software or other application s to obtain the relevant data for the income itemization from the direct deposits and other deposits.

The user may interface with the institution system via the website that may display one or more pages of content to the user on the user computing device . A request for income itemization information may be received from the user at the institution system through any suitable means such as interaction with a web browser that is in communication with institution system . The actual mechanism of connection is outside the scope of the present discussion. The request may be processed by an income itemization engine .

The income itemization engine has access to data files and documents pertaining to the user as well as any other data files and documents that may be useful in generating an income itemization and information pertaining to income tax liabilities that are currently stored by the financial institution as well as external data files and documents.

The institution system has the ability to retrieve information from one or more internal data sources and one or more external data sources in an implementation via an internal data source access engine and an external data source access engine respectively. Data pertaining to the user income payors locations and or tax liabilities may be retrieved from internal data source s as well as external data source s . The retrieved data may be stored centrally perhaps in storage . Other information may be provided to the institution system from the user .

Internal data source s may contain data metadata email files and or documents that the institution system maintains pertaining to the user such as personal data such as name physical address email address etc. and financial data such as credit card numbers and checking account numbers. Such data may be useful for generating an income itemization and income tax liability information as described herein. External data source s may contain additional data and documents pertaining to the user such as additional personal data and documents and or financial data and documents which may be useful in generating an income itemization and income tax liability information. The institution system may access this information upon receipt of a direct deposit or other deposit and when generating an income itemization and tax liability information for the user .

External data source s may be associated with one or more entities that may be independent of each other. Each of the external data source s may be a computer system that maintains data and documents that are not maintained by the institution system . It is contemplated that any number of external data sources may be in communication with the institution system and may provide any type of data or document thereto.

The income itemization engine may comprise a deposit processor and a data extractor . The deposit processor may receive a direct deposit data file or data file pertaining to another deposit such as a paper check or electronic check and process the associated deposit. In this manner the account of the user may be properly credited with the deposit.

The data extractor may receive data from the deposit processor the user computing device and or data in the internal data source s and or the external data source s . The received data may be processed by the data extractor to extract information that may be used in an income itemization such as deposit amount payor and supplemental information such as a description of the work and information that may be used to determine the location where the work performed by the user took place that is associated with the income payment of the deposit or where the payor or payor s financial institution is located. After retrieving or otherwise receiving the information from the various sources the data extractor may use tools applications and aggregators for example to generate an income itemization and income tax liability information.

The user computing device may provide user access to a system which is coupled to the institution system and is configured to receive a plurality of requests at least one of which is a request for income itemization information. A system may be configured to format and transmit a graphical user interface to the user and through the graphical user interface provide the user the ability to interact with information that may be maintained requested and or provided by the institution system .

A user access system associated with the user computing device may be communicatively coupled to the income itemization engine and may be configured to send machine readable instructions to the income itemization engine . Those instructions may cause the income itemization engine to access one or more internal and one or more external data sources and respectively.

As mentioned above the institution system may provide a unified graphical presentation output. The unified graphical presentation may be transmitted to the user access system. In an implementation the unified graphical presentation is combined with other materials and transmitted to the user . In an implementation the unified graphical presentation is received by the user access system and transmitted directly to the user without the inclusion of any other materials.

The user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system through the use of any suitable interactive web technology provides an interactive experience to the user through which access to and maintenance of income itemization data income tax liability information and related data can be accomplished.
