No. 13 895 294 filed May 15 2013 entitled Recurring Revenue Management Benchmarking. The disclosure of each document identified in this paragraph is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The subject matter described herein relates to data processing and management and more particularly to processing and managing recurring revenue asset information for example in support of sales execution and opportunity management for recurring revenue streams and for generating a visual representation of recurring revenue management system data and predictions.

Innovations in products or marketing the introduction of new or improved products sales to new customers or additional sales to existing customers and other approaches to expanding the amount of market share controlled by a company or other commercial entity have historically been primary drivers for revenue growth. However as markets mature and consolidate a larger fraction of revenue realized by a commercial entity used herein to refer broadly to a company corporation organization person group of persons or the like that undertakes commercial activity including but not limited to sales of products and or services to customers may be derived from renewals of recurring revenue assets. As used herein a recurring revenue asset can generally refer to one or more of maintenance and or support agreements for software or hardware service covered products service contracts subscription agreements warranties renewables or the like.

Many commercial entities fail to maximize realization of revenue from recurring revenue assets at least in part because management of such assets is not well supported by currently available approaches. Currently available tools for managing recurring revenue are spread across customer relationship management CRM systems partner relationship management PRM systems data warehouses entitlement systems billing systems and even spreadsheets or the like. However recurring revenue management presents a number of challenges that differ in substantial and important ways from the typical focus of the sales staff of a commercial entity.

A typical sales process involves closing a sale or deal and moving on to a next customer. In contrast a recurring revenue relationship is by definition repetitive and is not efficiently tracked or managed by tools designed to support initial sales. In addition the commercial entity s existing investments in sales personnel sales processes and information systems are typically directed to and are optimized and supported with appropriate technology for achieving maximum revenue performance in the product or services sales business not the management of recurring revenue streams and the sales activities necessary to ensure that recurring revenue assets are maintained and even increased in value. Optimizing the recurring revenue such as service contracts and other service assets requires resolving challenges that span multiple areas of a company s operations. In today s ever changing market landscape service revenues have become integrally related to the success of a commercial entity. The problem however is that as commercial entities begin to recognize the need for this updated focus they run into a host of challenges for which they are not prepared.

For example a company often has to deal with fragmented data from disparate sources and this data can be inaccurate incomplete and sometimes duplicated particularly in a sales channel or when selling through the channel. Further in the case of a merger or acquisition various legacy systems lead to complexity. Another challenge is a lack of specialization toward service contracts or service renewals. Most company data is centered on the products it sells rather than the services contracted post sale of those products. A lack of industry focus on recurring service revenue has lead to a dearth of standard metrics and proven best practices.

Previously available approaches to recurring revenue management have not included a unified repository or even any other way of collecting and organizing these types of information that are important to optimizing recurring revenue sales that integrates data from multiple disparate external client systems in support of an asset data model capable of resolving the key questions of what e.g. services serviceable products etc. has been purchased who e.g. which commercial entity made the purchase or purchases who is the end user of the purchased services or serviceable products where are the purchased services or serviceable products being used how are the purchased services or serviceable products being used how satisfied is the end user and optionally others at the commercial entity with the purchased services or serviceable products where are other opportunities for sales of additional related or unrelated services to the commercial entity as a result of the sale of the purchased services or serviceable products and the like. Furthermore software systems to automate and optimize the recurring revenue market have generally been limited in regards to analytics specific and relevant to recurring revenue assets well developed key performance indicators KPIs for management of such assets the ability to acquire and aggregate the data streams and other useful features that support optimization of recurring revenue sales and renewals.

Additionally prior art approaches to recurring revenue asset management have generally lacked user interface features that provide the most relevant data or information to a user to assist in optimizing recurring revenue asset sales.

Consistent with one or more aspects of the current subject matter a recurring revenue repository can be maintained with recurring revenue information obtained from one or more external data sources as wells from ongoing sales activities e.g. user interaction and updating of the database . Some aspects of the current subject mater can include use of a recurring revenue asset data model generated from at least a portion of this recurring revenue information. The recurring revenue asset data model can represent relationships among recurring revenue assets and organizations previously sold products underlying the recurring revenue assets people and products associated with the recurring revenue assets and the underlying previously sold products and the like. A number of analytics and business intelligence processes can optionally be executed on the recurring revenue asset data model and on the recurring revenue information in the recurring revenue repository.

In some aspects of the current subject matter a method includes generating a user interface for an electronic display. The user interface includes a graphical representation of one or more recurring revenue assets the graphical representation representing each of the one or more recurring revenue assets according to one or more metrics that define each of the one or more recurring revenue assets. The method further includes calculating a predicted outcome for at least one of the one or more recurring revenue assets the calculating being from a predictive model that is based on aggregate historical information collected from one or more data sources. The method further includes generating for concurrent display in the user interface with the graphical representation of one or more recurring revenue assets a graphical representation of the predicted outcome according to one or more parameters related to the one or more metrics.

Implementations of the current subject matter can include but are not limited to systems and methods including one or more features as described herein as well as articles that comprise a tangibly embodied machine readable medium operable to cause one or more machines e.g. computers etc. to result in operations consistent with these features. Similarly computer systems are also described that may include one or more processors and one or more memories coupled to the one or more processors. A memory which can include a computer readable storage medium may include encode store or the like one or more programs that cause one or more processors to perform one or more of the operations described herein. Computer implemented methods consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter can be implemented by one or more data processors residing in a single computing system or multiple computing systems. Such multiple computing systems can be connected and can exchange data and or commands or other instructions or the like via one or more connections including but not limited to a connection over a network e.g. the Internet a wireless wide area network a local area network a wide area network a wired network or the like via a direct connection between one or more of the multiple computing systems etc.

The details of one or more variations of the subject matter described herein are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages of the subject matter described herein will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims. While certain features of the currently disclosed subject matter are described for illustrative purposes in relation to an enterprise resource software system or other business software solution or architecture it should be readily understood that such features are not intended to be limiting. The claims that follow this disclosure are intended to define the scope of the protected subject matter.

This document describes recurring revenue management systems and methods techniques etc. relating to operations and functionality in support of recurring revenue management. Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter a recurring revenue management system can include a recurring revenue assets repository that stores data relating to recurring revenue assets which are discussed in greater detail below. A unified data store model can be provided to manage both transactional and analytical uses of data. In some implementations of the current subject matter the use of dynamically generated and updated in memory data structures including but not limited to data cubes and the like can facilitate rich analytical exploration of data in near real time thereby allowing adaptation to customer specific dimensions and metrics. In some implementations of the current subject matter an analytics framework supports role specific dashboards and a plug in model with rich representational state transfer REST application programming interfaces APIs can be included to support use of third party ad hoc analytics products. Also consistent with implementations of the current subject matter data maintained in the recurring revenue management system can be organized according to an asset data model that includes data objects and defined or derived relationships between these data objects. The data objects can be representative of products sold by a commercial entity recurring revenue assets of that commercial entity opportunities for sale or renewal of new or existing recurring revenue assets and contacts related to one or more of the products recurring revenue assets opportunities and other contacts.

Referring again to the recurring revenue assets repository can include information about instances of covered assets e.g. products such as physical items or software licenses etc. that can be sold by a commercial entity to one or more customers of the commercial entity which are also referred to herein as covered assets that have been sold. These covered assets form the basis for recurring revenue assets because they constitute an existing instance of a seller purchaser relationship between the commercial entity and the customer who purchased the covered assets. The recurring revenue assets service assets themselves can include among other assets service contracts warranties maintenance agreements and the like sold by the commercial entity to the customer in association with or to provide an ongoing service arrangement for the covered assets.

Because it relates to an existing and ongoing relationship with the customer the information about products and their associated recurring revenue assets that is contained in the recurring revenue assets repository can be used to generate one or more opportunities for renewal of an existing recurring revenue asset to thereby maintain the recurring revenue stream and in some cases to increase the value of the recurring revenue asset for example by selling a higher value agreement service contract etc. to the customer . As used herein opportunities are groupings of offers targeted for execution of a sale to a customer and offers are individual instances of a recurring revenue asset available for renewal. The groupings of offers in an opportunity can include multiple offer instances for the same customer. In some examples the offers grouped into an opportunity can all have expiration dates during a sale period e.g. a month a quarter a year etc. . Opportunities can be collected in the opportunity repository .

Once acted upon by sales staff who make contact with appropriate decision makers at the customer opportunities can be moved into a quotation stage during which quotations related to renewals increases etc. of existing recurring revenue assets can be generated. Quotations which include a transaction offer for a set of offers included in an opportunity can be stored in the quotation repository . As a quotation is transitioned to a deal being closed a booking which refers to a set of offers accepted by a customer can be generated and stored in a bookings repository . Resolution of a booking results in generation of a new recurring revenue asset which can be retained in the recurring revenue asset repository for use in generating future offers and opportunities. For example when a resolved service contract or the like approaches its next expiration a new offer for renewal of that service contract can be generated and optionally grouped with other offers for the same customer with similarly timed expiration dates into a new opportunity. Additional data that impact the generation of opportunities and execution of those opportunities includes contact information for the decision makers and other important contacts e.g. individuals and companies involved in the sales process with whom sales staff need to communicate. This contact information can be stored in the contacts repository .

Efficient and structured assembly of the information contained in the repositories depicted in can be an important aspect of a recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. However much of this information is typically contained or at least originates in other data management systems referred to herein as external client systems than the recurring revenue management system as discussed in greater detail below in reference to . The term client is used herein to refer to a commercial entity that employs features or functions of a recurring revenue management system provided or supported by a recurring revenue management vendor or service provider. Effectively as used herein the client is a commercial entity that is a customer of the recurring revenue management vendor or service provider. The client commercial entity in turn has customers to whom the client has sold and or wishes to sell or renew recurring revenue assets such as those described elsewhere herein. A customer of a client commercial entity typically has an installed base of products for which the customer can purchase various service agreements contracts etc. In effect the products in the installed base of products can be considered as covered assets for which the commercial entity can sell to the customer one or more service contracts agreements etc. From the perspective of the client commercial entity these service contracts agreements etc. can be considered to be service assets or recurring revenue assets.

A recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can be configurable for the storage retrieval searching and analysis of a wide range of recurring revenue information. Data relating to service assets or other recurring revenue assets referred to herein as recurring revenue data can include information pertaining to what a commercial entity has sold such as for example services products for which related services can be sold etc. e.g. the covered assets . Recurring revenue data can also include information about the purchasers users locations of use modes of use etc. of such services serviceable products etc. In other words the recurring revenue data can include information about what recurring revenue assets an entity has who the customers and users of the recurring revenue assets are and where and how the recurring revenue assets are being used. Recurring revenue data can further include metrics relating to satisfaction of the customer or user of the recurring revenue asset as well as information relating to potential opportunities for services contract sales e.g. for serviceable products soon to come off warranty etc. and the like.

The recurring revenue management system can import diverse information and of various formats from external client systems into a common asset data model. The asset data model can facilitate a wide range of recurring revenue management capabilities and can provide automated assistance for entity resolution resolving external entities to pre existing entities in the system . The recurring revenue management system can also optionally maintain provenance information for all information loaded into the system e.g. all recurring revenue data from each of the one or more data sources to be able to discern information origin.

As noted above in reference to a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can receive and assign a usable structure to information obtained from a variety of external clients systems . shows a diagram illustrating potential sources of data or other information that can be acquired by or received at a recurring revenue management system . Among other possible data sources the external client systems referenced in can include one or more of an entitlement system an order management system a pricing system a product master database a sales force automation system a customer master database a contract management system user adoption and usage data sources a customer service database and the like. It will be understood that the individual external client systems shown in can in some implementations of the current subject matter be provided by one or more systems that support features of more than one such external client system . For example external client systems can include customer relationship management CRM systems enterprise resource planning ERP systems business intelligence BI systems calendar and contact systems or databases customer service systems inventory systems accounts receivable systems sources of customer usage and engagement information and the like. In general a commercial entity acquires these various systems databases and the like from more than one different software or computing system provider each of which typically uses distinct or proprietary database structures data formats report configurations application programming interfaces APIs and the like that are optimized for the specific tasks to be performed by its product. Assembly of information from a group of data sources with multiple potentially disparate database structures and data formats can present a challenge for any system that seeks to collect such information present it in a usable format support detailed analytics based on the data etc. Further challenges can be presented by the need to authenticate potentially conflicting information received from more than one source. Additionally information collected in a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter is typically not static. Rather users interacting with the system are likely to update or correct the information based on communications with contacts etc. Execution of tasks depicted in can also alter the correct version of some of the information received into the recurring revenue management system.

An approach to this problem typically involves receipt of the data at the recipient system from a source system creation of customized mappings or application of pre created mappings between data structures of each source system and the data structures of the recipient system and transformation of the data from the source system data structures to the recipient system data structures according to the mappings. Subsequent to import of data from the data sources but prior to making the imported data available for productive use by end users at the recipient system one or more quality control operations generally occur to ensure consistency of the imported data to identify duplicate and potentially conflicting records and to alert one or more users with appropriate permissions levels to the presence of any errors partial imports missing data or the like. For export of data from the recipient system back to the source system a similar process can be undertaken with the mapping being performed in reverse.

For an active recurring revenue management system particularly one supporting recurring revenue asset management for a large commercial entity with a sizable sales staff a large number of recurring revenue assets and a complicated information landscape in which multiple systems maintain data records relevant to support of recurring revenue management activities a quality control process that interrupts productive use of the system subsequent to a data import is not desirable. For example in a large enterprise with multiple data streams quality control could be quite time consuming. Additionally in the interest of having the most current information available for use by the recurring revenue management system frequent data imports can be advantageous. However if each such import were to require substantial downtime for the import and transformation processes to complete and quality assurance routines to execute usability of features supported by the recurring revenue management system would be negatively impacted.

A recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can include synchronization and integration of data with a variety of disparate external client systems. For example a recurring revenue management system can access data records and formatted data from systems such as entitlement systems order management systems customer master systems product master systems and service delivery systems. The data from these external client systems is usually not static. Accordingly it is advantageous for the recurring revenue management system to be able to receive data feeds from such systems at a high throughput rate. Furthermore the received data is usable either upon receipt at the recurring revenue management system or at least within a very short processing time.

Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter a recurring revenue management system and an included asset data model can include product data objects recurring revenue asset data objects opportunity data objects and contact data objects . Product data objects represent products e.g. covered assets which as noted above in reference to can include items sold to customers and can be considered as part of the customer s installed base of covered assets. A framework of data objects can include a set of common relationships related to recurring revenue management these relationships can include product relationships asset relationships opportunity relationships and contact relationships . Products can provide the basis for a recurring revenue assets represented by instances of asset data objects via one or more product relationships between a product represented by a product data object and the instances of an asset data object representing the recurring revenue asset or assets. Product relationships can also optionally exist between product represented by a product data object and one or more of recurring revenue assets represented by instances of asset data objects opportunities represented by instances of opportunity data objects contacts represented by instances of contact objects other products represented by other instances of a product data object etc.

Further with reference to asset relationships can exist between a recurring revenue asset represented by an instance of an asset data object and one or more of a product represented by an instance of a product data object a contact represented by an instance of a contact data object e.g. a person organization etc. relevant to a recurring revenue asset an opportunity represented by an instance of an opportunity data object e.g. a bundle of offers relating to renewal of existing recurring revenue streams and or to establishment of new or increased value recurring revenue streams another recurring revenue asset represented by another instance of an asset data object etc.

Opportunity relationships can exist between an opportunity represented by an instance of an opportunity data object and one or more of a specific recurring revenue asset represented by an instance of an asset data objects a product represented by an instance of a product data object underlying the recurring revenue asset s a contact represented by another instance of a contact data objects another opportunity represented an instance of an opportunity data object etc. Contact relationships can exist between a contact represented by an instance of a contact data object and one or more of a recurring revenue asset represented by an instance of an asset data object for example based on communications relating to an initial sale of a recurring revenue asset and or to one or more renewals of the recurring revenue asset a product represented by an instance of a product data object underlying the recurring revenue asset s an opportunity represented by an instance of an opportunity data object another contact represented by another instance of a contact data object etc.

The data objects discussed above can optionally also be extendible for example through customer specific extensions fields. Additional custom objects can be added to a customer s configuration. In addition the set of base relationships can be extended to match specific requirements of the commercial entity using the recurring revenue management system . Relationships between an instance of the product data object the asset data object the opportunity data object and the contact data object can be established based on one or more of the data received from the incoming data streams existing data in the recurring revenue management system user input and the like. The instances of the data objects and the defined relationships between these instances together make up the asset data model .

An asset data model such as that described herein can provide a useful vehicle for exploring and understanding relationships that exist among product objects asset objects organization objects contact objects and opportunity objects. Many of these relationships are directly derived from information that exists in source client systems while others require inference on the part of the system others are generated by the system as part of object generation others are created as a side effect of system actions and still others are constructed as a result of actions by system users. In an illustrative but not limiting example of an inference approach to generation of the relationships between objects a relationship inference includes exploitation of transitivity e.g. if a relates to b and b relates to c a relationship can be instantiated between a to c and an automated instantiation of inverse relationships if a relates to b then there exists an inverse relationship from b to a .

A consistent approach to managing opportunities quotes and bookings activities can be provided through one or more features supported by an asset data model consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. Such features can include but are not limited to detailed reports pipeline dashboards opportunity details territory management and the like. Detailed reports allow sales representatives to proactively identify and address at risk opportunities while pipeline dashboards allow managers to view pacing of sales activities by time period and production metrics. Opportunity details can allow viewing of deal progress and logged activities by sales representative sales operations assistants managers and other staff. Territory management allows managers to manage and drive sales representatives behavior by assigning tasks to opportunities based on existing priorities. Territory can refer to divisions of available opportunities based on one or more factors which can include but are not limited to geography customer groupings subject matter etc.

Through the asset data model a clearer view can be presented to users e.g. sales staff sales support staff managers executives etc. of the installed base of products services etc. that have been previously sold to customers of the commercial entity and that provide the foundation for new and renewal sales of recurring revenue assets. As discussed elsewhere herein the clearer view can be presented to users via one or more user interface displays computer generated interfaces or the like. Management of this installed base using an asset data model can improve accuracy and insight into the customer base and enable leveraging of this installed base data to maximize recurring revenue streams. Increased sales can be achieved through improved quote accuracy consolidation identification of cross sell and up sell opportunities better handling of renewal contacts and processes and the like. Service delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction can be increased through improved entitlement shipping and staffing resource planning. Prediction of customer behavior can also improve which can facilitate optimization of sales staff activities.

Among other information that can be received in the inbound data streams and incorporated into appropriate instances of data objects in the asset data model the asset data model can store and organize expiration information for existing recurring revenue assets product information e.g. characterizations of the install base including who what where etc. information relationships e.g. predecessors successors associated opportunities covered products customers partners locations etc. expected value analyses e.g. projected future revenue product margin analyses etc. and the like.

A recurring revenue management system including one or more features as described herein can provide a scenario based revenue projection from the recurring revenue repository of service asset data and other recurring revenue data. In some implementations the recurring revenue management system generates a user interface to display a projection of revenue over time from a set of assets based on expiration dates product information projected sales timing and projected sales effectiveness.

A recurring revenue management system including one or more features as described herein can also receive input from a user to define patterns that when applied to data of the recurring revenue repository yield one or more sets of opportunities generated for sales execution. Logic of the recurring revenue management system includes an application that executes one or more methodologies to identify different classes of opportunities e.g. renewal cross sell up sell etc. as well as optimizing offer grouping within opportunities to improve sales productivity. The recurring revenue management system can encode and automate computer based processing for automated guidance of team based selling of services recurring revenue sales .

In various aspects consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter recurring revenue sales execution can be supported by one or more of an opportunity generation and handling approach forecasting and targeting approach a sales stage management approach an integrated sales operations approach a channel partner management approach and sales automation approaches. In other aspects one or more sales operations functions such as for example quote processing bookings processing and data services can also be provided. Various operations in support of such features can optionally be based at least in part on use of an asset data model of a recurring revenue management system as discussed above. It will be understood that while the approaches described herein make reference to various features and functions of an asset data model the use of such a model is not mandatory unless otherwise so stated. The following description and the accompanying figures relate to various advantageous use features related to these aspects as well as technical features via which such use features can be provided.

Upon a sales representative making a successful contact with a buyer or other decision maker at the customer and upon identifying a desire on the part of the buyer or decision maker to explore renewing of the service asset the sales representative can request a quote and this can be logged into the recurring revenue management system . A quotation record can be generated and forwarded to a sales operations team member . When the sales operation team member completes the quotation and optionally logs this into the recurring revenue management system the recurring revenue management system can notify the sales representative that the generated quote can be sent to the buyer. In optional variations the recurring revenue management system can automatically detect when a quotation has been completed and can provide the notification to the sales representative that this has occurred.

The sales representative can deliver the quotation to the buyer or other decision maker and this delivery event can also be recorded by the recurring revenue management system as further tracking of the sales process. When the sales representative logs into the recurring revenue management system that a purchase order has been received the sales process state can be updated accordingly . The recurring revenue management system then generates a booking record . When the sales operation team member records that the sale has been completed the sales phase will move to closed sale. A next generation service asset can be generated for example with another instance of an opportunity object that has a relationship to the instance of the product object associated with the covered asset . This next generation service asset provides a starting point for a next offer to renew the service asset as the next generation service asset approaches its expiration date.

The asset data model can also support real time or at least nearly or approximately real time reporting and interpretation of service assets installed base total asset value projected revenue and data quality as well as subscriptions planning e.g. evaluating categorizing and prioritizing subscriptions to drive sales programs opportunity generation e.g. creating opportunities based on installed base or subscription planning outcomes. In this manner the asset data model can be used in generation of offers and opportunities for example based on inter data object relationships and information that can be included in or derived from the asset data model . This additional information can include but is not limited to exclusion rules expiration window filters product customer or region filters target selling periods upsell and cross sell opportunities upgrade requirements expected outcome analysis and the like.

An approach to opportunity generation and handling consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can be better understood in reference to . At any particular time a user or an automated process can select a filtered set of service assets to be used as a source population for opportunity generation. Typically this filter can include a range for the expiration dates of the service contracts that corresponds to a targeted selling period e.g. a time period in which new contract or renewal sales are expected to close . The expiration date range can typically include dates corresponding to one of expiration dates before the selling period expired or carryover contracts expiration dates during the selling period in period and expiration dates after the selling period futures . Opportunity generation can be an automated process that operates on a selected set of service assets. An example of an opportunity generation approach can be better understood by reference to the process flow chart which illustrates features of a method consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter.

At the filtered set of service assets discussed above is selected. In various implementations of the current subject matter the selecting of the filtered set of service assets can occur automatically for example via a computing system applying one of the filters discussed above to an asset data model that includes a collection of data objects including asset data objects associated with service assets providing recurring revenue streams to a commercial entity. At a new service offer based on one or more specific rules defined for the commercial entity is created for service assets in the selected set. The creating can optionally include applying one or more offer creation parameters. A non limiting example of an offer creation parameter includes a type of renewal to be offered e.g. a like for like service which can also be referred to as a renewal par an upgrade in service etc. . The creating can also include looking up or otherwise determining an appropriate renewal stock keeping unit SKU or other reference information for an expiring asset and a chosen service level looking up or otherwise determining a price for new a new SKU or other reference information for a renewal of the expiring asset copying relevant information from the expiring service asset e.g. contact information etc. and the like. The relevant information can in some implementations be stored in an asset data object associated with the expiring service asset or in a contact data object having a relationship with the asset data object associated with the expiring service asset or the like. The copying can include transferring the data from an asset data object associated with the expiring service asset to a new asset data object associated with the new service asset generated by a renewal establishing a relationship between a contact data object having a relationship with the new asset data object associated with the new service asset generated by the renewal or the like.

At the set of created offers can optionally be grouped into two or more smaller sets of opportunities. The grouping of offers into smaller sets of opportunities can be performed to optimize sales efficiency. The grouping can in some examples involve associating offers for a same target customer a same reseller organization or the like. In additional or alternative variations grouping can be based on other considerations such as for example a same or related product type etc. At the offers either as sets of opportunities or individually can be assigned to one or more sales teams. The assigning can be based on data contained within the opportunity for example in an opportunity data object associated with the opportunity. In further implementations of the current subject matter opportunity generation can optionally include more complex logic to automatically add appropriate add on services to the offers or to create offers corresponding to cross sell opportunities.

Implementations of a recurring revenue management system include user interface features implemented in an electronic graphical display that provide the most relevant data or information to a user to assist in optimizing recurring revenue asset sales. In one example the user interface can include a graphical feature that highlights or otherwise draws a user s attention to one or more opportunities groups of opportunities values of one or more metrics or the like based on predictive analysis. The user interface features provide real time analytics comparative benchmarking to management generated goals or to predictive outcomes and customizable forecasting based on the dynamic selection of one or more metrics or definition of one or more parameters related to a recurring revenue asset. The user interface generated by the recurring revenue management system can be customized for any type of electronic display device or dimensions and capabilities thereof.

In some implementations a recurring revenue management system is configured for generating graphical representations of individual recurring revenue assets based on data attributes associated with those assets. The system is further configured for generating graphical representations of sets of recurring revenue assets that can be filtered or ordered based on data attributes associated with those assets. In some implementations a recurring revenue management system is configured for generating graphical representations of information about sets of recurring revenue assets where the sets can be defined by filters on asset data attributes and the information is defined by one or more metrics that are defined by aggregate functions on attributes of recurring revenue assets in the set and one or more attributes used as dimensions for metric grouping. The system can calculate predictive metrics or dimensions for recurring revenue assets based on aggregate historical information collected from one or more data sources.

In one implementation renewal sales opportunities can be displayed concurrently with one or more predictions generated from one or more predictive models. Each of the one or more predictive models can be based on any number of metrics and can function with additional capabilities beyond a simple ad hoc query tool. For example intelligent sorting of the opportunities presented in the list of opportunities can highlight probable outcomes and the like. The metrics that are displayed concurrently with the list of opportunities can be dynamically selected and changed for display in the user interface to support the ability of a user to gain rapid insight into the sales activities or changes in sales activities that may be most useful in improving sales performance.

Implementations of the current subject matter can display a number of additional data sources or results derived from data sources that are highly relevant to recurring revenue asset sales success. For example a days in advance DIA metric historically based metrics and other metrics etc. can be displayed in combination with sales renewal opportunities. The DIA metric is related to a time period before expiration of a currently active service asset. The time period is preferably expressed in terms of days but may also be expressed in terms of other time intervals such as weeks months quarters or any other time periods. The DIA metric can be used in predictive models to estimate an optimal timing relative to expiration of an existing service asset to determine a time period in which contact with a customer is most likely to yield success in the recurring revenue asset sale.

In some implementations a user interface can display information that both characterizes one or more sales opportunities and characterizes one or more metrics that can be used in predicting the likelihood of a favorable outcome of any of the one or more sales opportunities. For example the user interface can display a list that includes multiple two or more opportunities that are presented with ranking capabilities. The ranking capabilities can include rankings based on criteria such as distance from the expiration date or the like.

Additional features of implementations of the current subject matter include the ability to query and or sort a list of opportunities based on one or more metrics that are used in a predictive model. For example these metrics can include a length of time from first contact a length of time for first quoting of an opportunity relative to a close date a number of revised quotes delivered to a customer before closing a meantime to complete a quote request and the like.

A predictive model can also include the ability to diagnose problems that a sales organization an individual salesperson or any other individual or group of individuals may be experiencing that lead to less than optimal sales performance. A desired output of a predictive model can include a probability of a successful close of a renewal sales offer at any given time and or at any given current value compared with one or more metrics used in the predictive model.

Some implementations of the current subject matter can support understanding the distribution of expiring assets over time for example as part of long range planning of potential future revenue. This functionality need not involve creation of opportunity objects. shows an example screenshot view illustrating a display of various analytics information that can be presented to a user based on information organized in an asset data model . The data displayed can optionally be dynamically updated to reflect an at least near real time view on the status of the install base data quality data import statistics value of the recurring revenue asset stream e.g. both assuming renewal of contracts at their existing value and with some amount of upsell projected service asset revenue e.g. with projections for a benchmark amount a historic trend and a what if or hypothetical prediction based on one or more user configurable parameters . Dynamic data updating can be provided in some implementations of the current subject matter via a high performance in memory database backend.

Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter a combination top down bottom up approach to predictions of recurring revenue from service assets can be supported by one or more of on going availability of large streams of inbound data received from external client system the ability to track project and analyze these data and the like. In this approach management personnel can set sales targets for a sales period e.g. a month a quarter etc. and sales operations team members and or sales representatives explained in more detail below can generate updated forecasts for example on a shorter timescale than the sales period e.g. a day a week etc. . The term target as used herein can be considered as a business objective created via a top down approach such as a desired goal set by a manager supervisor division vice president etc. for a given sales period. In contrast a forecast as used herein can be a forward looking projection created by a sales employee to indicate where that sales person expects his or her sales numbers to be by the end of the sales period. shows a chart illustrating the relationship between targets forecasts and reality as represented by current closed sales for a given sales period. In the example of a target line represents a top down projection or expectation set by one or more managers or management executive staff while a forecast line represents a bottom up estimate generated by input from actual sales staff. The current closed sales line represents actual sales results updated at least approximately to the current date and or time . Comparison of these various metrics at various times such as for example as the sales period progresses at the end of the sales period etc. can be useful in a number of analytical measures relating to sales performance. Examples of analytical measures that can be supported based on data collected generated etc. using approaches consistent with the current subject matter can include comparisons of sales performance versus one or more predefined metrics benchmarking against data regarding other recurring revenue sales activities etc. As explained in further detail below the benchmarking can occur against internal data for a commercial entity for example using the commercial entity s historical data as collected in an asset data model etc. Alternatively or in addition external benchmarking is also within the scope of the current subject matter.

Another feature of a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can involve support of timely and accurate analysis of how a sales history can drive future sales performance. Tools to assist with this effort can include dashboards and visualizations of analytical content such as graphs and charts that display immediately upon login a rich query interface that can support set operations aggregations background processing and materialized collections either or both of standard and client specific reports and externally callable REST APIs that facilitate the use of third party data exploration and reporting tools. shows a screenshot view that illustrates an example of real time performance statistics reported by analytical tools embedded in a dashboard such as described herein. The dashboard shown in the view can an overview tab or page as well as various tabs or pages linked from the overview that enable a deeper dive into the collected sales data to allow a user of the system to access data pertaining to one or more metrics or view on the sales data based on a user role. For example a manager s view on the data metrics etc. can differ from that of a sales representative or sales operation team member. These details are discussed in greater detail below.

The available opportunity for a given sales period is generally defined as all opportunities expiring in the current sales period and any remaining unresolved opportunities from the previous sales period. Another aspect of recurring revenue management that can be supported using approaches consistent with the current subject matter involves dynamic calculation and real time or near real time updating of key performance indicator KPI metrics relating to sales performance and optimization of a recurring revenue stream. Among other questions that a sales team manager other executive etc. at a commercial entity may desire to have answered are how successful the sales team is at covering the customer base how successful the sales team is at converting opportunities to a win how successful the team is at upselling and cross selling etc. Upselling generally involves closing an opportunity at an increase revenue point relative to the contract or other recurring revenue stream that was expiring. This can include selling a higher level of service a maintenance or insurance plan with a lower deductible etc.

Information that feeds KPI calculations can include a resolution rate which measures the fraction of opportunities that were moved to final status within the transaction period e.g. closed sale no service divided by the available opportunity for a sales period a close rate which is the ratio of closed successful sales to total amount of resolved opportunity e.g. wins losses and measures the fraction of opportunities resolved that were resolved as a win and a conversion rate which is an amount of won service asset value divided by a targeted and therefore measures the actual transaction value of closed sale against target value.

The top down approach mentioned above can generally rely upon KPIs and other historical performance metrics applied to opportunity. For example an available opportunity multiplied by a resolution rate multiplied by a close rate multiplied by a conversion rate can yield a forecast for a sales period. As an example a sales period with 1.2 M in available opportunity an 80 expected resolution rate an 80 close rate and a 105 conversion rate would have a forecasted target value of 806 000 e.g. 1.2 M times 80 times 80 times 105 806 000 .

A bottoms up approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can make use of a commit level red yellow green approach which is a specific forecast percentage applied to each deal. In this manner a sales team members representative or operations depending on the configuration of the sales team can enter a per opportunity estimate of the likelihood of that opportunity being successfully resolved a win . A simplified commit designation scheme e.g. red yellow green with a limited number of categories each indicating some defined likelihood of a successful close can be relatively straightforward and not as time consuming such that a sales member is more likely to take the care necessary to enter his or her predictions on a regular schedule e.g. once per week etc. . Continuing with the boom up approach every target opportunity can be assigned a commit level representative of an expected outcome probability. An expected close date for each opportunity can also be entered or estimated. A weighted value of the opportunity can be the total available opportunity value for that opportunity multiplied by the commit level percent chance of success . A forecast of total revenue for a sales period can be the sum of the weighted values of the opportunities projected to close in that sales period.

Implementations of the current subject matter can also support understanding the distribution of associated expiration dates for a given set of offers or opportunities within a target selling period. Offers within a selling period can be differentiated by the expiration date of the service asset associated with each offer. This expiration date in conjunction with historical comparison data can be used to help predict the probability of that offer resolving and the probability of that offer closing within more specific date ranges in the selling period for example within a specific month in a quarter . A recurring revenue management system can support the ability to consistently constrain predictions of outcome so that predictions of outcome early in the selling period properly constrain predictions later in the selling period. These constraints can be updated as time progresses in a quarter and as actual outcomes become available. Opportunity generation can include batching of existing and anticipated recurring revenue assets according to their expiration dates. In some examples a sales period opportunity metric can be generated based on a calculation of the value of renewal contracts that are available to be completed during the sales period. A sales period can be a different period of time than a quarter e.g. a month a week a year or longer a day or less etc. .

An example of an predictive modeling can be better understood by reference to the process flow chart shown in which illustrates features of a method consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter. At a set of offers for renewal of service assets is differentiated within a sales period. The differentiating can be based based at least in part on an expiration date of a service asset associated with each offer of the set of offers. At a set of parameters representative of each offer in the set of offers is analyzed. The analyzing can include applying a predictive model based on outcomes of other offers for renewal of service assets. The set of parameters includes at least one user provided constraint on an expected outcome of each offer. For example the set of parameters can include a predicted commit level assigned to each offer by a representative responsible for each offer. Commit levels are discussed in more detail below. At a predicted outcome for the set of offers is calculated based on an applied predictive model using the set of parameters as inputs. The at least one constraint for at least one offer of the set of offers is updated based on at least one sales outcome occurring during the sales period at and at a predicted outcome for the set of offers is recalculated based on the set of parameters comprising the updated at least one constraint.

Implementations of the current subject matter can provide tools that assist managers and sales staff at a commercial entity in tailoring their sales approach to the purchasing behavior of the customers of the commercial entity. Such behaviors can impact the success of one or more opportunities. Features consistent with the current subject matter can leverage features and capabilities of a recurring revenue management system and asset data model as described herein to track potential opportunities forecast sales results target sales staff effort and attention where and when it is likely to be most beneficial and the like.

In general an opportunity that is based on an expiring customer contract other service arrangement etc. can be assigned one or more different status or outcome indicators. The term contract used here to generically refer to a recurring revenue asset as discussed elsewhere in this specification and can include without limitation an existing contract or agreement a free or low cost warranty or service contract e.g. as might be included with an original purchase of a product or the like. Expiring contracts can provide a basis for generation of recurring revenue renewal opportunities. A first indicator e.g. a metric designation label etc. associated with an opportunity can include a resolution state. A resolution state is a designation or indicator regarding whether the opportunity remains open or alternatively has been resolved or closed. An open resolution state indicates that the opportunity has not yet been resolved. The selling process has not ended in failure but instead continues to have a chance of being resolved favorably.

A second indicator metric etc. associated with an opportunity is an outcome state. An outcome state can be won or lost. As used herein the term won or win as it pertains to an outcome state refers to a successful renewal or establishment of paid service for example a successful close of a renewal of a contract other service arrangement etc. based on an opportunity or group of opportunities. An outcome state of lost or no service or the like refers to an outcome state in which no service was established for a given opportunity or group of opportunities. For example a lost opportunity based on an expiring contract indicates that any revenue to be received by the commercial entity as well as any service provided by the commercial entity in satisfaction of the contract of ends when the term of the existing agreement service arrangement etc. expires and no renewal or continuation of service is paid for by the customer.

A third indicator associated with an expiring contract or group of expiring contracts is a timing state which relates to a current resolution state of the opportunity relative to the date of expiration of the existing contract or other relationship underlying the opportunity. For example an opportunity that has a resolution state of open on a date subsequent to the expiration date of an underlying contract other service arrangement etc. can have or be assigned a late timing state. An opportunity that has a resolution state of resolved and that reached that state prior to the date of expiration of the underlying contract other service arrangement etc. can have or be assigned an on time or optionally an early timing state. Consistent with some implementations of the current subject matter a closed opportunity can have or be assigned an early timing state if the date of closing occurs prior to a sales period containing the expiration date of an underlying contract other service arrangement etc. A closed opportunity can have or be assigned an on time timing state if the date of closing occurs in a same sales period containing the expiration date of an underlying contract other service arrangement etc.

It can generally be observed that customer purchasing behavior is strongly dependent on the timing with which a decision maker or other contact at the customer is presented with an offer in relation to the expiration date of an underlying contract other service arrangement etc. For example if an opportunity for renewal is presented too early e.g. one or more months in advance of the expiration date of the underlying contract other service arrangement etc. the urgency to close may be lessened due to a tendency to prioritize decision points that are more imminent. An opportunity that remains open after the expiration date of the expiration date of the underlying contract other service arrangement etc. can also be at risk as the customer may grow accustomed to proceeding without the service. The urgency of renewing or resuming the service may be lessened and such opportunities may experience a heightened risk of eventually resolving as a loss.

Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter the above issues with timing of sales efforts in relation to an expiration date of a contract other service arrangement etc. underlying an opportunity can be addressed by grouping opportunities into three sets for a given sales period carryover current and future opportunities. Carryover opportunities can include contracts or other renewal opportunities that expired in a previous sales period but that were not resolved in that previous sales period and thus remain available to close in the current sales period. As noted above due to typical customer behavior renewal contracts tend to age quickly meaning that contracts not renewed in a relatively short time after their expiration have a low probability of ever doing so. Current contracts are contracts that expire during the current sales period. Typical customer behavior generally results in renewal purchases occurring most frequently within about 90 days of expiration. As such current contracts can be of prime importance to many recurring revenue asset sales operations. Future contracts include those contracts that expire after the end of the current sales period. Such contracts are available to be resolved during the current sales period. Closing of a contract early can be useful in protecting the value of the recurring revenue stream. However closing contracts early at the expense of other contracts that may be expiring sooner can be less advantageous. It can be desirable to prioritize current and carryover opportunities to prevent or reduce the occurrence of potential gaps in the revenue stream.

Implementations of the current subject matter can include at each sales phase process milestones which can for example define the sales stages within a sales phase information capture requirements and advancement triggers that can assist in keeping the sale process on track. For example the qualification sales phase can include one or more process milestones defining the not contacted and contacted sales stages respectively based on whether an opportunity has been taken up by the sales staff and a qualified buyer e.g. a decision maker has been reached. Information captured in the qualification sales phase can optionally include one or more of logs of customer qualified buyer contacts notes dates contact type and method etc. relating to the contact events recorded in the process milestones scheduling of follow up tasks etc. Advancement triggers for the qualification sales phase can include logging of a successful customer contact which can cause the sales stage to move from not contacted to contact . In some examples the state phase and monitors can be managed for triggering actions that cause state transitions. Triggering actions can include actions performed by a user in the context of an opportunity e.g. clicking on Log Customer Contact and successfully executing or can include changes in any data in the opportunity that match a predefined pattern. The set of states triggering actions and state transitions can be predefined as part of system configuration and can be subsequently modified.

For the solution sales phase process milestones can include definitions of the quote requested stage A quote completed sales stage B and the quote delivered stage as follows a quote can be registered as requested when a sales solution is reached e.g. an agreement in principle regarding renewal of the opportunity is reached between a sales representative and a decision maker at the customer as completed when the quotation is ready for delivery and as delivered when it is actually delivered to the buyer decision maker etc. Information captured in the solution sales phase can optionally include one or more of terms service levels and discounts requested by the customer a revisions history and notes financial aspects of a quotation a delivery date and target recipient of the quotation etc. Advancement triggers for the solution sales phase can include detection that a sales representative has requested a quotation e.g. through functionality supported in a user interface of the recurring revenue management system that a sales operation team member has logged a quotation as completed that a sales operation team member has logged a quotation as delivered etc.

For the close sales phase process milestones can include definitions of the purchase order received sales stage A customer commitment sales stage B and closed sale sales stage as follows a customer commitment can be indicated by buyer commitment to a payment date a purchase order received state can be indicated by a payment being sent for processing and a closed sale can be indicated by a payment being fully processed. Information captured in the close sales phase can optionally include payment financial information payment and order dates an order revision history terms and service levels to be applied to the renewed contract e.g. if the terms and or service levels have changed from a previous contract that has been renewed etc. Advancement triggers for the close sales phase can include a sales representative logging a customer commitment e.g. to move the process to the customer commitment stage A a sales representative requesting a booking e.g. to move the process to the purchase order received stage B a sales operation team member completing a booking e.g. to move the process to the closed sale stage etc.

In the event that the sales process does not result in a successful close the opportunity is classified as a loss as discussed above. A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can also include automated data collection and processing related to losses. Such data and other information can be helpful in assessing the factors that resulted in an unsuccessful sales effort for the opportunity and can support analysis of the efforts of a sales team vs. well defined metrics. Process milestones for a lost opportunity can include receiving an indication that the customer is not interested in buying e.g. a no service situation that an opportunity should be identified as invalid e.g. a house account etc. Information captured for lost opportunities can include identification of the person or persons who declined the opportunity to buy one or more reasons given by that person or person or other information acquired by the sales representative or other sale steam members regarding reasons for the opportunity being lost any notes by the sales representative or other sales team member relating to or backing up the loss etc. Advancement triggers for a lost sale can include the sales representative resolving the opportunity in the system as a loss.

As discussed briefly above an asset data model consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can track reasons explanations etc. relating to resolution of an opportunity group of opportunities a single offer etc. e.g. a why regarding a win or loss outcome for a given opportunity or offer . Outcomes can include a closed successful sale a house account e.g. an invalid opportunity perhaps relating to an underlying product or service that a customer once had but has since disposed or or a no service outcome in which the customer simply chooses not to purchase a service agreement or subscription or allows an existing agreement to expire without renewing. One or more reason codes can be included and tracked as part of the asset data model for each type of outcome. These codes can be useful in providing feedback to service salespersons and as additional input data for further analytics and business intelligence processes. For a closed sale an outcome code can include without limitation a backdated sale a long co term sale a short co term sale a discounted sale a multi year advance sale a pricing change sale a re certification fee included sale a renewed at par sale a service downgrade sale a service upgrade sale an uncovered sale or the like. For a house account outcome an outcome code can indicate without limitation one or more of a bad data situation a cancelled contract or agreement a covered service a duplicate service an end of support condition an evergreen billing situation an international transaction a leasing situation an OEM customer an other explanation a product return a sales pullback by the customer or the like. For a no service outcome an outcome code can indicate without limitation one or more of a replacement of the product by the customer a competitive distributed value added reseller DVAR a competitive product replacement another explanation for a competitive service loss a customer cost benefit decision that the customer no longer exists a customer satisfaction driven refusal to buy or renew that the covered product or service is at the end of its service life some other data management issue a decommissioned or otherwise removed from service product a third party maintenance agreement an unresponsive end user an unresponsive value added reseller VAR a no service VAR or the like.

Descriptions herein of a sales process and sales personnel make reference in some examples to sales representatives and sale operation team members. One aspect of the current subject matter can include an integrated sales operations approach in which activities relating to the selling process for renewals between can be bifurcated between selling activity and back office sales support activity. Selling activity in this example refers to what is typically assumed to be an important sales representative skill specifically contacting buyers decision makers etc. at a customer and presenting an attractive value proposition that motivates the purchasing party to choose to complete a purchase. The skill set relating to such activities is a valuable one to a commercial entity so a recurring revenue management approach that maximizes the utilization of these skills can be quite advantageous. Accordingly user interface views provided by a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can support different view for different users.

Through the use of a recurring revenue management system that supports these focused views on the user interface that are tailored to specific roles in a sales team the recurring revenue management system enables tight coupling between quotation generation booking generation etc. in response to requests from the sales representative that are generated through buyer contacts and sales activities. Additionally the underlying asset data model which can be part of a recurring revenue management system consistent with implications of the current subject matter can support tight coupling of the sales process with underlying data services. In this manner data management and quality of data underlying the sales process and the renewal process can be optimized. Furthermore data that are quality enhanced or added to as part of a sales process can optionally be propagated back to one or more external client systems .

Management measurement and monitoring of service sales activities can be supported by one or more implementations of the current subject matter to ensure a consistent approach to managing opportunities quotes and bookings activities. A recurring revenue management system can include one or more features such as detailed reports that can enable a sales staff member e.g. a sales representative to proactively identify and address at risk opportunities pipeline dashboards to enable a manager to view pacing by time period and production metrics opportunity details to enable viewing of deal progress and logged activities territory management to enable manager and the like to drive sales staff behavior by assigning tasks to opportunities based on existing priorities and the like. shows an example screenshot view illustrating features of an analytics view displaying metrics relating to closed opportunity value. shows an example screenshot view illustrating features of an analytics view displaying metrics relating to a no service e.g. loss rate for closed opportunities. shows an example screenshot view illustrating features of an analytics view displaying a forecast dashboard for displaying forecast information. shows an example screenshot view illustrating features of an analytics view displaying metrics relating to an opportunity pipeline.

A recurring revenue management approach consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter can generate dynamic feedback and directed task navigation for a user of a recurring revenue management system based on one or more frameworks and roles as noted above. In some examples the directed task navigation can be designed to maximize the time that sales representatives can spend on sales related activities for which their skill set is an advantageous match. Based on the ability to identify sales issues or operational issues discovered in a role based dashboard by using or identifying data via search facets a user or manager can logically group a set of opportunities that meet certain characteristics. For example a user or manager can readily find all opportunities that have an expiration date of prior to a target date or date range e.g. prior to 2014 and a sales stage of Not Contacted where the Incumbent Reseller is a specific company e.g. ABC Inc. . Those opportunities can then be assigned to a specific task type such as creating a quote requesting a booking contacting the customer or resolving data issues and assigned to a specific role or user. Progression or evolution of the set of activities relative to that logical grouping of work can then be monitored over time as activities are completed or resolved.

A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can employ an asset data model specialized for recurring revenue asset sales and renewals. The asset data model can include fields related to service timing events service outcomes relationships to other assets and other context specific fields. For example in support of new sales of recurring revenue assets e.g. a new service contract a new subscription etc. a recurring revenue management system can process information received from the external client sources and optionally also updated information generated through sales contacts ongoing sales and renewal operations and other functions supported by the recurring revenue management system to populate data values in one or more fields relating to one or more of a local opportunity amount a local transaction amount an earliest existing end date an earliest new start date a latest new end date a commit level Red Yellow Black Green or other representational scheme a renewal sales stage a covered product a service product a service product description a client batch quarter a win loss result explanation an existing contract number an existing purchase order number an existing distributor an existing reseller a new distributor a new reseller and the like.

In support of renewal sales of recurring revenue assets e.g. a renewal of an existing contract a value added upsell of an existing contract etc. a recurring revenue management system can process information received from the external client sources and optionally also updated information generated through sales contacts ongoing sales and renewal operations and other functions supported by the recurring revenue management system to populate data values in one or more fields relating to one or more of a not contacted contacted status a quote requested status a quote delivered status a customer commitment status a purchase order received status as closed sale status etc.

A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can include a mechanism for coordinating online and offline activities of sales teams and individuals to optimally coincide with expiration or other timing events associated with a service sale. Such mechanisms can include automated workflows that guide when and how customers are contacted when activities such as quote request and quote presentment are executed and when escalations occur. The sales process can incorporate one or more key metrics associated with service sales such as for example resolution rate close rate conversion rate and the like that can be used to optimize performance.

A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can also implement one or more team coordination processes for pipelines and territories that ensure optimization of team outcomes. The processes metrics and workflows required to drive a sales outcome can be encoded in software and computer program products to enable the recurring revenue management system to perform predictive performance management.

Automated or semi automated forecasting of team based service sales can also be supported by a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. The recurring revenue management system can provide a framework for data collection from representatives based on key sales metrics and which allows representatives to follow a periodic i.e. weekly computer generated discipline process leading to accurate monthly and quarterly sales forecasts. The forecasting processes can incorporate a dual estimation approach where bottom up individual opportunity assessment based and top down expiration date grouping based calculations are employed.

User configured sales automation programs can be used to drive specialized process behavior for specific sets of opportunities and service sales operations. These automation programs can include adaptive quote and bookings management for service sales. Capabilities of adaptive quote and bookings management functionality consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter can include quote request categorization e.g. to identify key properties of the quote to guide processing quote request routing e.g. to route a request to a proper resource either human or automated to maximize processing efficiency statistical prediction of quote request outcomes e.g. to predict a probability of rejection and project a required processing time SLA management e.g. to effectively measure on time performance and to guide expectations of quote requestors throughput forecasting and management e.g. to manage workload and properly price quote processing services semi automated bookings reconciliation e.g. to allow reconciling an opportunity based sale such as from a CRM perspective with an external order management system view a dynamic i.e. rules based or algorithmic performance management engine for optimizing work activity allocation and the like.

A recurring revenue management system can further include modules for managing a complex channel partner network. The capabilities of the channel partner network management module s can include one or more of a federated permission model that allows OEMs to efficiently distribute access to opportunities across a multi level network of channel partners incumbency logic that determines which opportunities should be visible to any given channel partner gathering and disseminating forecast information from each channel sales incentive programs that can be executed across the channel self service management by channel partners e.g. to allow management of users and permissions for that partner quote processing management e.g. dynamically across a multi level channel and the like. For example a user interface can be provided for access by channel partners to display a selection of renewal ready defined opportunities for these channel partners to pursue based on underlying covered assets sold leased etc. by an original equipment manufacturer OEM . This or other user interfaces can include one or more renewal metrics similar to those discussed above and can be based on value to the OEM. In addition data regarding renewal process operations occurring at a channel partner can optionally be synchronized back to an asset data model maintained by or on behalf of the OEM. Projections targeting forecasting and the like as discussed above can be supported for a channel partner for example in a manner similar to those approaches discussed elsewhere herein.

A recurring revenue management system can also support holistic analysis of customer success management CSM which can include one or more of service asset analysis sales execution analysis sales operations analysis and the like. These features of SRM can include analytical capabilities to collect and display benchmark comparisons for all aspects of SRM.

As an example of these benchmarking capabilities the recurring revenue management system can access aggregate information regarding service revenue and other recurring revenue stream renewals sales etc. generated by one or more other commercial entities external to the commercial entity whose sales processes are automated through use of the recurring revenue management system . For example if the recurring revenue management system is provided via a software as a service SaaS framework the SaaS provider can have the ability to aggregate e.g. into a database the sales process outcome data from a number of commercial entities and to make these aggregated data available in the form of benchmarks and other metrics against which the sales outcomes of a specific commercial entity a sales team within the commercial entity an individual sales representative etc. can readily be compared.

As a further feature of a recurring revenue management system consistent with some implementations of the current subject matter the aggregated data discussed above can serve as an input for one or more predictive models that can be applied in improving the forecasting and targeting functions discussed above. In one example a set of parameters representative of a specific offer can be analyzed by a predictive model based on outcomes of other offers either within a given commercial entity or across aggregated data generated by more than one commercial entity to calculate a predicted outcome for that offer. The results of this kind of modeling can optionally be used in an iterative manner for example to test different possible sales approaches e.g. timing of a first contact relative to a current service asset expiration date time elapsed in the sales process from first contact by a sales representative to delivery of a quote etc. to identify a set of predicted best practices.

Predictive models can also support aggregate opportunity outcome predictions for example to forecast renewal rates values resolution rates etc. for a group of available offers or opportunities. The outcome predictions can optionally include projections of the value of a set of service assets at some point in the future a total amount of projected revenue for a set of service assets etc.

Predictive models based on historical sales execution data can be used to provide one or more of the following types of predictive analytics predictions of a probability of an offer closing within a particular time window based on customer product and time gap from expiration predictions of an expected value of an offer if closed within a particular time window based on customer product and time gap from expiration predictions of a probability of an upgrade of an offer if the offer is closed within a particular time window based on customer product and time gap from expiration etc. Predictive models consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can be built using machine learning approaches such as survival analysis clustering and regression analysis. The models can be encoded into the application for use in the form of predictor functions that augment data in the system.
