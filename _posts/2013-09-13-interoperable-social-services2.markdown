The present invention relates generally to the field of social computing and more particularly to interoperable social services that can access and use information from various social networking platforms to enhance enterprise web services.

Online social networks are well known and examples include LinkedIn Google Facebook and various additional online social utilities that support social networking. Such social networks can grow as their members discover and connect with other people who have similar interests or experiences.

Social networks track and enable connections between their members including people businesses and other entities . In particular social networking websites allow their members to efficiently communicate information that is relevant to friends or other connections on the social network. Social networks typically incorporate a system for maintaining connections among members in the social network and for maintaining links to content that is likely to be relevant to the members. Social networks also connect and maintain information about their members. This information may be substantially static such as employer job type age music preferences interests and a variety of other attributes or it may be more dynamic such as a member s geographic location within a city or his or her actions within the social network.

A typical modern computer implemented social networking application allows each member to provide some biographical and contact information to identify his or her interests and to make social networking posts about his or her status and daily life. Social networks can also suggest to the member other members whom the user might know or other members with compatible interests. Some social networks allow users to define relationships between the user and their connections. For example a user may designate another contact as their brother friend or co worker. While these defined relationships exist within the social network the information is not currently used by outside applications.

Typically when a member of a social network wishes to share information with other members of the social network the member uploads or copies and pastes the information to a location on the social network as a social networking post or sends the information in the form of a private message or email to other members.

An ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between pairs of concepts. An ontology provides a shared vocabulary which can be used to model a domain that is the type of objects and or concepts that exist and their properties and relations. Ontologies create a structural framework for organizing information and are used in artificial intelligence the semantic web and other areas as a form of knowledge representation about the world or some part of it.

The semantic web is a standard that promotes common data formats on the internet. The semantic web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application enterprise and community boundary. The semantic web involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data Resource Description Framework RDF Web Ontology Language OWL and Extensible Markup Language XML . HTML describes documents and the links between them. RDF OWL and XML by contrast can describe arbitrary things such as people meetings or parts of an object or assembly. Machine readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to content i.e. to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about content. In this way a machine can process knowledge itself instead of text using processes similar to human deductive reasoning and inference thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research.

Aspects of an embodiment of the present invention disclose a method computer program product and computing system for utilizing multiple social computing services of a user. A processor accesses a first networking service of a user and a second networking service of the user wherein the first networking service includes a first group of contacts connected with the user and the second networking service includes a second group of contacts connected with the user. A processor retrieves the first group from the first networking service and the second group from the second networking service. A processor creates a set of contacts wherein the set of contacts includes each contact of the first group of contacts with a corresponding link to information about that contact and each contact of the second group of contacts with a corresponding link to information about that contact and wherein a contact of the set of contacts has an associated relationship with the user wherein the associated relationship with the user is established externally from the first networking service and the second networking service.

Interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A and B are a set of software and or hardware components that may be installed to or otherwise included within a server such as ISP telecommunications server or server . Interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A and B operate to access social networking contact information of a user combine contacts from one or multiple social networking accounts such as social networking server into a single contact aggregate define relationships between a user and one or more contact aggregates and allow for enterprise service hosts to access and use this information to better perform enterprise services for a given user. Interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A and B may also operate to define relationships between multiple contact aggregates. A contact aggregate contains one or more entries from social networks of a user such as social networking server that represent a single unique individual contact. For example an individual contact may have profiles on two social networks and the contact aggregate for that individual will contain information from each social network within the single contact aggregate. In the current embodiment interoperable social services A resides on ISP telecommunications server and interoperable social services B resides on server . Interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A and B will be discussed in further detail with regards to .

In the depicted embodiment interoperable social services A and B include social services program contact aggregation function relationship association function relationship ontology file s and information storage . As previously mentioned interoperable social services A B may include additional components and software.

Social services program operates to get information from the user s identified social networking sources in order to determine one or more social networking sources such as social networking server to interoperate with for the user. Social services program accesses the user s social networking contact information from the user s identified social networking source such as social networking server through each of the user s corresponding social network accounts such as social networking server . Social services program may then retrieve all entries of contacts of the user from each identified social networking server such as social networking server . Social services program may retrieve information about the entries of contacts of the user from each identified social networking server and maintain that information via a corresponding link to information about that contact. In some embodiments the corresponding link may be to the source of the information such as the social networking site source or to an externally maintained link to information about the contact. Social services program may then aggregate all entries of contacts of the user as retrieved from all social networking sources such as social networking server into a consolidated list of contact aggregates. Social services program may reconcile multiple contact entries from different social networking sources such as social networking server that represent the same identity into one contact aggregate per each unique identity by applying contact reconciliation rules. Contact reconciliation rules may include for example multiple contacts containing a matching first name last name and cell phone number. Based on input received from the user or information retrieved from the social networking source one or more relationship axioms may be associated with each contact aggregate. Axioms are assertions in a logical form that together comprise an overall theory that an ontology describes in its domain of application. Relationship axioms are assertions about relationships as used in a relationship ontology such as a relationship file stored to relationship ontology file s . For example a relationship axiom between a user and a contact aggregate may assert that the contact aggregate is the user s brother. The operations performed by social services program may allow for enterprise service hosts to access and use additional information to better perform enterprise services for a user. Enterprise services may be any of the enterprise services discussed in such as those referencing enterprise services of server . In one embodiment social services program includes two functions contact aggregation function and relationship association function . In one embodiment social services program resides on the enterprise server containing the enterprise services such as enterprise services that it assists. In other embodiments social services program may reside on another server or another computing device provided that social services program is accessible to applicable enterprise services such as enterprise services and provided that social services program has access to respective relationship ontology file s information storage and applicable enterprise services.

Contact aggregation function operates to retrieve information from and allow access to contact and or user profile information stored within a variety of social media email and other similar connection making platforms. In one embodiment contact aggregation function may reconcile and merge contact or profile information from multiple sources into a single contact aggregate according to a set of contact reconciliation rules. Contact reconciliation rules may be predefined or may be customizable by a user through UI on client computing device . In another embodiment contact aggregation function may alert and query a user at client computing device through UI as to retrieved contact information and profile information from multiple contact sources that may in fact be directed to the same user. For example a person may have a profile on a first social networking platform and a profile on a second social networking platform. Contact aggregation function may allow a user to designate primary message settings for each user. All contact aggregates their corresponding sources and units of information linked to the contact aggregates may be stored to information storage . Units of information linked to the contact aggregates may include facts about contacts represented by the respective contact aggregates such as a contact s birthday. Such information may be stored in a format that is interoperable between systems equipped with interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A on ISP telecommunications server and interoperable social services B on server . In one embodiment the information may be stored in the resource description framework RDF as an extensible markup language XML file. RDF is a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human readable and machine readable.

Relationship association function operates to assist enterprise services such as enterprise services at query request to retrieve a list of contact aggregates when a specified relationship axiom is received. In one embodiment relationship association function may be able to make inferences based on relationship axioms a user previously associated with contact aggregates that are different than the specified relationship axiom of the request. For example a user may associate the relationship axiom sister with a contact aggregate. When the specified relationship axiom sibling is used for a query that involves gathering a group of members within the group sibling the contact aggregate associated with the relationship axiom of sister will also be listed as a member of sibling together with other social relationship axioms e.g. brother even though the relationship ontology concept of sister is not specified directly in the query. This is due to the relationship definition between sister and sibling in the applicable relationship ontology such as a relationship ontology stored to relationship ontology file s .

Relationship association function may also allow a user to set one or more relationships between the user and other contacts as well as between multiple contacts of the user. Relationships a user can set may include familial e.g. brother parent cousin employment e.g. boss co worker service e.g. barber electrician geographic e.g. neighbor location of residence interest friendship level e.g. friend acquaintance significant other or other types of relationships. Such information may be stored in a format that is interoperable between systems equipped with interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A on ISP telecommunications server and interoperable social services B on server . In one embodiment the information may be stored in the RDF as an XML file.

Relationship association function may also be able to import or export the user s social networking contact aggregates associated relationship axioms and applicable relationship ontologies used for such associated relationship axioms. For example relationship association function may be able to externalize a copy of the user s social networking contact aggregates from a first enterprise server location to a second enterprise server location. The information that may be imported or exported is comprised of the applicable relationship ontology such as a relationship ontology stored to relationship ontology file s and all the user s contact aggregates that contain all contact information from each of the social network sources such as social networking server . Enterprise servers such as server equipped with interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A and B may import the user s contact aggregates associated relationship axioms and applicable relationship ontologies used for such associated relationship axioms as exported from another enterprise server that is equipped with interoperable social services A B and vice versa.

Information storage is a repository that may be written and read by social services program contact aggregation function and relationship association function . Contact aggregates of each user that contain user profile graph objects extracted user profile information defined relationships and or links to user profile information may be stored to information storage . In addition contact reconciliation rules may be stored to information storage . In one embodiment information storage resides with interoperable social services A B. In other embodiments information storage may reside on another server or another computing device provided that information storage is accessible to social services program contact aggregation function relationship association function and applicable enterprise services such as enterprise services .

Relationship ontology file s is a repository that may be written and read by social services program and relationship association function . Relationship ontology file s may contain one or more relationship ontology files. A relationship ontology file contains an ontology artifact that captures definitions of relationships for a given domain. Relationship ontology files may be written or read by social services program or another ontology tooling and stored typically in serialized form to relationship ontology file s . In other embodiments relationship ontology files may be stored to information storage . In one embodiment relationship ontology information is stored as one or more web ontology language OWL files. OWL files are a type of file used by knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. The file type is characterized by formal semantics and RDF XML based serializations for the semantic web. Relationship ontology information may contain facts classes subclasses and other information about definition of truth and assertions about relationships within a given specific domain. For example in a personal domain personal relationship definition captured by relationship ontology may characterize mother by one or more combinations of the fact that a person has a child is female is not male or is a parent. Example of other relationship ontology for another domain includes business to business relationship ontology business to consumer relationship ontology etc. Relationship ontology information may help relationship association function decipher inferences and recognize extended relationships based upon relationship information retrieved and input by a user. Relationship ontology file s may comprise one or more files and enterprise servers may utilize one or more relationship ontology file s based on the needs of the services being performed such as enterprise services . In one embodiment relationship ontology file s resides with the other files and components of interoperable social services A or B. In other embodiments relationship ontology file s may reside on another server or another computing device provided that relationship ontology file s is accessible to social services program and relationship association function . In yet other embodiments relationship ontology file s may be uniform resource locator URL addressable for access by any user or entity with knowledge of the particular URL and access to the Internet. Relationships within each relationship ontology file of relationship ontology file s may be exported and captured in a relationship axiom artifact typically in the form of an XML file and stored as a part of information storage . A relationship axiom artifact is a file that may contain at least a list of relationships as contained within the applicable relationship ontology file or files of relationship ontology file s . The relationship axiom artifact may be read by UI of client computing device to populate the list of relationships displayed by UI for the user to associate one or more relationships with a contact aggregate.

Contact aggregation function is executing within the computing system of for retrieving contacts from one or more social networking sources and merging profiles directed toward the same contact into a single contact aggregate in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

In one embodiment a user may have accounts with one or more email social network or other networking platform. For example a user might have profiles with a professional network a social network and two email addresses wherein each account has a contact list or set of connections to other users. A user at client computing device may wish to use these connections to accomplish tasks and use services available outside of the confines of the applicable social networking platform s .

A user may wish to enable an interoperable social network that will allow multiple enterprise servers to take advantage of information available to the user through their established profiles and connections on existing email and social networking programs web sites and or other platforms. A user at client computing device may initiate interoperable social services A or B by accessing a server with interoperable social services capabilities. For example a user s ISP or telecommunication server such as ISP telecommunication server may allow access to interoperable social services A through an application or by being connected to a network operated by the provider. Alternatively a user may be able to access interoperable social services through an enterprise server such as server using interoperable social services B. A user at client computing device may initiate contact aggregation function through UI by selecting a contact source such as a social networking professional networking email or other networking platform and inputting necessary information to allow contact aggregation function to gain access to the selected contact source.

Information required to gain access to a contact source may include a username email address password site address or other information. For example if the contact source comes from an email account the account type e.g. POP3 IMAP etc. incoming mail server and outgoing mail server SMTP information and other information may additionally be necessary to allow contact aggregation function the necessary access. Some embodiments of the present invention may be integrated into a contact source program web site or platform and may not require additional user credential information to access the account or profile. In some embodiments the user may be able to provide contact aggregation function with access to particular connections or group of connections within the selected account rather than all of the connections in their entirety.

Once contact aggregation function has the necessary information required to access the contact source s in step contact aggregation function retrieves information from social sources by using the received user credentials. For example the contact source may be a social networking platform run on social networking server and the required user credentials may include the web site of the social networking platform the user s username and the password associated with the account.

In step contact aggregation function creates a contact link for each retrieved contact. A contact link may be a URL directed to the contact or user profile source. Additional information about the contact may be stored such as facts about the contact listed in the profile listed contact information profile pictures important dates e.g. birthday anniversary and relationship information e.g. spouse parents siblings children etc. . Alternatively an embodiment may extract all information available through the user credentials and store the complete set of information. Other embodiments may merely store links to the particular contact. Contact information and or links may be stored to a file or database such as information storage .

Contact information may be retrieved from the contact source through the use of an application programming interface API . In some instances a social media website or other similar platform may provide an API. An API is intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other. Many social media platforms provide services with a corresponding API. If a social media website or other similar platform uses an API contact aggregation function may be able to call the API for specific contact details and other information rather than relying on other processes.

If a social media platform does not use an API an embodiment of contact aggregation function may be able to use text analytics processes to extract information about contacts. In one embodiment contact aggregation function uses text analytics to parse through all available contact information and extract information based on keywords or common themes within the text of the user profile of the contact. Text analytics can be performed using an Unstructured Information Management Architecture UIMA application configured to analyze unstructured information to discover patterns relevant to contact aggregation function by processing plain text and identifying entities or relations.

In step contact aggregation function accesses a list of one or more contact reconciliation rules from information storage . Contact reconciliation rules may help contact aggregation function determine if profile information from different contact sources is directed to the same user. In some embodiments the one or more contact reconciliation rules may be a set of default rules. In other embodiments the one or more contact reconciliation rules may be a customized set of contact reconciliation rules created by a user for resolving whether or not profile information from different contact sources is directed at the same contact. For example a contact reconciliation rule may state that contact aggregation function should recognize a conflict if two profiles from different social network or other sources share the same birthday. In another example a contact reconciliation rule may state that contact aggregation function should recognize a conflict if the first and last initial of a user matches that of another user on another social networking platform. In yet another example a contact reconciliation rule may state that contact aggregation function should recognize a conflict if the first and last name of a user match within a certain specified threshold to that of another user on another social networking platform according to a Levenshtein distance algorithm. The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single character edits e.g. insertions deletions substitutions required to change one word into the other. In yet another embodiment a contact reconciliation rule may determine a conflict by using facial recognition software to compare profile pictures from two or more contact sources. In one embodiment contact reconciliation rules may allow contact aggregation function to automatically determine whether or not user profiles from different contact sources are operated by the same person. In another embodiment contact aggregation function may alert a user at client computing device when a conflict exists such as when a user lists two different mailing addresses.

In step contact aggregation function evaluates newly retrieved contacts against previously stored contacts or other newly retrieved contacts according to a set of contact reconciliation rules. If no new contact sources have been added to the user profile graph there may be no conflicts. However if there are multiple contact sources contact aggregation function may compare newly retrieved contacts to those linking or directed to other contact sources which are a part of the user profile graph. In one embodiment contact aggregation function individually selects each contact or contact link and compares it to stored contacts from other sources according to the applicable contact reconciliation rules see step . Embodiments of contact aggregation function may select new contacts to be evaluated by username or any other organized method.

In decision contact aggregation function determines whether two or more contacts or contact links from different contact sources are potentially directed to the same contact i.e. the same user operates each profile in question . If contact aggregation function determines that the contact is not directed to the same user as another contact from another contact source decision no branch contact aggregation function adds the contact link to the user profile graph step and stores the information to a file or database such as information storage . In one embodiment contact aggregation function may store additional information extracted from the contact source to a file or database such as information storage . If there are additional contact sources to input contact aggregation function may repeat the process for each additional contact source.

If contact aggregation function determines that the contact is potentially directed to the same user as another contact from another contact source decision yes branch contact aggregation function may determine whether or not to merge the two contacts into a single user profile graph object or a single contact directing to both contact sources decision . In some embodiments contact aggregation function may automatically make this determination decision based on the evaluation of the contacts using the list of one or more contact reconciliation rules see steps . In other embodiments contact aggregation function may notify the conflict to the user through a computing device such as client computing device . For example if there is a conflict contact aggregation function may cause the two profiles to be displayed on UI of client computing device and query the user for a determination on whether to merge the contacts. In either embodiment if contact aggregation function determines that the contacts should not be merged decision no branch contact aggregation function adds the contact link to the user profile graph step and stores the information to a file or database such as information storage . In one embodiment contact aggregation function may store additional information extracted from the contact source to a file or database such as information storage . If there are additional contact sources to input contact aggregation function may repeat the process for each additional contact source.

If contact aggregation function determines that the contacts should be merged decision yes branch contact aggregation function will merge the information into a single contact add the contact link to the user profile graph and store the contact link to the user profile graph step . Merging contacts may comprise including multiple contact links for a single contact wherein each contact link is directed at a different contact source e.g. email social network professional network etc. . In some embodiments contact aggregation function may extract information from the contact source to be stored. In such an embodiment contact aggregation function may store extracted information under a single contact contact aggregation function may delete duplicate information and contact aggregation function may alert a user at client computing device as to any information that does not match e.g. different birthdays listed different geographic locations etc. and may allow the user to specify the conflicting information to consider as primary. Contact aggregation function may store the information to a file or database such as information storage . In one embodiment contact aggregation function may store additional information extracted from the contact source to a file or database such as information storage . If there are additional contact sources to input contact aggregation function may repeat the process for each additional contact source.

Contact aggregation function or another function of social services program may allow a user to select primary contact methods for a contact such as a contact added to the user profile graph. For instance a contact may contain one or more email addresses telephone numbers social network usernames or other methods by which the contact may be accessed and a user may be aware of how the user prefers to be contacted. In such a scenario social services program may allow the user to specify messaging preferences for individual contacts and store those preferences to a file or database such as information storage .

In one embodiment initially a user at client computing device may use UI to connect to a server such as ISP telecommunications server and extract contact information from identified sources of social networking. At any point after generating such a group of contact aggregates and associating relationship axioms the user may connect to a server such as server to gain access to services such as enterprise services . Enterprise services may be any type of computing or online services offered by enterprises with an online presence. For example enterprise services may include Internet retail and commerce messaging and communications gaming video or any other type of online service. Assuming server has installed or otherwise has access to interoperable social services such as interoperable social services B relationship association function may be used by referencing relationships either associated or indirect and inferred as a part of the usage of the enterprise services . For example an enterprise service shopFor may take sibling as parameter for a user such that the item s that the user purchases with the enterprise service shopFor will be delivered to all his or her siblings.

In step relationship association function receives a request to assist with a service action such as a service action available from enterprise services where the request contains a relationship. For example a request for enterprise services may be to buy and send one copy of book to my brothers. In such a situation relationship association function shall determine all contacts that comprise the group brothers and in addition may supply enterprise services with address or other contact information for each member of the group brothers. The relationship specified may be a relationship that was specifically designated by a user however it may also be a relationship that must be inferred. For instance if a user has designated a contact as his or her brother an inference can be made by relationship association function that the user s brother is also his or her sibling.

When a specified relationship is not one which has been specifically designated but rather one that relationship association function must infer relationship association function may access applicable relationship ontology information step . Relationship ontology information may be stored to files or databases such as relationship ontology file s . In exemplary embodiments relationship ontology file s are URL addressable and may be accessed by any user computing device or entity with access to the Internet. In some embodiments relationship ontology file s may be stored using the web ontology language OWL . OWL is a format that can be used to define an ontology. OWL can define relatively rich semantics including relations between classes of entities properties and characteristics of properties. Relationship ontology information may be used to describe any types of relationships such as the relationship previously described and enterprises may include additional ontology files in order to enhance their service offerings. For example a familial relationship ontology file may include that a mother is a parent immediate family member relation woman has child etc. Relationship association function may use such details to make inferences based on disclosed relationships.

In step relationship association function performs the service action with regards to all contacts within the group that comprises the specified relationship. Typically the service action will include retrieving contacts in a group defined by relationships causing messages to be sent to users within a social networking platform or other similar actions that may assist the requesting enterprise service such as enterprise services . Contacts in the specified relationship may be based on specifically designated relationships or relationships that relationship association function has inferred by accessing applicable relationship ontology file s see step . In some embodiments the entity or enterprise performing the service or action may request that relationship association function use contact information located on a previously created user profile graph which may contain links to contact sources to connect to the contact source to retrieve additional or updated information using received user credentials in a similar manner as discussed with regards to contact aggregation function and . For example the enterprise service action may include sending a package to a desired contact or set of contacts and enterprise services may request that relationship association function connect to the contact source to verify the address information for a particular contact. In another example enterprise services may request that relationship association function send an article to all friends that have an interest in rock climbing and relationship association function may connect to the respective contact sources such as social networking server to find contacts within the designated relational group friends that list rock climbing as an interest or somewhere else on their respective profile. In one embodiment relationship association function may retrieve relationship and contact information stored to information storage using a SPARQL protocol and RDF query language SPARQL query. A SPARQL query allows for retrieval of data stored in resource description framework RDF format. RDF format allows for a method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources using a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats.

In one embodiment relationship association function may be used to transfer groups of contacts or entire lists of contacts such as those included within a user profile graph and stored to information storage . Relationship association function may transfer contacts and or contact information from one server to another server assuming both servers are equipped with interoperable social services. For example a user may have input contacts using interoperable social services A on ISP telecommunications server and may desire to take advantage of services such as enterprise services offered by server . In order to accomplish this the user may direct relationship association function to transfer all of or a selection of the user profile graph or other stored contact information to interoperable social services B. In one embodiment a user may specify a group of contacts to be transferred such as family friends neighbors or co workers.

A function of social services program such as relationship association function may allow a user to associate a relationship axiom between contacts groups of contacts and or the user. A function of social services program may allow a user to define familial e.g. brother parent cousin employment e.g. boss co worker business partner service e.g. barber lawyer geographic e.g. neighbor lake house and other types of relationships between the user and contact or between contacts themselves. Once set a query for a list of contact aggregates via an indirect relationship e.g. Relatives will list the contact aggregates according to the information contained in the applicable relationship ontology. A relationship ontology may contain a relationship and sub levels of the relationship that may establish other indirect relationships. In one embodiment a user at client computing device may be able to define associated relationship axioms through UI via a connection to interoperable social services such as interoperable social services A or interoperable social services B across network . In one embodiment the list of relationships available for association within UI is populated according to an axiom artifact file. The axiom artifact file may contain the list of relationships stored within the applicable relationship ontology from the one or more relationship ontologies as stored to relationship ontology file s . In one embodiment relationship association function may be able to cause contact aggregation function to extract relationship type information that has already been established by a user on the social network or other contact source platform or site. Relationships information may be stored as a part of the user profile graph or with other extracted contact information. Relationships may be stored to a file or database such as information storage . Relationships and relationship information may be accessible to relationship association function and social services program .
