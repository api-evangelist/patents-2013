title: System and method for data-driven web page navigation control
abstract: A system and method for web application navigation control includes updating navigation data models used in navigation constraints with received data from an end-user or system. Without needing a centralized application-specific controller, from a collection of extensible navigation rules associated with each page of a plurality of pages, the extensible navigation rules are automatically selected which depend on changed data values and need re-evaluation. The navigation constraints associated only with the pages potentially changing their ready state to execute from among the plurality of pages in an entire application are evaluated to determine which pages are ready to run based on updated data from the navigation data models. A preferred page to be actually navigated to next is selected from among a set of all available and ready pages by execution of a set of second and separate navigation constraints using results of the navigation constraints of the evaluating step.
