That is in the foregoing an example when JITENSHA bicycle is set as the base word is proposed. In addition base words and compound words are associated and stored in the compound word DB

Incidentally a compound word may also be generated by using the above patterns for product information such as the product name of the product DB product description and the like. When extracting a noun processing in which a morpheme whose part of speech is an unknown word or a symbol alphabet is handled as a noun and a morpheme whose part of speech is a noun suffix or noun number is not regarded as a noun may be performed by using a morphological analyzer. Further to remove words as noise compound words may be narrowed down to those used as many times as a predetermined number or more as search keywords.

In addition compound words may be generated from the base word other word and suffix according to the patterns of base word other word other word base word base word suffix other word and other word suffix base word .

Classification items to classify a compound word are stored in the classification item DB an example of the classification item storage means . As classification items for example User indicating for what kind of users product is intended Target indicating for what target to be used Purpose indicating the purpose of using product or the like Function indicating the function of product or the like Accessory indicating to be an accessory Shape indicating the shape of product or the like Location indicating the place of production of product or the like Company Name indicating the selling agency of product or the like Material indicating the material of product and Design indicating the design of product or the like can be cited. Further Size Atmosphere Processing Usage Specification Property and State can be cited as classification items. The classification item ID is attached to each classification item and each classification item is stored in the classification item. DB . Incidentally the classification item indicates a semantic relation established between a base word head and a modifier in a compound word.

Lexico syntactic patterns storing extraction patterns to acquire a word pair in a semantic relation corresponding to each classification item are stored in the LSP DB an example of the feature information storage means . If H is a base word and M is a modifier examples of the lexico syntactic pattern include M YOU H H for M M TSUKI H H with M M KATA H M type H M SEI H H made of M M SAN H H produced in M and M GARA H M pattern H .

Incidentally as the semantic relation TATOEBA M NADONO H H such as M is an example of hyponymy relations and H HA M NO BUBUN DEARU H is a part of M is an example of the part whole relation.

Further examples of the lexico syntactic patterns regarding a word X include X SAMA Mr. X X YOU for X X MUKE intended for X X YOU for X X KATA X type X KINOU TSUKI with X function X NOYOUNA KATACHI shape like X X NADONO KATACHI shape such as X X SAN produced in X X SHA X company X SEI made of X BURANDO NO X brand X MEKA NO X maker X and X NOYOUNA SOZAI material like X .

In addition the lexico syntactic pattern may be classified by relation. For example the lexico syntactic patterns X YOU for X X MUKE intended for X and X YOU for X are classified as the user relation the lexico syntactic pattern X KINOU TSUKI with X function is classified as the function relation the lexico syntactic patterns X KATA X type X NOYOUNA KATACHI shape like X and X NADONO KATACHI shape such as X are classified as the shape relation the lexico syntactic pattern X SAN produced in X is classified as the location relation the lexico syntactic patterns X SHA X company X SEI made of X BURANDO NO X brand X and MEKA NO X maker X are classified as the company relation and the lexico syntactic pattern X NOYOUNA SOZAI material like X is classified as the material relation.

 YOU for TSUKI with SEI made of SAN produced in KATA type BAN board BAN version GARA pattern IRO color and the like are stored in the suffix DB an example of the feature information storage means as characters of the suffix. For example characters of the suffix are used to generate a compound word like JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle . Incidentally in English in addition to for in helmet for bicycle with in for the purpose of made in made of and produced in can be cited as expressions corresponding to the above suffixes.

Incidentally the suffix is an example of an intermediate character string between a base word and another word and is a word in a suffix portion of a modifier portion with respect to a base word of a compound word. In the case of for example a base word H and another word X suffix portions YOU for TSUKI with and SEI made of in the modifier portions X YOU for X X TSUKI with X and X SEI made of X in the compound words X YOU H H for X X TSUKI H H with X and X SEI H H made of X can be cited as characters of the suffix. In English with in for the purpose of made in made of and produced in of the modifier portions with X in X for the purpose of X made in X made of X and produced in X in the compound words H for X H with X H in X H for the purpose of X H made in X H made of X and H produced in X can be cited as expressions corresponding to the above suffixes.

Dictionaries such as a user word dictionary of words related to users an object word dictionary of words related to targets a function word dictionary of words related to functions a shape word dictionary of words related to shapes a location word dictionary of words related to places of production place names and the like a company name word dictionary of words related to corporate names and brand names and a material word dictionary of words related to the material are recorded in the classification dictionary DB an example of the feature information storage means .

In the user word dictionary words representing a person like SHINIA senior JUNIA junior BEBI baby User and DANSEI male are stored. The user word dictionary is used when the classification item of YUSA user is obtained.

In the object word dictionary words representing an object like BIHAKU BIYOUEKI skin whitening liquid foundation HEDDO DORESU headdress and IROGAMI colored paper are stored. The object word dictionary is used when the classification item of Target the classification item of Accessory or the classification item of Shape is obtained.

In the function word dictionary words representing a function like SHOUSHU deodorization TAISHIN earthquake proof SAIZU CHOUSEI size adjustment and HORUDO hold are stored. The function word dictionary is used when the classification item of Function is obtained.

In the shape word dictionary words representing a shape like MIKAZUKI crescent and DAEN ellipse are stored. The shape word dictionary is used when the classification item of Shape is obtained.

In the material word dictionary words representing a material like KAWA leather GOMU rubber GARASU glass and KAMI paper are stored. The material word dictionary is used when the classification item of Material is obtained.

In addition the classification dictionary DB includes a dictionary of a morphological analysis system that classifies words in each language like a Japanese morphological analysis system. The classification dictionary DB also includes a dictionary in which expressions representing a person are collected to determine whether a word represents a person. Further the classification dictionary includes a database related to dependency of each language and data on the frequency of appearance of words or phrases is also present in the database.

Next as shown in the classification item lexico syntactic patterns corresponding to the classification item and compound words for training are associated and stored in the training DB an example of the classification item storage means . In the training DB information about a base word underlined in the figure as a head and a modifier portion in each compound word for training are stored.

Search keywords used by users for a search are stored in the query log DB . As shown in the number of times of use is also counted and stored in the query log DB together with the search keyword used for a search. Further as shown in if the search keyword used for a search is HERUMETTO JITENSHA helmet bicycle a search keyword is stored in the query log DB by setting HERUMETTO helmet as the base word and JITENSHA bicycle as the other word and combining the base word and the other word. Incidentally if the search keyword used for a search is HERUMETTO helmet only the base word is stored. If the search keyword used for a search is JITENSHA HERUMETTO bicycle helmet HERUMETTO helmet may be set as the base word and JITENSHA bicycle as the other word before being distributed out and stored in the query log DB

The LSP DB the suffix DB and the classification dictionary DB form a feature information database hereinafter called feature information DB an example of the feature information storage means storing feature information about a feature that provides a clue to classify a compound word. In the feature information DB the character string of a modifier part of speech and meaning class name are also stored as feature information necessary to construct a classification model.

The feature is a clue to classify a compound word into one of the classification items and an element indicating characteristics of the compound word. Examples of feature information about a feature include a suited lexico syntactic pattern classification dictionary in which modifier portions are registered character string of a modifier portion part of speech of a modifier portion suffix at the end of a modifier portion and meaning class to which a modifier portion belongs. A compound word can be characterized by the above feature information. Incidentally to acquire the meaning class information of an existing thesaurus such as a classification lexicon table is used.

A matrix of a feature vector is stored in the feature information DB . The feature vector is a multi dimensional vector characteristic value vector having characteristic values of a compound value as values thereof. A feature vector is configured by a matrix of a feature vector including a lexico syntactic pattern portion of the feature vector a modification portion of the feature vector a part of speech portion of the feature vector a suffix portion of the feature vector and a meaning class portion of the feature vector.

The lexico syntactic pattern portion of a feature vector corresponds to each lexico syntactic pattern and occupies for example as many dimensions as the predetermined number of lexico syntactic patterns. The portion of each dimension of the lexico syntactic pattern portion corresponds to an individual lexico syntactic pattern.

The modification portion of a feature vector corresponds to each character string of a modifier and occupies as many dimensions as the predetermined number of types of the modifier character string. Each dimension portion of the modification portion corresponds to an individual character string.

The part of speech portion of a feature vector corresponds to the part of speech of a modifier and occupies as many dimensions as the predetermined number of part of speeches of the modifier. The portion of each dimension of the part of speech portion corresponds to an individual part of speech.

The suffix portion of a feature vector corresponds to the suffix at the end of a modifier and occupies for example as many dimensions as the predetermined number of types of the suffix. Incidentally NULL is assumed when there is no suffix. The portion of each dimension of the suffix portion corresponds to an individual suffix.

The meaning class portion of a feature vector corresponds to the meaning class in a classification lexicon table and occupies for example as many dimensions as the predetermined classification number of meaning classes. The portion of each dimension of the meaning class portion corresponds to an individual meaning class. Here the classification lexicon table is a thesaurus in which words are classified and distributed out by meaning. The classification lexicon table is stored in the feature information DB .

The feature vector of a compound word is obtained by applying the compound word to the matrix of a feature vector and obtaining the feature value of each component of the feature vector that is the feature value of each portion of the feature vector. The matrix of the feature vector is also an example of feature information.

Here using feature information for a compound word means for example using feature information for a compound word to extract information about elements indicating characteristics of the compound word. Examples of using feature information for a compound word include a case when an feature vector is used for a compound word to expand the compound word into an feature vector to obtain each component when the suffix such as YOU for and TSUKI with is used for a compound word to determine whether the suffix such as YOU for is present in the compound word when a lexico syntactic pattern is used for a compound word to extract a predetermined word or character string matching the lexico syntactic pattern from the compound word or determine whether the compound word matches the lexico syntactic pattern or when a classification dictionary is used for a compound word to determine whether a word or character string in a predetermined portion of the compound word is present in the classification dictionary.

The input output interface unit performs interface processing between the communication unit and the memory unit and the system control unit .

The system control unit is formed with for example a CPU Central Processing Unit a ROM Read Only Memory and a RAM Random Access Memory an example of the storage means . Then the system control unit functions as a compound word classification means that distributes a compound word into classification items by various programs stored in the ROM or the storage unit being read and executed by the CPU

As shown in the shop terminal device functioning as a computer is for example a personal computer or a mobile terminal such as a portable wireless phone including a smartphone and PDA and includes a communication unit a storage unit a display unit an operation unit an input output interface unit and a system control unit . Further the system control unit and the input output interface unit are connected through a system bus .

The communication unit controls communication with the information processing server through the network . Incidentally when the shop terminal device is a mobile terminal device the communication unit has a wireless communication function to connect to a mobile communication network of the network .

The storage unit is configured by for example a hard disk drive or the like and stores an operating system and programs such as a Web browser program and Web browser toolbar.

The display unit an example of the display means is configured by for example a liquid crystal display device or EL Electro Luminescence device.

The operation unit is configured by for example a keyboard mouse and the like. The user inputs a response through the operation unit . Incidentally if the display unit is a display panel of the touch switch method like a touch panel the operation unit acquires position information of the display unit where the user touches or approaches.

The input output interface unit is an interface between the communication unit and the storage unit and the system control unit .

The system control unit includes for example a CPU a ROM and a RAM . The system control unit reads and executes various programs stored in the ROM the RAM C or the storage unit through the CPU . For example the system control unit functions as a Web browser by executing a Web browser program.

As shown in the user terminal device functioning as a computer is for example like the shop terminal device a personal computer or a mobile terminal such as a portable wireless phone including a smartphone and PDA and includes a communication unit a storage unit a display unit an example of the display means an operation unit an input output interface unit and a system control unit . Further the system control unit and the input output interface unit are connected through a system bus . Incidentally the configuration and function of the user terminal device are approximately the same as those of the shop terminal device and thus a detailed description thereof is omitted. Incidentally a Web page to search for product and also a Web page of search results are displayed in the display unit by a Web browser.

Next the operation of a first embodiment of the information processing system according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described using .

As shown in the information processing server acquires a compound word for training step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a compound word for training by referring to the training DB of the storage unit . Further the system control unit acquires a base word and a modifier portion of the compound word for training from the training DB . For example as shown in the system control unit acquires BESUTO vest as the base word of a compound word and FA fur as the modifier portion.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a training compound word acquisition means that acquires a compound word for training.

Next the information processing server acquires a classification item for training step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a classification item for training from the training DB of the storage unit . For example as shown in the system control unit acquires a classification item ZAIRYOU material of the compound word FA BESUTO fur vest .

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a training classification item acquisition means that acquires a classification item for training corresponding to a compound word for training acquired by the training compound word acquisition means by referring to a classification item storage means.

Next the information processing server acquires feature information step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a matrix of a feature vector by referring to the feature information DB . The system control unit acquires a matrix of the above feature vector including the lexico syntactic pattern portion of the feature vector the modification portion of the feature vector the part of speech portion of the feature vector the suffix portion of the feature vector and the meaning class portion of the feature vector.

Next the information processing server calculates a feature vector for the compound word using the feature information step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server calculates each component of a feature vector of the compound word containing the base word using the matrix of the above feature vector for the compound word and expands the compound word into the feature vector.

When for example the component of the lexico syntactic pattern portion of an feature vector is obtained the system control unit generates compound words for example FA NO BESUTO vest of fur FA SEI BESUTO vest made of fur . . . in which the lexico syntactic pattern of each component is applied to the base word for example BESUTO vest of a compound word for training and the modifier portion for example FA fur . Incidentally the modifier portion becomes WOKINGU YOU for walking like a compound word WOKINGU YOU SOKKUSU socks for walking but a compound word is generated by setting WOKINGU walking obtained by omitting the suffix YOU for as M and applying the lexico syntactic pattern.

As the lexico syntactic patterns as shown in all lexico syntactic patterns corresponding to the classification items are used. Incidentally instead of using all lexico syntactic patterns as shown in lexico syntactic patterns to be used may be limited to lexico syntactic patterns corresponding to each classification item to which the compound word for training belongs. Then the system control unit searches a predetermined database to determine whether as many generated compound words as a predetermined number or more are present. If as many generated compound words as the predetermined number or more are present 1 is set to the component corresponding to the lexico syntactic pattern and otherwise 0 is set. Incidentally the predetermined number may be the number of hits when the search server is used or the number of hits in the product DB in case that a generated compound word is set as the search keyword.

To obtain the component of the modification portion of an feature vector the system control unit applies the modifier portion of a compound word for training to each character string of the modifier and sets the component where applied to 1 and the component where not applied to 0 .

To obtain the component of the part of speech portion of a feature vector the system control unit determines the part of speech of the modifier portion of the compound word for training by morphological analysis or by using a database on part of speeches. The system control unit sets the component where the part of speech corresponds to 1 and the component where the part of speech does not correspond to 0 .

To obtain the component of the suffix portion of a feature vector the system control unit extracts a word at the end or at the start of the modifier portion of the compound word for training. The system control unit determines to which suffix of the suffix portion of a feature vector the extracted word corresponds and sets the component of the corresponding suffix to 1 and the component of the non corresponding suffix to 0 .

To obtain the component of the meaning class portion of an feature vector the system control unit determines to which meaning class the modifier portion of the compound word for training belongs by referring to the classification lexicon table and sets the component of the corresponding meaning class to 1 and the component of the non corresponding meaning class to 0 .

Next the information processing server does machine training using feature vectors and classification items for training to construct a classification model step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server constructs a classification model by inputting each of the calculated feature vectors and setting classification items for training as correct solutions teacher s data to cause machine training. Methods of machine training include for example MIRA Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm the decision tree and a combination of a plurality of SVM Support vector machine . Incidentally the classification model is represented by a weighting function a matrix of weight or the like. As the classification model a classification result of the compound word including the base word is output by calculating a product of a weighting function or the like and a feature vector input of a compound word.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a classification model construction means that constructs a classification model to distribute a compound word containing a base word into classification items from the compound word for training acquired by the training compound word acquisition means by doing machine training using an feature vector of the compound word for training generated by the feature vector generation means applying feature information and classification items for training acquired by the training classification item acquisition means.

Next an operation example of classifying a search result using a constructed classification model will be described using .

First the user searching for product inputs for example HERUMETTO into a product search Web page displayed in the display unit of the user terminal device . When the search button of the Web page is clicked the user terminal device transmits the search keyword to the information processing server .

As shown in the information processing server acquires a base word step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server receives a search keyword from the user terminal device temporarily stores the keyword in the storage unit or the RAM as examples of the storage means and then acquires the received search keyword from the storage unit or the RAM as a base word. Incidentally the information processing server may also acquire a keyword ranked in the top at the shopping site as a base word. In addition the information processing server may acquire a predetermined base word related to a special topic article to build a special topic page.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a base word acquisition means that acquires a base word to be a base. The information processing server also functions as an example of the base word acquisition means that acquires a search keyword from the user terminal device as a base word.

Next the information processing server acquires a compound word step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a compound word related to the acquired base word by referring to the compound word DB as an example of the compound word storage means. For example the system control unit acquires a compound word like KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children and JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle related to the base word HERUMETTO helmet . Incidentally the remaining portion after removing the base word from the compound word is the modifier portion like KODOMO YOU for children and JITENSHA YOU for bicycle . In addition the compound word may be the base word itself.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a compound word acquisition means that acquires a compound word in which a base word acquired by the base word acquisition means becomes a modifiee from the compound word storage means.

Next the information processing server acquires classification items step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires predetermined classification items for example User Target Purpose Function Accessory Shape Location Company Name Material and Design by referring to the classification item DB

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of the classification item acquisition means that acquires a classification item to classify a compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means from the classification item storage means.

Next the information processing server acquires feature information step S . More specifically like in step S the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a matrix of a feature vector by referring to the feature information DB .

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a feature information acquisition means that acquires feature information about a feature that provides a clue to classify a compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means by referring to a feature information storage means.

Next the information processing server calculates a feature vector for the compound word using the feature information step S . More specifically like in step S the system control unit of the information processing server calculates a feature vector for the compound word containing a base word using the feature information.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a feature vector generation means that generates a feature vector of a compound word using feature information for the compound word.

Next the information processing server distributes each compound word into classification items using a classification model and a feature vector step S . More specifically like in step S the system control unit of the information processing server calculates each component of a feature vector for each compound word. Then the system control unit distributes each compound word into classification items using the classification model constructed in step S and the feature vector of each compound word. For example KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children OTONA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for adults and the like are distributed into the classification item User JITENSHA YOU HERUMERTTO helmet for bicycle BAIKU YOU HERUMETTO helmet for motorbike and the like are distributed into the classification item Target and BOUSAI YOU HERUMETTO helmet for disaster prevention YAKYU YOU HERUMETTO helmet for baseball and the like are distributed into the classification item Purpose . Incidentally a compound word that does not fit to any classification item is distributed into Others . Incidentally the information processing server may distribute the base word itself into the classification item using the classification model.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of the compound word classification means that distributes a compound word containing a base word into a classification item acquired by the classification item acquisition means using a classification model generated in advance and feature information acquired by the feature information acquisition means for the compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word classification means that distributes a compound word containing a base word into a classification item using a classification model constructed by the classification model construction means and a feature vector of the compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means.

Next the information processing server conducts a search based on the base word step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server conducts a search using the base word as a search keyword by referring to the product DB and acquires a search result an example of base word related information such as the product name product image and the like obtained as hits in the search. Incidentally base word related information includes elements of a search result and also elements like individual special topic targets when a special topic page is built. As such elements for example individual search result targets and special topic targets can be cited and in the case of a product search individual product obtained as hits in a search based on a predetermined search keyword can be cited. The system control unit of the information processing server may acquire a search result by the search server through the network . In addition the information processing server may acquire base word related information about a predetermined base word related to a special topic article to build a special topic page. In a special topic article of JITENSHA bicycle for example product names an example of base word related information of product to be sold in connection with JITENSHA bicycle are acquired in advance. Also search results using such product names as search keywords may be used as base word related information.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a base word related information acquisition means that acquires base word related information containing a plurality of elements related to the base word based on the base word. The information processing server also functions as an example of the base word related information acquisition means that acquires a search result by conducting a search based on a search keyword.

Next the information processing server classifies a search result step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server compares a product name as a hit in the search and classified compound words and assigns the classification item of a compound word that is the same as or similar to the product name. Then the system control unit classifies the search result according to the assigned classification item. For example in a Web page as shown in a classification item region corresponding to each classification item is provided in a related product region . The classification item region has a classification item name attached thereto and an image of each product in the search result arranged therein. A name of the modifier portion of a compound word is attached to the lower neighborhood of each of the images . Incidentally a search result of the product name that does not fit to any of the predetermined classification items or a search result of the product name corresponding to the classification item Others is displayed in a search result region .

When a compound word is acquired based on text to be searched the classification in step S is sufficient but if the text to be searched and the source from which a compound word is acquired are different even if a classification item is present a search result may not be classified into the classification item and thus such a classification item may not be displayed.

Incidentally the order of arranging images in the classification item region may be as shown in Formula 6 stated below in descending order of score as a function of the base word suffix and other words. The system control unit calculates scores of Formula 6 for compound words KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children OTONA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for adults . . . and causes each of the classification item regions to display information about compound words of top five scores of Formula 6 .

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a base word related information classification means that classifies each of at least a portion of elements contained in base word related information acquired by the base word related information acquisition means into one of classification items in accordance with a classification result by the compound word classification means. The information processing server also functions as an example of the base word related information classification means that classifies each of at least a portion of elements contained in a search result searched by the base word related information acquisition means into one of classification items in accordance with a classification result by the compound word classification means.

Incidentally the information processing server may acquire a search result based on a base word an example of a first search result using a base word as a search keyword and a search result based on each compound word an example of a second search result using a compound word as a search keyword to display the search result based on each compound word an example of the second search result in the related product region and a search result an example of at least a portion of the first search result obtained by deleting a portion common to the search result based on the compound word from the search result based on the base word an example of the first search result in the search result region . More specifically the information processing server compares elements individual product or the like of search results obtained as hits in a search in the first search result and the second search result and deletes elements that are the same as elements in the second search result from elements in the first search result.

For example the information processing server removes search results of compound words such as the search keywords KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children and JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle from a search result of the search keyword HERUMETTO helmet by comparing URL Uniform Resource Locator product names or the like of elements of search results and deleting the same elements. Incidentally when acquiring a first search result the above processing may be omitted by generating a search formula that deletes each compound word in the search based on a base word. Further the information processing server arranges a product image as a first hit in a search result of the compound word KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children a product image as a first hit in a search result of the compound word OTONA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for adults and the like as the images in the related product region . Top hits of a search result based on each compound word may be displayed when the image or the name of the modifier portion is clicked. As an example of the compound word among related words related to a base word a related word having a suffix like KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children will be called a typed related word.

As shown in the information processing server may generate the Web page an example of search result information described in HTML or the like to cause the display unit of the user terminal device to display by distinguishing a portion of the first search result the search result region and the second search result the related product region . In the Web page a portion of the first search result the search result region and the second search result the related product region are displayed in distinguished regions.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a search result acquisition means that acquires a first search result using a base word as a search keyword and a second search result using a compound word as a search keyword. The information processing server also functions as an example of a search result information generation means that generates search result information so that at least a portion of a first search result and a second search result acquired by the search result acquisition means are made to be distinguished and displayed on the screen of a display means. The information processing server also functions as an example of the search result information generation means that generates search result information so that a search result obtained by removing a portion of a second search result from a first search result is made to be displayed at least as a portion of the first search result.

Next the information processing server outputs the search result step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server transmits information about the Web page to the user terminal device as the search result. Then the system control unit of the user terminal device receives search result information and displays the Web page as shown in in the display unit .

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of an output means that outputs base word related information classified by the base word related information classification means.

According to the present embodiment described above a base word to be abase for example a search keyword a compound word in which the base word becomes a modifiee classification items to classify the compound word and feature information for example a matrix of an feature vector about an feature that provides a clue to classify the compound word are acquired the compound word containing the base word is distributed into a classification item using a classification model classification model constructed by machine training generated in advance and the feature information for example an feature vector calculated by using a matrix of an feature vector for the compound word base word related information based on the base word and containing a plurality of elements related to the base word is acquired for example a search result based on a search keyword is acquired each of at least a portion of elements contained in the base word related information is classified into one of the classification items in accordance with a result of the classification and the classified base word related information is output to classify the base word related information according to classification item and therefore mixing of the base word related information is distributed out based on the classification item so that a display that is easy for the user to view can be provided.

When a compound word for training is acquired classification items for training corresponding to the acquired compound word for training are acquired a classification model is constructed by doing machine training using an feature vector of the compound word for training generated from the acquired compound word for training and the classification items for training an feature vector of the compound word is generated using feature information for the acquired compound word and the compound word containing a base word is distributed using the constructed classification model and feature vector of the acquired compound word the classification model to provide a display that is easy for the user to view can be realized by machine training with high precision. More specifically when compared with a case of heuristic training various features can be considered by using machine training so that high precision can be realized and various kinds of information can be effectively used for classification.

When classification items into which compound words are distributed are output to the user terminal device from among classification items into which compound words are distributed to cause the user to select a specific classification item a selection result of the classification items is acquired from the user terminal device and base word related information acquired based on the acquired selection result of the classification items and abase word is classified in accordance with a classification result a display that is easy for the user to view user desired information in accordance with the user s selection can be provided.

When a search keyword is acquired from the user terminal device as a base word a search result is acquired by conducting a search based on the search keyword and the search result obtained by conducting a search is classified according to classification item a display that is easy for the user to view information searched for by the user can be provided.

By acquiring a first search result using a base word as a search keyword and a second search result using a generated compound word as a search keyword and generating the Web page an example of search result information so that at least a portion of the acquired first search result and the second search result are made to be distinguished and displayed on the screen of the display unit mixing of search targets searched for based on a search keyword can be reduced for display.

When search result information is generated so that a search result obtained by removing a portion of a second search result from a first search result is made to be displayed as at least a portion of the first search result mixing of the first search result and the second search result is eliminated which makes product related to the second search result more noticeable. In addition the user is more likely to notice a search result based on a compound word.

Next the operation of a second embodiment of the information processing system will be described using figures. Incidentally the same reference numerals are used for the same units as those in the first embodiment or corresponding units and only different configuration and operations will be described. This also applies to other embodiments and modifications.

First as the operation of the second embodiment of an information processing system in the present invention an operation example of generating a classification dictionary will be described using .

As shown in the information processing server acquires a keyword matching a predetermined lexico syntactic pattern and a category ID from a query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires user related lexico syntactic patterns X YOU for X and X MUKE intended for X by referring to the LSP DB . Then the system control unit acquires keywords matching these lexico syntactic patterns and category IDs of the category to which the keywords belong by referring to the query log DB

Next the information processing server extracts keywords corresponding to HITO human step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server extracts a word corresponding to a word X of the lexico syntactic pattern from the acquired keywords. Then the system control unit determines whether the word X expresses a human HITO human based on a dictionary in which expressions indicating a human are collected the system control unit determines for example whether a word in the dictionary and the word match . In the case of DANSEI YOU for men for example the word X becomes DANSEI men and DANSEI men is registered in the dictionary and so is determined to be HITO human . Thus if the word X is determined to express HITO human the system control unit extracts keywords corresponding to HITO human from keywords matching the lexico syntactic pattern by adopting the original keyword containing the word X. Then the system control unit associates and stores the keyword corresponding to HITO human and the category ID in the storage unit .

Next the information processing server extracts keywords appearing in a predetermined number of categories or more step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server refers to the storage unit to count an appearance number of some keyword appearing in categories based on the category ID. Then the system control unit extracts keywords whose appearance number is equal to a predetermined number or more.

Next the information processing server registers the keywords in the classification dictionary step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server registers for example extracted keywords like SHINIA senior JUNIA junior BEBI baby User and DAISEI men in the classification dictionary DB

As shown in the information processing server acquires a keyword from a query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires keywords by referring to the query log DB

Next the information processing server calculates an animacy score step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server extracts a keyword X that appears as many times as a predetermined number or more in the query log DB . Then the system control unit calculates an animacy score Score anim X like Formula 1 by referring to a database related to dependency of the classification dictionary DB .

Here X a b is the frequency of Xab appearance in a database related to dependency of the classification dictionary DB . For example X a b is a value indicating how often the phrase X GA IRU X is present appears in a database related to dependency.

Animacy is a kind of grammatical category and the property as a living being of a target indicated by a noun pronoun or the like.

In Japanese for a word of high animacy for example X KODOMO X child the frequency of appearance of KODOMO GA IRU a child is present is greater than that of KODOMO GA ARU there is a child . For a word of low animacy for example X ISU X chair the frequency of appearance of ISU GA ARU there is a chair is greater than that of ISU GA IRU a chair is present . Therefore for a word of high animacy the value of X GA IRU be present increases and also the value of Score anim X increases.

In English for a word of high animacy for example X man the frequency of appearance of the man s face is greater than that of the face of the man . For a word of low animacy for example X clock the frequency of appearance of the face of the clock is greater than that of the clock s face .

Here K is a predetermined word like face . Incidentally a score about animacy may be calculated by making use of characteristics of each language.

Next the information processing server calculates a buy and sell score step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server calculates a buy and sell score Score sell buy X like Formula 3 for the keyword X that appears as many times as the predetermined number or more in the query log DB by referring to a database related to dependency of the classification dictionary DB Score sell buy sell buy 3 

The value of the buy and sell score increases with an increasing frequency of appearance of a phrase related to buying and selling like X WO KAU buy X or X WO URU sell X in a database related to dependency.

In English the system control unit may calculate a buy and sell score according to Formula 4 . Score sell buy sell buy 4 

Incidentally purchase may be used instead of buy or together. A score about buying and selling may be calculated by making use of characteristics of each language.

Next the information processing server calculates an object score step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server calculates an object score Score obj X from an animacy score and a buy and sell score according to Formula 5 . Score obj 1 Score anim Score sell buy 5 

As shown in Formula 5 the value of an object score increases with a decreasing animacy score and an increasing buy and sell score.

Next the information processing server extracts keywords whose object score is equal to a predetermined value or more step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server leaves among acquired keywords keywords whose object score is equal to a predetermined value or more.

Next the information processing server registers the keywords in the classification dictionary step S .

As shown in the information processing server acquires keywords matching a predetermined lexico syntactic pattern from a query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a function related lexico syntactic pattern X KINOU TSUKI with X function by referring to the LSP DB . Then the system control unit acquires keywords matching the lexico syntactic pattern by referring to the query log DB

Next the information processing server extracts keywords whose frequency of appearance is equal to a predetermined number or more step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server leaves keywords among acquired keywords regarding X KINOU TSUKI with X function whose frequency of appearance in the product DB is equal to a predetermined number or more.

Next the information processing server registers the keywords in the classification dictionary step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server registers extracted keywords for example SHOUSHU deodorization TAISHIN earthquake proof and SAIZU CHOUSEI size adjustment in the function word dictionary of the classification dictionary DB . In this manner a function word dictionary is generated.

Next the generation of a shape word dictionary and a material word dictionary will be described using .

As shown in the information processing server acquires keywords matching a predetermined suffix from a query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a suffix KATA type by referring to the suffix DB . Then the system control unit acquires keywords matching X KATA X type by referring to the query log DB

Subsequently the information processing server extracts keywords appearing in a predetermined database step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires lexico syntactic patterns X NOYOUNA KATACHI shape like X X NADONO KATACHI shape such as X and X NADONO KATACHI shape X or the like by referring to the LSP DB . Then the system control unit transmits keywords fit for X NOYOUNA KATACHI shape like X X NADONO KATACHI shape such as X or X NADONO KATACHI shape X or the like obtained by applying the lexico syntactic patterns to keywords matching the suffix pattern X GATA X type to the search server as search keywords and leaves keywords whose number of hits is equal to a predetermined number or more.

Then the information processing server registers the keywords in the classification dictionary step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server registers extracted keywords for example MIKAZUKI crescent and DAEN ellipse in the shape word dictionary of the classification dictionary DB . In this manner a shape word dictionary is generated.

First the information processing server acquires keywords matching a predetermined suffix from a query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a suffix SEI made of by referring to the suffix DB . Then the system control unit acquires keywords matching X SEI made of X by referring to the query log DB . The system control unit of the information processing server also acquires lexico syntactic patterns X NOYOUNA SOZAI material like X X NADONO SOZAI material such as X and X NADONO SOZAI material X or the like by referring to the LSP DB . Then the system control unit transmits keywords obtained by applying the lexico syntactic patterns to keywords matching the suffix pattern X SEI made of X to suit X NOYOUNA SOZAI material like X X NADONO SOZAI material such as X or X NADONO SOZAI material X or the like to the search server as search keywords to leave keywords whose number of hits is equal to a predetermined number or more.

Next the information processing server registers the keywords in the classification dictionary step S . More specifically the system control unit registers extracted keywords such as KAWA leather GOMU rubber and GARASU glass in the material word dictionary of the classification dictionary DB . In this manner a material word dictionary is generated.

Next the generation of a location word dictionary and a company name word dictionary will be described using .

As shown in the information processing server acquires keywords matching a predetermined suffix from a query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a suffix SAN produced in for a location name dictionary and suffixes SHA company and SEI made by for a company name word by referring to the suffix DB . Then for a location word dictionary the system control unit acquires keywords matching X SAN produced in X by referring to the query log DB . For a company name word dictionary the system control unit acquires keywords matching X SHA X company by referring to the query log DB

Incidentally for a company name word dictionary the system control unit may acquire keywords matching X SEI made by X and further leave keywords matching BURANDO NO X X of brand BURANDO X brand X MEKA NO X X of maker or MEKA X maker X . Alternatively the system control unit may acquire keywords matching X SEI made by X and leave keywords whose number of hits is equal to a predetermined number or more after conducting a search using BURANDO NO X X of brand BURANDO X brand X MEKA NO X X of maker and MEKA X maker X as search keywords.

Next the information processing server registers the keywords in the classification dictionary step S . More specifically for a location word dictionary the system control unit of the information processing server registers extracted keywords for example TOKYO Tokyo HIROSHIMA Hiroshima and ITARIA Italy in the location word dictionary of the classification dictionary DB . For a company name word dictionary the system control unit registers keywords of extracted companies brand names and product names in the company name word dictionary of the classification dictionary DB . In this manner a company name word dictionary is generated. Incidentally though called the company name word dictionary in the present embodiment company name words including brand names and the like are generically called company name words.

As described above the information processing server functions as an example of a classification dictionary generation means that generates a classification dictionary by deciding the association of a classification item and a predetermined word in accordance with the appearance number of the predetermined word appearing in a predetermined database or by deciding association of each of the classification items and the predetermined word by extracting the predetermined word suited to an extraction pattern corresponding to the classification item from the predetermined database.

Next an operation example according to the second embodiment of search result classification in an information processing system will be described using .

Next the information processing server acquires a compound word step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a compound word by acquiring the compound word from the storage unit or the RAM according to a subroutine to acquire a compound word from the acquired base word. Incidentally the acquisition of a compound word will be described in detail in the subroutine to acquire a compound word. The information processing server may acquire like in step S a compound word related to the acquired base word by referring to the compound word DB

The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word acquisition means that acquires a compound word in which a base word acquired by the base word acquisition means becomes a modifiee.

Next the information processing server acquires information on the suffix and classification dictionary step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires information on the suffix and classification dictionary about how to use feature information such as the suffix and classification dictionary in a classification model generated in advance using the classification dictionary by referring to the feature information DB . Incidentally the classification model generated in advance using the classification dictionary will be described in detail in a subroutine to distribute a compound word.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of the feature information acquisition means that acquires feature information about a feature that provides a clue to classify a compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means by referring to the feature information storage means. The information processing server also functions as an example of the feature information acquisition means that acquires a classification dictionary that associates each of the classification items with predetermined words by referring to the feature information storage means.

Next the information processing server acquires a modifier portion with respect to the base word from the compound word step S . More specifically when the base word is HERUMETTO helmet and the compound word is KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children the system control unit of the information processing server acquires the modifier portion KODOMO YOU for children .

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a modifier portion acquisition means that acquires a modifier portion with respect to a base word of a compound word.

Next the information processing server acquires a suffix from the modifier portion step S . More specifically when the modifier portion is KODOMO YOU for children the system control unit of the information processing server acquires a suffix YOU for .

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a suffix acquisition means that acquires a suffix from a modifier portion acquired by the modifier portion acquisition means.

Next the information processing server distributes the compound word into a classification item using the classification model generated in advance using the classification dictionary and feature information for the modifier portion step S . For example compound words like KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children and OTONA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for adults are distributed into as in step S the classification item User . Incidentally distributing of a compound word will be described in detail in a subroutine to distribute a compound word.

The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word classification means that distributes a compound word containing a base word into a classification item acquired by the classification item acquisition means using a classification model generated in advance and feature information acquired by the feature information acquisition means for the compound word acquired by the compound word acquisition means. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word classification means that distributes a compound word containing a base word into a classification item using a classification model generated in advance using the classification dictionary stored in the feature information storage means and feature information for a modifier portion acquired by the modifier portion acquisition means.

Next like in step S the information processing server conducts a search based on the base word step S .

Next the information processing server acquires another word step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server acquires other words used together with the base word by referring to the query log DB . When the base word is HERUMETTO helmet the system control unit of the information processing server acquires KODOMO child JITENSHA bicycle BOUSAI disaster prevention or the like as other words by referring to the query log DB

Next the information processing server generates compound word candidates step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server generates compound word candidates related to the base word by combining the base word and other words through the subroutine to generate compound word candidates. The generated compound word candidates are stored in the storage unit or the RAM . Here as compound word examples compound word candidates combining the base word and other words like KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle and JITENSHA TSUKI HERUMETTO helmet with bicycle . Incidentally the generation of compound word candidates will be described in detail in a subroutine to generate compound word candidates.

Next the information processing server decides compound words from the candidates step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server calculates a score for each compound word candidate from generated compound word candidates to decide compound words having a score equal to a predetermined value or more. If the scores of KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children and JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle are larger than the predetermined value and the score of JITENSHA TSUKI HERUMETTO helmet with bicycle is smaller than the predetermined value KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle are decided as compound words. Then the system control unit temporarily stores the decided compound words in the storage unit or the RAM as examples of the storage means. Incidentally the decision of a compound word will be described in detail in a subroutine to decide a compound word.

As shown in the information processing server acquires suffixes step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server reads out YOU for TSUKI with SEI made of SAN produced in KATA type BAN board BAN version GARA pattern and IRO color as suffix characters examples of the intermediate character by referring to the suffix DB

Next the information processing server generates compound word candidates from the base word other words and suffixes step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server generates compound word candidates combining a read suffix character the base word and another word by referring to the suffix DB . Such a suffix character is placed between the base word and another word to generate a compound word candidate. When for example the base word is HERUMETTO helmet and another word is JITENSHA bicycle JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle JITENSHA TSUKI HERUMETTO helmet with bicycle JITENSHA SEI HERUMETTO helmet made of bicycle . . . HERUMETTO YOU JITENSHA bicycle for helmet . . . HERUMETTO SEI JITENSHA bicycle made of helmet and the like are generated as compound word examples. At this point compound word candidates also in the order of the base word a suffix and another word like HERUMETTO YOU JITENSHA bicycle for helmet are generated. HERUMETTO YOU RAITO light for helmet RAITO TSUKI HERUMETTO helmet with light . . . KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children and the like when another word is other than JITENSHA bicycle are generated

When the subroutine terminates the information processing server performs processing in step S. Thus the information processing server functions as an example of a compound word candidate generation means that generates a compound word candidate from a base word. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word candidate generation means that generates a candidate by combining a base word and another word. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word candidate generation means that generates a candidate by combining a base word and a word other than the base word. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word candidate generation means that generates a candidate by an intermediate character placed between a base word and another word.

More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server specifies one compound word candidate for example JITEMSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle in order from among compound word candidates generated in step S and stored in the storage unit or the RAM

Next the information processing server calculates a frequency of appearance of the base word and another word in the query log step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server calculates a frequency of appearance Nin which both of the base word and another word appear together by referring to the query log DB . Here k1 represents the base word and k2 represents another word. When for example as shown in the base word is HERUMETTO helmet and another word is JITENSHA bicycle the system control unit of the information processing server reads as many pieces of data of the base word HERUMETTO helmet and the other word JITENSHA bicycle as there are from the query log DB and sets the number thereof as the frequency of appearance N.

Next the information processing server obtains the number of shops that include compound word candidates in their product description step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server obtains the product ID by specifying product of an specified compound word candidate for example JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet or bicycle or product used by a compound word candidate in the product description by referring to the product DB . Then the system control unit of the information processing server calculates the number of shops dealing in product Mby counting shops that deal in product of a compound word candidate or use a compound word candidate in their product description based on the product ID by referring to the shop DB . Here s represents the suffix such as YOU for TSUKI with SET made of SAN produced in KATA type BAN board BAN version GARA pattern and IRO color the preposition such as for with and in a functional expression such as for the purpose of .

Next the information processing server calculates a score using the frequency of appearance and the number of shops step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server calculates using the frequency of appearance Nand the number of shops Ma score Score k1 s k2 as a function of the base word suffix and another word according to Score 12 log log 6 

Next the information processing server determines whether the score is equal to a predetermined value or more step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server determines whether the calculated score Score is equal to a predetermined value or more. Here the score Score k1 s k2 indicates a large value when the base word k1 and the other word k2 are words frequently used by the user who searches for product and the compound word k1 s k2 is a word frequently used by each shop. log N indicates a state on the demand side of product and log M indicates a state on the supply side of product.

Next if the score is not equal to a predetermined value or more step S NO the information processing server deletes the compound word candidate step S . More specifically if the score Score k1 s k2 is less than a predetermined value the system control unit of the information processing server regards the compound word candidate as inappropriate as a compound word and deletes the word from the storage unit or the RAM

If the score is equal to a predetermined value or more step S YES the information processing server proceeds to the processing in step S without deleting the specified compound word candidate.

Thus the information processing server functions as an example of the compound word decision means that decides a compound word. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word decision means that decides a compound word in accordance with the number of shops after obtaining the number of shops that deal in the product by including a compound word candidate generated by the compound word candidate generation means in their product description. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word decision means that decides a compound word in accordance with the appearance number in which a base word appears in a predetermined database. The information processing server also functions as an example of the compound word decision means that decides a compound word in accordance with the number of hits of a search using a compound word candidate generated by the compound word candidate generation means as the search keyword.

Next the information processing server determines whether all candidates have been specified step S . More specifically the system control unit of the information processing server determined whether all compound word candidates stored in the storage unit or the RAM have been specified. If all candidates have not yet been specified step S NO the information processing server moves to the processing in step S.

If all candidates have been specified step S YES the processing of the subroutine terminates and the information processing server performs the processing in step S.

According to the present embodiment described above a base word to be a base a compound word in which the base word becomes a modifiee classification items to classify the compound word and feature information for example information about the suffix and classification dictionary about a feature that provides a clue to classify the compound word are acquired the compound word containing the base word is distributed into the acquired classification item using a classification model for example rules as shown in generated in advance and the acquired feature information for example the compound word is distributed into a classification item using for example rules as shown in for the compound word base word related information based on the base word and containing a plurality of elements related to the base word is acquired for example a search result based on a search keyword is acquired each of at least a portion of elements contained in the base word related information is classified into one of the classification items in accordance with a result of the classification and the classified base word related information is output to classify the base word related information according to classification item and therefore mixing of the base word related information is distributed out based on the classification item so that a display that is easy for the user to view can be provided.

When a classification dictionary associating each classification item and a predetermined word is stored a modifier portion with respect to a base word of a compound word is acquired the classification dictionary associating the classification items and predetermined words is acquired by referring to the feature information database and the compound word containing the base word is distributed into a classification item using a classification model generated in advance using the classification dictionary stored in the feature information database and feature information about the acquired modifier portion the compound word can efficiently be distributed into the classification item according to the classification dictionary.

When a suffix is acquired from an acquired modifier portion and a compound word containing a base word is distributed into a classification item using a classification model generated in advance using a classification dictionary stored in the feature information database and feature information for the modifier portion excluding the suffix the compound word can efficiently be distributed into the classification item according to predetermined rules.

When a classification dictionary is generated by deciding the association of each classification item and a predetermined word in accordance with the appearance number of the predetermined word appearing in a predetermined storage means such as the product DB or by deciding association of each of the classification items and the predetermined word by extracting the predetermined word suited to an extraction pattern corresponding to the classification item from the predetermined storage means a classification dictionary suited to the predetermined storage means can be constructed.

When compound word candidates are generated from a base word and a compound word is decided from the candidates a more appropriate compound word can be generated from the generated candidates.

When the number of shops dealing in product by including the generated compound word candidate in their product description is obtained and a compound word is decided in accordance with the number of shops a more appropriate compound word used generally on a shopping site operated by the information processing server or in a network can be generated.

When a compound word is decided in accordance with the appearance number for example the frequency of appearance N of abase word appearing in a predetermined storage means such as the query log DB a more appropriate compound word can be generated from a base word generally used on a shopping site or in a network.

When compound word candidates are generated by acquiring other words different from a base word and combining the base word and the other words a more appropriate compound word can be generated. Many compound word candidates can be generated by combining the base word and other words and candidates can then be narrowed down to a more appropriate compound word. Further still more compound word candidates can be generated by combining the base word other words and an intermediate word

Incidentally when products are registered in the shop terminal device the present embodiment can be used to check whether a product name to be registered is appropriate or to obtain an appropriate product name of related product. A base word is transmitted from the shop terminal device to the information processing server and the information processing server decides a compound word in S. Then the information processing server transmits the compound word decided in S to the shop terminal device . The compound word is displayed in the display unit of the shop terminal device .

Incidentally when calculating the frequency of appearance Nin step S instead of the query log DB as an example of the predetermined storage means the system control unit of the information processing server may obtain the number of hits when the base word and other words are set as search keywords for example HERUMETTO JITENSHA helmet bicycle in the product DB and set as the frequency of appearance N.

When obtaining the frequency of appearance Nand the number of shops M the frequency of appearance or the number of shops in the network may be obtained without being limited to the shopping site of the information processing server . When for example the number of shops in the network is obtained URLs where product is sold may be counted after conducting a search based on a compound word candidate JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle .

In step S the system control unit of the information processing server may obtain the number of hits of a search using a generated compound word candidate as a search keyword. The number of hits of a search may be the number of hits in the product DB or the number of hits in the network . The system control unit of the information processing server uses instead of M the number of hits to calculate Score k1 s k2 . The system control unit of the information processing server may also calculate Score k1 s k2 from the number of hits the frequency of appearance N and the number of shops M.

When the compound word is decided in accordance with the number of hits of a search using a generated compound word candidate as a search keyword a compound word used generally on a shopping site or in a network can be decided so that a more appropriate compound word can be generated.

The system control unit of the information processing server may also extract for example other words JITENSHA bicycle and KODOMO child from JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle and KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children stored as base words by referring to the query log DB

In addition a base word of the query log DB containing the base word HERUMETTO helmet may be adopted as a compound word. For example the system control unit of the information processing server extracts JITENSHA YOU HERUMETTO helmet for bicycle and KODOMO YOU HERUMETTO helmet for children stored in a base word area of the query log DB as compound word candidates from the base word HERUMETTO helmet .

As shown in the information processing server may generate a Web page as a special topic page related to a base word. The Web page includes a base word name a classification item name a compound word name and an image for each product. The base word name indicates a base word. The classification item name indicates one classification item selected from a plurality of classification items. The compound word name indicates a compound word related to the base word. The image of product is an image of product corresponding to a compound word related to a base word.

In step S or S the information processing server acquires for example one set word JITENSHA bicycle as a base word base word name .

In step S or S the information processing server sets one classification item classification item name from classification items into which compound words related to the base word are distributed.

Next as shown in the information processing server generates based on a compound word compound word name related to the one set classification item the Web page in which the compound word names and the images of product are arranged for the base word name and the classification item name . The information processing server arranges the compound word names product names and the images of the product in the Web page . Incidentally the compound word names and the images of the product correspond to elements contained in base word related information. In addition the base word JITENSHA bicycle may be a similar word SAIKURU cycle .

As shown in the information processing server may generate a Web page for mobile terminals. In step S or S the information processing server acquires a search keyword input into the Web page as a base word.

After compound words being distributed into classification items in step S or S the information processing server conducts a search based on the search keyword and acquires a search result.

In step S or S the information processing server generates the Web page for mobile terminals by classification item. In the Web page images of hit product are arranged by classification item classification item name . When the image of product is tapped or touched a search result of a compound word corresponding to the classification item is displayed.

If as shown in the display unit is narrow a rough display by a compound word corresponding to the classification item can be presented to the user improving user s convenience.
