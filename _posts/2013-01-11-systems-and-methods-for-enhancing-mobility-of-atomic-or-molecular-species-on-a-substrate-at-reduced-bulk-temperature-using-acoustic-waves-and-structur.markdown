This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802 09 C 0001 awarded by the Department of the Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.

A variety of gas phase techniques for depositing materials on a substrate are known in the art including physical vapor deposition PVD based techniques such as evaporation sputtering molecular beam epitaxy MBE and pulsed laser deposition PLD and a wide variety of chemical vapor deposition CVD based techniques including atomic layer deposition ALD . These techniques are ubiquitous in the development of novel materials and films that have a wide range of applications from consumer electronics to biology or medicine from architectural engineering to aerospace. Both PVD and CVD based techniques may include exposing the substrate to an atomic or molecular species at a set of processing parameters that are selected based on the deposition technique to be used the material to be deposited and the substrate upon which the material is to be deposited.

For example schematically illustrate structures that may be formed during a previously known gas phase material deposition technique. As illustrated in substrate may be exposed to an atomic or molecular species that is in the gas phase. In the evaporation and MBE techniques such gas phase atomic or molecular species may be formed by heating and evaporating a material using a variety of known power sources including a resistive or radiative heater or an electron beam. The PLD technique is similar but irradiates a material using a pulsed laser to generate gas phase atomic or molecular species . In the sputtering technique such gas phase atomic or molecular species may be formed by bombarding a material with energetic particles so as to liberate molecules of the material into the gas phase the energetic particles may be generated using a variety of known sources including a plasma an ion source a particle accelerator or a radioactive material. In the CVD and ALD techniques such gas phase atomic or molecular species may be stored separately in gaseous form and introduced to a reaction chamber that contains the substrate the species optionally may be activated using a suitable source such as with a plasma combustion or thermal decomposition.

As illustrated in gas phase atomic or molecular species may adsorb onto substrate forming adsorbed atomic or molecular species . Upon such adsorption atomic or molecular species may form a molecular bond with substrate e.g. a covalent or ionic bond or a bond based on dipole dipole interactions London dispersion force or hydrogen bonding. Upon such bonding with substrate atomic or molecular species may directly form material disposed on substrate as illustrated in or may first undergo a further chemical reaction e.g. with substrate with another atomic or molecular species adsorbed to substrate or with another gas phase atomic or molecular species to form material illustrated in . In many situations the adsorbed atomic or molecular species may move along the surface to find the right accommodation e.g. site on substrate or another gas phase or adsorbed atomic or molecular species for the ultimate reaction to occur. At the macroscopic level the processing parameters used during a given material deposition technique may include the type and power level of any source selected to assist with generating or activating gas phase atomic or molecular species any electrical bias that may be applied to substrate any heating or cooling that may be applied to gas phase atomic or molecular species or to substrate the flow rate or concentration of gas phase atomic or molecular species the pressure or partial pressure of gas phase atomic or molecular species and the amount of time with which substrate is exposed to gas phase atomic or molecular species .

At the microscopic level the energy barrier that may be required to convert gas phase atomic or molecular species illustrated in into material illustrated in may be far lower than the total amount of energy provided by the processing parameters. In this regard at the microscopic level substrate may be viewed as an energy sink toward which atomic or molecular species is attracted and additional energy may be applied to agitate adsorbed atomic or molecular species that is to enhance the mobility of species on substrate to convert species into material . The conversion of species to material thus may be considered to have two different types of energy deficits the first arising from the particular chemical reactivity of atomic or molecular species and the second being of a more general thermodynamic and kinetic nature.

The processing parameters may nominally provide the amount of energy that may be required at the microscopic level to overcome both the first and second types of energy deficits. However such processing parameters may be applied at the macroscopic or bulk level and thus applied to the entirety of substrate and to all gas phase species and all adsorbed species . For example as illustrated in substrate may be disposed on heater that heats substrate to a temperature sufficient to enhance the mobility of absorbed species to convert such species into material . However such bulk heating may produce a number of engineering constraints that may limit the type of material that may be deposited on a particular substrate . Specifically the material from substrate is made including the materials of any structures buried therein must be compatible with the bulk heating temperature used while the substrate is maintained at the bulk heating temperature other objects in the reaction chamber preferably are kept sufficiently cool to inhibit contamination and supporting hardware to maintain substantially uniform heating cooling or temperature stability must be provided to maintain uniform growth of material on substrate . In particular elevated temperatures may cause materials buried within substrate to diffuse into each other or into substrate thus damaging the materials.

Thus what is needed is a way to enhance mobility of adsorbed atomic or molecular species on a substrate while reducing the bulk temperature of the substrate.

Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for enhancing mobility of atomic or molecular species on a substrate at reduced bulk temperature using acoustic waves and structures formed using the same. In particular the energy from a pulsed laser under controlled parameters may be converted into acoustic waves that propagate across a substrate and enhance molecular mobility at distance removed from the source of the acoustic waves. With this ability embodiments of the invention allow for the development of a non contact non intrusive method for preparing materials that may be adapted for use with existing materials processing reaction chambers. The enhanced mobility induced by acoustic waves additionally or alternatively may be used to remove atomic or molecular species adsorbed on a substrate surface as a way of cleaning or sterilizing the substrate or to inhibit specific molecular species from ever residing on a surface or to gather or pattern adsorbed atomic or molecular species to one or more selected locations on a surface.

Under one aspect of the present invention a method for enhancing mobility of an atomic or molecular species on a substrate may include exposing a first region of a substrate to an atomic or molecular species that forms a molecular bond with the substrate in the first region directing a laser pulse to a second region of the substrate so as to generate an acoustic wave in the second region the acoustic wave having spatial and temporal characteristics selected to alter the molecular bond and transmitting the acoustic wave from the second region to the first region the acoustic wave altering the molecular bond between the substrate and the atomic or molecular species to enhance mobility of the atomic or molecular species on the substrate in the first region.

Responsive to the altering of the molecular bond the atomic or molecular species may translate e.g. hop or jump laterally across the substrate in a direction defined by the spatial and temporal characteristics of the acoustic wave. Alternatively or additionally responsive to the altering of the molecular bond the atomic or molecular species may form a material e.g. may form nanometer sheets of graphene films by epitaxial growth . Alternatively responsive to the altering of the molecular bond the atomic or molecular species may dissociate e.g. shed atoms to form more chemically energetic species such as radicals that induce surface chemical reaction e.g. formation of graphene by methane ethane carbon source adsorption . The substrate may have a damage threshold temperature and wherein in the absence of the acoustic wave the atomic or molecular species may form the material or otherwise diffuse only at a reaction temperature that is higher than the damage threshold temperature of the substrate. For example the substrate may include an integrated circuit a chalcogenide glass a ZBLAN glass or a polymer such as polycarbonate poly methyl methacrylate polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene terephthalate. The material may include silicon nitride graphene carbon nanotubes diamond titanium dioxide titanium boride zirconium oxide yttria stabilized zirconium boron carbide boron nitride or metal. Alternatively there may be the desire to form a material e.g. graphene using a convenient molecular source e.g. methane but at much lower temperatures e.g. currently 800 C. or above may be required .

In some embodiments the laser pulse has a temporal duration of less than about 1 nanosecond at FWHM or 1 picosecond at FWHM or less than about 100 femtoseconds at FWHM. The laser pulse may be focused to a point in the second region of the substrate and the acoustic wave is transmitted radially from the point. Alternatively the laser pulse may be focused to a line in the second region of the substrate and the acoustic wave is transmitted linearly from the line as a plane wave. Alternatively the laser pulse may be focused to form a pattern in the second region of the substrate so as to generate a complex radiating acoustic pattern.

In some embodiments the acoustic wave includes a Rayleigh wave which may have a bandwidth of 100 MHz at FWHM or more.

The molecular bond may include a covalent bond an ionic bond or a bond based on dipole dipole interactions London dispersion force or hydrogen bonding.

Under another aspect of the present invention a structure may include a substrate having a damage threshold temperature and a material disposed on the substrate the material having a reaction temperature that is higher than the damage threshold temperature of the substrate.

The substrate may include an integrated circuit a chalcogenide glass a ZBLAN glass or a polymer such as polycarbonate poly methyl methacrylate polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene terephthalate. The material may include silicon nitride graphene carbon nanotubes diamond titanium dioxide titanium boride zirconium oxide yttria stabilized zirconium boron carbide boron nitride or metal.

Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for enhancing mobility of molecular species on a substrate at reduced bulk temperature using acoustic waves and structures formed using the same. In particular embodiments of the present invention may provide systems and methods of preparing materials or processing substrates by enhancing the mobility or diffusion of molecular species on a substrate surface by irradiating the substrate with a relatively short laser pulse to generate an acoustic wave that then alters a molecular bond e.g. alters the strength of a molecular bond between the atomic or molecular species and substrate. Such alteration enhances the mobility of the atomic or molecular species on the substrate by reducing chemical bonding barriers that may entrap an atomic or molecular species at a specific site on the substrate. For example responsive to the alteration of the molecular bond the atomic or molecular species may translate laterally across the substrate in a direction defined by the spatial and temporal characteristics of the acoustic wave which in turn are defined by the spatial and temporal characteristics of the laser pulse. Or for example responsive to the alteration of the molecular bond the atomic or molecular species may chemically react to form a material. As such by enhancing mobility of the atomic or molecular species on the substrate using acoustic waves the temperature of the substrate may be reduced relative to what otherwise may have been required to achieve comparable mobility via bulk heating.

Accordingly some embodiments of the present invention may allow materials that are technologically important but that have relatively high reaction temperatures to be deposited on substrates that have damage threshold temperatures that are lower than such reaction temperatures. Examples of such materials may include silicon nitride SiN graphene carbon nanotubes diamond titanium dioxide TiO titanium boride TiB zirconium oxide ZrO yttria stabilized zirconium YSZ boron carbide BC boron nitride BN or a metal and examples of such substrates may include integrated circuits chalcogenide glasses fluoride glasses such as ZrF BaF LaF AlF NaF ZBLAN glasses or polymers e.g. polycarbonate poly methyl methacrylate polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene terephthalate. Or for example some embodiments of the present invention may allow undesired atomic or molecular debris to be cleaned removed or directed from a substrate surface by using the acoustic waves to enhance diffusion of such debris on the surface.

First some exemplary structures that may be formed using the present invention and an illustrative method for forming same will be provided. Then an exemplary system for implementing such a method will be described. Lastly several experiments that have been performed that demonstrate enhanced molecular mobility will be described.

As illustrated in a first portion of substrate may be irradiated with laser pulse which may have a set of preselected characteristics including a set of optical wavelengths a temporal duration a spatial profile and an intensity I. In embodiments in which the laser pulse is optically temporally or spatially Gaussian such parameters may be described by their full width of the pulse at half of the pulse s maximum FWHM . In embodiments in which the laser pulse has more complex features e.g. contains optical wavelengths that are not contiguous with one another contains multiple discrete temporal features or has multiple discrete spatial features such parameters may be described as appropriate. Additionally the laser repetition rate R t the laser pulse amplitudes A t or the burst rate number of laser shots per burst B t each may be individually varied to enhance the generation of the acoustic wave while inhibiting damage to substrate . Preferably the set of optical wavelengths of laser pulse is at least partially absorbed by substrate and thus heats the irradiated first portion of substrate . In some embodiments the first portion of substrate may include a coating not illustrated having optical characteristics selected to at least partially absorb the set of optical wavelengths of laser pulse .

Preferably the temporal duration of laser pulse is relatively short so as to cause sufficiently rapid thermal expansion of substrate as to generate acoustic waves illustrated in . For example laser pulse may have a substantially Gaussian temporal profile and may have a temporal duration of less than about 10 nanoseconds at FWHM or less than about 1 nanosecond at FWHM or less than about 100 picoseconds at FWHM or less than about 10 picoseconds at FWHM or less than about 1 picosecond at FWHM or less than about 100 femtoseconds at FWHM in one example about 8 10 nanoseconds at FWHM. Additionally the spatial profile of laser pulse is relatively small in at least one dimension such that the acoustic wave has a sufficiently small spatial profile in that dimension to sufficiently alter the molecular bond between adsorbed atomic or molecular species and substrate and thus to enhance mobility of atomic or molecular species on substrate . For example laser pulse may be focused to a point to a line or to a more complicated pattern as appropriate. In some embodiments the spatial profile of laser pulse may have a dimension of about 20 microns or less in at least one dimension or less than about 10 microns or less in at least one dimension or less than about 5 microns or less in at least one dimension or less than about 2 microns or less in at least one dimension. Preferably the intensity Iof laser pulse is selected so as to reduce or inhibit damage to substrate but at the same time to generate acoustic wave having sufficient amplitude in combination with the other acoustic wave parameters to alter molecular bonds between adsorbed atomic or molecular species and substrate . To mitigate local damage that may be induced by the laser the laser pulse may be repeatedly moved scanned across the surface of substrate e.g. using reflecting mirror described in greater detail below with reference to . In one embodiment the intensity Iof laser pulse is selected so as to induce a thermoelastic material response in substrate . Laser pulse may be generated by any suitable pulsed laser such as an diode pumped Q switched Nd Vanadate ultrafast laser or a diode pumped cavity dumped Nd Vanadate ultrafast laser or a flashlamp pumped Nd YAG nanosecond pulse laser.

It should be appreciated that the spatial profile and intensity Iof the acoustic wave depend not only on the spatial profile and intensity Iof laser pulse but also on the temporal duration of the laser pulse the thermal expansion coefficient of substrate and the rate at which substrate expands responsive to deposition of heat by the laser pulse. Specifically as illustrated in the spatial profile of heated region may be defined by and in some embodiments may be substantially the same as the spatial profile of laser pulse . The spatial profile of the acoustic waves resulting from rapid thermal expansion of substrate within heated region may be defined by and in some embodiments may be substantially the same as the spatial profile of heated region . However if temporal duration of laser pulse is too long then the laser pulse will not cause heated region of substrate to thermally expand with sufficient rapidity to generate acoustic waves . Waves have a temporal profile based on the waves respective spatial profiles and the speed of sound in the material for waves having such a spatial profile and a bandwidth that is inversely proportional to the temporal profile . Acoustic waves may include surface waves or bulk waves e.g. longitudinal or transverse waves or harmonics thereof or combinations thereof as denoted by the dashed arrows within substrate . Preferably acoustic waves have a bandwidth of at least 100 MHz at FWHM or at least 250 MHz at FWHM or at least 1 GHz at FWHM or at least 100 GHz at FWHM or at least 1 THz or more.

As is known in the art acoustic waves conform to mathematical analysis by the wave equation and consequently have attributes common to waves in general such as wave interference. In preferred embodiments acoustic waves include one or more modes that are substantially confined at the interface between substrate and gas phase atomic or molecular species . For example a combination of compression e.g. longitudinal and shear modes e.g. transverse may lead to a surface wave that may propagate along an interface between a gas and a solid with the Rayleigh mode being one that is mathematically tractable as is known in the art. A surface wave typically penetrates into the solid medium e.g. into substrate by a distance equivalent to approximately 1 2 wavelengths. As such an acoustic wave having a frequency of 100 MHz and a wavelength of 50 microns traveling along the surface of an exemplary substrate having an acoustic velocity of 5000 m s may penetrate approximately 100 microns into the substrate. Preferably the acoustic wave is broadband that is includes many frequencies and has a relatively high bandwidth rather than narrowband e.g. containing only a single frequency such as 100 MHz and having a relatively low bandwidth. In this regard a narrowband single frequency acoustic wave traveling at a solid gas interface may be mathematically shown to only displace atoms or molecules at the interface in an elliptical pattern but without inducing net lateral translational motion. However it is believed that a broadband acoustic wave may induce net lateral translational motion of atoms or molecules at such an interface thus enhancing mobility of those atoms or molecules.

As illustrated in acoustic wave is transmitted along the surface of substrate from a transient heated region to a second region in which adsorbed molecular species is molecularly bonded to substrate . Here acoustic wave alters the molecular bond between the adsorbed atomic or molecular species and substrate e.g. alters the strength of the molecular bond as indicated by the deformation in adsorbed atomic or molecular species . Such alteration enhances the mobility of adsorbed atomic or molecular species without requiring a corresponding increase in the bulk temperature of substrate as was previously known. Note that such enhanced mobility would be unexpected based only on the equilibrium energetics of the system. Specifically the energy of acoustic wave may be on the order of a millielectron volt meV . The energy of the molecular bond between atomic or molecular species and substrate may be on the order of hundreds of meV if the bond is based on physical adsorption e.g. a bond based on dipole dipole interactions or the London dispersion force or may be on the order of an eV if the bond is based on chemical adsorption e.g. a covalent bond an ionic bond or a hydrogen bond. Accordingly it would be unexpected that an acoustic wave having an energy that is orders of magnitude lower than the bond energy would be able to alter the molecular bond between atomic or molecular species and substrate particularly to an extent that would enhance mobility of the atomic or molecular species.

However without wishing to be bound by any theory it is believed that an acoustic wave propagating at the surface of substrate and having sufficient intensity and bandwidth may induce a transient strain at that surface and thus may momentarily alter the strength of the bond between atomic or molecular species and substrate . For example an acoustic wave having a 100 MHz bandwidth in a substrate having an acoustic velocity of 5000 m s may interact with atomic or molecular species for approximately 10 nanoseconds it will be appreciated that the duration of such interaction may vary based on the acoustic velocity of the particular substrate being used as well as the spatial profile and temporal profile of the acoustic wave.

As noted above acoustic wave preferably is a broadband acoustic wave. It is believed that the various frequency components of acoustic wave and in particular the high frequency components may induce a net directed force in a lateral direction on adsorbed atomic or molecular species . On the microscopic scale the transient wave may induce surface strain of local substrate atoms to which the atomic or molecular species is molecularly bonded. The local strain may have the effect of reducing the height of the barrier that has immobilized the atomic or molecular species. The adsorbed atomic or molecular species is always in random motion as consequence of local temperature e.g. an effect known as Brownian motion in liquids . The lowering of the barrier height may provide a path along which the directed force of the acoustic wave may act. Responsive to the combination of such a net directed force and the alteration in strength of the molecular bond concurrently induced by acoustic wave atomic or molecular species may have enhanced mobility e.g. may move laterally along the surface of substrate to which it is adsorbed. It should be appreciated that the magnitude of such enhanced mobility may depend upon the parameters of acoustic wave and the nature of the molecular bond between atomic or molecular species and substrate . Additionally as acoustic wave propagates along substrate acoustic wave also may interact with additional adsorbed atomic or molecular species thus enhancing the mobility of such species as well. However higher frequency components of the acoustic wave may damp as the wave propagates as consequence of dispersion properties of the material from which substrate is formed to acoustic wave propagation with a rate proportional to the inverse of the square of the frequency.

The distance traveled by adsorbed atomic or molecular species responsive to a single acoustic wave may be relatively small e.g. on the order of about one tenth of a length of the bond between atomic or molecular species and substrate e.g. on the order of about 0.001 nm in one example or on the order of about 0.01 nm in another example or on the order of about 0.1 nm in another example or on the order of about 1 nm in another example or on the order of about 10 nm in still another example. So as to increase the net distance traveled by atomic or molecular species substrate may be irradiated by a plurality of laser pulses at a predetermined laser repetition rate R t amplitude A t and burst rate B t each laser pulse generating an acoustic wave that moves species an additional distance. Preferably the repetition rate R t is selected such that at least some of the heat deposited by each laser pulse dissipates into substrate before the next laser pulse arrives so as to reduce the buildup of heat in substrate the use of a laser shot in short burst modes may further mitigate thermal buildup the dissipation rate of such heat may depend on the thermal conductivity of substrate . Examples of suitable repetition rates R t may be in the range of kHz tens of kHz hundreds of kHz or even MHz or greater. Optionally laser pulses may be applied in bursts with a burst rate B t selected to permit heat to sufficiently diffuse out of heated region between bursts e.g. using a fast optical shutter. In one example burst rate B t may be on the order of 1000 laser shots or less or 10 000 laser shots or less. In addition the laser pulse amplitudes A t in the burst may also be altered at a single pulse unit to further allow diffusion of heat.

Note that each acoustic wave in a plurality of acoustic waves need not necessarily be generated at the same physical region of substrate . Instead each subsequent laser pulse optionally may irradiate different regions of substrate with corresponding acoustic waves being generated by rapid thermal expansion of such regions. In one illustrative embodiment a moving mirror such as mirror illustrated in or other optical element may be used to dynamically direct different laser pulses to different regions of substrate . Additionally each acoustic wave in a plurality of acoustic waves need not necessarily be generated by a single laser. Instead one or more laser pulses may be generated by a first laser and one or more laser pulses may be generated by one or more additional lasers. Moreover each laser pulse may be spatially and or temporally shaped using known techniques such that the corresponding acoustic waves have appropriate characteristics to suitably alter the molecular bond between adsorbed atomic or molecular species and substrate . Indeed a sequence of laser pulses from one or more lasers may be tailored such that the corresponding acoustic waves interfere with one another in such a manner as to produce a specific spatial excitation mode that enhances mobility of adsorbed atomic or molecular species while reducing the presence of waves that do not enhance mobility of adsorbed atomic or molecular species such as standing waves. In some embodiments the laser pulse s are spatially and or temporally shaped so as to direct adsorbed atomic or molecular species into a desired pattern on substrate .

For example in embodiments where laser pulse is focused to a point acoustic wave may propagate radially away from that point and into the bulk as well. In embodiments where laser pulse is focused to a line acoustic wave may propagate as a planar surface wave linearly away from that line. The former wave shape may be used to clear adsorbed atomic or molecular species away from an area while the latter may be used to induce motion in a particular direction. Other spatial profiles for laser pulse are possible. For example a laser beam may be split to form multiple laser pulses that are individually focused to a line or a point but that irradiate substrate in close proximity to one another. Such a technique may narrow the frequency content of the resulting acoustic wave through interference phenomenon and may be suitable for use in moving larger atomic or molecular species. Or for example two pulsed lasers that are synchronized to one another may be used to irradiate substrate with different spatial profiles than one another e.g. so as to generate a first acoustic wave with a relatively low bandwidth e.g. 10 MHz and a second acoustic wave with a relatively high bandwidth e.g. 100 MHz . The sum of the two acoustic waves may be used to alter molecular bonds between adsorbed atomic or molecular species and substrate .

Responsive to the mobility enhancement induced by one or more acoustic waves adsorbed atomic or molecular species may directly form material disposed on substrate as illustrated in or may first undergo a further chemical reaction e.g. with substrate with another atomic or molecular species adsorbed to substrate or with a gas phase atomic or molecular species to form material illustrated in .

Now referring to an exemplary method of enhancing mobility of an atomic or molecular species with an acoustic wave according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Method includes co selecting a substrate atomic or molecular species and process parameters based on the material to be prepared step . Specifically the process parameters may include laser parameters such as the laser pulse wavelength temporal profile spatial profile and intensity I which may be selected as described above as may any other process parameters such as a technique for generating the atomic or molecular species e.g. PVD or CVD based technique such as described above or known in the art the pressure or partial pressure and flow rate of the atomic or molecular species and the bulk temperature of the substrate.

Then the selected substrate is provided and prepared step for example using any suitable technique known in the art. For example the upper surface of the substrate may be suitably cleaned in preparation for forming a material thereon. The substrate may include one or more additional layers therein including insulators conductors and or semiconductors. In one embodiment the substrate is a low temperature substrate by which it is meant a substrate having a damage threshold temperature that is lower than the reaction temperature of the material to be deposited therein. Examples of such substrates may include for example an integrated circuit a chalcogenide glass a ZBLAN glass or a polymer such as polycarbonate PC poly methyl methacrylate PMMA polystyrene PS polyvinyl chloride PVC or polyethylene terephthalate PET .

Then a first region of the substrate is exposed to a gas phase atomic or molecular species step . Alternatively the atomic or molecular species may be dissolved in liquid such as a high vapor pressure solvent e.g. methanol ethanol acetone and the solvent then evaporated. Responsive to such exposure the atomic or molecular species may adsorb on the substrate. The gas phase atomic or molecular species may be generated using physical vapor deposition PVD based techniques such as evaporation sputtering molecular beam epitaxy MBE and pulsed laser deposition PLD or chemical vapor deposition CVD based techniques including atomic layer deposition ALD or a liquid based system. In some embodiments the gas phase atomic or molecular species is a precursor to a technologically important material such as silicon nitride graphene carbon nanotubes diamond titanium dioxide titanium boride zirconium oxide yttria stabilized zirconium boron carbide boron nitride or metal. As illustrated in the reaction temperature of such materials may be significantly higher than the damage threshold temperature of low temperature substrates e.g. polymers such as polycarbonate PC poly methyl methacrylate PMMA polystyrene PS polyvinyl chloride PVC or polyethylene terephthalate PET . It may not be practicable to deposit such materials on low temperature substrates using bulk heating because the substrate would need to be heated above its damage threshold temperature to achieve the reaction temperature of the material. Instead enhancing the mobility of precursors to such materials on the surface of such a substrate using acoustic waves may reduce the bulk temperature to which a substrate need be heated to form the material. Alternatively after the region is exposed to a gas phase or molecular species the surface may be exposed to photons e.g. such as generated by lasers lamps or X ray sources or to electrons responsive to which the surface layer may be altered so as to allow a more efficient use of the acoustic waves to enhance surface mobility e.g. to induce material growth or to remove atomic or molecular species from the substrate.

Note that during step illustrated in the entire upper surface of the substrate may be exposed to the gas phase atomic or molecular species. However the term first region is intended to distinguish the region of the substrate in which molecular bonds are to be altered with an acoustic wave from the second region of the substrate to be irradiated with a laser pulse so as to generate such an acoustic wave during step . The first and second regions may be separated from one another by any desired distance e.g. about 10 microns or more or about 100 microns or more or about 1 millimeter or more or about 10 millimeters or more or about 100 millimeters or more or about 1 centimeter or more.

Then the mobility of atomic or molecular species adsorbed to the substrate is enhanced using acoustic waves step . Specifically in the embodiment illustrated in a laser pulse such as described herein is directed to a second region of the substrate step . The laser pulse generates a corresponding acoustic wave such as described herein which has spatial and temporal characteristics selected to alter a molecular bond between the adsorbed atomic or molecular species and the substrate step . The acoustic wave is then transmitted from the second region to the first region of the substrate so as to alter the molecular bond between the adsorbed atomic or molecular species and the substrate thus enhancing the mobility of the atomic or molecular species as described herein step .

Responsive to the alteration of the molecular bond between the adsorbed atomic or molecular species and the substrate the atomic or molecular species may form a material such as described herein step . In one specific example the atomic or molecular species includes carbon that forms a graphene film by epitaxial growth. In another specific example the substrate includes a metal film catalyst that has been impregnated with the atomic or molecular species and responsive to the alteration of the molecular bond the atomic or molecular species provides a seed for growth of material. Alternatively the atomic or molecular species may translate across the substrate in a direction defined by the acoustic wave step . In another alternative embodiment not illustrated the atomic or molecular species may dissociate e.g. shed atoms to form a more chemically energetic species such as a radical. Such energetic species may induce a surface chemical reaction such as the formation of graphene by methane ethane carbon source adsorption.

Stage is positioned within reaction chamber and supports substrate and is operable to adjust the position of the substrate in the x y and z directions responsive to instructions from controller . Alternatively mirror may include a high speed scanning mirror with a compensating Z motion focus unit that is configured to move the laser beam while maintaining substrate in a stationary position. During execution of step of laser emits light of a wavelength selected to be absorbed by substrate so as to rapidly heat an irradiated region of substrate and thus generate an acoustic wave. In other embodiments not shown one or more additional lasers may be provided to heat substrate so as to generate acoustic waves.

Mirror directs the light from laser toward one or more regions of substrate in accordance with instructions from controller preferably through a window or port hole in reaction chamber . In an alternative embodiment not shown stage is used to move substrate relative to the laser beam instead of using mirror to direct the light to different portions of substrate . For example for relatively large reaction chambers e.g. chambers configured to accommodate one or more substrates having a collective area of one or more square meters or ten or more square meters such as industrial autoclaves it may be preferable to move the laser beam using mirror rather than moving stage . Reaction chamber is configured to maintain substrate at a selected pressure or partial pressure of molecular species generated by atomic or molecular species source during the appropriate processing time as well as at a selected bulk temperature which may be significantly lower than the bulk temperature that may be required in the absence of the acoustic waves . Note that if substrate is to be exposed to different types of atomic or molecular species then one or more corresponding atomic or molecular species sources may be provided and configured to provide such species to reaction chamber as appropriate under control of controller .

Responsive to user input provided through input device e.g. user input defining the material to be prepared on substrate or other processing to be performed on substrate controller requests database to provide information on how to prepare that type of material or to perform such processing. Responsive to the request database provides some or all of the following information to controller the type of substrate to be used any required preparation thereof the wavelength s and other parameters of laser light to be used the type of atomic or molecular species source to be used and any parameters thereof including the pressure or partial pressure of the atomic or molecular species and any additional processing to be performed after exposing the substrate to the atomic or molecular species and laser light. Controller receives this information and stores it in memory . Processor processes the stored information and based on that information displays instructions to the user via display device and controls stage laser reaction chamber and mirror to process the substrate as appropriate.

In one example the user uses input device e.g. a keyboard and mouse to input to the controller that he desires to prepare a particular material disposed on a particular substrate e.g. a TiOfilm on a PMMA substrate. Responsive to that input controller requests database to provide information on preparing such a structure. Responsive to the request database provides a set of instructions to the controller which controller stores in memory . Processor then processes the stored instructions to determine what information is to be displayed to the user via display device and how the various components of the system are to be controlled. For example processor may cause display device to display the type of substrate and molecular species to be used so that the user may obtain and prepare the substrate and molecular species to the extent that system is not configured to obtain the substrate and molecular species automatically without further user intervention .

Next the user places the prepared substrate on stage and uses input device to inform controller that the substrate is ready. Responsive to this input processor instructs stage to move to a first pre determined position in the x y and z directions and instructs reaction chamber to expose substrate to an atomic or molecular species from molecular species source at a suitable pressure or partial pressure based on the stored instructions. Processor then instructs laser to emit light having wavelength and other parameters such as described herein and instructs mirror to guide that light to the appropriate region s of substrate . The light then generates an acoustic wave that enhances the mobility of molecular species adsorbed to substrate .

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that any of the user performed steps may alternatively be automated using commercially available equipment not illustrated . For example in certain industrial applications a process script profile may be provided that controls gases laser motion and timing. For example instead of displaying to the user what type of substrate and film is to be provided controller may instead be in operable communication with a robotic substrate handler that may obtain substrate from a substrate store and may process the substrate as appropriate. In one example the substrate may be automatically dispensed e.g. using a tape dispensing roller. In one embodiment one or more steps of an instruction sequence are made contingent on a feedback parameter such as a spectrum of light reflected from the substrate or a change in reflectivity of the substrate resulting from deposition of material.

For example a pulsed laser beam from a separate probe laser not shown may be used to periodically irradiate a region of the substrate where a material is being deposited and a reflected portion of the probe beam then input into a photodetector also not shown in communication with controller . The output of the photodetector may be analyzed to determine whether a material had been deposited on the region of the substrate and if so how much. For example controller may include software stored in memory operable on processor for determining based on the photodetector output whether the reflectivity of the substrate changed as a result of material deposition in the irradiated region and or whether the reflectivity indicates that a sufficient thickness of material has been deposited in that region. If the controller determines that the material has been deposited to a sufficient thickness then controller may instruct stage to move substrate such that a different region of the substrate is irradiated by laser and by the probe laser. In addition a laser heterodyne sensor may be provided that includes a continuous wave CW laser configured to generate light that is reflected off of the surface of substrate onto a photodetector not shown . The laser heterodyne sensor may monitor minute surface deflections e.g. deflections generated by the acoustic wave to check the acoustic wave profile and amplitude at various location on the substrate.

Some non limiting examples of enhanced molecular mobility on a substrate at reduced bulk temperature will now be described with reference to .

Specifically a series of experiments using gold clusters having low numbers of gold atoms were used as the atomic or molecular species and a polished glass ceramic surface specifically lithium aluminosilicate was used as the substrate. The experiments were performed at room temperature and unless otherwise noted the images are optical microscope images at 100 magnification. Gold clusters were selected as the molecular species because their locations on the substrate could readily be evaluated using optical emission microscopy as described below. It is believed that the results described below may be generalized to other atomic or molecular species and other substrates.

The gold clusters were formed by drop casting a solution of 8 nm gold nanoparticles on the lithium aluminosilicate substrate. The nanoparticles then were irradiated with 532 nm light from a Quantaray laser having an 8 ns pulse with a repetition rate of 100 Hz and approximately 

As is known in the art and as illustrated in different gold clusters have different excitation dashed lines and emission solid lines characteristics than one another. So as to observe the behavior of only a single size of gold clusters specifically clusters having eight gold atoms Au the field of gold clusters was irradiated using broad band ultraviolet light approximately 300 400 nm so as to excite the Auclusters. is an image of the field of gold clusters obtained using a 455 nm filter which is in the emission band for Auclusters and in which several clusters appear bright. is an image of the field of gold clusters obtained using a 510 nm filter which is off the emission band peak for Auclusters in which different clusters appear bright. Such results suggest that the bright clusters in as well as in have spectroscopic attributes and likely correspond to Auclusters. An analogous experiment was performed but with exciting the clusters with blue light approximately 400 480 nm instead of ultraviolet light in which it was observed that substantially no clusters appeared bright using the 455 nm filter while others appeared bright using the 510 nm suggesting that those clusters likely correspond to Au.

The motion of Auclusters responsive to interactions with acoustic waves generated in the lithium aluminosilicate substrate then was characterized. A Quantaray Nd Yag laser operating at 355 nm 

The above experiments demonstrate that molecular species may be moved in a desired lateral direction on a substrate using broadband acoustic waves e.g. by approximately a bond length 0.2 0.3 nm for every ten applied laser pulses. To appreciate such a result consider that the diffusion coefficient of a small molecule in water is on the order of 10cm second. If the above data for Auwere to be fit to a mean square displacement law from which a diffusion coefficient could be derived the resulting value would be approximately 3.7 10cm second comparable to that of a small molecule in water but on a dry surface and at room temperature. Additionally it should be noted that heat driven diffusion is a random walk phenomenon while the above experiments demonstrate that directed motion may be achieved using acoustic waves that have been shaped to generate a propagating line wave which may be referred to as a plane wave in the art . Additionally because the motion is directed it also may be used to pattern a substrate surface with selected molecular species without the use of masks or optical lithography. As such embodiments of the invention not only facilitate the growth of materials at reduced temperature but also may be used to remove or clean unwanted molecular species from delicate surfaces or from catalytic surfaces or to inhibit such species from ever binding to the surface. For example catalysts tend to get poisoned or lose efficiency over time and acoustic waves may be used to rejuvenate such catalysts by inhibiting binding between the catalyst and undesired molecular species. Or for example acoustic waves may be used to inhibit growth or binding of bacteria on surfaces such as surgical instruments thus sterilizing the instruments and reducing or obviating the need for chemical or thermal sterilization.

Additionally because acoustic waves propagate by inducing local strain and small strain rates e.g. on the order of 10 second have been observed to induce nucleation e.g. annealing removing of surface dislocations it is believed that certain embodiments of the present invention may be used to anneal defects such as kinks terraces or slip faults at the surface of a substrate or a material disposed on a substrate. As devices become small the ratio of the surface area to volume increases. Consequently surface defects may limit reliability which may be ameliorated using acoustic waves such as described herein. On the other hand some types of surface waves may propagate to form solitons which do not disperse with wavelength while other types of surface waves may form shock fronts. The soliton waves may carry the surface energy farther while the nonlinear or shock front waves may be used to crack or induce defects.

While various illustrative embodiments of the invention are described above it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention. The appended claims are intended to cover all such changes and modifications that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
