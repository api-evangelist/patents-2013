The present application claims the benefit of and priority to a pending provisional application entitled Drain Termination for Transistor with Improved Breakdown Voltage Ser. No. 61 600 469 filed on Feb. 17 2012. The disclosure in this pending provisional application is hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DE AR0000016 awarded by Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ARPA E . The Government has certain rights in this invention.

As used herein the phrase group III V refers to a compound semiconductor that includes a group V element and at least one group III element. Moreover the phrase III Nitride refers to a compound semiconductor that includes nitrogen N and at least one group III element including aluminum Al gallium Ga indium In and boron B and including but not limited to any of its alloys such as aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN indium gallium nitride InGaN aluminum indium gallium nitride AlInGaN gallium arsenide phosphide nitride GaAsPN and aluminum indium gallium arsenide phosphide nitride AlInGaAsPN for example. III Nitride also refers generally to any polarity including but not limited to Ga polar N polar semi polar or non polar crystal orientations. A III Nitride material may also include either the Wurtzitic Zincblende or mixed polytypes and may include single crystal monocrystalline polycrystalline or amorphous structures.

Group III V heterostructure field effect transistors group III V HFETs such as group III V high electron mobility transistors group III V HEMTs are often utilized in high power switching applications. For example III Nitride HEMTs may be utilized to provide switching and or amplification functions.

Group III V HFETs advantageously allow implementation of power transistors using a lateral conduction topology in which the drain source and gate electrodes are formed on one side of a semiconductor wafer or die. In a typical lateral transistor layout for example drain and source finger electrodes coupled to respective drain and source pads may be interdigitated and surrounded by a gate region. As the power requirement for such transistors continues to increase the transistors are fabricated with a higher unit cell density. However due to high termination electric fields typically present at the drain finger electrode ends the gate to drain spacing at the drain finger electrode ends of higher density power transistors may be insufficient to reliably sustain a high breakdown voltage.

The present disclosure is directed to a transistor having a decreased electric field at the ends or tips of the drain finger electrodes by increasing the radius of curvature of the drain finger electrode ends thereby allowing for an increased breakdown voltage and a more robust and reliable transistor substantially as shown in and or described in connection with at least one of the figures and as set forth more completely in the claims.

The following description contains specific information pertaining to implementations in the present disclosure. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present disclosure may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed herein. The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary implementations. Unless noted otherwise like or corresponding elements among the figures may be indicated by like or corresponding reference numerals. Moreover the drawings and illustrations in the present application are generally not to scale and are not intended to correspond to actual relative dimensions.

Source finger electrodes and drain finger electrodes are situated in gate region and are implemented in an interdigitated pattern such that gate region surrounds source finger electrodes and drain finger electrodes and is disposed between the interdigitated source finger electrodes and drain finger electrodes . As further shown in conventional transistor has source to drain half pitch i.e. the distance separating center line of source finger electrode from center line of drain finger electrode .

Conventional transistor displays a symmetrical layout commonly utilized to implement lateral power transistors. As shown in source to drain half pitch is substantially constant along the entirety of drain finger electrodes . However due to the high termination electric fields which may develop under high voltage operation particularly at semicircular drain finger electrode ends the robustness of conventional transistor may be compromised. As a result conventional transistor may break down become unstable and or fail catastrophically under high voltage operation.

It is noted that as used herein the feature referred to as a transistor may correspond more generally to a variety of specific transistor or other semiconductor device implementations. In one implementation for example transistor may take the form of a field effect transistor FET . For instance transistor may be an insulated gate FET IGFET or a heterostructure FET HFET . In one implementation transistor may take the form of a metal insulator semiconductor FET MISFET such as a metal oxide semiconductor FET MOSFET . Alternatively when implemented as an FIFET transistor may be a high electron mobility transistor HEMI producing a two dimensional electron gas 2DEG . In yet another implementation transistor may take the form of a schottky diode not shown in for example through replacement of drain finger electrodes with anode electrodes replacement of the source finger electrodes with cathode electrodes and without the controlling gate electrode of .

Referring to the exemplary implementation shown by semiconductor body of transistor may be configured to provide a group III V HFET such as a III Nitride HEMT. III Nitride materials include gallium nitride GaN and or its alloys such as aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN indium gallium nitride InGaN and aluminum indium gallium nitride AlInGaN . These materials are semiconductor compounds that have a relatively wide direct bandgap and strong piezoelectric polarizations and can enable high breakdown fields and the creation of 2DEGs. As a result III Nitride materials such as GaN are used in many microelectronic applications in which high power density and high efficiency switching are required.

Active surface of transistor includes source pad drain pad and gate pad . In addition to drain finger electrodes and source finger electrodes transistor also includes gate region and field dielectric . Source finger electrodes are electrically coupled to source pad drain finger electrodes are electrically coupled to drain pad and gate region is electrically coupled to gate pad . It is noted that the electrical coupling of source finger electrodes to source pad and that of gate region to gate pad is shown by dashed lines because those connections may be formed using one or more additional metal layers not shown in .

It is noted that in some implementations either or both of source pad and drain pad may be on the same plane as source finger electrodes and drain finger electrodes . However in other implementations source pad and or drain pad may be on a different plane than that occupied by source finger electrodes and or drain finger electrode . For example source pad and or drain pad may be formed on a backside of the device or substrate and electrically connected to their respectively corresponding finger electrodes using electrical through substrate vias. Such transistor designs with ohmic pad source and or drain construction on other planes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 233 028 entitled Gallium Nitride Material Devices and Methods of Forming the Same and issued on Jun. 19 2007 and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 915 645 entitled Monolithic Vertically Integrated Composite Group III V and Group IV Semiconductor Device and Method for Fabricating Same and issued on Mar. 29 2011. The entire disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 233 028 and 7 915 645 are hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

As shown in source finger electrodes and drain finger electrodes may be implemented in an interdigitated pattern such that gate region surrounds source finger electrodes and is between interdigitated source finger electrodes and drain finger electrodes . Source finger electrodes have length and drain finger electrodes have length . Also shown in is source to drain half pitch of transistor i.e. the distance separating center line of source finger electrode from center line of drain finger electrode .

Source finger electrodes have source finger electrode beginnings coupled to source pad and source finger electrode ends adjacent drain pad . Drain finger electrodes have drain finger electrode beginnings coupled to drain pad and curved drain finger electrode ends or tips adjacent source pad . As shown in source to drain half pitch of transistor is substantially constant from source finger electrode beginnings to source finger electrode ends . As further shown in curved drain finger electrode ends are modified in order reduce the electric field at the tips of drain finger electrodes .

In at least one exemplary implementation curved drain finger electrode ends have an increased radius of curvature such as r for example resulting in increased width of curved drain finger electrode ends relative to width of drain finger electrode . It is noted that as used herein width is defined as the width of drain finger electrode just before the transition to curved drain finger electrode end . As also shown in radius of curvature r of gate region surrounding curved drain finger electrode end is also increased which increases the gate to drain spacing d in the vicinity of curved drain finger electrode ends compared to the gate to drain spacing d further reducing the electric field at curved drain finger electrode ends . It is noted that for the purposes of the present application when curved drain finger electrode ends are described as having an increased radius of curvature that characterization can apply to either one or both of r and r .

In some implementations as shown in increased radius of curvature r of curved drain finger electrode ends may cause curved drain finger electrode ends to have a generally ellipsoidal shape as discussed in more detail in reference to below. One advantage of implementing curved drain finger electrode ends as substantial ellipsoids is that such a shape can aid in reducing or relaxing the high termination electrical fields that can otherwise exist at semicircular drain finger electrode ends of conventional transistor shown in . As a result increased radius of curvature r and or increased radius of curvature r as well as the subsequent increase in gate to drain spacing d at curved drain finger electrode ends reduces the termination electric field at curved drain finger electrode ends so as to achieve an increased breakdown voltage and reliability for transistor .

In one exemplary implementation curved drain finger electrode ends are extended beyond source finger electrode beginnings . In other words and as depicted in in some implementations curved drain finger electrode ends may be situated closer to source pad than source finger electrode beginnings . Extension of curved drain finger electrode ends beyond source finger electrode beginnings can advantageously achieve an increased breakdown voltage for transistor without increasing source to drain half pitch along length of source finger electrodes . Consequently the exemplary transistor layout shown in can be implemented so as to allow for a tighter source to drain half pitch while achieving increased breakdown voltage thereby providing a low ON resistance and improved performance for transistor concurrently.

It is noted that although the implementation shown in depicts drain finger electrodes as having increased radius of curvature r increased radius of curvature r and increased width at curved drain finger electrode ends as well as having curved drain finger electrode ends extending beyond source finger electrode beginnings that representation is merely exemplary. In other implementations drain finger electrodes may not have all of those characteristics concurrently. For example in one implementation curved drain finger electrode ends may extend beyond source finger electrode beginnings but not have increased radius of curvature r increased radius of curvature r or increased width . Alternatively according to another implementation curved drain finger electrode ends may have increased radius of curvature r increased width and or increased radius of curvature r but may not extend beyond source finger electrode beginnings . Thus according to a variety of possible implementations drain finger electrodes may have length greater than length of source finger electrodes and or may have curved drain finger electrode ends extending beyond source finger electrode beginnings and or may have increased radius of curvature r increased width and or increased radius of curvature r at curved drain finger electrode ends .

Some of the features discussed in conjunction with will now be further described by reference to . present respective top plan views of exemplary drain terminations having a decreased electric field at the ends or tips of the drain finger electrodes. As further described below such a decreased electric field can result from increasing a radius of curvature of the gate to drain spacing between an edge of a curved drain finger electrode end and a boundary of a gate region surrounding the curved drain finger electrode end thereby allowing for an increased breakdown voltage and a more robust and reliable transistor. It is noted that the exemplary implementations shown in corresponding in general to the implementation shown in .

Referring first to is an example of an actual layout used for the drain finger termination according to one implementation. shows a portion of gate region surrounding drain finger electrode . Also shown in are source finger electrodes with which drain finger electrode is interdigitated and field dielectric . Gate region drain finger electrode source finger electrodes and field dielectric correspond respectively to gate region drain finger electrodes source finger electrodes and field dielectric in .

Continuing to shows gate region surrounding drain finger electrode . Drain finger electrode has width and also includes drain finger electrode beginning having width . In addition shows curved drain finger electrode end having increased radius of curvature r relative to the radius of curvature of semicircular drain finger electrode ends in conventional transistor of . That is to say in contrast to conventional transistor having semicircular drain finger ends radius of curvature r of curved drain finger end is greater than a radius of curvature of a circle having a diameter equal to width .

Also shown in is radius of curvature r of the gate electrode region surrounding the drain finger electrode end radius of curvature r of the smooth transition connecting curved drain finger electrode end to drain finger electrode and radius of curvature r of the smooth transition connecting gate region surrounding curved drain finger electrode end to the gate region surrounding drain finger electrode . further depicts gate to drain spacing d gate to drain spacing d and length of drain finger electrode . Gate to drain spacing d gate to drain spacing d length and width correspond respectively to gate to drain spacing d gate to drain spacing d length and width in . Moreover curved drain finger electrode end radius of curvature r and radius of curvature r in correspond respectively to curved drain finger electrode ends radius of curvature r and radius of curvature r in .

Continuing to shows gate region surrounding drain finger electrode . Drain finger electrode has width and includes drain finger electrode beginning having width . In addition drain finger electrode has curved drain finger electrode end with increased width relative to width of drain finger electrode . Also shown in are field dielectric radius of curvature r radius of curvature r radius of curvature r radius of curvature r gate to drain spacing d and gate to drain spacing d as well as minor axis and major axis of curved drain finger electrode end .

Gate region field dielectric and drain finger electrode correspond respectively to gate region field dielectric and drain finger electrode in . In addition width curved drain finger electrode end and drain finger electrode beginning having width correspond respectively to width curved drain finger electrode end and drain finger electrode beginning having width in . Moreover gate to drain spacings d and d and radii of curvature r r r and r in correspond respectively to gate to drain spacings d and d and radii of curvature r r r and r in . It is further noted that increased width of curved drain finger electrode end in corresponds to increased width of curved drain finger electrode end in .

As shown in curved drain finger electrode end has a shape described by major axis and minor axis . Major axis is longer than and substantially perpendicular to minor axis . As further shown in major axis is substantially aligned with drain finger electrode and minor axis is substantially perpendicular to drain finger electrode .

In some implementations for example curved drain finger electrode end may be substantially an ellipsoid having major axis substantially aligned with drain finger electrode . Curved drain finger electrode end taking the form of an ellipsoid with major axis and minor axis results from forming curved drain finger electrode end and the surrounding gate region with increased radii of curvature r r r and r such that r

Gate to drain spacing d is shown as being less than gate to drain spacing d . As discussed above by reference to by forming the gate to drain spacing such that d

In some implementations it may be advantageous for the ratio of increased width to width to be approximately equal to 2 1. In other implementations it may be advantageous or desirable for the ratio of increased width to width to be greater than 2 1. An advantage of using an ellipsoidal shape for curved drain finger electrode end is that such a shape can aid in reducing or relaxing the high termination electric fields that can otherwise be present at the termination of a conventionally configured drain finger electrode such as semicircular drain finger electrode ends in .

It is noted that width increased width and curved drain finger electrode end are exaggerated in for conceptual clarity. Thus drain finger electrode is not drawn to scale. Nevertheless drain finger electrode corresponds to drain finger electrodes in as well as to drain finger electrode in as noted above.

In some implementations further improvements in high current carrying transistors can be realized with higher breakdown voltages and lower ON resistance through use of tapered drain and source finger electrodes which may be implemented in combination with a curved drain finger electrode end having an increased radius of curvature corresponding to curved drain finger electrode ends in respective . Such tapered source and drain finger designs are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 417 257 entitled III Nitride Device with Improved Layout Geometry and issued on Aug. 26 2008. The entire disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 7 417 257 is hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

As further shown in width of tapered drain finger electrode beginning is larger than width . In other words in contrast to drain finger electrode for which width of drain finger electrode beginning may be substantially equal to width tapered drain finger electrode has a tapered drain finger electrode beginning width that is greater than width .

Thus by providing a transistor with drain finger electrodes having an increased radius of curvature at curved drain finger electrode ends implementations dislcosed by the present application result in a reduced termination electric field at the curved drain finger electrode ends. As a result the disclosed implementations achieve an increased breakdown voltage for the transistor. In addition by extending the curved drain finger electrode ends beyond the beginnings of source finger electrodes interdigitated with the drain finger electrodes implementations disclosed by the present application allow greater gate to drain separation at the curved drain finger ends without increasing source to drain half pitch. Consequently the implementations disclosed herein can achieve increased breakdown voltage for a transistor while concurrently maintaining a low specific ON resistance on resistance in the active area for the transistor.

From the above description it is manifest that various techniques can be used for implementing the concepts described in the present application without departing from the scope of those concepts. Moreover while the concepts have been described with specific reference to certain implementations a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the scope of those concepts. As such the described implementations are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. It should also be understood that the present application is not limited to the particular implementations described herein but many rearrangements modifications and substitutions are possible without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
