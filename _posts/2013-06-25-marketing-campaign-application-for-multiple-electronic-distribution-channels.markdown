No. 13 926 389 filed on Jun. 25 2013 and entitled MARKETING CAMPAIGN APPLICATION FOR MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS The 789 application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 61 698 244 filed Sep. 7 2012 entitled MARKETING CAMPAIGN APPLICATION FOR MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. All of which are incorporated herein by reference. entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to generating an offer for distribution across multiple electronic distribution channels.

As the Internet and electronic communications evolve into more interactive and personalized experiences for a user more and more channels of electronic communication are developed marketing efforts may be distributed across the multiple electronic communication channels including various social media platforms. A merchant may be provided new opportunities to reach customers and potential customers in a faster more targeted manner than conventional marketing. These new opportunities come with the burden of a merchant needing to generate and manage redundant and or multiple offers for distribution across the multiple electronic communication channels. Further it may be very difficult for a merchant to be able to calculate the return or benefit of multiple offers across the various channels.

In various embodiments the present disclosure provides methods systems and computer readable medium for allowing a merchant to create offers for distribution via multiple electronic distribution channels. The electronic distribution channels may include social media networks and location based services. In various embodiments the method comprises receiving at a computer based system offer parameters for generating an offer generating offer data based on the offer parameters and based on at least one of merchant data and multiple account holders data wherein the offer comprises providing a coupon less offer to an account holder determining a first data subset of the offer data for distribution through a first electronic distribution channel and determining a second data subset of the offer data for distribution through a second electronic distribution channel. The offer parameters may be received from a merchant. Additionally at least one of the first data subset distributed through the first electronic distribution channel is based on the capabilities of the first electronic distribution channel and wherein the second data subset distributed through the second electronic distribution channel is based on the capabilities of the second electronic distribution channel. In various embodiments the first electronic distribution channel and the second electronic distribution channel individually comprise at least one of a merchant website a social media website an affiliate website a partner website an external vendor and a mobile device communication.

Further in various embodiments the method can also comprise receiving a selection of at least one merchant location for redemption of the offer. The method may include receiving a selection of a criterion for the offer. The offer parameters can be provided based on a business objective and wherein the business objective is at least one of acquisition of new customers and loyalty of prior customers. Also the computer based system can provide offer parameter guidelines based on the business objective. In various embodiments the method can further comprise matching an accepted offer with a record of charge ROC in a transaction account held by the account holder and crediting the transaction account based upon the matching. Similarly the computer based system may debit a transaction account held by a merchant in response to the crediting. A transaction account held by the merchant system may be debited in response to the computer based system matching an accepted offer with a record of charge in a transaction account held by the account holder.

The account holder may be selected based on account history where the account history comprises at least one of prior transaction data loyalty points reward points location of prior transactions past purchases transaction amount transaction volume and account status. Further the account holder may be selected based on at least one of demographics and a location of the account holder. The location of the account holder may be determined based upon at least one of a zip code a GPS signal a location signal and a submitted location by the account holder.

In addition to generating an offer the system and method may further include associating a transaction account of the account holder with the offer monitoring a transaction of the transaction account comparing the transaction with a criterion governing the offer and generating a report based on the transaction and account holder data. In addition in various embodiments the method may comprise obtaining transaction data of one or more transactions at the merchant from a third party institution where the transaction data corresponds to account holder data comparing the one or more transactions with a criterion governing the offer and generating a report based on the one or more transactions and the account holder data. Providing the report to an entity that provides the offer parameters. The report may be provided to an entity that provides the offer parameters. The reporting information in the report may include at least one of number of the offers transmitted number of the offers accepted number of the offers redeemed total value of the redeemed offers average size of the transaction involving the offer and rate of the offer redemption. The reporting information in the report may include a return on investment where the return on investment is based on a comparison of the first transactions during an offer period and second transactions during a non offer period. Additionally the reporting information in the report may include non transaction information where the non transaction information includes at least one of demographic information of the account holder and social media indicators. The reporting information in the report may include tracking information on repeat customers and new customers during an offer period. Also the generation of the report can occur approximately real time with the transaction. One advantage of approximately real time report generation is the ability to modify the offer based on the reporting data. The real time reporting may facilitate generating a second marketing campaign that modifies the offer based on reporting information in the report.

In various embodiments the present disclosure provides methods and systems for setting by a merchant system offer parameters where an offer is generated based on the offer parameters by a computer based system configured to facilitate the offer selecting a first electronic distribution channel and a second electronic distribution channel where the offer is distributed by the computer based system to an account holder via the first electronic distribution channel and the second electronic distribution channel and receiving at the merchant system and from the computer based system a report based on a transaction associated with the offer. The method and system may further include a merchant selecting a merchant location for redemption of the offer or setting a criterion for the offer. In various embodiments the computer based system can be configured to generate offer data based on the offer parameters and merchant transaction data where the computer based system is further configured to determine a first data subset of the offer data for distribution through the first electronic distribution channel and determine a second data subset of the offer data for distribution through the second electronic distribution channel.

The detailed description of exemplary embodiments herein makes reference to the accompanying drawings which show the exemplary embodiments by way of illustration and their best mode. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical and mechanical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Thus the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation. For example the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented. Moreover any of the functions or steps may be outsourced to or performed by one or more third parties. Furthermore any reference to singular includes plural embodiments and any reference to more than one component may include a singular embodiment.

The present disclosure provides a method and system for facilitating the creation e.g. by a merchant of offers for distribution e.g. via multiple electronic distribution channels . In various embodiments and with reference to a method comprises receiving offer parameters e.g. from a merchant or third party entity step generating the offer based on the offer parameters data related to the merchant and or multiple account holders step modifying the offer for distribution through a first electronic distribution channel step and modifying the offer for distribution through a second electronic distribution channel step .

A system for implementing the described method in various embodiments and with reference to may include a marketing campaign system comprising a merchant system in communication with a marketing campaign application with the marketing campaign application being in further communication with multiple electronic distribution channels . The marketing campaign application receives offer parameters from merchant or a third party entity. The campaign parameters may include merchant defined parameters such as for example minimum spend discount requirements campaign duration and or locations accepting the campaign offer. In addition marketing campaign application may also receive merchant data and or multiple account holders data. The merchant data may be received from merchant and or a separate database. Similarly multiple account holders data may be received from one or more financial institutions payment processors and or a separate database. Marketing campaign application generates offer data based on the offer parameters merchant data and or multiple account holders data. In various embodiments marketing campaign application determines which data of the offer data to provide to a specific electronic distribution channel. The determination of which data to provide is based on the capabilities of the specific electronic distribution channel. The electronic distribution channel capabilities can include various media content hyperlinks various display formats various graphical options and the like. The offer data may be modified for different electronic distribution channels in order to operate in association with the appropriate formats provided data graphical display and other elements functions as would be known to one skilled in the art after reading the present disclosure. The marketing campaign application can be configured to parse the offer data in order to provide a subset of the offer data to the specific electronic distribution channel. Accordingly the marketing campaign application may generate a first data subset of the offer data to provide to a first electronic distribution channel A. The marketing campaign application may also be configured to generate additional data subsets of the offer data to provide to one or more additional channels such as a second data subset fbr a second electronic distribution channel B a third data subset for a third electronic distribution channel C a fourth data subset for a fourth electronic distribution channel D etc.

In accordance with various embodiments the individual electronic distribution channels may impact the formatting and appearance of the individual offers of the offer. Marketing campaign application can be configured to provide specific input data to each electronic distribution channel such that each individual channel receives the appropriate offer data. In various embodiments the first electronic distribution channel and or the second electronic distribution channel may comprise at least one of a merchant website a social media website affiliate or partner websites an external vendor a mobile device communication social media network and or location based service. Examples of social media channels include Facebook Foursquare Twitter MySpace LinkedIn and the like. Examples of affiliate or partner websites include American Express Groupon LivingSocial and the like. Moreover examples of mobile device communications include texting email MMS and or mobile applications for smartphones.

One benefit of marketing campaign application is that merchant does not have to fully or partially develop and manage multiple offers over multiple distribution channels. Marketing campaign application fully or partially facilitates the development and management aspects of multiple subsets of offer data over multiple channels through a single interface. In this way the offer data may be fully or partially consistent and merchant can make a single change at marketing campaign application that is incorporated in one or more of the multiple subsets of offer data. Furthermore in various embodiments merchant can use the single interface to make changes specific to one or more offers without changing all the offers. For further information about changes to one offer or offer model impacting other offers or offer models see U.S. Pat. No. 8 150 662 issued on Apr. 3 2012 and entitled METHOD AND COMPUTER READABLE MEDIUM FOR VISUALIZING DEPENDENCIES OF SIMULATION MODELS which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Creating an offer using the marketing campaign application involves various steps for the user e.g. merchant marketing company . In various embodiments and with reference to to create an offer a merchant accesses the marketing campaign application landing page and logs into the merchant site of the marketing campaign application . The merchant sets up an offer campaign and submits an offer for confirmation by the marketing campaign application .

The setting up of an offer campaign may include various steps. For example and with reference to a method of setting up an offer can include selecting a segment which can include the purpose behind the offer such as acquisition loyalty or all inclusive as further explained herein . The method may also include selecting a construct of whether the offer is a percentage discount a certain value discount and or other. The method can also include selecting a duration of the offer such as for example a fixed date duration a redemption cap and or a long term offer expiration. Further if the merchant has more than one location and or website the method can include selecting one or more locations to be valid for the offer. After the offer campaign framework is setup the merchant can review the offer and submit for confirmation . The marketing campaign application can be configured to confirm the offer campaign and various electronic distribution channels including third party channels . The confirmation may be based on any suitable criteria such as for example appropriateness of discount or reward conformance with rules duration requirements etc.

Various examples of application screen shots and offers are presented to provide additional detail to the above disclosure. For example is one example of a merchant log in page for accessing the marketing campaign application . The merchant provides a user identification and password for authentication and accessing the merchant s account. After a merchant has logged on to the marketing campaign application the merchant can connect to various electronic distribution channels as illustrated in . In the exemplary screen shots the electronic distribution channels include social media channels such as for example Facebook and Foursquare .

In various embodiments and with respect to an offer campaign can be directed towards a selected segment of people based on a business objective such as acquisition loyalty or all inclusive. The acquisition objective can be designed to send the offer campaign to new customers that have not sufficiently patronized the merchant. The loyalty campaign can be designed to send the offer campaign to prior customers who have previously patronized the merchant. The all inclusive campaign can be designed to send the offer campaign to both new and prior customers and therefore reach a wider segment of people. Within the various segments other criteria may be applied to further segment the directed offer. The other criteria may include a customer s location a customer s patronage of similar or related merchants how recently a customer patronized a merchant and or people or entities associated with the customer patronizing or being associated with the merchant. Customer interaction association or patronization may be determined by merchant data customer data or payment processor data.

The parameters of an offer are formed in order to build an offer campaign. The parameters may be set by the merchant. Further the marketing campaign application may suggest parameters for the merchant s consideration. With reference to the exemplary screen shot illustrates selecting parameters such as percent discount or discount value a spend threshold to receive the discount the number of visits to use the offer the duration start and end dates and whether the offer can be capped at a specific number of offers or redeemed offers. The referenced screen shot provides recommendations of the parameters to the merchant based on the merchant s average customer.

In accordance with various embodiments and with reference to the marketing campaign application can set boundaries and or guidelines for the offer parameters according to the business objective. For example an offer campaign with an all inclusive objective can have a discount value guideline of 20 to 50 with a 20 value being the default. Similarly an offer campaign with a loyalty objective can have a discount value guideline of 15 to 50 with a 15 value being the default. Likewise an offer campaign with an acquisition objective can have a discount value guideline of 30 to 50 with a 30 value being the default. The guideline limitations may be optional or required. The marketing campaign application can require offers in line with the motivation so that it may provide guidance to the merchant. Furthermore the marketing campaign application is able to apply prior offer data to the current campaign for example by imposing such limitations.

In various embodiments the marketing campaign application is capable of providing recommendations based on an average customer because the marketing campaign application receives past merchant transaction data from a payment processor or a third party institution. The past merchant transaction data includes both information on the merchant transactions and also information on the merchant s customers. For example and with reference to the marketing campaign application can provide offer parameter recommendations based on the average customer spending 45 per transaction and conducting transactions a month. In this example the average transaction amount of 45 is the basis for recommending a spend threshold of 45.

In various embodiments the marketing campaign application can vary the offer campaign based on different customer segments. For example a first segment or population of customers may be offered a first discount level and a second segment or population of customers may be offered a second discount level. In one example new customers may be offered a discount level of 25 and returning customers may be offered a discount level of 10 . Furthermore various customers may be added or removed from the offer campaign for various reasons such as removing consistent customers. Irregular prior customers may also be added or removed. For additional detail on removing specific people from a list U.S. application Ser. No. 12 857 389 filed Aug. 16 2010 and entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR E MAIL BASED REWARDS is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In response to the offer campaign setup the merchant may review and submit the offer as illustrated in . The completed and confirmed offer campaign can be distributed across multiple electronic distribution channels. In various embodiments and with reference to the merchant can select which electronic distribution channels and associated social networks to distribute the offer campaign. One example of a completed mobile offer is illustrated in .

In addition to a merchant creating an offer campaign with various parameters the offer campaign can be applied to multiple merchant locations e.g. regions . In various embodiments and with reference to a merchant may have more than one location. The offer campaign can be valid for one or more locations as set by the merchant. The merchant can control which locations are valid for the offer campaign within the marketing campaign application . Furthermore in various embodiments the merchant can tailor the offer campaigns to individual locations as well. For example a first location can have an offer campaign with an acquisition objective and a second location can have an offer campaign with a loyalty objective.

As part of the offer an offer may be provided to an account holder as the customer. The offer may be valid in response to a transaction or the account holder satisfying at least one criterion of the offer. The criterion may be set by the merchant. The criterion may include one or more of a transaction date range an enrollment cap a spending percentage a threshold level and or the like. The various types of offers may include an offer that is partially or fully applied at the time of the transaction and or an offer that is partially or fully applied after the transaction is completed. In order to apply the offer after the transaction is completed the method may include matching an accepted offer with a record of charge ROC in a transaction account held by the account holder and crediting the transaction account held by the account holder based upon the matching. The offer may be a rewards offer such as an offer of a credit of monetary value to the transaction account a merchant prepaid account a discount or a credit of loyalty points. For additional detail regarding applying an offer after the transaction is completed U.S. application Ser. No. 13 411 281 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING COUPON LESS DISCOUNTS BASED ON A USER BROADCASTED MESSAGE is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Again the offer may be provided to an account holder via one or more distribution channels.

In accordance with various embodiments an account holder is selected to receive an offer based on at least one of location active registration and or prior transaction history. A location of an account holder may be determined based upon one or more of a travel itinerary a OPS signal a location signal for example proximity of a mobile communication device to a cellular base station and or a zip code. Further an account holder may register to receive a coupon offer or a coupon less offer. In various embodiments a coupon offer can be redeemed when a customer presents a physical coupon or a digital representation such as a bar code on a mobile phone e.g. during the transaction checkout. The merchant processes the offer during the transaction and the discount may be applied prior to completion of the checkout. The tracking and reporting of the coupon redemption can be performed by the merchant.

In various embodiments a coupon less offer can be redeemed during a transaction without presenting a coupon or bar code. No interaction needs to take place at the merchant because the coupon less offer is redeemed as a credit to the card member after the transaction is completed. Though coupons may be presented for a different offer during the transaction it is understood that the coupon less offer is conducted for that specific offer without a coupon present. Furthermore a coupon provided to a user either before or after the transaction can still be considered a coupon less offer if no coupon or bar code is presented during the transaction. An advantage of a coupon less offer is that the redemption can be tracked and reported by a payment processor or third party. An offer from a merchant registered to provide coupon less offers may be transmitted to a mobile communication device. In various embodiments the offer may be provided based upon the location of the account holder. In various embodiments a merchant s offer may be limited to selecting by the merchant at least one merchant location for redemption of the offer. An offer once accepted by an account holder may be matched to a record of charge associated with a transaction account held by the account holder. A credit may be applied to the account holder s transaction account and a debit may be applied to a transaction account of the registered merchant. A credit may be applied based upon a transaction complying with one or more criteria specified by a registered merchant for a coupon less offer. An exemplary criterion comprises a spend level on a class of products. One or more offer categories and or one or more offer category classes may be transmitted to the mobile communication device based upon the account holder s location.

The determination of who receives the offer may also be based at least in part on the transaction history of the account holder. Furthermore the qualification for any reward associated with the offer may be based at least in part on an aggregate transaction history of the account holder. Also the qualification for the rebate credit may be based at least in part on a product identifier corresponding to at least one of a particular product or a vendor. An offer based on a prior transaction at a first merchant may result in an offer for the same first merchant or for a second merchant. For example the second merchant may be a competitor of the first merchant or may be complementary to the first merchant thereby having a higher likelihood of the account holder redeeming the offer.

An account holder can receive the predefined offer in a variety of ways. For example the account holder can receive the predefined offer on a portable electronic device. Moreover in various embodiments an account holder identifier may be a unique identifier associated with the portable electronic device which is associated with the account holder. The unique identifier associated with the portable electronic device may be used to match the transaction to an account holder identifier.

The marketing campaign application may also include providing the merchant with management options and reporting options. In various embodiments and with reference to the marketing campaign application can provide a merchant with a management dashboard for presenting information related to the merchant s offers. As illustrated a merchant may have multiple offers with each campaign having specific parameters and statuses. In various embodiments the merchant can control the status of the offers varying from live pending cancelled and completed.

The reporting options may include a marketing analysis or monitoring of the success of various marketing programs and information relating to account holder participation therein. In various embodiments and with reference to in addition to generating an offer the system and method may further include repotting various metrics of the offer to the merchant or other entity. For example the report may be provided to an entity that selects the offer parameters. In various embodiments the systems and methods may include associating a transaction account of the account holder with the offer monitoring a transaction of the transaction account comparing the transaction with a criterion governing the offer and generating a report for the merchant based on the transaction and account holder information. Reporting information may include a daily weekly monthly or other periodic breakdown of the total sales and total discounts generated by an offer. This information can help the merchant track the trends of the offer such as whether the total sales are increasing or decreasing over time. In addition the reporting information may include tracking information on the number of repeat customers and new customers during an offer period. Furthermore in various embodiments the report generating may occur during any time period and in various embodiments in approximately real time with the transaction. One advantage of approximately real time report generation is the ability to modify the offer based on the reporting data.

In various embodiments a reporting method may include associating by a computer based system a transaction account of an account holder with an offer monitoring a transaction of the transaction account comparing the transaction with a criterion governing the offer and generating a report for a merchant based on the transaction and account holder information. The generated report may include several types of analysis and information for the merchant. For example reporting information in the report may include at least one of number of offers transmitted number of offers accepted number of offers redeemed total value of redeemed offers average size of transaction involving the offer and rate of offer redemption.

In various embodiments the reporting information in the report may include a return on investment or performance information. The return on investment is based on a comparison of transactions during an offer period and transactions during a non offer period. This metric may be calculated in multiple ways. For instance the metric could compare all of the transactions in an offer period to all of the transactions in a non offer period. The metric may also determine whether an account holder or user spent a minimum amount to receive the offer or more than the minimum amount defined in the offer. These comparisons help capture the secondary effect of providing an offer to account holders such as the effect of marketing the offer. Such comparisons could also be seasonally adjusted in order to obtain a more accurate understanding of an offers impact on business. Further the reporting may separately analyze transactions making use of the offer versus transactions not making use of the offer.

In various embodiments the reporting information in the report may include tracking information on the number of repeat customers and new customers during an offer period. The determination of whether a customer is a repeat customer or a new customer may be based on the transaction history of the account holder. When generating the report a search of a transaction account number in a database having prior transactions is conducted a match is found then the account holder is a repeat customer. If a match is not found then the customer may be considered a new customer. Furthermore in various embodiments a search for a merchant identifier in the account holder s transaction history database may be conducted. If the merchant identifier is located in the account holder s transaction history then the customer may be considered a repeat customer of the merchant. If the merchant identifier is not found then the customer may be considered a new customer of the merchant.

In various embodiments the reporting information in the report may include non transaction information and the non transaction information may include at least one of demographic information of the account holder and social media indicators. With respect to demographic information the report may contain information such as age gender ethnicity nationality income marital status disabilities mobility home ownership employment status and location. The demographic information may be obtained directly from the account holder or may be obtained from an account holder database. The demographic information can be useful to a merchant to validate whether an offer directed towards a specific demographic is yielding results. The demographic information may aid a merchant in selecting a specific demographic to target in an offer.

With respect to social media indicators in various embodiments the report may contain information such as the number of likes shares or any other indication given by an account holder to a social media network of a response to the offer.

If the marketing campaign system has access to both the account holder information and the transaction information the system is able to obtain data on both the customer account and the merchant transaction. In various embodiments the marketing campaign system is configured to access the transaction information and account holder information in approximately real time and thereby generate the report approximately real time with the transaction. In various embodiments the transaction information and account holder information is accessed on a delayed time period such as daily. Even if the reporting is not real time frequent offer reports still enable the merchant to receive timely status updates on the offer. The timely reports may enable the merchant to modify the current offer based on the reporting data. In accordance with various embodiments marketing campaign application comprises an application programming interface API configured to retrieve transaction data in approximately real time to the occurrence of a transaction. The transaction data is inputted into marketing campaign application and enables reporting on the performance of the current offer and overall campaign performance may influence changes to the current campaign or to a future offer.

In various embodiments a marketing campaign system has limited access to merchant and account holder data. A marketing campaign reporting method may include receiving from a financial institution hatch data on multiple transactions. The marketing campaign reporting method includes filtering the batch data for a transaction at the merchant and account holder information associated with the transaction comparing the transaction with a criterion governing an offer and generating a report for the merchant based on the transaction and the account holder information. The reporting information in the report may include at least one of number of offers transmitted number of offers accepted number of offers redeemed total value of redeemed offers average size of transaction involving the offer and rate of offer redemption. Further the reporting information in the report may include a return on investment wherein the return on investment is based on a comparison of transactions during an offer period and transactions during a non offer period. Further the reporting information in the report may include non transaction information wherein the non transaction information includes at least one of demographic information of the account holder and social media indicators

In various embodiments where the marketing campaign system receives batch data on multiple transactions from a financial institution and filters for a transaction at the merchant and account holder information associated with the transaction the batch data may not be received in approximately real time. Even if the batch data is received after an offer is completed a second offer may be generated based on the batch data.

However data tables having similar though not identical data in the key fields may also be linked by using AGREP for example. Any suitable data storage technique may be utilized to store data without a standard format. Data sets may be stored using any suitable technique including for example storing individual files using an ISO IEC 7816 4 file structure implementing a domain whereby a dedicated file is selected that exposes one or more elementary files containing one or more data sets using data sets stored in individual files using a hierarchical filing system data sets stored as records in a single file including compression SQL accessible hashed via one or more keys numeric alphabetical by first triple etc. Binary Large Object BLOB stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO IEC 7816 6 data elements stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO IEC Abstract Syntax Notation ASN.1 as in ISO IEC 8824 and 8825 and or other proprietary techniques that may include fractal compression methods image compression methods etc.

In various embodiments the ability to store a wide variety of information in different formats is facilitated by storing the information as a BLOB. Thus any binary information can be stored in a storage space associated with a data set. As discussed above the binary information may be stored on the financial transaction instrument or external to but affiliated with the financial transaction instrument. The BLOB method may store data sets as ungrouped data elements formatted as a block of binary via a fixed memory offset using either fixed storage allocation circular queue techniques or best practices with respect to memory management e.g. paged memory least recently used etc. . By using BLOB methods the ability to store various data sets that have different formats facilitates the storage of data associated with system by multiple and unrelated owners of the data sets. For example a first data set which may be stored may be provided by a first party a second data set which may be stored may be provided by an unrelated second party and yet a third data set which may be stored may be provided by an third party unrelated to the first and second party. Each of these three exemplary data sets may contain different information that is stored using different data storage formats and or techniques. Further each data set may contain subsets of data that also may be distinct from other subsets.

As stated above in various embodiments of system the data can be stored without regard to a common format. However in one exemplary embodiment the data set e.g. BLOB may be annotated in a standard manner when provided for manipulating the data onto the financial transaction instrument. The annotation may comprise a short header trailer or other appropriate indicator related to each data set that is configured to convey information useful in managing the various data sets. For example the annotation may be called a condition header header trailer or status herein and may comprise an indication of the status of the data set or may include an identifier correlated to a specific issuer or owner of the data. In one example the first three bytes of each data set BLOB may be configured or configurable to indicate the status of that particular data set e.g. LOADED INITIALIZED READY BLOCKED REMOVABLE or DELETED Subsequent bytes of data may be used to indicate for example the identity of the issuer user transaction membership account identifier or the like. Each of these condition annotations are further discussed herein.

The data set annotation may also be used for other types of status information as well as various other purposes. For example the data set annotation may include security information establishing access levels. The access levels may for example be configured to permit only certain individuals levels of employees companies or other entities to access data sets or to permit access to specific data sets based on the transaction merchant issuer user or the like. Furthermore the security information may restrict permit only certain actions such as accessing modifying and or deleting data sets. In one example the data set annotation indicates that only the data set owner or the user are permitted to delete a data set various identified users may be permitted to access the data set for reading and others are altogether excluded from accessing the data set. However other access restriction parameters may also be used allowing various entities to access a data set with various permission levels as appropriate.

The data including the header or trailer may be received by a stand alone interaction device configured to add delete modify or augment the data in accordance with the header or trailer. As such in various embodiments the header or trailer is not stored on the transaction device along with the associated issuer owned data but instead the appropriate action may be taken by providing to the transaction instrument user at the stand alone device the appropriate option for the action to be taken. System contemplates a data storage arrangement wherein the header or trailer or header or trailer history of the data is stored on the transaction instrument in relation to the appropriate data.

Phrases and terms similar to financial institution transaction account issuer issuer and payment processor may be used interchangeably and include any person entity software and or hardware that offers transaction account services. For example a payment processor may include an issuer and or an acquirer. Although often referred to as a financial institution the financial institution may represent any type of bank lender or other type of account issuing institution such as credit card companies card sponsoring companies or third party issuers under contract with financial institutions. It is further noted that other participants may be involved in some phases of the transaction such as an intermediary settlement institution. Phrases or terms similar to a processor such as a payment processor may include a company e.g. a third party institution appointed e.g. by a merchant to handle transactions for merchant banks. Processors may be broken down into two types front end and back end. Front end processors have connections to various transaction accounts and supply authorization and settlement services to the merchant banks merchants. Back end processors accept settlements from front end processors and via The Federal Reserve Bank move money from an issuing bank to the merchant bank. In an operation that will usually take a few seconds the payment processor will both check the details received by forwarding the details to the respective account s issuing bank or card association for verification and may carry out a series of anti fraud measures against the transaction. Additional parameters including the account s country of issue and its previous payment history may be used to gauge the probability of the transaction being approved. In response to the payment processor receiving confirmation that the transaction account details have been verified the information may be relayed back to the merchant who will then complete the payment transaction. In response to the verification being denied the payment processor relays the information to the merchant who may then decline the transaction.
