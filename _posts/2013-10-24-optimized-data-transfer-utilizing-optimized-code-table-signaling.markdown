The present application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 862 745 filed Aug. 6 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The disclosure generally relates to the field of communication systems particularly to a data communication system utilizing optimized code table signaling.

Various data communication schemes are available for radio communication systems. Modulation techniques e.g. analog or digital modulation may be utilized in such communication schemes. In addition encoding and decoding processes may also be utilized to improve the signal integrity of the data being communicated.

The present disclosure is directed to data communication systems and methods. In various embodiments the method applies optimized code table signaling OCTS to a digital data stream for the purpose of optimizing its transfer adapting to a digital communications network and operating independent of industry and regulatory standards for input digital bit stream and transmission methods.

A further embodiment comprises applying OCTS to an analog bit stream that has been digitized for the purpose of optimizing the bit stream s transfer adapting to a communications method selected for transmission of digitized analog signals and operating independent of industry and regulatory standards for input digitized analog signal stream and transmission methods.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not necessarily restrictive of the present disclosure. The accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification illustrate subject matter of the disclosure. Together the descriptions and the drawings serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.

Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments including embodiments showing example implementations of systems and methods for OCTS expanded data communications. Wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict example embodiments of the disclosed systems and or methods of use for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following description that alternative example embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

In one embodiment upon receiving data from a sender step transforms encodes the received data into a vector of real numbers which may be referred to as a real valued data vector . For example each n bit binary word may be transformed into a set of m real valued numbers. The transformation is calculated in real time for each binary word based on the mapping function or performed as a lookup in a pre computed table. For example in one embodiment Trellis coded Modulation TCM is utilized for transforming a sequence of n bit binary words into a sequence of m real valued numbers based on the pre computed table.

The number m of real valued numbers utilized to represent an n bit binary word may vary based on the properties of the communication path environment. For example in one embodiment fewer than 6 real valued numbers are utilized to represent a 6 bit binary word in a less noisy environment. In another embodiment comprising a noisy environment a 6 bit binary word may be transformed into a set of 6 or more real valued numbers. Those skilled in the art will understand that a small m value the number of real valued numbers used to represent an n bit binary word increases transmission capacity while a larger m value provides better performance in a noisy environment. The specific values of n and m may be determined base on one or more properties of the communication environment such as for example noise level bit error rate signal integrity and or other properties.

A transmitter transmits the transformed real value data vector to a receive side. Standard communication mechanism such as for example radio communication technologies comprising analog and or digital module and or spread spectrum techniques may be utilized for the transmission. For example in one embodiment Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM is utilized for transmission of the transformed real value data vector from the sender side to the receiver side.

Upon receipt of the real valued data vector on the receiver side the received real valued data vector is transformed decoded into the computer readable format originally sent by the sender . In one embodiment the decoding process is performed as a table lookup for each set of m real valued numbers to locate the n bit binary word represented by the given set of m real valued numbers. For example for each set of m real valued numbers the decoding process locates an element in the lookup table that has the smallest Euclidian distance away from this set of m real valued numbers. Thus the n bit binary word that corresponds to this element in the lookup table is the n bit binary word represented by the set of m real valued numbers.

Once the transformation of the real valued data vector into data represented in a computer readable medium format is completed the computer readable data is transmitted to the receiver . It will be appreciated that additional signal integrity is provided by transmitting the encoded real valued data vectors instead of the original binary data stream. Since the transformation table or code table is not shared with a third party decoding of the intercepted real valued data vector by the third party into the format originally sent by the sender may be prevented and or deferred. In some embodiments the sender and the receiver both comprise a pool of potential code tables suitable for performing the encoding and decoding. The sender informs the receiver of the specific code table utilized for encoding via a table identifier such as for example acknowledging a table identifier as part of a handshake process and or sending the identifier as part of the data transmission. The table identifier may not be meaningful to the third party intercepting the transmission.

In some embodiments the performance of the data communication system is determined by the attributes of the code tables which may be optimized based on the properties of the communication environment. The code tables may not be unique for mapping an n bit binary word to a set of real valued numbers. In one embodiment the selection criteria for a suitable code table comprises 1 having a maximum distance between the data vectors while maintaining the maximum power in the data vectors and using the same dynamic range within each column and 2 providing an acceptable encoding and decoding performance for example above a predetermined threshold.

In one embodiment the code table selecting module comprises a determining module for determining at least one of a communication characteristic of a communication environment a desired level of signal integrity a desired data throughput level or any combination thereof. The code table selecting module selects the code table at least partially based upon at least one of said communication characteristic of the communication environment desired level of signal integrity desired data throughput level or any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the code table selecting module includes a table generating module for creating a plurality of candidate code tables each of the plurality of candidate code tables having real valued data entries. The code table selecting module selects the code table from the plurality of candidate code tables based on an evaluation criterion. For example in one embodiment the evaluation criterion is based on at least one characteristic of the communication environment such as for example noise level bit error rate signal integrity and or other properties. In another embodiment the evaluation criterion comprises a minimum separation distance for a given candidate code table.

In some embodiments the code table selecting module comprises a selecting module for selecting a code table from a set of preconfigured code tables. Each preconfigured code table of the set of preconfigured code tables is associated with a performance metric to facilitate the selection process. Once a selection is made a coordinating module coordinates the code table selected with at least one receiver.

In some embodiments the data communication system comprises an evaluating module for evaluating a performance metric of the code table. A determining module is configured to determine whether the performance can be improved if the current code table is replaced with a new code table. If the performance can be improved a replacing module replaces the current code table with the new code table and the new code table is utilized for subsequent data communications.

As previously mentioned the receiver is configured for transforming the vector of real numbers received into a best corresponding vector by utilizing the code table. In one embodiment the receiver comprises a vector generating module for creating a set of candidates for the best corresponding vector an associating module for associating each candidate of the set of candidates with a confidence value the confidence value for each candidate is determined based on a separation distance between the candidate and the vector of real numbers calculated utilizing the code table and a transforming module for transforming the vector of real numbers into the candidate with the best confidence value. In some embodiments the receiver comprises a storage device configured for storing the best corresponding vector.

In some embodiments code table generation algorithms are driven by a seed value passed into a pseudorandom number generator. By using a random number generator that creates an identical string of pseudorandom numbers given an identical seed the code table generation algorithms will generate an identical code table given an identical seed. A code table may be identified by a unique identifier within a naming scheme and or by a seed value. In some embodiments the code table algorithms require two or more seed values each for unique functions within the code table generation algorithm. When multiple seed values are used an exhaustive search of a code table space driven by creating an exhaustive list of code tables becomes prohibitively complex. In some embodiments code table generation comprises a three step process consisting of table creation table evaluation and table partitioning.

In some embodiments a full set of code table output vectors is referred to as a code table signal constellation. Given a pair of n element output vectors x x x . . . x and y y y . . . y the mean free Euclidian distance MFED between vectors x and y is given by the equation 

In some embodiments comprising sparsely populated code tables a table creation process generates a search algorithm to generate candidate code tables and to evaluate each of the candidate code tables with a code table metric. For example in one embodiment if a table is very sparsely populated a table generator spreads the signal constellation apart to generate better candidates as compared to a signal constellation with a more uniform spread. In another embodiment comprising a fully populated code table the minimum MFED may be identical in all cases. In this embodiment the table generator is configured to maintain mapping from a single random number seed to a specific and repeatedly generated code table.

An OCTS expanded process provides the means to manage many of the tasks of OCTS and expands the utility of OCTS as an industry standards agnostic interface to an existing digital communications system. In some embodiments an OCTS expanded table comprises an addition of a column to the OCTS table indicating the expanded use of each encoded vector. illustrates one embodiment of a standard OCTS table. illustrates one embodiment of an OCTS expanded table comprising an additional column. In some embodiments one or more internal OCTS expanded control channels are included for the OCTS expanded process. As illustrated in a traditional OCTS table comprises one or more OCTS encoded vectors . The OCTS expanded table illustrated in comprises one or more OCTS encoded vectors and further comprises a use column . The use column identifies the use of a vector within the OCTS expanded table .

In some embodiments OCTS expanded processing requires two independent channels denoted as the Gateway Channel and the Composite Channel. The Gateway Channel allows a member user into the signal stream and the Composite Channel provides message and control functions. Each channel requires its own code table denoted as the Gateway Code Table and the Composite Code Table. In some embodiments the encoded Gateway Channel output vectors are interleaved with the encoded Composite Channel output vectors into a single pipe. The interleaving provides an additional measure of complexity to the signal stream that may be used for additional functions beyond Optimized Data Transfer.

In some embodiments a data vector is interleaved as illustrated in . A binary input data vector is provided to an OCTS expanded encoder . The OCTS expanded encoder applies an OCTS expanded table to the binary input data vector . A gateway encoder encodes a gateway channel utilizing a second OCTS expanded table. The data stream for the OCTS expanded encoder and the gateway encoder are interleaved into the same output stream to produce a multi valued output composite vector which is transmitted over a communication channel. In some embodiments the communication channel may comprise an RF communication channel. In other embodiments the communication channel may comprise any bound or unbound communication channel. An internal OCTS expanded controller is configured to control both the OCTS expanded encoder and the gateway encoder .

In various embodiments a channel is defined as a specifically purposed stream of encoded information. illustrates one embodiment of an OCTS expanded table comprising a use column denoting the use type for each vector within the OCTS expanded table . Each data type of the Use Column of an OCTS expanded encoded vector has a designated use. In some embodiments control data for the Gateway Channel is used for gateway and code table identification and is denoted C. Control data for the Gateway Channel may be further used for Receive and Transmit RX TX coordination. In some embodiments additional use column data for the Gateway Channel comprising Error Control Coding ECC information denoted as E and additional data denoted as D may be included in the OCTS expanded table . In some embodiments the composite channel is used for combination data RX TX coordination and or other possible control information. Control data for RX TX coordination in the Composite Channel is denoted C Error Control Coding information is denoted as E and additional data may be included and is denoted as D. In some embodiments additional uses may exist for the Composite Channel and may be used for growth and expansion of the OCTS expanded process. In one embodiment the additional Composite Channel data defines the function and performance of OCTS expanded Quality of Service processing.

In various embodiments a pipe comprises the full set of channels for an RX TX pair. A symbol comprises one element of an encoded output vector a frame comprises the full element set of an encoded output vector and a block comprises the full frame set of encoded vectors included in a message block. Symbol synchronization comprises the identification of the leading edge of single symbol. Frame synchronization comprises the identification of the initial symbol within a frame. Block synchronization comprises the identification of the initial frame within a message block.

In some embodiments the interleaved encoded multi valued output vector is created using a mask to identify the locations within the Composite Channel symbol stream to interleave with the Gateway Channel symbol stream. illustrates one embodiment of a composite channel code block a gateway channel code block a pipe comprising the interleaved composite channel code block and the gateway channel code block and a mask indicating the interleave pattern of the pipe . In the illustrated embodiment the gateway channel block length is dissimilar to the composite code block length and both are dissimilar to the Interleaved Code Block length. The interleaving of the gateway channel and the composite channel with frame and message synchronization requires symbol synchronization. In some embodiments the interleaving process sifts the symbols through the de interleave function. This is detailed in Table 1 and allows full message transmission through the Composite Channel.

In some embodiments a number q of symbol elements is available for each element of the output vector. For example in the case of Multiple Frequency Key Shifting with forty one unique tones q is equal to 41. The number of binary inputs comprises 2 where m is the number of elements in the binary input vector and the total number of possible output vectors is q where n is the number of elements in the encoded output vector. For example the OCTS expanded table illustrated in may be used to encode a 16 bit input vector. The number of unique binary inputs is 2 65 536 and the number of unique multi valued output vectors is 41 68 921. The OCTS expanded Code Table associated with this input output pairing is an array of dimension 68921 3 . In this example the D partition of the OCTS expanded Code Table comprises the first 65 536 rows leaving 68 921 65 536 3 385 rows to encode 3 385 C and E vectors.

In various embodiments an OCTS expanded process can transmit and receive into an existing digital communications system to integrate robust control features into the digital data stream. illustrates one embodiment of an OCTS expanded process integrated into a digital communications system. In this embodiment a conventional digital bit stream is converted to a composite multi valued stream including data control and additional error control coding information. The digital bit stream is provided to an input buffer . The input buffer passes the digital bit stream to an error control coding process . The digital bit stream and the error control coding stream are provided to a multiplexer which is coupled to an input vector mapper . The input vector mapper maps the output of the multiplexer to an OCTS expanded table. The composite channel signal coding process encodes mapped vectors based on a table stored by the composite table manager and the table library manager . The encoded data is passed to an interleaver to interleave the data with a gateway channel stream. The gateway channel stream is generated by a transmit controller coupled to a gateway channel formatter . The gateway channel formatter provides gateway channel data to a gateway channel mask which in turn passes the data to a gateway channel signal coding process for encoding the gateway channel data. The encoded gateway channel data is provided to the interleave signal processor and is interleaved with the composite channel data provided by the composite channel signal coding process. The interleaved signal is provided to an input buffer and then to the transmission medium . In some embodiments the output of the OCTS expanded processing transmit module of the digital communications system is one to one that is a given input to the OCTS expanded processing transmit module always results in the same output and the output is unique to the given input.

After being de interleaved the gateway channel is provided to a gateway channel signal coding block to decode the gateway channel data through an OCTS expanded table. The output of the gateway channel signal coding block is provided to a gateway channel mask block to remove the mask from the gateway channel data. The de masked gateway channel data is provided to a gateway channel formatter which removes previously added formatting from the gateway channel data and provides the gateway channel data to a receive controller .

In some embodiments the gateway code table and message blocks encode and decode the composite code table identifier and provide confidence in the composite code table identifier s correct decoding. In one embodiment an appropriate number of seeds for pseudorandom number generators are used by the receive function to uniquely generate the Composite Code Table. Multiple methods may be used to establish the Gateway Code Table and Message Blocks such as for example bit position partitioning table partitioning or a combination of the two techniques.

In Bit Position Partitioning both the transmitter and receiver know the location of the encoded bits. Detection of the transmitted message is available to the receiver based on knowledge of the position of the encoded message. An appropriate number of seeds are used to generate the pseudorandom numbers for the unique encoding.

With table partitioning the partitions can be allocated to increase the Mean Free Euclidian Distance MFED between elements of the partition by assigning encoded elements with the smallest MFED to different partitions. This increases the MFED within a partition thus increasing noise rejection properties in the case where a received signal can be identified as a member of a specific partition.

With the use of table partitioning alone the gateway channel information can be encoded using the gateway channel s partition elements without the use of bit position partitioning for identification. With bit position partitioning the process of synchronizing against the first element of a message block can be achieved by recognizing the position of the gateway channel information within the block and stepping back in bit position with this known offset. In table partitioning the gateway channel information must carry this offset within its encoding since the offset from the received Gateway Channel bits and the lead bit of a message block can vary. illustrates one embodiment of a gateway code table and block configured for table partitioning. As illustrated in the OCTS expanded encoded vector for the gateway channel comprises the offset within the channel frames .

In various embodiments the interleave and de interleave functions are configured to act in coordination with each other. The interleave and de interleave functions are each driven by a controller utilizing the interleave and de interleave specification and sequencing seeds.

In some embodiments the gateway channel format and reformat functions are configured to act in coordination with each other. The gateway channel format and reformat functions are each driven by the controller utilizing the gateway channel format and reformat specification and sequencing seeds.

In some embodiments an error correcting code such a Bose Chaudhuri and or Hocquenghem BCH code that generates additional bits that are added uniquely to the data stream is included in the OCTS expanded processing. By adding the use definition to each code the E encoded vectors can be injected into the composite data stream in an arbitrary location since they can be identified specifically as the generated parity and error correction bits. In various embodiments the input MUX and output DEMUX are configured to act in coordination with each other. The input MUX and the output DEMUX are each driven by the controller utilizing the MUX DEMUX specification and sequencing seeds.

In some embodiments an OCTS expanded communication system comprises a controller. The controller is responsible for a series of tasks such as for example quality of service monitoring and code table selection to meet the needs of a dynamic transmission environment. The controller may be further responsible for specifying scheduling and coordinating code table swaps input remapping multiplexer and de multiplexer operations gateway channel formatting and or interleaved operations. In some embodiments the controller is configured to receive information such as for example code table swap seeds input remapping seeds multiplexer and de multiplexer operation seeds gate channel formatting seeds and or interleaved operation seeds. The received seeds may be generated from the code table generator seeds coded in the gateway channel.

In some embodiments operational requirements for the controller comprise monitoring the transmission environment and adapting to the transmission environment and maintaining a sufficiently high rate of table swapping to maintain signal integrity. The operational requirements may be driven by a specific application. The controller management may be driven by a requirements matrix an options matrix defined by the system resources and or direct and indirect performance and transmission environment measures. Direct performance and transmission environment measures may comprise for example direct quality of service measurements derived using code built into the code table to calibrate against a known signal and receiver unique measurements. Indirect performance and transmission environment measures may comprise for example bit error rate derived from error control coding schemes SNR estimate derived from miss distance measures used in the decoding process and or rule in rule out measure.

In some embodiments an indirect performance and transmission environment measure comprises rule in rule out measure. An OCTS decode process requires comparing the received decoded vector against all of the encoded vectors in a code table. In some embodiments rather than an exhaustive search of the table a rule in rule may be implemented. A rule in rule requires that if the MFED between the input vector and a code table vector is less than a predetermined value the decoded vector is immediately ruled in as the matching vector and the search can cease. In some embodiments a rule out rule may be implemented. A rule out rule requires that if the accumulated MFED calculated on a vector element by vector element basis exceeds a predetermined threshold the code table vector can be ruled out and the MFED calculation for that vector can cease. In some embodiments a derived measure is generated in the case where no vector is ruled in and all but a few vectors are ruled out. In this embodiment the vectors that are not ruled out are correlated to a signal to noise ratio and the proper match determined.
