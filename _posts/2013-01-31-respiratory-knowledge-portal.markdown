The present disclosure generally relates to transmission of data over a network and more particularly to the use of a computing device to communicate with medical devices over a network.

Medical ventilators colloquially called respirators are machines that are typically used to mechanically move breathable air into and out of lungs in order to assist a patient in breathing. Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive care medicine home care emergency medicine and anesthesia. Common ventilators are limited to a single direction of communication and as such are configured to provide information related to the ventilator for display but not receive information from a remote source to control the ventilator. For example common ventilators send outbound data to another entity such as a display device in order to display ventilator settings.

Health care professionals in a health care facility typically need to be in physical proximity to a ventilator e.g. next to the ventilator in order to view ventilator information for a patient. It is difficult however for health care professionals such as respiratory therapists to be physically near each of many patients the therapist is responsible for in order to monitor the ventilation of each of the patients. Thus a therapist monitoring a ventilator of one patient is unable to concurrently monitor the ventilator of another patient. As a result vital health information for a patient on a ventilator may not be seen by the therapist until it is too late or in certain circumstances may never be seen by the therapist. In such circumstances the health care facility in which the therapist and patients are present may suffer economic loss from inefficient use of ventilators for their patients or more importantly may incur negative health consequences for patients due to an inability to monitor the ventilators of multiple patients with a limited number of therapists.

At step ventilator information is transmitted by the ventilator to the medical entity . The ventilator information is associated with the ventilator manipulation. For example transmitter transmits communication that is associated with information regarding the manipulation of ventilator functionality e.g. confirmation of changed ventilator settings .

Context data accessor is configured for accessing context data . Context data can be any information that is able to provide context to ventilator data to enhance patient care via a ventilator. For example context data can be but is not limited to patient identification ID ventilator ID caregiver ID bed ID or location. In certain aspects patient ID is associated with or issued from an Admit Discharge Transfer ADT system not shown . As such the patient ID allows system to acquire additional patient specific information to be associated with ventilator data . The patient specific information can be but not limited to age sex height weight and treatment information associated with the patient. It should be appreciated that treatment information can be but is not limited to surgery acute care burn recover or other treatments. Patient ID can be accessed through patient logon with the ventilator. For example a patient ID which may be worn on a wrist of a patient is scanned and the patient is subsequently logged on to the ventilator and the patient ID is accessed.

Data associator is configured for associating context data and ventilator data such that ventilator data is contextualized. For example ventilator data includes gas supply parameters and ventilator modes. Context data can include the caregiver ID of the caregiver e.g. responsible physician or nurse for the patient associated with the ventilator . Accordingly data associator associates the gas supply parameters and ventilator modes with the caregiver ID. Thus the gas supply parameters and ventilator modes are contextualized by being associated with the caregiver ID.

In certain aspects data associator is further configured for associating a subset or a portion of ventilator data with context data . For example ventilator data is associated with a caregiver ID and or certain operations performed on the ventilator . In such an example the caregiver ID may be accessed locally by scanning the caregiver ID via a scanner coupled to the ventilator or remotely such as through remote login e.g. username password from the caregiver with a handheld interface utilized by the caregiver. As a result ventilator data is associated with the caregiver e.g. to a caregiver ID which in turn allows for forwarding of information to a handheld device or other device location. In various embodiments the caregiver ID is ascertained and or verified for certain actions such as remote login accessing certain stored streaming data changing certain ventilator settings implementing an automated protocol etc.

Transmitter is configured to transmit associated data that is generated by data associator . In certain aspects transmitter is configured to transmit associated data to a handheld device of a caregiver. In various embodiments associated data or contextualized data can be maintained on a ventilator or a server e.g. a server application .

At step of method ventilator data is accessed. The ventilator data is generated by a ventilator . For example ventilator data is accessed by ventilator data accessor and ventilator data is generated by ventilator . At step context data is accessed. For example context data is accessed by context data accessor . At step a patient ID is accessed. For example a patient wristband is scanned to access a patient ID or any other unique patient information e.g. age sex height weight etc. . At step a ventilator ID is accessed. For example a ventilator ID of ventilator is accessed for contextualizing ventilator data . At step a caregiver ID is accessed. For instance a caregiver ID or any other unique caregiver information is accessed to facilitate in contextualizing ventilator data . As a result associated data is transmitted to a handheld device utilized by the caregiver. At step context data is scanned. For example a caregiver ID is scanned in order to access the caregiver ID. In another example context data is scanned via auto ID technology e.g. bar codes radio frequency identification fingerprint etc. . At step context data is accessed for a subset of ventilator actions. For example a caregiver ID is accessed verified for certain ventilator actions such as remote login storing streaming data change certain ventilator settings etc. At associate the ventilator data with the context data such that the ventilator data is contextualized. For instance data associator associates ventilator data and context data to generate associated data such that ventilator data contextualized.

At step a subset of the ventilator data is associated with the context data. For example ventilator data includes gas supply parameters and ventilator modes for an entire duration that a patient is associated with the ventilator . Context data includes a first caregiver ID of a plurality of caregivers for the patient associated with the ventilator . Accordingly data associator associates the gas supply parameters and ventilator modes with the first caregiver ID rather than a second and third caregiver ID for a second and third caregiver for the patient. Thus a portion or subset of ventilator data is associated with the first caregiver ID. At step the contextualized ventilator data is transmitted to a caregiver wherein the context data includes a caregiver identification of the caregiver. For example associated data is transmitted to a tablet computer of the caregiver who is responsible for the care of the patient.

Receiver and transmitter are similar to receiver and transmitter respectively as described above. Processor can be any processor that is configured for processing data applications and the like for ventilator . Memory is configured for storing ventilator information. For example memory stores ventilator data context data and or associated data . Display screen is configured for displaying ventilator information. For example display screen displays a ventilator mode patient ID clinician ID etc. In certain aspects display screen is a touch screen display that allows access to data on other networked ventilators and or medical devices. Scanner is any information reader e.g. bar code reader RF reader etc. that is able to read medical information that is utilized by ventilator . For example scanner is able to scan patient IDs caregiver IDs ventilator IDs and other IDs.

Camera is configured for providing image capture functionality for ventilator . For example camera may capture images of a patient caregiver other medical devices to facilitate in the care or security of a patient associated with ventilator .

Accessory interface which may be wired or wireless is configured to interface other components devices with ventilator . For example accessory interface includes a Universal Serial Bus USB interface for third party accessories e.g. a video camera .

It should be understood that ventilator is operable and provides basic ventilator functionality to provide care for a patient without ventilator component module . However ventilator component module and its respective components enhance the functionality of ventilator as described above. Ventilator component module is disposed within the housing of ventilator or is integral with the housing of ventilator . However ventilator component module may also be releasably attached to ventilator as depicted in . This allows for upgrades to ventilator . For example a version of ventilator component module may easily be swapped out with a new version of ventilator component module . Additionally the releasably attached ventilator component module also facilitates in managing regulatory compliance in the event that some components functions of the ventilator component module are not immediately approved for patient use.

Ventilator protocol accessor is configured for accessing ventilator protocol . Ventilator protocol can be any protocol facilitating in the control of ventilator functionality. For example ventilator protocol can pertain to oxygen level flow rate or timing. In various embodiments ventilator protocol can be but is not limited to a weaning protocol an acute care protocol a neonatal Oprotocol and a lung protection protocol. In certain aspects a protocol can be described as a decision tree with respect to ventilator control and functionality. In certain aspects ventilator protocol provides instructions to clinicians on what to do with respect to the ventilator. Ventilator protocol may be native to a ventilator and thus provided by a ventilator e.g. ventilator . In other embodiments ventilator protocol may be pushed accessed from other systems such as but not limited to a hosted or deployed user interface or a hospital healthcare system.

Ventilator protocol implementor is configured for implementing ventilator protocol via a touch screen display of a ventilator e.g. display screen . In other words ventilator protocol implementor is configured to implement ventilator protocol on a ventilator by way of user input at the ventilator. For example one or more ventilator protocols e.g. weaning protocol lung protection protocol etc. may be displayed on a touch display screen of a ventilator . A caregiver then selects via the touch display screen which ventilator protocol is to be implemented on the ventilator for patient care. Accordingly based on user input ventilator protocol implementor automatically implements the selected ventilator protocol on the ventilator . In various embodiments ventilator protocol is implemented in combination with a medical device such as an infusion pump. Ventilator protocol can also be controlled or implemented based on patient input. For example a conscious patient may be able to increase reduce ventillatory support by self selection within a protocol defined range.

Ventilator protocol customizer is configured for customizing ventilator protocol . Ventilator protocol customizer can customize ventilator protocol based on unique patient information for example a patient ID patient lab results patient test results etc. It should be appreciated that the patient information can be accessed from an ADT system.

Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise bus . Common forms of machine readable media include for example floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM an EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge or any other medium from which a computer can read. The machine readable storage medium can be a machine readable storage device a machine readable storage substrate a memory device a composition of matter effecting a machine readable propagated signal or a combination of one or more of them.

As used herein the phrase at least one of preceding a series of items with the terms and or or to separate any of the items modifies the list as a whole rather than each member of the list i.e. each item . The phrase at least one of does not require selection of at least one item rather the phrase allows a meaning that includes at least one of any one of the items and or at least one of any combination of the items and or at least one of each of the items. By way of example the phrases at least one of A B and C or at least one of A B or C each refer to only A only B or only C any combination of A B and C and or at least one of each of A B and C.

Terms such as top bottom front rear and the like as used in this disclosure should be understood as referring to an arbitrary frame of reference rather than to the ordinary gravitational frame of reference. Thus a top surface a bottom surface a front surface and a rear surface may extend upwardly downwardly diagonally or horizontally in a gravitational frame of reference.

Furthermore to the extent that the term include have or the like is used in the description or the claims such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term comprise as comprise is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.

A reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean one and only one unless specifically stated but rather one or more. Pronouns in the masculine e.g. his include the feminine and neuter gender e.g. her and its and vice versa. The term some refers to one or more. Headings and subheadings are used for convenience only do not limit the subject technology and are not referred to in connection with the interpretation of the description of the subject technology. All structural and functional equivalents to the elements of the various configurations described throughout this disclosure that are known or later come to be known to those of ordinary skill in the art are expressly incorporated herein by reference and intended to be encompassed by the subject technology. Moreover nothing disclosed herein is intended to be dedicated to the public regardless of whether such disclosure is explicitly recited in the above description.

While this specification contains many specifics these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what may be claimed but rather as descriptions of particular implementations of the subject matter. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system components in the aspects described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all aspects and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

The subject matter of this specification has been described in terms of particular aspects but other aspects can be implemented and are within the scope of the following claims. For example the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. As one example the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown or sequential order to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Other variations are within the scope of the following claims.
