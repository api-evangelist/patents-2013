Consumer adoption of mobile devices such as cellular telephones laptop computers pagers personal digital assistants and the like has increased dramatically over recent years. These devices can be used for a diversity of purposes ranging from basic communications to conducting business transactions to managing entertainment media as well as a host of other tasks. Additional enhancements such as location awareness features e.g. global positioning system GPS tracking also enable mobile device users to monitor their position and present their location via a local display. Distracted driving has also emerged as a growing problem among drivers who actively use communication apps such as for example e mail SMS text messaging social media etc. In fact distracted driving is considered to be one of the leading causes of car accidents. The availability of mobile devices such as mobile phones tablets personal digital assistants PDA s etc. contributes greatly to this problem.

An apparatus method and software for detecting and disabling and or restricting the use of a mobile device by a driver is described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments described. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments described may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the various embodiments.

It is observed that portable device users who enjoy an increased level of mobility have to be mindful of their location as well as keep a vigilant eye on their devices to ensure the devices and or information stored thereon is not misplaced lost or stolen. Traditionally when a portable device went missing for whatever the cause the use of conventional approaches to locate and recover the device or at least identify a potential perpetrator e.g. a thief has yielded little if any success. Moreover most mobile device owners rely on password and encryption techniques to protect valuable or otherwise sensitive information stored to their devices however even encrypted data once in the hands of another may be eventually decrypted. As a consequence a void exists in the marketplace for effective and efficient techniques to remotely control and track mobile devices such as for the purpose of locating and recovering missing devices or identifying potential perpetrators.

Therefore the approach of system according to certain exemplary embodiments stems from the recognition that consumers can benefit from remote control and tracking services whereby subscribers or users are given access to a management platform for remotely activating at least one application on their devices such as one or more mobile devices for locating and or controlling these devices. For instance subscribers may access the management platform for remotely activating an application on a mobile device for controlling an audio interface e.g. a microphone and or an imaging interface e.g. a camera of the mobile device to capture one or more signals from the audio interface or the imaging interface. Captured signals may relate to acoustic and or visual indicia of an environment surrounding the mobile device which may be utilized by a subscriber to locate and retrieve their device or identify a potential perpetrator who may have stolen or inadvertently taken possession of the device. In other instances remotely activating an application on the mobile device may cause the mobile device to return spatial positioning information e.g. an address latitude longitude elevation etc. corresponding to a location of the device. This spatial positioning information may be overlaid on for instance a topological depiction of a geographic area surrounding the location of the device which may also be appended with various cartographic features such as buildings landmarks roadways signs and the like or provided with directions to the location of the device. Subscribers may also be given access to the management platform to remotely activate at least one application on their device to control or configure one or more features of the device. For example an application may be remotely activated in order to image or backup a memory of a mobile device as well as store the image to for instance a networked repository. Subscribers may also be enabled to erase a memory of the mobile device such as for the purpose of purging the device of personal or otherwise sensitive information. Still further an application may be remotely activated in order to configure features of or services available to the mobile device such as to monitor or deactivate an ability of the mobile device to transmit and receive information.

Accordingly in some embodiments system facilitates remote mobile device controlling and tracking by enabling subscribers or users to access management platform via one or more client devices e.g. computing device voice station or another mobile device not shown to register to the remote control and tracking services of system as well as to create customize and manage one or more user profiles stored to for example user profiles repository or any other suitable storage location of or accessible to the components or facilities of system . In this manner subscribers may submit requests to platform in order to remotely control configure monitor register and or track their mobile devices . In response thereto platform may generate one or more control signals to remotely activate one or more applications or application programming interfaces API on mobile devices for remotely controlling configuring monitoring and or tracking these devices . Control signals may be transmitted to mobile devices over one or more of networks such as transmitted over one or more of networks as part of one or more API directed messages e.g. API short messaging service SMS directed messages . It is noted that management platform is described in more detail in accordance with .

In certain exemplary embodiments access to platform may be obtained via any suitable portal interface not illustrated such as a voice portal or a web portal. For example a networked remote application for implementing the portal may be deployed via platform however it is contemplated that another facility or component of system such as a frontend middleware or backend server may deploy remote application and consequently interface with platform . As such it is contemplated that remote application may be implemented on one or more of client devices and or and thereby configured to interface with platform . In certain embodiments one or more remote applications may function in conjunction with one another to achieve the features and functionalities of system such as one or more of the processes described herein for remotely controlling and or tracking mobile devices .

The portal may include or provide users with the ability to access configure manage and store user profile information to user profiles repository as well as the ability to remotely control configure monitor and or track their mobile devices . As such platform may be configured to receive or retrieve tracking content from mobile devices and thereby store this tracking content to for example tracking content repository . It is contemplated that tracking content may be additionally or alternatively stored to any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to the components or facilities of system . Further tracking content may generally relate to any signals or information retrieved or received from mobile devices that have been or currently are being remotely controlled configured monitored tracked etc. In this manner the portal may provide subscribers with access to tracking content of tracking content repository .

As seen in platform includes remote application for generating commands instructions parameters and or signals hereinafter collectively referred to as control signals that may be executed on or by mobile device via API s . These control signals are utilized to remotely activate API s to control configure monitor or track mobile device in response to for instance a request to control configure monitor or track mobile device by an authorized subscriber of the remote control and tracking services of system . In this manner the control signals may be utilized to generate store or otherwise implement configuration information based on received control signal s . According to one embodiment control signals may also be utilized to control an audio interface e.g. a microphone or an imaging interface e.g. a camera of mobile device to capture one or more signals from the audio interface or the imaging interface. Captured signals may relate to acoustic and or visual indicia of an environment surrounding mobile device which may be utilized by a subscriber to locate and retrieve their device or identify a potential perpetrator who may have stolen or inadvertently taken possession of the device.

In other instances remote application may generate control signals to remotely activating API s on mobile device to cause mobile device to return spatial positioning information e.g. an address latitude longitude elevation etc. corresponding to a location of mobile device . Accordingly mobile device may be configured to determine corresponding spatial positioning information through conventional satellite positioning system SPS technology such as GPS technology however any suitable navigational or location determination technology may be utilized such as advanced forward link trilateration A FLT assisted GPS A GPS enhanced cellular identification CELL ID wireless area network WLAN positioning etc. As is well known SPS technology utilizes a constellation of satellites that transmit signals to receivers not shown of for example one or more mobile devices so that the receivers may determine corresponding spatial positions or locations speeds directions and or timing for mobile devices . Mobile devices may report this information to platform to facilitate the remote control and or tracking services of system . It is also noted that platform may poll or receive such spatial positioning information from mobile devices in real time so as to provide presence service features related to mobile devices . As such the location of for instance mobile device may be detected without mobile device having to initiate a phone call or other like communication session. Thus platform may be configured to present received and or retrieved spatial positioning information to subscribers such as via one or more GUI s . It is also noted that spatial positioning information may be stored to user profiles repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to system .

Accordingly to particular embodiments spatial positioning information corresponding to a location of mobile device may be overlaid on for instance a topological depiction of a geographic area surrounding the location of mobile device which may also be appended with various cartographic features such as buildings landmarks roadways signs and the like or provided with directions to the location of mobile device .

Subscribers may also be given access to the management platform to remotely activate API s on mobile devices to control or configure one or more features of the device. For example API s may be remotely activated in order to image or backup a memory not shown of mobile device as well as store the image to for instance a networked repository such as tracking content repository . Subscribers may also be enabled to erase a memory of mobile device such as for the purpose of purging mobile device of personal or otherwise sensitive information. Still further API s may be remotely activated to configure features of or services available to mobile device such as to monitor or deactivate an ability of mobile device to transmit and receive information. For instance control signals may be transmitted to mobile device by platform in order to lock mobile device until an appropriate unlock code or signal is input or transmitted to device . As another example subscribers may be enabled to request platform to monitor usage of mobile device and thereby provide a log of such use which may also enable subscribers to determine whether or not their devices have been stolen and or being utilized for illicit or otherwise unauthorized purposes.

Accordingly platform via for example remote application may be configured to issue control signals via various bearers to mobile devices such as in the form of one or more call control setup messages short messaging service SMS messages enhanced messaging service EMS messages multimedia messaging service MMS messages electronic mail files or any other suitable bearer as well as any suitable combination thereof. In particular implementations these bearer mediums may include control signals in various forms including attention AT commands menu traversal paths function codes voice data dual tone multi frequency DTMF signals scripts strings parameters object variables and the like. It is noted that these control signals can be used in lieu of software code and therefore may be directly integrated into the control logic of mobile device thereby requiring less processing and hence less power. It is contemplated however that coded instructions may also be utilized. As such these control signals may be utilized by API s to facilitate the remote control and or tracking services of system .

It is noted that control signals generated by for example remote application of platform may be transmitted to mobile devices via one or more of communication networks . To prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the remote control and or tracking services of platform authentication information may be required. For instance a username and password procedure may be employed. According to one embodiment subscribers may be required to enter a code e.g. personal identification number PIN etc. before accessing the features and functionality of platform . Similarly to prevent the implementation of unauthorized control signals otherwise received at mobile device platform may include an authentication identifier when transmitting control signals to mobile devices . For instance control signals may be encrypted either symmetrically or asymmetrically such that a hash value can be utilized to authenticate received control signals as well as ensure that those control signals have not been impermissibly alerted in transit. As such control signals may include various identifiers keys random numbers random handshakes digital signatures and the like. Further these authenticating schemas may themselves be encrypted or otherwise secured.

According to exemplary embodiments mobile devices may include one or more application protocol interfaces API such as a set of APIs included within for example a binary runtime environment for wireless BREW platform for receiving control signals from platform and thereby for being remotely activated controlled configured monitored tracked etc. by platform . It is contemplated however that one or more other mobile client applications may be utilized such as one or more applications written in one or more programming languages such as C C J2ME Java etc. As such API s may be configured to in response to control signals being received from for instance platform enable one or more signals to be captured from an audio interface e.g. a microphone or an imaging interface e.g. a camera of mobile device . These signals may relate to acoustic s or image s of an environment surrounding mobile device . In other instances API s may determine spatial positioning backup or erase a memory not shown configure or reconfigure functions obtain usage logs terminate services etc. of or associated with mobile devices .

In exemplary embodiments mobile devices transmit via one or more of networks the one or more signals captured from an audio interface and or an imaging interface of mobile devices to platform . Other information or signals may also be transmitted by mobile devices to platform such as spatial positioning information device usage information images of memories of mobile devices etc. These signals and or information may be stored to any suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to the components and or facilities of system such as tracking content repository . In other instances the signals and or information may be presented to subscribers such as via one or more GUI s .

As seen in service provider network enables client devices and to access the features and functionality of platform via one or more of networks and . Networks may be any suitable wireline and or wireless network. For example telephony network may include a circuit switched network such as the public switched telephone network PSTN an integrated services digital network ISDN a private branch exchange PBX or other like network. Wireless network may employ various technologies including for example code division multiple access CDMA enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS mobile ad hoc network MANET global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like. Meanwhile data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN the Internet or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network such as a proprietary cable or fiber optic network.

Although depicted as separate entities networks may be completely or partially contained within one another or may embody one or more of the aforementioned infrastructures. For instance service provider network may embody circuit switched and or packet switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit switched and or packet based communications. It is further contemplated that networks may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner networks may embody or include portions of a signaling system SS7 network or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions. As such the conjunction of networks may be adapted to facilitate the remote control and tracking services of system .

According to exemplary embodiments client devices and may include any customer premise equipment CPE capable of sending and or receiving information over one or more of networks . For instance voice terminal may be any suitable plain old telephone service POTS device facsimile machine etc. whereas mobile terminal may be any cellular phone radiophone satellite phone smart phone wireless phone or any other suitable mobile device such as a personal digital assistant PDA pocket personal computer tablet customized hardware etc. Further computing device may be any suitable computing device such as a VoIP phone skinny client control protocol SCCP phone session initiation protocol SIP phone IP phone personal computer softphone workstation terminal server etc. Even though only a limited number of user devices and are illustrated it is contemplated that system can support a plurality of user devices and .

As previously mentioned system may also include user profiles repository for storing subscriber information such as billing information contact information demographic information location information mobile station configurations subscription parameters and the like. User profiles repository may also be utilized to store data relating to authorized users of the remote control and tracking services of system as well as associated authorization information corresponding to those users. Namely a user of mobile device may establish one or more sub profiles including usernames passwords codes PINS etc. to further distinguish various override scenarios. While user profiles repository is depicted as an extension of service provider network it is contemplated that user profiles repository can be integrated into collocated at or otherwise in communication with any of the components or facilities of system .

In this manner repositories and may be maintained by a service provider of the remote control and tracking services of system or may be maintained by any suitable third party. It is contemplated that the physical implementation of repositories and may take on many forms including for example portions of existing repositories of a service provider new repositories of a service provider third party repositories and or shared repositories. As such repositories and may be configured for communication over system through any suitable messaging protocol such as lightweight directory access protocol LDAP extensible markup language XML open database connectivity ODBC structured query language SQL and the like as well as combinations thereof. In those instances when repositories and are provided in distributed fashions information and content available via repositories and may be located utilizing any suitable querying technique such as electronic number matching distributed universal number discovery DUNDi uniform resource identifiers URI etc.

Thus a subscriber of or an individual authorized to use the remote control and tracking services of system may initialize a communication session at client devices and as well as at another mobile unit not shown to interact with remote application so as to remotely control configure monitor track etc. mobile device . Furthermore although the remote control and tracking services are described with respect to a mobile device it is recognized that the remote control and tracking services may be applied to any device capable of providing voice communications such as client devices and . In other instance mobile devices may be integrated with other devices individuals objects etc. and thereby enable subscribers to remotely control configure monitor and or track these other devices individuals objects etc. While system has been described in accordance with the depicted embodiment of it is contemplated that system may embody many forms and include multiple and or alternative components and facilities.

The acoustic transmission unit also includes a memory that can be used to store various types of information. According to at least one embodiment the memory can be in the form of read only memory ROM which allows data stored therein to be retained even when no power is supplied to the acoustic transmission unit . According to other embodiments the memory can be in the form of a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM which allow appropriate personnel to change the contents stored therein. Such a feature allows information to be updated when changes are made to the contents of the memory without having to replace the entire acoustic transmission unit . According to at least one embodiment the memory is used to store a database not shown which contains various specifications for different vehicles. For example the database can include a vehicle model make year of production and physical dimensions. At least one physical dimension can be the distance between the driver seat and the location of the on board diagnostics port. Since most vehicles include an ability to adjust the driver seat forward backward up down etc. the information stored in the database can account for such variations in dimension.

The acoustic transmission unit also includes a transmitter and a receiver . The transmitter and receiver are used to transmit or emit and receive or detect sound waves to and from mobile devices located within the vehicle. According to at least one embodiment the transmitter and receiver are configured to transmit and receive sound waves having a frequency above the audible range of normal human hearing i.e. about 20 KHz. Such frequencies are sometimes referred to as ultrasound frequencies. Alternatively the sound waves can be within the human audible spectrum. According to at least one embodiment the transmitter can be configured as a speaker capable of operating at the required frequencies and the receiver can be configured as a microphone capable of detecting the required frequencies.

A wireless transceiver is also provided to communicate with the mobile device as well as the service provider network . Thus the wireless transceiver is capable of providing information to either the mobile device and or the service provider network in real time. According to at least one embodiment the wireless transceiver is capable of communicating with the mobile device using the Bluetooth protocol. According to another embodiment the wireless transceiver communicates with the service provider network using any supported voice and or data communication protocol. Thus the wireless transceiver would communicate with the mobile device via the service provider network . Alternatively the wireless transceiver may incorporate functionality associated with both a Bluetooth communication protocol as well as the voice and or data communication protocol employed by the network. Such an embodiment would allow the wireless transceiver to communicate with the mobile device using the Bluetooth protocol while using a protocol such as LTE to exchange data with the service provider network .

A controller is provided to control and direct operation of all the components contained within the acoustic transmission unit namely the memory transmitter receiver interface and wireless transceiver . The controller for example determines the frequency at which the acoustic waves are transmitted and controls the sampling frequency with which they are received. According to at least one embodiment the controller retrieves information from the vehicle through the interface connected to the on board diagnostics port. This information is used to query the database stored in the memory in order to obtain specification information for the particular vehicle being driven. The controller also determines what information should be transmitted to either the mobile device the service provider network or both. As will be discussed in greater detail below this information can be used to determine whether or not the mobile device belongs to the driver of the vehicle and can be used to initiate the necessary protocols to prevent and or restrict use of the mobile device.

At step a link is established between the acoustic transmission unit and mobile devices located within the vehicle . As previously discussed the acoustic transmission unit can communicate with a mobile device in various ways including Bluetooth or the service provider network . Accordingly the acoustic transmission unit could for example utilize the wireless transceiver to establish a link to one or more of the mobile devices. Each mobile device within vehicle determines its distance from the acoustic transmission unit . This is done at step . Once the distance has been obtained the mobile device determines if its proximity is close enough to the driver to be considered the driver mobile device . This is done at step .

According to at least one embodiment the acoustic transmission unit can be configured to determine the position of the mobile device within the vehicle . This would be done at step . Based on the position of the mobile device the controller determines at step whether it is in close enough proximity to the driver to be considered the driver mobile device . If it is determined that the mobile device does not belong to the vehicle driver the acoustic transmission unit determines if other mobile devices are present in the vehicle . According to the example shown in the acoustic transmission unit would determine at step that two other mobile devices are present in the vehicle . If it is determined at step that other mobile devices are present then the acoustic transmission unit attempts to establish a link to each mobile device in order to determine its position within the vehicle . Thus the flow returns to step . As can be appreciated there will be circumstances where other mobile devices are not present in the vehicle . According to one or more embodiments the acoustic transmission unit can continually monitor for other mobile devices at predetermined intervals.

At step the vehicle s location data is collected. According to one embodiment the movement data is obtained from the driver mobile device itself. For example GPS data and accelerometer data can be used to determine whether or not the driver mobile device is moving as well as the velocity at which it is moving. According to other embodiments the movement data is collected from the vehicle through the on board diagnostics port . Under such conditions the driver mobile device is considered to be within the same frame of reference as the vehicle . Thus all movement performed by the vehicle is presumed to be also performed by the driver mobile device . The data obtained through the on board diagnostics port can include for example speed data engine speed data fuel delivery data etc. As can be appreciated the foregoing list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of information pertaining to the vehicle that can be collected through the on board diagnostics port .

At step the movement data is analyzed. Based on this analysis the mobile device determines whether or not the vehicle is currently moving. Optionally the controller could be configured to determine whether or not the vehicle is currently moving. According to at least one embodiment the data can be analyzed to determine the approximate speed at which the vehicle is moving. If the vehicle is not moving then the acoustic transmission unit simply continues to collect and analyze movement data until the status of the vehicle changes. For example if a user enters the vehicle and starts the ignition but remains in a parking lot the acoustic transmission unit would conclude that the vehicle is not moving. Accordingly the driver would have full access to functions on the driver mobile device . By continually collecting the movement data the acoustic transmission unit is capable of determining when the vehicle begins moving and takes appropriate action. This is illustrated at step wherein operation of the driver mobile device is restricted.

According to one embodiment the mobile device first issues a command to transmit a sound wave through its speaker at timestamp t. The sound wave is detected by a microphone of the mobile device at timestamp t. The same sound wave is also detected by the receiver of the acoustic transmission unit at timestamp t. When determining the distance of the mobile device from the acoustic transmission unit using the time of detecting the sound wave at timestamp tinstead of the transmit command time at timestamp tas a reference avoids delays associated with internal processing and management of concurrent running apps on the mobile device. Such delays between the time when such command is issued and the time when the audio signal actually goes in the physical media would induce error in determining the distance between the mobile device and the acoustic transmission unit because the delays can vary among different mobile devices and even for the same mobile device depending on operating conditions such as CPU load available memory etc.

A predetermined delay Tis allowed to pass after the acoustic transmission unit detects the sound wave at timestamp t. The acoustic transmission unit then transmits a second sound wave through its transmitter at timestamp t. The second sound wave is detected by the mobile device through its microphone at timestamp t. According to at least one embodiment tis defined as 

The mobile device then applies at least one formula to calculate the distance between the mobile device and the acoustic transmission unit . According to at least one embodiment the distance is calculated according to the following formula Distance 2 where is the nominal speed of sound in air.

According to other embodiments accuracy of the distance calculation can be improved by considering current environmental conditions. More particularly the mobile device can obtain real time data capable of affecting the speed of sound such as for example ambient temperature humidity altitude etc. This information can then be used to modify the distance equation and or select a value for C which compensates for ambient conditions.

According to alternative embodiments the distance calculations can be performed by the controller located in the acoustic transmission unit . The controller could for example initiate predetermined protocols resident on an application layer of the mobile device in order to request transmission of the initial sound wave and or receive the values for tand tfrom the mobile device. The controller can also cause to acoustic transmission unit to communicate with the service provider network and obtain regional ambient weather data for use in the distance calculation.

The calculated distance is then compared to the threshold radius d in order to determine if the mobile device is located on or in close proximity to the driver. This would suggest that the detected mobile is actually the driver mobile device . Since the internal space configurations as well as the precise location of the on board diagnostics port can vary between vehicles the threshold radius d is selected in accordance with specifications for the particular vehicle being driven. The acoustic transmission unit therefore retrieves vehicle information through the on board diagnostics port in order to determine the make and model of the vehicle . Reference data for example predetermined threshold radius d for the specific vehicle can then be retrieved for example from the database stored in the memory . According to various embodiments the database can also store threshold radius d values for different vehicles. Thus the controller can query the database in order to retrieve a value for the threshold radius d for the specific vehicle being used and or driven. Alternatively the database can store key dimensions and the threshold radius d can be calculated in real time based on the current position of the driver seat. According to other embodiments the database can also be stored on the mobile device or management platform of the service provider. Under such circumstances the mobile device can optionally query the database and retrieve a value for the threshold radius d.

The acoustic transmission unit can subsequently restrict and or limit use of the driver mobile device if it is located within the threshold radius d and the vehicle is in motion. According to an embodiment sensor information can be used to provide assistance in determining the location of the mobile device. For example most vehicles are equipped with one or more sensors which detect the presence or absence of a front seat passenger. Information from such sensors can be used to improve the accuracy of identifying a mobile device as a driver mobile device . Specifically if a mobile device is placed on the front passenger seat acoustic measurement of its location would suggest that it does not belong to the driver. By combining this location information with sensor data indicating the absence of a passenger for example it can be concluded that the driver mobile device has been placed on the front passenger seat. Appropriate action could therefore be taken to restrict and or limit use of the driver mobile device . It should be noted however that it is impractical for a driver to operate a mobile device while it is located on the front passenger seat. Rather the driver is more likely to retrieve the mobile device and bring it within reasonable proximity. According to at least one embodiment the acoustic transmission unit continually monitors the location of the driver mobile device at predetermined intervals. Accordingly the driver mobile device would be subject to the aforementioned restrictions upon entering the space defined by the threshold radius d.

According to at least one embodiment the software for restricting operation of the driver mobile device can be configured in an energy efficient middleware platform that is embedded within the operating system of the mobile device. Upon receiving a signal to restrict access to the driver mobile device the middleware platform switches to a driving mode wherein limited or no access is available to the driver. For example the driver may be prevented from accessing applications pertaining to phone GPS music email etc. According to one embodiment the driver may only be allowed to access emergency phone functions.

According to one or more embodiments a configuration interface can be provided at an account management level to select specific functions that will be available while driving the vehicle . For example a user can use the configuration interface to allow access only to GPS navigation functions and emergency dialing. Parents can use the configuration interface to completely disable use of the driver mobile device by young adult children that may have driving access to the vehicle . Thus the vehicle would have to come to a complete stop in order to access any functions including emergency dialing. Alternatively the driver mobile device can be limited to emergency dialing. As can be appreciated such combinations of available functions are only intended to be illustrative and not all encompassing. Rather the configuration interface can provide an extended list of functions that a user can selectively enable or disable while driving.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for controlling cursor movement on the display .

According to an exemplary embodiment the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multiprocessing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement exemplary embodiments. Thus exemplary embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an exemplary embodiment through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic optical or electromagnetic waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM CDRW DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape optical mark sheets any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the exemplary embodiments may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

In one embodiment the chip set includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to controlling a set top box based on device events. The memory also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.

To the extent the aforementioned embodiments collect store or employ personal information provided by individuals it should be understood that such information shall be used in accordance with all applicable laws concerning protection of personal information. Additionally the collection storage and use of such information may be subject to consent of the individual to such activity for example through well known opt in or opt out processes as may be appropriate for the situation and type of information. Storage and use of personal information may be in an appropriately secure manner reflective of the type of information for example through various encryption and anonymization techniques for particularly sensitive information.
