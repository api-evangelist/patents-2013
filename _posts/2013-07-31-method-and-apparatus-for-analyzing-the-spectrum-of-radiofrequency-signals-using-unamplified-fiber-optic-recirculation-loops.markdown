Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to radio frequency receiving system and more particularly to a method and apparatus for analyzing the spectrum of radio frequency signals using unamplified fiber optic recirculation loops.

Typically public radio frequency RF communications are transmitted at a preconfigured frequency so that a receiver can tune to the particular frequency and receive the communications. In contrast private communications and military RF systems are transmitted across multiple frequencies e.g. using frequency hopping and or spread spectrum techniques in a short time window. In some instances these private communications need to be captured by unintended receivers e.g. law enforcement agencies military organizations and the like. However difficulties arise when a communication is transmitted across various frequencies i.e. frequency hopping is employed in the form of short RF pulses where each broadcast is on a different frequency.

Without knowing the frequency hopping pattern a receiver must attempt to capture all signals in the relevant band. Typically all the signals within the band are digitized and then processed using a very high speed digital signal processing DSP system. Such high speed DSP systems are very costly to manufacture operate and maintain. In some instances the band of interest is divided into sub bands and each sub band is digitized and processed in a corresponding DSP. Such sub band channelization enables many signals to be quickly processed in parallel using less expensive DSP circuits i.e. lower speed circuits . However even a channelized broad band receiver is very expensive to manufacture operate and maintain.

Recently optical systems have found use in broad band signal processing wherein the received RF signals are used to modulate a light signal and the light signal is processed in an optical signal processing section of the receiver. Such techniques unfortunately are prone to resonant noise and system instability due to the use of amplifiers within the optical signal processing section.

Therefore there is a need in the art for an improved method and apparatus for analyzing the spectrum of radio frequency signals using a fiber optic recirculation loop.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and an apparatus for generating a frequency spectrum of an RF signal comprising a gate switch for generating a series of pulses from a laser of wavelength lambda modulated by an input RF signal a first fiber optical loop for circulating a first percentage of a first pulse of the series of pulses from the gate switch for a predetermined number of cycles n where each cycle takes time t a second fiber optical buffer delay loop for conducting a second percentage of the first pulse for a predetermined number of cycles k where each cycle takes time t where t k t n a first switch with a first state for coupling the first pulse from the gate switch to a coupler the coupler coupling the first pulse into the first fiber optical loop and tapping replicas of the pulse from the first fiber optical loop and a second state for coupling the second percentage of the first pulse to the coupler to increase intensity of the tapped replica pulses a processor for correlating the replicas of the pulse with each other to produce a set of data points comprising a plurality of multiplexed correlated pulses and transforming the data points into a channelized frequency spectrum of the input RF signal.

Embodiments of the present invention further relate to a method and an apparatus for generating a frequency spectrum of an RF signal comprising a gate switch for generating a series of pulses from a laser of wavelength lambda modulated by an input RF signal fiber optical loop for circulating a first pulse of the series of pulses from the gate switch for a predetermined number of cycles n where each cycle takes time t a first switch coupled to the gate switch in a first state for coupling the first pulse from the gate switch to a coupler the coupler coupling a first percentage of the first pulse into the fiber optical loop and tapping a second percentage of the first pulse out of the first fiber optical loop as a replica pulse and a second state for coupling the fiber optical loop to the coupler and a processor for correlating a predetermined amount of replicas of the pulse with each other to produce a set of data points comprising a plurality of multiplexed correlated pulses and transforming the data points into a channelized frequency spectrum of the input RF signal.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise an apparatus for generating a large number of re circulated replica signal pulses in the time domain from a single input optical pulse that carry a RF signal with two side bands while avoiding noise by use of an unamplified extreme low loss fiber optic recirculation loop circuit. In some embodiments fiber optic recirculation loop circuit comprises two fiber optical loops where one fiber optical loop recycles and introduces a buffer delay in the original input pulse to augment the intensity of the pulse signal in the other fiber optical loop. Each replica pulse carries two copies of the RF signal the copies having a relative time delay due to the chromatic dispersion of the fiber optical loop. The replica signal pulses are then coupled to a photodetector to obtain the RF signal that is expanded in time as a series of delayed pulses that may be later correlated. A processor is configured to perform a Fast Fourier Transform FFT using a transform module on the correlated pulses generating a channelized frequency spectrum.

When searching for unknown RF signals at ten of hundreds of gigahertz thousands or possibly millions of transmitter signal may be received by a wide bandwidth receiver making it difficult to determine which signal may be a signal of interest. In such a situation higher frequency resolution is desired in order to search the carrier frequency of the signal of interest and then perform intermediate frequency IF down converting. Accordingly a low loss fiber optic recirculation circuit can be used to perform such an analysis using a significant amount of generated pulses as described in . However to minimize processing time it is desirable to perform a two step searching process by performing an initial low resolution quick search by using a single fiber optical loop circuit as shown in that provides only a small amount of generated pulses for analysis. Once a signal of interest is found the high resolution processor shown in is used to narrow down the frequency channel as described below.

According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the apparatus processes an RF input signal and produces frequency spectrum representing information carried by the RF input signal . The input signal is an RF signal and the laser is a carrier wave light signal.

The RF input signal may be received via a conventional RF front end not shown comprising for example an antenna low noise amplifier and various filters. The choice of components and arrangement depends upon the nature of the signals that are to be processed. The selection of components and their arrangement is a design choice capable of being made by anyone with skill in the RF communication arts.

The laser provides laser light of wavelength lambda . The optical modulator modulates light from the laser with the RF input signal creating an RF modulated light wave with two sidebands around the laser carrier in the frequency domain. According to an exemplary embodiment the laser is a continuous wave laser CWL . In other embodiments two lasers with varying wavelengths are generated and modulated by the modulator . Also according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the optical modulator is a Mach Zehnder modulator though those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any equivalent modular may be used. The gate switch e.g. an optical gate switch converts the modulated light into an RF modulated optical pulse. After an initial output pulse of the modulated light wave leaves the gate switch the gate switch closes so that for a predetermined length of time further pulses cannot enter the loop to cause distortion and noise. Thereafter the control circuit controls opening and closing of the gate switch so as to create a series of pulses which enter the loop in a periodic fashion.

According to an exemplary embodiment the optical gate switch is a fast and high extinction ratio optical gate switch and generates short pulse from the modulated laser light at an output port G. According to some embodiments the optical power of the pulse generated at port G has a range of 10 mW to 100 mW. The 1 2 switch couples the output pulse from output port G to input port C of the 2 2 coupler . The gate switch also has an output port G which may be used to analyze the RF signal by another circuit not shown unrelated to the apparatus . The coupler is used to couple the output pulse into and out of the fiber recirculation loop . According to an exemplary embodiment the length of loop is approximately 1.3 Km if regular telecom fiber is used and the total RF bandwidth is about 50 GHz.

Initially the 1 2 switch is set to a first state by the control circuit when the gate switch generates the pulse where the input A is coupled to the output of the switch . The 1 2 switch has a second state where the input A is coupled to the output of switch . After the input signal pulse passes though switch the switch will be switched to the second state and remains in that the second state for one full cycle of operation. Accordingly when 1 2 switch is set to the first state the initial pulse is coupled by switch into port C of coupler . The coupler is a weak 2 2 optical coupler by way of non limiting example the coupler has a 5 95 ratio. For example 5 of the signal is coupled into the loop from output port C while 95 of the signal is coupled from output port C to the 1 2 switch .

According to exemplary embodiments the coupler comprises two adjacent wave guides not shown for example a waveguide from input port C to output port C and a waveguide from input port C to output port C. If a pulse is coupled with either one of the input ports 95 of the pulse signal remains in the intended waveguide while 5 is coupled off to the adjacent waveguide.

The first pulse enters the coupler at input port C. A first percentage for example 5 of the power of the first pulse re circulates in the loop through output port C a predetermined number of times n while a second percentage for example 95 of the pulse is output at port C. According to some embodiments the pulse circulates in the loop fifty times i.e. n 50. According to other embodiments n 35. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that n is a variable parameter based on the length L of the loop to accommodate for various frequency bandwidths. After the initial pulse each time the pulse circulates the loop once and arrives at port C of the coupler the pulse signal is split once again so that a second percentage for example 95 of the signal goes back into the loop i.e. the waveguide from port C to C carries the majority of the pulse signal and a first percentage for example 5 exits the loop at port C. After the initial pulse circulates the loop once the control circuit sets the switch to a second state where the switch outputs only at port B so the 1 2 switch taps out a replica pulse or alternatively a pulse pair with sidebands where two initial lasers are used instead of laser . If a pulse takes time VI to travel once fully through loop where the loop length of loop is L a series of n pulse replicas will be generated at port C each pulse separated by a time t from the subsequent pulse.

According to an exemplary embodiment the loop has a loss of approximately 0.17 db per kilometer and the length of loop is about 1.3 km. Further according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention the loop length generally does not affect the ability to tap out replica pulse pairs however loops with length less than one pulse width will cause overlap and distort results. The loop may be a dispersion shifted fiber where there is non dispersion around the operating wavelength of the light generated by laser .

Initially the 1 2 switch is in a first state where the input of switch is coupled to output port B of switch so that the input from port C is coupled directly to the output B. After the initial pulse is output at output B of switch the control circuit sets switch to a second state where the input of switch is coupled to the output port B of switch .

The initial pulse of the series of pulses is coupled from output port B of switch to an input port D of the 2 2 switch . When the initial pulse is coupled to switch the control circuit controls the switch so that the initial pulse at input port D is coupled so as to recirculate in the loop through output port D. After the initial pulse enters the loop the control circuit sets the switch to the D D setting where the input port D will couple the pulse to the output port D causing the pulse to travel into the loop for a predetermined number of times k . According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention the loop is significantly larger than loop . In some embodiments the loop is ten times the length of loop . The pulse travels through loop to complete a single cycle in a predetermined duration of time t. Accordingly time k t is the duration of time the pulse remains in loop as well as the duration of time taken by the initial pulse to travel through loop for n cycles.

After the pulse travels the loop for n cycles in time k t the control circuit controls port D of the 2 2 switch to be coupled to port A of switch in order to allow the pulse to reenter the loop via the coupler . By way of a non limiting example if n 35 five percent of the initial pulse will travel through the loop thirty five times cycles while 95 of the initial pulse travels through loop k times. However due to loss in the loop as well as the successive tapping out of a portion of the pulse signal the pulse signal will lose energy during each cycle. When the subsequent pulse exits the switch and enters the loop 95 of the initial pulse from loop is coupled with the subsequent pulse via switch and input C the signal intensity is increased and so on for the next 35 pulses.

Optionally this embodiment can be simplified by making k 1 and removing the 2 2 switch . Therefore the total length of the fiber loop is n times the length of the first loop . According to another embodiment an optional optical amplifier may be added in the buffer delay loop to compensate for fiber loss so that the recycled subsequent first pulse sent to C has the same amplitude of the original first input pulse. According to yet another embodiment an optional switch and an optical filter may be added after the optional amplifier as a time domain and frequency domain noise filter to filter out the noise generated from the amplifier .

After the initial pulse enters switch and outputs at port B the control circuit switches the output of switch to output port B. This allows 5 of the pulse signal in the loop to be tapped out of the loop to generate a replica pulse at output port B. The series of n pulses are then coupled from the output port B of switch to the optical amplifier . According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the amplifier is an Erbium doped fiber amplifier EDFA though the present invention is not limited the type of amplifier used. By placing the amplifier outside of the loop resonant noise in the loop is reduced significantly increasing the signal to noise ratio.

According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention all fiber connections to couplers and switches in the circuit shown in are spliced connections. According to some embodiments the values n and k may be increased to reduce the total amount of instances when the pulse passes through switch switch and switch to avoid signal loss. According to some instances the switch may be removed entirely and the loop is composed instead of a long fiber that is n L in length.

The process of recirculating a pulse in the loop n times may be repeated until a desired number of replica pulses are obtained. The amplifier couples the set of replica pulses to a photodetector to obtain the original RF signal expanded in time as a series of pulses delayed by time t.

The output RF electronic pulse signals from the photodetector is coupled to a data acquisition and processing computer . The detail processing and mathematics is described in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 13 371 556 filed on Feb. 13 2012 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The RF modulated optical pulse has two side bands around the frequency carrier and therefore contains two copies of the RF modulated pulse. When the pulse enters the fiber optical loop and performs one loop cycle with travel time t the two RF side band pulses will travel at a slight relative time delay t between each other due to the chromatic dispersion of the loop . According to embodiments of the present invention N replica pulse pairs are generated by this process. The relative time delay generated between each pulse pairs are accordingly t 2 t 3 t . . . N t. These pulse replica pairs provide the data points for time domain autocorrelation performed by the RF analog signal processor .

The computer performs an analog to digital conversion on the auto correlates the replica pulses signal produced by the processor and generates a set of data points which are then stored in memory .

The computer also performs data normalization for calibrating on a set of calibration signal with a known RF frequency to produce a weight function for the periodic amplitude changes due to the recirculation loop circuit without RF. In the digital domain the computer may further normalize the data set from the real signal using that weight function and then uses the transform module to apply a Fourier Transform to transform the normalized auto correlated data from the time domain to the frequency domain thereby obtaining the RF spectrum of the input RF pulse . In an exemplary embodiment the memory may include one or more of the following random access memory read only memory magneto resistive read write memory optical read write memory cache memory magnetic read write memory and the like as well as signal bearing media not including non transitory signals such as carrier waves and the like.

The Fast Fourier Transformed data points generate a channelized frequency spectrum which is obtained using signal processing techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the apparatus processes the RF input signal and produces frequency spectrum representing information carried by the input signal . The input signal is an RF signal and the laser is a carrier wave light signal.

The laser provide laser light of wavelength . The optical modulator modulates light from the laser with the RF input signal creating an RF modulated light wave with two sidebands around the laser carrier in the frequency domain. According to an exemplary embodiment the laser generates a continuous wave laser. Also according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the optical modulator is a Mach Zehnder modulator. According to yet another embodiment two lasers with differing wavelengths may be used in place of laser . The gate switch e.g. an optical gate switch converts the modulated light into a pair of RF modulated optical pulse. Once a pulse enters the gate switch the control circuit causes the gate switch to close so further pulses cannot enter the loop to cause distortion and noise.

The optical pulse generated by the gate switch is coupled to the input port A of the 2 1 switch . According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention the switch is a low loss high speed fiber switch. Initially the switch is set to a first state where the input from port A is coupled to the output port of switch thereby coupling the output of switch to the input of a 1 2 coupler . According to an exemplary embodiment the coupler is a weak 1 2 optical splitter with a large splitting ratio for example 1 to 99 though other weak ratio couplers may also be substituted. Accordingly if a 1 99 coupler is used 99 of the initial pulse is output at port C of coupler into the loop where the loop has a length L. Once the initial optical pulse enters loop the control circuit sets the switch to a second state where input port A of switch is coupled to the output port of switch to close the loop allowing the pulse to travel through the loop for a duration of time.

Each time the initial optical pulse cycles through the loop the coupler outputs a small portion for example 1 of the optical pulse signal to generate a replica pulse thereby generating a series pulse train at C. The pulse train is coupled to the input of an amplifier to amplify the signal. The amplified signal is coupled to a photo detector to obtain an original RF signal expanded in time as a series of delayed pulses.

The output RF electronic pulse signals from the photodetector is coupled to the RF signal processor and produces the auto correlation data that is collected by the computer . The detail processing and mathematics is described in commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 13 371 556 filed on Feb. 13 2012 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The RF modulated optical pulse has two side bands around the frequency carrier and therefore contains two copies of the RF modulated pulse. When the pulse enters the fiber optical loop and performs one loop cycle with travel time t the two RF side band pulses will travel at a slight relative time delay t between each other due to the chromatic dispersion of the loop . According to embodiments of the present invention N replica pulse pairs are generated by this process. The relative time delay generated between each pulse pairs are accordingly t 2 t 3 t . . . N t. These pulse replica pairs provide the data points for time domain autocorrelation performed by the RF signal processor .

The computer performs an analog to digital conversion on auto correlation signal from processor and generates a set of data points which are then stored in memory .

The computer also performs data normalization for calibrating on a set of calibration signal with a known RF frequency to produce a weight function for the periodic amplitude changes due to the recirculation loop circuit without RF. In the digital domain the computer may further normalize the data set from the real signal using that weight function and then use the transform module to apply a Fourier Transform to transform the normalized auto correlated data from the time domain to the frequency domain thereby obtaining the RF spectrum of the input RF pulse . In an exemplary embodiment the memory may include one or more of the following random access memory read only memory magneto resistive read write memory optical read write memory cache memory magnetic read write memory and the like as well as signal bearing media not including non transitory signals such as carrier waves and the like.

According to the embodiments shown in the relative intensity difference between successive pulse replicas is predetermined by the loop circuits loss including the loss due to signal splitting and tapping out. To obtain normalized pulse replica data sets the loss or intensity fluctuation may be experimentally measured by recording the pulse intensity with an un modulated laser input pulse or a laser input pulse modulated by a single known RF frequency to perform the normalization in the digital domain.

According to an exemplary embodiment apparatus can be used in conjunction with apparatus . In order to perform a quick search of a spectrum with low resolution apparatus is used. Subsequently the apparatus is used for higher resolution frequency spectrum that performs a zoom in function to resolve the signal of interest.

At step the method determines whether the pulse has travelled n cycles in the first fiber optical loop and if not the method returns to step . If n cycles have been completed the method proceeds to step . At step a switch is modified to a second state where a second percentage of the pulse is coupled from the second fiber optical loop back into the first fiber optical loop to augment the intensity of the signal.

At step the tapped out replica pulses are autocorrelated to generate a set of data points. At step the method determines whether a predetermined number of data points have been stored. If a predetermined number X of data points have not been stored the method proceeds to step where more replica pulses are tapped out of the first fiber optical loop. If a predetermined number of data points have been stored the method proceeds to step .

At step the computer performs a data normalization and FFT on the X points to generate a frequency spectrum at step . At step the method terminates when all pulses have been stored and a frequency spectrum has been generated for the input RF signal.
