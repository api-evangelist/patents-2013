This application claims the benefit as a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 185 446 filed Jul. 18 2011 the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein under 35 U.S.C. 120. The applicants hereby rescind any disclaimer of claim scope in the parent application or the prosecution history thereof and advise the USPTO that the claims in this application may be broader than any claim in the parent application.

The present invention relates to printing a document from a mobile device and more specifically to identifying a printing device based on encoded data displayed by the printing device queuing a printing job for the printing device at a network service and allowing the printing device to retrieve the printing job from the network service.

The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore unless otherwise indicated it should not be assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.

Conventionally printing a document from a mobile device may require identifying the printing devices that are available in a user s network establishing connectivity with the available printing device and sending a printing job to the printing device for processing. Identifying a printing device available in the user s network is referred to as a printer discovery process. A printer s discovery is often limited to discovering only those printing devices that are in the user s local network. Therefore the user can only print on the printing devices located in the user s local network but not on the printing devices located remotely.

Furthermore performing printer discovery determining a printing driver suitable for the printing device physically locating the printing device entering a job release code to the printing device and initiating a printing job on the printing device can be tedious and time consuming because many MFPs have simple user interfaces with limited functionality.

Moreover a user may be unfamiliar with an interface that is specific to a particular printing device. Therefore the process of selecting the printer s features and options by navigating the unfamiliar printer s interface can be difficult and disappointing.

Techniques are provided for utilizing encoded data of a printing device to identify an available printer queue a printing job for the printing device at a network service that acts as a repository and allow the printing device to retrieve the printing job from the network service. A printing device displays the encoded data and a mobile device scans or photographs the encoded data from the printing device. The mobile device uses the encoded data to identify the printing device and to queue a printing job at the network service for the printing device to retrieve it and process. Encoded data represent various types of information comprising a features and options that are currently supported by the printing device b a printer identifier of the printing device and c network service interface data for a network service.

A network service acts as a data repository it receives and stores print settings selection data and electronic document identification data from a mobile device and allows a printing device to retrieve the print settings selection data and the electronic document identification data from the network service. In response to the retrieving the printing device processes the print setting selection data and the electronic document identification data and produces a printed copy of an electronic document.

In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

An approach is provided for utilizing encoded data of a printing device to identify the printing device and to facilitate an electronic document printing from a mobile device by queuing a printing job at a network service and allowing the printing device to retrieve the printing job from a queue maintained by the network service.

The communications links between cloud and each of printing device mobile device and other network services may be implemented by any medium or mechanism that provides for the exchange of data between the elements of . Examples of such links include without limitation a network such as a Local Area Network LAN Wide Area Network WAN Ethernet or the Internet or one or more terrestrial satellite or wireless links.

Printing device is a network device that is configured to communicate with a network service in cloud and process various document data. Although the description herein refers to printing device and processing printing jobs printing device may be a multi functional peripheral MFP and be configured to perform not only printing but also scanning faxing and other types of document processing.

For example MFP may be configured to scan one or more printed documents and generate scanned document data that represent one or more electronic document data. The scanned document data may be in a variety of formats depending upon a particular implementation. One example format is the portable document format PDF by Adobe Systems Inc. MFP may also be configured to convert scanned document data from a non text format such as PDF to a text based format using various data conversion techniques such as optical character recognition OCR method. MFP can further be configured to transmit the scanned document data to another location such as storage of network service over a communications link established between MFP and cloud .

In an embodiment printing device implements the capability to process electronic document data stored in storage . Printing device can also be configured to download the electronic document data from storage of network service to storage .

In printing device includes an operation panel a scan process a print process encoded data generator job retriever and storage . The operation panel is configured to display information to a user and to accept user input.

Implementations of operation panel may vary depending upon architecture of printing device . In an embodiment operation panel may include a screen having a touch screen portion on which a graphical user interface GUI is displayed. The touch screen can allow a user to select icons and GUI objects on the GUI. The GUI may be updated to reflect changes in the functionalities offered by the printing device . The operation panel may also include control buttons and a numeric keypad for receiving user input. Example of operation panel is described in more detail below with reference to .

Scan process is configured to cause one or more printed documents to be scanned by printing device and to generate scanned document data that represent the one or more printed documents. Scan process may be initiated for example in response to a user s selection of a scan start control button not depicted in .

Print process is configured to cause one or more documents to be printed by printing device based on corresponding electronic document data. Print process may be initiated for example in response to a user s selection of a print start control button not depicted in or in response to a printing device completing a download of the electronic document data and user s selections of the features and options associated with the electronic document from network service .

In an embodiment to enable printing a particular printing job print process retrieves information specific to a printing job. Such information can include print setting selection data and electronic document identification data. The print setting selection data provides description of the features and options for the features that printing device should apply while performing the printing job. The electronic document identification data comprises information identifying an electronic document to be printed by printing device . For example the electronic document identification data may comprise the electronic document name a web link to the electronic document data a pointer to the electronic document data or any other information that allows printing device to retrieve and download the electronic document data to storage .

Print process is configured to download electronic document data to storage and in particular to the part of storage labeled on as other data . The electronic document data can be downloaded to storage from storage from storage associated with external network services or any other storage available to printing device .

Encoded data generator is configured to generate and display encoded data specific to printing device . Encoded data are used to allow other devices such as mobile device to identify printing device to determine the capabilities of printing device and to indicate a job queue for queuing printing jobs for printing device .

In an embodiment encoded data can be generated using a variety of data encoding techniques. For example the encoded data can be encoded using a quick response QR code technique.

Quick response QR code is a two dimensional code for representing data in a graphical form. The data are encoded to strings containing ones and zeros and the strings are represented graphically as rows and columns containing black and white pixels. For example a QR code may utilize a two dimensional array of pixels wherein each pixel can have associated one of two Boolean values. For instance if according to the coding a particular pixel has associated the Boolean value of 1 then the pixel is filled with a black rectangle or square. However if according to the coding a particular pixel has associated the Boolean value of 0 then the pixel is filled with a white rectangle or square. Using the coding the rows and columns of the two dimensional array are filled with black and white rectangles and groups of the pixels are interpreted as the encoded data. Other combinations of associations between the Boolean values and colors of the rectangles are also contemplated.

In other embodiment encoded data can be a bar code in which data are encoded to a string containing ones and zeros and the strings are represented graphically as a row of black and white bars. The encoded data can also be represented by one or more symbols one or more alphanumeric characters or any other form of coding.

In an embodiment encoded data generator is configured to generate encoded data to represent specific information and to display the encoded data to make the encoded data available to other devices. In an embodiment encoded data represent a features and options that are currently supported by printing device b a printer identifier for printing device and c network service interface data for a network service.

Encoded data generator encodes the features and options that are currently supported by printing device and displays the encoded data to allow other devices to determine the capabilities of printing device . Examples of the features and options currently supported by printing device can include duplex option finisher features the types of paper format that are available on printing device the types of formatting that are available on printing device color or black white printing collate or not collate etc.

Encoded data generator encodes the printer s identifier and displays the encoded data to allow other devices to determine the identifier of the printer and to use the identifier when sending printing jobs to a job repository. Examples of a printer s identifier can include a device identifier ID a device model identifier Model a device serial number etc.

Encoded data generator encodes the network service interface data for a network service and displays the encoded data to allow other devices to determine the network service interface of the network service from which printing device can download printing jobs. Examples of network service interface data can comprise a uniform resource identifier URI of network service an email address of network service etc.

Other types of data specific to network service can also be included in the encoded data. For example the encoded data can comprise an application programming interface API key for validating a client access to cloud and network service when cloud and network service require client s authorization. For example network service can be a secure process that grants access only if the clients are successfully authorized to an authorization server not depicted in . The authorization server can be communicatively coupled to cloud . The API key can be used by mobile device and printing device before each of the respective devices gains access to network service .

Encoded data generator can repeat the encoding and regenerating encoded data for a variety of reasons. For example encoded data generator can regenerate the encoded data when a location of the network service is changed and the old method included in the old encoded data for establishing a communications link with the network service is obsolete. In such a situation encoded data generator can be provided with the updated network service information data and regenerate the encoded data to reflect the updated method for establishing a communications link with the new network service.

According to another example encoded data generator can repeat the encoding and regenerating encoded data when printing device has been upgraded and the features and options of the upgraded printing device have changed. For example printing device can be upgraded to provide additional features that were not available when the old encoded data were generated. In such a situation encoded data generator can be provided with the updated information about the features and options currently supported by the updated printing device and regenerate the encoded data to represent the updated features and options currently supported by the updated printing device.

According to other example encoded data generator can repeat the encoding and regenerating encoded data when printing device is relocated to another network another physical location or altered in any way that requires a change in a printing device identifier. In such a situation a new printing device identifier is generated provided to encoded data generator and used to regenerate the encoded data to represent the new printing device identifier.

In an embodiment encoded data comprise information about all the features and options that are currently supported by printing device . Therefore by acquiring the encoded data and decoding the encoded data other devices such as mobile device can determine the capabilities of printing device and can generate a graphical user interface GUI that is specific to printing device .

In an embodiment encoded data comprise a printing device identifier. The printing device identifier can be any alphanumeric code containing letters numbers and or special characters. The printing device identifier can have a fixed or variable length. The printing device identifier uniquely identifies printing device in system . Therefore no two printing devices in system can have the same printing device identifier.

Printing device identifier is used by mobile device to identify printing device and to communicate the printing device identifier to network service when mobile device has a printing job to be performed by printing device . Once mobile device identifies printing device mobile device can deposit one or more printing jobs in a repository such as network service for printing device to retrieve it and to perform.

In an embodiment encoded data comprises network interface data that mobile device can use to establish a communications link with cloud and to communicate with network service . For example the network interface data can provide information that specifies a uniform resource identifier URI of a network device on which cloud is implemented and methods for mobile device to communicate with network service . According to another example the network interface data can provide an email address of a network device on which cloud and network services are implemented and the email protocol identifier that mobile device can use to identify email protocol for communicating with network services .

In an embodiment printing device displays encoded data on operation panel for other devices to read scan or retrieve and process. For example the encoded data may be displayed on operation panel as an electronically generated light emitting diode LED display or as a sticker affixed to the operation panel a wireless signal emitted by printing device or displayed using any other method facilitating providing the encoded data to other devices.

The encoded data can be acquired by other devices such as mobile device using a variety of techniques. For example the encoded data displayed by printing device can be scanned by a scanner of mobile device and interpreted by mobile device using the same encoding schema that encoded data generator used to generate the encoded data. According to another example the encoded data can be photographed by a camera of mobile device and interpreted by mobile device . According to other example the encoded data emitted by an infra red emitter of printing device can be captured by an infra red sensor of mobile device . According to other example the encoded data transmitted using a wireless signal transmitter of printing device can be received by a wireless signal receiver of printing device . Other methods of acquiring the encoded data of printing device by mobile device are also contemplated.

Job retriever is configured to establish a communications link with network service inquire whether any printing job has been queued at storage of network service for printing device and if so retrieving the printing job from storage and storing the printing job in storage of printing device . To inquire about a printing job queued at storage job retriever can provide to network service a printer s identifier. The printer s identifier can be used to identify a job queue stored at a repository of network service .

In an embodiment job retriever establishes a communications link with network service by using a web browser application described in detail below.

Storage may be any combination of volatile or non volatile storage for storing data used by printing device . For example storage may be random access memory RAM one or more disks or any combination of RAM and one or more disks for storing scanned document data. As depicted in storage may store scan data and other data . Other data may include electronic document data or other types of data such as word processing document files.

Printing device may include other modules and processes that are not depicted in for purposes of brevity.

Operation panel may be arranged in many different ways and the arrangements depend on the implementation of printing device . For example as depicted in operation panel may have job settings buttons such as an automatic default setting control full color setting control black and while setting control text photo setting control density setting control and others paper selection buttons function selection buttons additional function buttons graphical user interface and encoded data display .

The functions implemented on any particular printing device may vary depending upon the implementation of printing device . For example if a particular printing device is a multi functional peripheral MFP then the functions of printing device can include not only printing but also copying connecting to a document server faxing and other functions.

In an embodiment operation panel can also include a numeric keypad and a set of user controls for toggling the power starting a function and clearing the current function not shown in . These are examples of the user controls that are typically included on a MFP. More or fewer user controls may be provided depending upon a particular implementation of printing device .

Operation panel can also include a graphical user interface GUI for displaying information and receiving user input. GUI may be a touch screen that is capable of detecting user selection of icons and GUI objects displayed on GUI . GUI may be stored on printing device and loaded directly from local storage of printing device .

In an embodiment GUI is generated based on the features and options for the features that are specific to printing device .

Encoded data display can represent encoded data that identify printing device features and options specific to printing device and network interface data for establishing a communications link with network service . The encoded data display is used to communicate the encoded data to other devices such as mobile device . For example encoded data display displaying the encoded data can be scanned by a scanner of mobile device . Scanning of the encoded data displayed in encoded data display allows mobile device to acquire information identifying printing device information identifying the features and options of printing device and information identifying methods for establishing a communications link with network service to retrieve one or more printing jobs for printing device .

Encoded data may be encoded using a variety of formats. For example the encoded data may be encoded as a quick reference QR code a two dimensional array of black and white pixels that uniquely represent a piece of information. The encoded data can also be encoded as a bar code one or more symbols one or more alphanumeric characters or any other encoding techniques known in the art.

Encoded data display can be an electronic LED display projecting an electronic display of the encoded data a sticker affixed to operation panel containing printed encoded data a display generated by an infra red signal emitter a signal generated by a wireless signal emitter generating the encoded data or any other form of display configured to communicate the encoded data to other devices.

Referring again to in an embodiment a network service is a part of a separate network referred herein as a cloud . Alternatively network service may be implemented on a standalone computer that is communicatively coupled with printing device and mobile device .

A cloud is a computing system communicatively coupled to printing device and mobile device and configured to provide processing power storage processing and other computing services to printing device and mobile device often via a web browser.

In an embodiment from the perspective of printing device and mobile device cloud can be viewed as a collection of services and a data repository. At the hardware level although transparent to printing device and mobile device cloud comprises one or more network devices that host a plurality of services.

The services offered by cloud are accessible to printing device and mobile device via the Internet using any of the data communications protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol TCP the Internet Protocol IP and other protocols. Each of the services in cloud may be associated with a different communications protocol a different IP address and or port number.

Cloud may be maintained by a single individual user or an organization such as a company an association a university or other entity. An example of a cloud is the VACS Value Added Cloud Solution provided by Ricoh Company Ltd.

Multiple organizations can share responsibility for maintaining a particular cloud. A network service outside of cloud such as any of external network services in can be provided by one or more individual users or organizations that are different than any individual user or organization that maintains could . Thus other network services are considered third party services relative to the services in cloud .

In cloud includes a network service that is configured to maintain job queues for printing devices including a job queue for printing device . Network service can also be configured to receive one or more printing jobs from mobile device placing the received printing jobs in respective job queues and allowing printing devices such as printing device to access the respective printing job queue to retrieve the stored printing jobs.

Non limiting examples of network service can include Box.net Google Docs Salesforce.com Evernote and Jigsaw .

Cloud may also include an OCR service not shown for converting scanned document data in non text format for example PDF into text based format. Cloud may also include a forwarding service not shown for transmitting scanned document data in text format to one or more recipients. The OCR service and the forwarding service may be implemented as part of network service . Alternatively the OCR service and the forwarding service may be implemented separately from network service . For example the OCR service and the forwarding service can be implemented as one of other network services .

In an embodiment cloud also comprises storage that may store different types of data for example electronic document data and user selection data . Electronic document data stores electronic document data that comprise document data such as text data. Electronic document data can also store pointers to documents document data links and other document data identification information that can be used to identify and download the document data. For example mobile device can store a web link to a document that a user of the mobile device would like to print on printing device . Network service can retrieve the web link from electronic document data use the web link to retrieve the particular document data and download the particular document data to storage .

In an embodiment user selection data stores data that indicate the specific features and options for the features of printing device that a user of mobile device selected as appropriate for printing an electronic document data on printing device . For example the user settings data can include information that the particular electronic document should be printed in a landscape format on an A4 format paper as a black and white printed document.

Storage may be implemented as any type of volatile or non volatile storage for storing data used by network service . For example storage may be random access memory RAM one or more disks or any combination of RAM and one or more disks for storing scanned document data.

Mobile device is communicatively coupled with cloud and other devices in system . In an embodiment mobile device communicates with cloud by providing to cloud printer identification data of a printer identification information of an electronic document to be printed and user s selected features and options to be used in processing and printing the document on the printer.

Mobile device may be implemented as any type of device equipped with wireless communication capabilities capabilities to generate display and interact with a graphical user interface capabilities to access the Internet and other capabilities specific to the mobile device technology. Non limiting examples of mobile device include without limitation cellular telephony devices such as cell phones personal digital assistants PDAs and a tablet device.

Mobile device can be configured to display on a touch screen display a series of graphical displays each of which provides a user with choices and each of which is configured to accept the user s selection and to communicate the user s selections to other applications residing on mobile device .

In an embodiment mobile device hosts one or more applications facilitating communications with mobile device and facilitating execution of various tasks. For example mobile device can host an interface application that allows a user to authenticate to mobile device an application that allows scanning information from printing device an application that allows communicating with cloud and other applications that allow communicating with other devices in system . Alternatively mobile device can execute one robust application that is designed to provide a variety of services including the services described above.

In an embodiment mobile device executes an application that causes prompting a user of mobile device via a user interface to enter authentication information such as a username and password. Once the authentication information is entered the user is not required to re enter the authentication information. The authentication information may be stored for example persistently on mobile device . Thus if subsequently the user attempts to access one or more services in cloud then another application or applications can retrieve the already provided authentication information and send the authentication information to cloud .

In an embodiment mobile device executes a web browser application that causes scanning or photographing encoded data displayed by printing device . The scanned encoded data of printing device comprises the printer s identifier that uniquely identifies printing device . Furthermore the encoded data of printing device can comprise information about features and options available on printing device . The encoded data can also comprise network service interface data that provide methods for communicating with network service . Moreover the encoded data of printing device can comprise authentication information for validating access to network service .

In an embodiment mobile device can identify a printing device from a plurality of printing devices available to mobile device and acquire a printer identifier specific to the identified printing device.

In an embodiment mobile device executes a web browser application that causes generating a graphical user interface GUI to display the features and options of printing device . The web browser application can also be configured to receive a user s selection of the electronic document to be printed and a user s selection of the features and their corresponding options to be used in printing the electronic document on printing device .

The user s selections of the electronic document to be printed and the features and options for the respective features to be utilized in printing the electronic document can also be referred to as printing selection information or print data.

In an embodiment the web browser application can also be configured to cause sending the user s selections of the electronic document the features and options and printing device identifier to network service in cloud . Upon receiving the user s selections and the printing device identifier network service can identify a job queue that network service maintains for the printing device identified by the printing device identifier and store the user s selections in the identified job queue for future retrieval by the printing device.

Because more than one printing devices may be available for printing to mobile device network service can maintain a separate job queue for each printing device from the plurality of printing devices. Therefore mobile device sends to network service the printer identifier that uniquely identifies the printing device selected by the user of mobile device . Network service uses the received printer identifier to select a job queue that is associated with the specific printing device that is identified by the received printer identifier.

In an alternative embodiment the above steps are performed by an application that is not a web based browser. Such an application may comprise various modules for scanning encoded data displayed by printing device processing the scanned data generating and displaying a graphical user interface GUI for depicting the features and options currently available on printing device accepting the user s selections of the features and options accepting the user s selection of an electronic document for printing establishing a communications link with network service and sending the user s selections and a printer identifier to network service . In such an embodiment any updates to the application can be distributed to each mobile device individually and configured on each mobile device individually. In contrast with a browser based implementation such updates may not be required. Instead any updates to a web browser based application may be distributed when each of the mobile devices establishes a communications link with the network service or distributed in a form of a broadcast to mobile devices.

In an embodiment mobile device is equipped with a scanner or a camera to acquire encoded data displayed by printing device . For example a scanner of mobile device is configured to scan the encoded data displayed by printing device . Alternatively a camera of mobile device can be used to photograph the encoded data displayed by printing device . The scanned or photographed encoded data can be communicated to an encoding data processing application. Other methods of acquiring the encoded data are also contemplated.

In an embodiment the encoded data comprises a printer identifier of the printing device. The encoded data can also comprise the features and options for the respective features currently available on the printing device. Furthermore the encoded data can comprise network interface data that provide information necessary for establishing a communications link with network service and an API key described above.

In an embodiment an application executed on a mobile device causes one or more selectable icons to be displayed each of which is associated with a different service. For example one selectable icon may correspond to printing another selectable icon may correspond to scanning and another selectable icon may correspond to faxing.

In an embodiment the information that is displayed on a screen of mobile device is personalized to the user of mobile device . The personalization of the displayed information may be based on previous interactions such as previous document processing jobs between mobile device and cloud . For example if the user has used a set of printing job settings in connections with one or more previous printing jobs then the application can display on option to select that set of printing job settings without having to individually select each setting in the set. The job settings of previous document processing jobs may be stored on mobile device and accessible to the application executing on mobile device .

Alternatively the job settings may be stored in cloud for example in storage in association with a printer identifier specific to printing device . Thus after the application starts up on mobile device the application requests from network service one or more sets of job settings for one or more previous document processing jobs and displays selectable data that correspond to each set of job settings.

In an embodiment the application of mobile device uses the features and options currently available on selected printing device to generate a graphical user interface GUI to display the printer specific features and options. While the features and options displayed in the GUI are specific and unique to the selected printing device the overall design of the GUI may be consistent with the preferences previously selected by the user of mobile device . The overall consistency of the GUI design can be maintained by mobile device until the user changes the preferences.

The purpose of maintaining the overall consistency of the GUI design is to provide the GUI with which the user is familiar and comfortable and which has the same look and feel to the user. While the features and options displayed in the GUI are specific to the selected printing device the overall design of the GUI is the same regardless of which printing device is selected from a plurality of printing devices. Since the user is familiar with the overall design of the GUI the user can more effectively navigate through the features and options even if the features and the options are specific to one of the printing devices from the plurality of the printing devices.

In an embodiment the application of mobile device receives a user s selections entered by the user using the GUI. The application stores the selections processes them and communicates them to for example network service .

In step a user initiates the execution on mobile device of a job printing application. For example the user can select an icon representing the job printing application and launch the application.

In step in response to the user s initiation of the job printing application the job printing application causes one or more service icons to be displayed on a screen of mobile device . The service icons may include without limitation a print service icon.

In step the user selects one of the displayed service icons. In an embodiment the user selects the icon that represents a printing capability.

In step in response to user selection of one of the displayed service icons the application causes activating a scanner or a camera of mobile device to scan or photograph encoded data displayed by printing device . For example the user can approach printing device point the scanner or the camera of mobile device to the display of encoded data on printing device and press a button to activate the scanner or the camera to capture the encoded data displayed by printing device .

In other embodiment the encoded data can be acquired by utilizing an infra red sensor for capturing an infra red signal emitted by an infra red emitter of printing device . In other embodiment the encoded data can be received by a wireless signal receiver of mobile device that is configured to capture a signal transmitted by a wireless signal transmitter of mobile device . Other implementations are also contemplated.

In step mobile device processes the received encoded data decodes the encoded data and extracts the features and options currently available on printing device from the decoded data. For example the features and options can specify the types of formatting available for a document printing the types of paper formats available for a document printing the types of finishing options available on printing device and other features and options for the respective features currently available on printing device . Furthermore in step mobile device uses the features and options to generate and display a graphical user interface on mobile device .

In an embodiment the graphical user interface GUI presents to a user the features and options that are specific to printing device however the overall design of the GUI is consistent with the user s preferences and does not change when a different printing device is selected from a plurality of printing devices.

Maintaining the consistency of the overall design of the GUI allows displaying the GUI with which the user is familiar and which the user can navigate comfortably and efficiently. Even if the features and options change as the user selects a different printing device from the plurality of the printing device the look and feel of the GUI displayed on the user s mobile device does not have to change.

In step a user selects one or more features and one or more options for the selected features for a printing job that the user would like to have performed by printing device . For example the user can select that an electronic document should be printed on an A4 format paper in a landscape format one sided black and white and collated.

The user can also provide application data for printing. For example the application data can be an electronic document that the user wants to have printed. According to another example the application data can be electronic data identification data comprising a location indicator of the location of the electronic document that the user wants to have printed. Non limiting examples of the electronic document identification data include a name of the electronic document pointer uniform resource identifiers URI and a hyperlink to the electronic document that should be used to retrieve the electronic document for printing.

In step the user s selected features and options the application data and the printer identifier are sent to network service according to network service interface identification data extracted from encoded data as described above. The network service interface identification data may indicate for example a uniform resource identifier URI of the device that hosts network service or an email address of the network service . Other forms of network service interface identification data can be also utilized.

In step in response to receiving the user s selected features and options the application data and the printer identifier network service processes the received information and extracts the printer identifier. Network service uses the printer identifier to store the received user s selected features and option and the application data in an association with the printer identifier.

In step network service associates the printer identifier with the received user s selected features and options and the application data.

If the application data is represented as electronic document identification data a name of the electronic document name pointer URI hyperlink etc. then network service can use the electronic document identification data to determine a location of the corresponding electronic document data download the corresponding electronic document data to storage associated with network service and translate the downloaded electronic document data to print data in the format that printing device understands.

In an embodiment network service stores the received user s selected features and options and application data in association with the received printer identifier. Various data structures and various storing methods can be used for storing the association of the received data and the received printer identifier. For example network service can store the user s selected features and options and application data in a data structure identified by a printer identifier. Non limiting examples of such structures may include data tables data arrays job queues and multidimensional data structures.

In an embodiment the steps are repeated each time a user of mobile device or any other user of system wishes to store a printing job in a repository of network service . The printing job information is stored in storage of network service and can be reused to repeat the printing of the same document and using the same features and options. Alternatively the printing job information may be updated partially by for example updating the electronic document identification data. Thus the information about the features and options can be reused while different electronic documents are printed.

In step printing device establishes a communications link with network service and inquires whether any printing job is stored in a job queue maintained by network service for printing device . Printing device can establish the communications link with network service by using a universal resource identifier URI associated with network service . According to another example printing device can establish a communications link with network service by sending an email to network service using an email address provided to printing device in advance. Other methods of establishing communication with network service are also contemplated.

Printing device can make the inquiry at different times and intervals that may vary depending upon a particular implementation. For example printing device may make periodic inquiries make one or more inquiries at specified times or make inquiries in response to the occurrence of particular events.

There are many types of events that may trigger printing device to make an inquiry about whether any print jobs are currently stored for printing device in cloud . For example printing device may make an inquiry in response to entering a powered up state or in response to transitioning from a power save state to an active state. As another example printing device may make an inquiry in response detecting selection of one or more user interface objects or functions via operation panel . As yet another example printing device may make an inquiry in response to a request from a mobile device such as mobile device .

If network service has stored at least one print job for printing device then printing device requests and or downloads the stored printing jobs from a printing job queue maintained by network service and executes them in step .

Once the stored printing jobs are downloaded to printing device the printing jobs are deleted from the printing job queue associated with network service .

However if network service does not have any printing jobs stored in a printing job queue for printing device at the moment then printing device remains idle until printing device can again inquire about printing jobs at network service .

In an embodiment step may be periodically repeated by printing device or can be performed according to a schedule. In other embodiment step can be executed when printing device is not busy performing other jobs or when printing device performs a routine check of the job queues maintained for printing device by any network service other service or repository in system .

For clarity in an element points to steps that can be performed by mobile device an element points to step that can be performed by network service and an element points to steps that can be performed by printing device .

In step an application of mobile device acquires encoded data of printing device from printing device . In an embodiment the encoded data can be scanned by a scanner of mobile device transmitted to a decoder of mobile device and interpreted. Alternatively the encoded data can be photographed by a camera of mobile device and transmitted from the camera to the decoder.

As described above the encoded data can be encoded decoded using a variety of techniques including a quick response QR coding.

In an embodiment the encoded data represent a features and options that are currently supported by printing device b a printer identifier for printing device and c network service interface data for a network service .

In step an application of mobile device uses the encoded data and in particular the information about the features and options that are currently supported by printing device to generate a graphical user interface GUI to provide a graphical representation of the features and options available on printing device . While the GUI provides the representation of the features and options that are specific to printing device the overall design of the GUI is based on the preferences that the user provided in advance. Therefore the GUI looks and feels similarly to the user regardless of the type of printing device.

In step an application of mobile device receives user s selections that the user entered using the GUI displayed on mobile device . The user s selections may indicate the user s selected features and options and application data described above. For example the user could have entered that he wants to print a particular electronic document on an A4 format paper and in color.

In step an application of mobile device sends the user s selected features and options the application data and the printer identifier extracted from the encoded data to network service .

The application can establish a communications link with network service according to network service interface data extracted from encoded data provided by printing device . For example the network service interface data may comprise an URI of network service which a web browser based application of mobile device can use to access network service . In addition the web browser based application of mobile device can also use an API key also extracted from the encoded data to gain access to network service if network service is a secure device.

According to another example the network service interface data may comprise an email address of network service which an email processing application of mobile device can use to send to network service an email containing the user s selections and the printer s identifier.

In step network service receives user s selected features options document data and a printer s identifier from mobile device . As described above the user s selected document data can comprise an electronic document itself or electronic document identification data such as a name a pointer a URI or a hyperlink to the electronic document that the user wants to print. The user s selections of the features and options comprise the specific features and options that should be applied when the electronic document is printed. The printer s identifier is an identifier that uniquely identifies a particular printing device in a plurality of printing device in system .

In an embodiment network service associates the received user s selected features options and document data with the received printer identifier and stores the received user s selected features options and document data in association with the printer s identifier. The associations can be stored in various data structures such as data tables data arrays job queues or multidimensional data structures.

If the associations are stored in job queues then network service determines whether a printing job queue has been already created by network service for the printing device identified by the received printer s identifier. If such a queue has been already created then network service adds the received user s selected features options and document data to the queue identified by the respective printer s identifier. However is such a queue has not been already created for the received printer s identifier then network service creates a print job queue for the printing device identified by the received printer s identifier and stores the received user s selected features options and document data in the respective queue.

In an embodiment if the received document data comprise electronic document identification data then network service uses the electronic document identification data to identify a corresponding electronic document downloads the electronic document to a cache of network service converts the electronic document to a printable electronic document according to the user s selected features and options and stores the printable electronic document in the queue for printing device .

In step printing device requests printing jobs from network service . For example a job polling application can establish a communications link with network service using for example a URI of network service and inquire whether network service has stored any printing job for printing device . The inquiry can comprise the printer s identifier which helps the network service to identify a print job queue that network service maintains for printing device .

In response to determining that no printing job is available for printing device from network service at the moment printing device can continue executing the job polling application and continue inquiring whether a printing job became available for printing device at network service .

However in response to determining that at least one printing job is available for printing device from network service the job polling application can proceed to step .

In step the job polling application of printing device downloads one or more printing jobs from network service . In an embodiment printing device can download print data from storage of network service to storage of printing device . Furthermore printing device can download the user s selection of the features and options that printing device should apply while printing the print data on printing device .

If more than one printing job is available at network service for printing by printing device in an embodiment the job polling application of printing device can download one printing job at the time initiate the printing of the downloaded printing job and proceed to downloading another printing job from network service once the printing of the previous printing job was completed. Alternatively the job polling application of printing device can download all printing jobs that are stored at network service at the particular time and initiate the printing of the downloaded printing jobs once all the printing jobs have been downloaded from network service to printing device .

Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio wave and infra red data communications.

Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor for execution. For example the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra red transmitter to convert the data to an infra red signal. An infra red detector can receive the data carried in the infra red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus carries the data to main memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor .

Computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . Communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link that is connected to a local network . For example communication interface may be an integrated services digital network ISDN card cable modem satellite modem or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.

Network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider ISP . ISP in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet . Local network and Internet both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link and through communication interface which carry the digital data to and from computer system are example forms of transmission media.

Computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s network link and communication interface . In the Internet example a server might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet ISP local network and communication interface .
