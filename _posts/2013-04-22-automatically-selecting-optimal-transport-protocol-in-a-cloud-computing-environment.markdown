title: Automatically selecting optimal transport protocol in a cloud computing environment
abstract: A method, system and computer program product for selecting an optimal transport protocol in a cloud computing environment. An application creates a socket to communicate with a destination Virtual Machine (VM). The application requests a daemon agent to query a virtual machine manager to determine if the destination VM is on the same hypervisor as the application. The daemon agent receives a VMCI address (“context ID”) and an indication of the hypervisor associated with the destination VM from the virtual machine manager. The daemon agent enables the transport layer to route traffic over the VMCI protocol to the destination VM using its context ID in response to the destination VM being on the same hypervisor as the application. In this manner, the application is able to route traffic using an optimal transport protocol, including VMCI, depending on peer hypervisor association without requiring any code modifications to the application.

The present application is a continuation application of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 356 199 which was filed on Jan. 23 2012 which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The present application claims priority benefits to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 356 199.

The present invention relates to cloud computing and more particularly to automatically selecting the optimal transport protocol e.g. Virtual Machine Communication Interface VMCI Transmission Control Protocol TCP in a cloud computing environment.

In a cloud computing environment computing is delivered as a service rather than a product whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a metered service over a network such as the Internet. In such an environment computation software data access and storage services are provided to users that do not require knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the system that delivers the services.

In computer networking the transport layer provides end to end communication services for applications within a layered architecture of network components and protocols. The transport layer provides convenient services such as connection oriented data stream support reliability flow control and multiplexing. Examples of transport protocols include the Transmission Control Protocol TCP and the Virtual Machine Communication Interface VMCI protocol. The VMCI is an infrastructure that provides fast and efficient communication between a virtual machine and the host operating system and between two or more virtual machines on the same host i.e. the same physical real computer . VMCI is advantageous over TCP in that the throughput for VMCI may be significantly greater than the throughput for TCP IP. However there are some limitations in using VMCI.

For example in order to implement the VMCI protocol the application developer needs to make code modifications to make the application aware of the VMCI protocol. Such a requirement to make code modifications is a hindrance to enterprise level adoption due to the high cost of re testing.

Furthermore in a virtualized computer environment such as may be implemented in a cloud computing node of the cloud computing environment the VMCI protocol only provides communication within the local hypervisor. In a virtualized computer the computer includes a virtual operating system. The virtual operating system includes a common base portion and separate user portions that all run on a physical computer. The physical computer is referred to as a host. The common base portion may be referred to as a hypervisor and each user portion may be called a guest. Each guest is a logical partition of physical resources of the computer. A guest operating system runs on each guest and the guest appears to the guest operating system as a real computer. Each guest operating system may host one or more virtual machines.

Since the VMCI protocol only provides communication within the local hypervisor the VMCI sockets socket provides a bidirectional communication endpoint for sending and receiving data with another socket only communicate from guest to guest as well as between a guest to a host on a single host. VMCI sockets cannot be used for communicating between virtual machines running on two separate physical machines or from one host to another host across a network. Instead the application has to rely upon TCP IP to communicate with external hosts.

Since the application layer application layer contains all protocols and methods that fall into the realm of process to process communications does not have visibility to the underlying virtual infrastructure to determine whether it should communicate over VMCI if communicating on the same host or over TCP if communicating over a different host the application resorts to using TCP since virtual machines can migrate to new hosts as workload demands change.

As a result despite the benefits of using the VMCI protocol over the TCP protocol the use of the VMCI protocol in a virtualized computer environment in a cloud computing node of the cloud computing environment is currently impractical.

In one embodiment of the present invention a method for selecting an optimal transport protocol in a cloud computing environment comprises creating a socket to communicate with a destination virtual machine by an application. The method further comprises requesting a daemon agent to query a virtual machine manager to determine if the destination virtual machine is on a same hypervisor as the application. Additionally the method comprises receiving a context identification of the destination virtual machine and an indication of a hypervisor associated with the destination virtual machine from the virtual machine manager. In addition the method comprises enabling by a processor a transport layer to route traffic over a first transport protocol to the destination virtual machine using the context identification of the destination virtual machine in response to the destination virtual machine being on the same hypervisor as the application.

Other forms of the embodiment of the method described above are in a system and in a computer program product.

The foregoing has outlined rather generally the features and technical advantages of one or more embodiments of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the present invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be described hereinafter which may form the subject of the claims of the present invention.

The present invention comprises a method system and computer program product for selecting an optimal transport protocol in a cloud computing environment. In one embodiment of the present invention an application creates a socket to communicate with a destination host e.g. virtual machine running on a hardware host . The application requests a daemon agent to query a virtual machine manager to determine if the destination host is on the same hypervisor as the application. The daemon agent receives a Virtual Machine Communication Interface VMCI address also referred to as a context ID and an indication of the hypervisor associated with the destination virtual machine from the virtual machine manager. The daemon agent enables the transport layer to route traffic over the VMCI protocol to the destination virtual machine using the context ID of the destination virtual machine in response to the destination host being on the same hypervisor as the application. In this manner the application is able to route traffic using an optimal transport protocol including VMCI depending on peer hypervisor association without requiring any code modifications to the application.

While the following discusses the present invention in connection with selecting either the VMCI protocol or the TCP UDP protocol the principles of the present invention may be applied to selecting any two optimal transport protocols. Furthermore the principles of the present invention may be applied to selecting between the VMCI protocol and any conventional transport protocol of the transport layer of the Internet protocol suite. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be capable of applying the principles of the present invention to such implementations. Further embodiments applying the principles of the present invention to such implementations would fall within the scope of the present invention.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details. In other instances well known circuits have been shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail. For the most part details considering timing considerations and the like have been omitted inasmuch as such details are not necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the present invention and are within the skills of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather the embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any type of clustered computing environment now known or later developed.

In any event the following definitions have been derived from the The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing by Peter Mell and Timothy Grance dated September 2011 which is cited on an Information Disclosure Statement filed herewith and a copy of which is provided to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics three service models and four deployment models.

On Demand Self Service A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service s provider.

Broad Network Access Capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones tablets laptops and workstations .

Resource Pooling The provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or data center . Examples of resources include storage processing memory and network bandwidth.

Rapid Elasticity Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released in some cases automatically to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured Service Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based e mail or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages libraries services and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application hosting environment.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage and deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private Cloud The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers e.g. business units . It may be owned managed and operated by the organization a third party or some combination of them and it may exist on or off premises.

Community Cloud The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be owned managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community a third party or some combination of them and it may exist on or off premises.

Public Cloud The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned managed and operated by a business academic or government organization or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

Hybrid Cloud The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds .

Referring now to the Figures in detail illustrates a network system configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Network system includes a client device connected to a cloud computing environment via a network . Client device may be any type of computing device e.g. portable computing unit personal digital assistant PDA smartphone laptop computer mobile phone navigation device game console desktop computer system workstation Internet appliance and the like configured with the capability of connecting to cloud computing environment via network .

Network may be for example a local area network a wide area network a wireless wide area network a circuit switched telephone network a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM network Wireless Application Protocol WAP network a WiFi network an IEEE 802.11 standards network various combinations thereof etc. Other networks whose descriptions are omitted here for brevity may also be used in conjunction with system of without departing from the scope of the present invention.

Cloud computing environment is used to deliver computing as a service to client device implementing the model discussed above. An embodiment of cloud computing environment is discussed below in connection with .

Referring now to illustrates cloud computing nodes A N in a virtualized computer environment in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Cloud computing nodes A N may collectively or individually be referred to as cloud computing nodes or cloud computing node respectively. Cloud computing nodes A N are each coupled to an administrative server configured to provide data center level functions of communicating with hypervisors on cloud computing nodes to install virtual machines terminate virtual machines and move virtual machines from one cloud computing node to another within the data center.

With reference now to cloud computing node A cloud computing node A includes a virtual operating system A. Operating system A executes on a real or physical computer A. Real computer A includes one or more processors A a memory A also referred to herein as the host physical memory one or more disk drives A and the like. Other components of real computer A are not discussed herein for the sake of brevity.

Virtual operating system A further includes user portions A B identified as Guest 1 and Guest 2 respectively in referred to herein as guests. Each guest A B is capable of functioning as a separate system. That is each guest A B can be independently reset host a guest operating system A B respectively identified as Guest 1 O S and Guest 2 O S respectively in and operate with different programs. An operating system or application program running in guest A B appears to have access to a full and complete system but in reality only a portion of it is available.

Each guest operating system A B may host one or more virtual machine applications A C identified as VM 1 VM 2 and VM 3 respectively in such as Java virtual machines. For example guest operating system A hosts virtual machine applications A B. Guest operating system B hosts virtual machine application C.

Each virtual machine A C runs an application program A C and a daemon agent A C respectively. Virtual machines A C are a module of automated computing machinery configured by a hypervisor to allow application A C and daemon agent A C to share the underlying physical machine resources of cloud computing node A the processor A memory A and so on. A more detailed discussion of the use of application A C and daemon agent A C in connection with selecting the optimal transport protocol e.g. Virtual Machine Communication Interface VMCI Transmission Control Protocol TCP in a cloud computing environment is provided further below in connection with .

Virtual operating system A further includes a common base portion A referred to herein as a hypervisor. Hypervisor A may be implemented in microcode running on processor A or it may be implemented in software as part of virtual operating system A. Hypervisor A is configured to manage and enable guests A B to run on a single host.

As discussed above virtual operating system A and its components execute on physical or real computer A. These software components may be loaded into memory A for execution by processor A.

As also discussed above cloud computing environment can include multiple cloud computing nodes A N as is shown in . In one embodiment each cloud computing node A N is configured similarly as previously discussed cloud computing node A. For example cloud computing node N is configured similarly as cloud networking A. Cloud computing node N includes the same elements as cloud computing node A. For example guests C D identified as Guest 3 and Guest 4 respectively in are functionally the same as guests A B. Similarly guest operating systems C D identified as Guest 3 O S and Guest 4 O S respectively in are functionally the same as guest operating systems A B. Virtual machines D E identified as VM 4 and VM 5 respectively in are functionally the same as virtual machines A C. Applications D E and daemon agents D E are functionally the same as applications A C and daemon agents A C respectively. Furthermore hypervisor B is functionally the same as hypervisor A. Hence the discussion of cloud computing node A applies to each cloud computing node including cloud computing node N.

Guests A D may collectively or individually be referred to as guests or guest respectively. Guest operating systems A D may collectively or individually be referred to as guest operating systems or guest operating system respectively. Virtual machines A E may collectively or individually be referred to as virtual machines or virtual machine respectively. Applications A E may collectively or individually be referred to as applications or application respectively. Daemon agents A E may collectively or individually be referred to as daemon agents or daemon agent respectively. Hypervisors A B may collectively or individually be referred to as hypervisors or hypervisor respectively.

Additionally in some embodiments VM manager is responsible for lifecycle management of virtual resources efficient utilization of physical resources and for exposing basic application programming interfaces APIs for operations to users. Further functionality of VM manager is discussed below in connection with .

As stated in the Background section since the VMCI protocol only provides communication within the local hypervisor the VMCI sockets socket provides a bidirectional communication endpoint for sending and receiving data with another socket only communicate from guest to guest as well as between a guest to a host on a single host. VMCI sockets cannot be used for communicating between virtual machines running on two separate physical machines or from one host to another host across a network. Instead the application has to rely upon TCP IP to communicate with external hosts. Since the application layer application layer contains all protocols and methods that fall into the realm of process to process communications does not have visibility to the underlying virtual infrastructure to determine whether it should communicate over VMCI if communicating on the same host or over TCP if communicating over a different host the application resorts to using TCP since virtual machines can migrate to new hosts as workload demands change. As a result despite the benefits of using the VMCI protocol over the TCP protocol the use of the VMCI protocol in a virtualized computer environment in a cloud computing node of the cloud computing environment is currently impractical.

The principles of the present invention provide a means for automatically selecting the optimal transport protocol including the Virtual Machine Communication Interface VMCI protocol in a cloud computing environment without requiring any code modifications to the applications as discussed below in connection with . is a flowchart of a method for selecting the optimal transport protocol e.g. VMCI TCP depending on peer hypervisor association. is a flowchart of a method for enabling high performance network quality of service via the use of the VMCI protocol. is a flowchart of a method for ensuring persistent communication by seamlessly transitioning from a VMCI socket to a TCP UDP socket. is a flowchart of a method for ensuring persistent communication when virtual machines migrate between separate hardware hosts.

Referring to in conjunction with in step application e.g. application A creates a socket to communicate with a destination virtual machine e.g. virtual machine D operating on real computer B .

In step application requests daemon agent e.g. daemon agent A to query VM manager to determine if the destination virtual machine is on the same hypervisor e.g. hypervisor A as application .

In step daemon agent receives the context identification ID of the destination virtual machine as well as an indication of the hypervisor associated with the destination virtual machine from VM manager . In one embodiment each virtual machine is provided with a VMCI address referred to herein as a context identification ID . VM manager is responsible for deploying virtual machines to cloud computing environment and will therefore have the knowledge regarding the context ID of virtual machine as well as the particular hypervisor associated with virtual machine . As a result VM manager could provide daemon agent with the context ID for virtual machine as well as the particular hypervisor associated with virtual machine .

In step daemon agent determines whether the destination virtual machine is on the same hypervisor as application . Since daemon agent receives the indication of hypervisor associated with the destination virtual machine daemon agent would know whether the destination virtual machine is on the same hypervisor as application . If the destination virtual machine e.g. virtual machine C operating on real computer A is operating on the same hypervisor e.g. hypervisor A as application e.g. application A then in step daemon agent will enable the transport layer to route traffic over VMCI to the destination virtual machine . Daemon agent enables the transport layer to route traffic over VMCI to the destination virtual machine using the acquired context ID of the destination virtual machine . Otherwise in step daemon agent will enable the transport layer to route traffic over TCP or some other conventional transport protocol such as User Datagram Protocol UDP to the destination virtual machine using the acquired context ID of the destination virtual machine . In this manner the application is able to route traffic using an optimal transport protocol including VMCI depending on peer hypervisor association.

In some implementations method may include other and or additional steps that for clarity are not depicted. Further in some implementations method may be executed in a different order presented and that the order presented in the discussion of is illustrative. Additionally in some implementations certain steps in method may be executed in a substantially simultaneous manner or may be omitted.

A Service Level Agreement SLA is a part of a service contract where the level of service e.g. data rates throughput is formally defined. In order to optimize performance and efficiently maintain workload according to the service level agreement the knowledge of virtual machine placement may be utilized as discussed below in connection with . is a flowchart of a method for enabling high performance network quality of service via the use of the VMCI protocol.

Referring to in conjunction with in step VM manager determines if the requirements of the SLA e.g. high data rate high throughput are violated while using virtual machines on separate hosts .

If the requirements of the SLA e.g. high data rate high throughput are violated while using virtual machines on separate hosts then in step VM manager deploys virtual machines that are the endpoints in a communication to the same hypervisor including evicting other virtual machines if needed to satisfy the requirements of the SLA .

In step daemon agent enables the transport layer to route traffic over VMCI between these deployed virtual machines.

If however the requirements of the SLA e.g. high data rate high throughput are not violated while using virtual machines on separate hosts then in step no action is taken by VM manager .

In some implementations method may include other and or additional steps that for clarity are not depicted. Further in some implementations method may be executed in a different order presented and that the order presented in the discussion of is illustrative. Additionally in some implementations certain steps in method may be executed in a substantially simultaneous manner or may be omitted.

Ensuring uninterrupted communication is accomplished by seamlessly transitioning from a VMCI socket to a TCP UDP socket as discussed below in connection with .

Referring to in conjunction with in step application opens a new connection over a socket e.g. application A opens a new connection over a socket to communicate with virtual machine C where such a socket is augmented with the ability to communicate over VMCI or TCP UDP.

In step the TCP IP stack implementation inspects the packet for its destination. For example the TCP IP stack implementation may inspect the header of the packet for its destination.

If a VMCI connection has been established for its destination then in step daemon agent encapsulates the packet as a VMCI packet and sends it through the socket.

If however a VMCI connection has not been established for its destination then in step daemon agent the packet on the TCP UDP socket unchanged.

In some implementations method may include other and or additional steps that for clarity are not depicted. Further in some implementations method may be executed in a different order presented and that the order presented in the discussion of is illustrative. Additionally in some implementations certain steps in method may be executed in a substantially simultaneous manner or may be omitted.

Persistent communication can further be ensured when virtual machines migrate between separate hardware hosts as discussed below in connection with .

Referring to in conjunction with in step VM manager requests that all new traffic be sent over the TCP UDP socket unconditionally.

In step VM manager closes the VMCI sockets once all pending packets have been sent over the VMCI sockets.

In step VM manager requests the action involving the migration of virtual machine s between similar but separate hardware hosts . For example VM manager may request the migration of virtual machine A on hardware host A to hardware host B.

In step upon completion of the migration action VM manager notifies daemon agent on all virtual machines residing on hypervisor associated with the migrated virtual machines of the completion of the action. For example VM manager notifies daemon agent D E on all virtual machines D E on hypervisor B associated with the migrated virtual machine A migrated from host A to host B of the completion of the action.

In step daemon agent opens VMCI sockets for new packets with destinations on the same hypervisor e.g. hypervisor B associated with the migrated virtual machines virtual machine A migrated from host A to host B . For example daemon agent opens VMCI sockets for new packets being sent by application D to the migrated virtual machine virtual machine A migrated from host A to host B that is associated with the same hypervisor e.g. hypervisor B as application D.

In some implementations method may include other and or additional steps that for clarity are not depicted. Further in some implementations method may be executed in a different order presented and that the order presented in the discussion of is illustrative. Additionally in some implementations certain steps in method may be executed in a substantially simultaneous manner or may be omitted.
