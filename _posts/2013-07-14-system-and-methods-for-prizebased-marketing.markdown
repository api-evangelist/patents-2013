This application claims the benefit of PCT Application No. PCT US13 50422 filed on Jul. 14 2013 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 718 257 filed on Oct. 25 2012 which are both hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to mobile computing devices. In particular the present invention relates to a method for marketing and promoting using an electronic game application.

The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.

The Internet has transformed both consumer sales and advertising. Where once a person had to physically visit a store to review the available merchandise and make a selection now people can sit in front of a computer in their home and review a vast array of selections and offerings. Once a consumer has decided to purchase an item they can initiate an online purchase and have the item shipped directly to their home. Before online sales and product promotion companies had to strategically market and promote their offerings to consumers through traditional media such as television newspapers or billboards and hope that the consumers were paying attention as they drove by the billboard or read the article on that page of the newspaper.

With the Internet numerous dynamic advertisements can be marketed to consumers on a website to website basis via mobile software application or based upon selected downloaded content. Further the ability to gather information on users and the flexibility of digital media allow advertisers to be precise in targeting their ads has generated complex marketing and promotional strategies.

Mobile communications devices such as smart phones and tablets devices are further transforming consumer sales and advertising. Instead of having to be in front of a desktop computer consumers can shop and purchase from almost anywhere they have cell phone coverage. An advertisement can be delivered to an individual s smart phone or tablet with the device notifying the individual of the availability of the ad. Further the global positioning systems GPS and cameras built into mobile devices provide new ways to target ads to consumers and to provide inducements or rewards. Using GPS a person can be presented with ads based upon their current location and proximity to offered products and services. Further a scannable barcode printed on a poster can allow a consumer in a sporting event to use their mobile phone camera to scan the code and instantly receive on their phone an ad or special offer or even a reward such as a free beverage from the concession stand.

The ubiquity and intrusiveness of mobile devices also pose challenges for consumer sales and advertising. People are increasingly inundated with information and advertising making it more difficult for a company or advertiser to engage an attentive consumer. Games have historically captured people s attention. The opportunity to win something based on luck not skill or mental exertion can give people a sense of anticipation increasing attentiveness and engagement with potential advertisement messages.

Mobile devices allow games to be delivered directly to a consumer providing a quick and easy respite from the real world. Further mobile devices can be used to instantly deliver the prize or award continuing the consumer s engagement. For companies selling to and advertising to consumers games offer a unique engagement tool something that can be used to capture and keep a consumer s attention and allow the presentation of a special offer or advertisement.

Therefore companies that sell and advertise to consumers would benefit from a game that can be used to engage consumers and present advertising and further a platform that allows the creation of custom smart phone or tablet games that also presents advertising and instant prizes or rewards.

A method is described for providing advertisements on a mobile device. The method includes monitoring tactile input from a user providing a game comprising identifiable game pieces on a playing surface and displaying an advertisement adjacent to the playing surface. Play of the game is initiated based upon the monitored tactile input from the user. One or more of the plurality of identifiable game pieces is associated to a prize based upon input from a random number generator. A user is able to select a game piece from the plurality of game pieces in an attempt to select the game piece associated with the prize. Upon selection of the associated game piece the user is awarded the prize. By requiring shaking of the mobile device to initiate a game the user is more engaged in game play better retaining focus to the game and advertisement.

An additional embodiment allows player users to be offered an instant prize at a venue or sporting event. In response to a prompting on a video screen announcement or posters attendees can use their mobile devices to send their picture to the game operation module. The pictures are displayed as a group on the video monitor at the venue or sporting event. The game operation module then randomly chooses one of the participants as the winner.

Additional embodiments provide a platform for creating and distributing gaming application with advertisements and prizes to mobile devices. Game designers are able to create save and distribute the games to mobile device users through the administrative platform. In one embodiment game designers are able to select the image and number of game pieces as well as how those pieces change during different parts of the game. The game designer is also able to dedicate part of the game screen to advertisements as well as decide the odds of winning. Gameplay parameters game settings and distribution to the mobile users may be managed and monitored through the administrative platform.

Initially a mobile device user i.e. user player is presented with an opportunity to play the game. This opportunity can be delivered in accordance of a previously expressed desire to receive games and so pushed to the mobile device . The game opportunity could also be an outcome of a previous interaction for example a person that has played and lost the lottery can be automatically presented with a second game. Further the game opportunity could be automatically presented to the user based on their physical location as derived from the phone s GPS or in response to the mobile device user scanning a QR code on a poster.

Gameplay of the gaming application includes providing in response to a request from a user a game comprising a plurality of identifiable game pieces the game pieces displayed on the interactive playing module i.e. a playing surface. The mobile device receives from the server an advertisement for display adjacent to the playing surface. The game is initiated upon player request the request may be indicated by player supplied tactile input such as shaking of the mobile device the shaking determined by monitoring a gyroscope or accelerometer within the mobile device. Game rules are predetermined by a merchant user or administrator of the game. For example the game rules may indicate a number of matches of user selected game pieces to game pieces selected by the gaming application and instruct the game play to select the number of game pieces.

After initiation of a game a player selects the predetermined number of game pieces. After selection of the game pieces the user is then instructed to shake the mobile device . Upon shaking or a predetermined time period thereafter the gaming application initiates selection of the game pieces at random. Selection of the game pieces includes a show display to the user. The show display indicates to the user that the gaming application is sorting through the game pieces on the screen in a random process instead of the nearly instantaneous selection enabled by computing processors available on the mobile device. In one embodiment the show display includes changing images of the game pieces randomly or sequentially with one or more random stops. Changing images can include a visual highlight or temporary transparent visual modulation. When the random number generator completes its process the randomly selected game pieces are highlighted along with the corresponding winning game pieces as visual indicia for example.

An additional embodiment of the invention allows people in a particular location for example a venue or sporting event to be offered an opportunity to participate in a group contest to win an instant prize. In operation an invitation to participate in the contest is presented to the people in the location. This invitation can be presented by a range of media for example as an announcement over the public address system on the scoreboard or video monitor on posters positioned around the arena or on other printed material for example the event tickets. In one embodiment user players participate in the game by taking a picture of themself using their mobile device and sending that picture to the game control module of the server. The picture can be sent via a text message email or uploaded to a web page that can be accessed with a mobile device. In one embodiment participants can also use a previously taken picture. The submitted pictures are stored in a database of the server.

The possible number of participants is determined by the game control module. The number of participants can be fixed e.g. a first 300 to submit their pictures or variable for example every submission received within ten minutes of the game invitation being presented. When the submission acceptance period is closed the game may be initiated.

In one embodiment the game control module displays pictures of the participants on a display device for example the video monitor in the area. When the game begins the pictures displayed on the video monitor are randomly highlighted suggesting the random number generator is sorting through the different pictures. The random number generator then selects the winner or winners and highlights the winner s pictures on the video monitor. Further the game control module can send a text or email message to the winner or winners on their mobile devices which can include the prize. The prize can be something accessed at that event for example access to the sideline of the event or a free drink participation in a subsequent event or a different kind of prize.

In one embodiment submitted pictures are analyzed to filter non responsive and undesirable pictures for example non facial pictures. Filtering may include checking a timestamp or performing facial recognition algorithms to determine that a face is indeed present on the submitted photograph. Pictures non in compliance with the predetermined criteria may be excluded from public presentation and prize award. For example in one embodiment pictures may be excluded from the displaying and the awarding when user s pictures have a timestamp greater than a predetermined time period in the past or failing to confirm that a face is included in the received user s picture.

At step an administrator may select a layout for the game pieces. The game design module interface allows the user to create and save a customized gaming application. In one embodiment the user can work or select from pre loaded game layout templates. As an example the game pieces can be a playing surface may consist of six rows of game pieces each containing five pieces or a line or circle of game pieces.

At step the administrator can select an image that may represent each of the plurality of game pieces. In one embodiment the game pieces can have logos or other commercial pictures such as an advertisement message. In one exemplary application an administrator is able to upload a digital image such as a game piece helmet or banana.

At step the user may specify or associate different images or sets of images to set stages of gameplay or game play events. For example one image may be uploaded and associated with an initial start of the game another image may be provided that indicates that a player has selected that piece another image that is displayed as the random number generator operates and another image that displays if the game piece is the winning piece.

At step the administrator is also able to dedicate part of the game screen to advertisements. The administrator can link this advertising screen space to ads provided by the administrator or allow ads from other companies to appear on the game screen as desired.

At step the administrator is able to designate the number of game piece matches required for a player win. As described herein above to win the user player must select which game piece or pieces the gaming application will randomly select. The administrators are able to specify the number of game pieces that a player must correctly guess to win for example one game piece match for a win or two game piece matches for a win at either the game creation or the game deployment. Requiring more matches effectively decreases the chances for a winner. As an example if the field of game pieces includes 30 game pieces and the player has to correctly guess which game piece the random number generator will select to win the player has a one in thirty chance of winning. If the user player must guess the two game pieces that the randomizer will select the odds drop to 1 in 900. In one embodiment the administrator is able to specify what will be displayed both in case of a win or a loss.

At step the administrator is further enable to designate a prize in case of a win at either the game creation or the game deployment. The prize can be something delivered to the mobile device for immediate use. For example a number or barcode that can be used for a free drink the right or option of receiving something at a future date for example a coupon that can be redeemed online to purchase more lottery tickets or an opportunity to participate in an event or happening for example sideline passes to the football game the winner is currently attending. In one embodiment the administrator is enabled to select a redeemable coupon as the prize deliverable whereby the gaming application is configured to generate a unique identification for each generated redeemable.

At step an administrator is able to provide a logo to incorporate into the selected game if the selected game is a logo based game. The logos are then incorporated into the game pieces as described herein above.

At step the administrator selects advertising content for display during gameplay. The advertising content may be uploaded as described herein above and may include banner formed advertisements and or video content.

At step the administrator selects display content provided to a user player after a successful player win. At step the administrator selects display content provided to a user player after a player loss. At step the administrator may specify a number of game piece matches necessary to win.

At step the administrator may set various distribution and marketing campaign parameters. Distribution and audience parameters includes specifying the duration a particular game will be available for play by user players and or setting availability based upon quantity of awarded prizes. In one embodiment the administrator can define which consumers selected by age state of residence or other demographic information will receive access to the game. Further the game operator can use an existing membership list and list management platform to target and distribute the game to consumers based on selected parameters for example selected by age state of residence or other demographic information advertiser preferences or state regulations. Once the game operator has created the campaign the game can be deployed to mobile users based on the parameters of the campaign at step . One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the some of the steps performed herein may be executed in any order or concurrently.

The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore it is intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiment s disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure but that the disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
