The U.S. Government has a paid up license in the inventions and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by terms of contract number FA 7014 07 C 0013 awarded by the U.S. Air Force.

The present invention relates to electro optic lenses including liquid crystals wherein the power of the lenses can be modified by application of an electric field. In one embodiment the liquid crystal based lenses include ring electrodes having a resistive bridge located between adjacent electrodes and in a preferred embodiment input connections for several electrode rings are spaced on the lens. In a further embodiment liquid crystal based lenses are provided that can increase optical power through the use of phase resets wherein in one embodiment a lens includes ring electrodes on surfaces of the substrates on opposite sides of the liquid crystal cell such that a fixed phase term can be added to each set of electrodes that allows for phase change across each group of electrodes to be the same and also be matched with respect to a previous group.

Electro optical lenses that utilize birefringent liquid crystal to alter their optical power are known. They have the inherent advantage over conventional glass or plastic optical lenses of being able to alter their optical power by the judicious application of an electric field. One drawback of existing liquid crystal electro optic lenses is that the number of optical powers a single lens can generate is presently limited.

One basic structure of electro optic liquid crystal lenses is that of a thin layer of liquid crystal sandwiched between two transparent substrates. Onto the inner surfaces of each substrate a transparent metallic electrode structure is formed. An alignment layer is formed on top of the electrode layers to establish a specific orientation of the liquid crystal molecules when there is no electric field present. An electric field is established across the liquid crystal layer when voltage is applied to one electrode layer and an electric potential is created between the electrodes. If the electrode structure is patterned a gradient in the field is created that gives rise to a gradient in the index of refraction of the liquid crystal layer. With proper design of the electrode structure and the applied voltages an electro optic lens can be fabricated.

Electro optic liquid crystal lenses have been designed and fabricated that utilize electrode structures to generate several optical powers with a single lens.

The basic structure of a spherical electro optic liquid crystal lens is that of a circular ring electrode design where the transparent electrodes on one or both substrates consist of toric rings electrically insulated from adjacent neighboring rings. Previous designs of these lenses are restrictive in the sense that the ring electrode widths and spacing often determine the optical power of the lens. However if a very large number of very narrow electrodes could be fabricated and addressed individually theoretically a very large number of optical powers could be generated by such a lens.

Considering that the optical phase change between each adjacent electrode should be less than about of a wave and that the total phase change across a lens might be as high as 100 waves it first appears that an electrode structure consisting of hundreds of rings addressed by hundreds of input connections to the device might be required for continuous tuning. This is not an acceptable solution however since the photolithography needed to create such an electrode structure would be daunting. Moreover fabricating the buss structure to connect and electrically address each electrode would be an overwhelming task and make the resulting device extremely complex and unwieldy.

The use of phase wrapping can help mitigate the problem of fabricating hundreds of input connections to the lens. It has been previously shown in Liquid Crystal Based Electro Optic Diffractive Spectacle Lenses and Low Operating Voltage Nematic Liquid Crystals by Joshua Naaman Haddock a Dissertation submitted to the Faculty of the College of Optical Sciences in partial fulfillment of the Requirements for a Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Graduate College of the University of Arizona in 2005 that electrodes can be grouped in such a way that the phase change over one group is approximately one wave. Thus the number of input connections is limited to the number of rings in each group. However this scheme only provides high efficiency if the phase change across each group of electrodes is very close to a multiple of one wave. Thus the phase change across each electrode group cannot be changed in a continuous manner and as a result the lens cannot be continuously tuned to multiple powers.

U.S. Publication No 2008 0212007 relates to an electro optic device comprising a liquid crystal layer between a pair of opposing transparent substrates a resistive patterned electrode set positioned between the liquid crystal layer and the inward facing surface of the first transparent substrate and a conductive layer between the liquid crystal layer and the inward facing surface of the second transparent substrate wherein the conductive layer and resistive patterned electrode set are electrically connected and wherein said resistive patterned electrode set comprises one or more electrically separated electrodes wherein the desired voltage drop is applied across each electrode to provide the desired phase retardation profile.

Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a tunable lens wherein an electrode of one substrate layer overlaps at least two electrodes of an electrode layer of a second substrate wherein said overlap is in a direction of the planes of the substrates.

Another object of the present invention is to provide patterned electrodes on two substrate surfaces whereby a fixed piston phase term is added to each set of electrodes in one section by a blazed electrode structure that allows for phase change across each group of electrodes to be the same and also to be phase matched with respect to a previous group.

In one aspect of the invention a tunable electro optic lens device is disclosed comprising at least two substantially transparent substrates a substantially transparent conductive electrode layer operatively connected to each substrate wherein at least one of the electrode layers is patterned and includes a plurality of ring electrodes wherein at least one ring electrode is electrically connected to an adjacent ring electrode by a resistive bridge and wherein an electro active liquid crystal material layer is present between the at least two substantially transparent substrates.

Referring now to the drawings illustrates a cross sectional view of a portion of one embodiment of an electro optical device of the present invention. Device includes a pair of substrates preferably planar and disposed parallel to each other in one embodiment. The substrates are maintained at a desired distance by spacers not shown. The spacing range can vary and in one embodiment is from about 5 to about 100 microns. An electrode layer is present on lower substrate and an electrode layer is present on upper substrate with the lower electrode layer illustrated as a patterned electrode as further explained herein. An alignment layer is present on the substrates preferably on the electrode layers . A liquid crystal layer is present between the substrates and in contact with alignment layers . As utilized herein the term layer does not require a uniform thickness and imperfections or uneven thicknesses can be present so long as the layer performs its intended purpose.

As the device is a lens the substrates must provide desired optical transmission and preferably are transparent. The substrates can be planar or can be curved. Various materials can be utilized as known in the art such as glass quartz or a polymer with glass being preferred. The substrate is preferably a non birefringent material or aligned or compensated to minimize the effect of their birefringence.

The conductive electrode layers can be deposited on a substrate by any known method. Preferably patterned electrode is formed utilizing a photo lithographic process. The electrode layer material can be any inorganic substantially transparent conductive material. Examples of suitable materials include metal oxides such as indium oxide tin oxide and indium tin oxide and preferably is indium tin oxide. The thickness of the conductive electrode layer is generally from about 100 to about 2 000 angstroms. The electrode layer must be sufficiently thick to provide desired conductivity. Resistivity of the conductive electrode layer is generally from about 10 to about 1 000 ohms sq and is preferably from about 10 to about 200 or 300 ohms sq.

The alignment layer is used to induce a particular directional orientation in the liquid crystal when no voltage is applied to the device . Various materials suitable for use as alignment layers are known in the art including but not limited to polyimide and polyvinyl alcohol. The thickness of the alignment layer should be sufficient to impart the desired directional orientation to the liquid crystal material such as about 100 to about 1 000 angstroms. As known in the art the alignment layer is treated by rubbing in some embodiments to impart a substantially homogenous molecular orientation to the liquid crystal material prior to an electrical field being applied to the material 

Generally any liquid crystal material that has an orientational order that can be controlled in the presence of an electric field can be utilized including any nematic smectic or cholesteric phase forming liquid crystals or polymer containing liquid crystals such as polymer liquid crystals polymer dispersed liquid crystals or polymer stabilized liquid crystals. Nematic liquid crystals are preferred in one embodiment. Desirable characteristics possessed by suitable liquid crystal materials include the ability to align the liquid crystal without much difficulty rapid switching time and a low voltage threshold.

The width of the rings is set so that the maximum phase difference between adjacent electrodes is less than approximately wave in one embodiment.

The number of electrodes present on the substrate i.e. both rings and central disk can vary. In one embodiment generally from about 20 to about 2 000 and preferably from about 50 to about 200 total electrodes are present on a substrate.

According to the present invention at least one group of electrodes i.e. two or more electrodes and preferably all or substantially all of the electrodes present are part of a resistive divider network. The electrode structure is designed so that a series of substantially linear changes in phase retardation between adjacent electrodes can be established that will yield the parabolic rphase profile required to generate a focusing optic. The resistive divider network comprises a resistive bridge having a desired resistance that connects adjacent electrode rings or a ring and disk such as shown in . Depending on the design of the device the resistive divider or bridge can have a resistance generally from about 100 to about 2 000 ohms and preferably from about 800 to about 1 200 ohms. Resistive bridge comprises a resistance path comprising an electrically conductive material preferably bordered by a non conductive material or an area free from conductive material that aids in creating the desired resistance between each adjacent electrode .

The conductive material of the electrode bridge can be any material as defined for the conductive electrode layer . The material of the conductive electrode layer can be different from the conductive material of the resistive bridge but preferably is the same material. In one embodiment indium tin oxide is the preferred conductive material of the resistive bridge. As an important benefit of the present invention the method utilized to create the desired electrode layer for example photolithography is utilized to create the pattern of each resistive bridge . Thus patterned electrode layer and resistive bridges are created utilizing photolithography in a single process step. Thus no additional materials or process steps are required to form the resistive network.

In addition if it is the case that the liquid crystal phase change with voltage is also linear than a continuously tunable lens can be fabricated with only two input connections one at the innermost ring i.e. disk and one connection at an outermost electrode ring thereby eliminating the need for multiple buss lines. This embodiment is especially useful when only a small portion of the available phase change of the liquid crystal device is utilized.

In an embodiment wherein the voltage vs. phase relation of the liquid crystal device is considered linear over a small portion of the total possible parabolic phase change it is preferable to connect each electrode by a fixed resistive bridge and then provide an input connection for several electrode rings evenly spaced on the lens. In one embodiment an input connection is connected every nelectrode ring wherein n is 2 or more. Therefore in one embodiment it is desirable to provide an input connection connected at the innermost ring or disk and provide further input connections based on the number of rings for example from about 10 to about 100 electrode rings and preferably from about 10 to about 20 electrode rings. For example in an embodiment where the substrate includes 100 ring electrodes wherein one of the ring electrodes is an innermost disk electrode electrodes and are provided with input connections. Thus in this embodiment it is only required that the phase vs. voltage relation for the liquid crystal material is linear over 1 10 of the range of the previous approach wherein no resistive bridges were utilized. Similarly in an embodiment wherein 20 input connections are employed linearity is only required over 1 20 of the full range or every fifth electrode. illustrates an input connection each connected to the first electrode and the tenth electrode of electrode layer .

The input connections to the desired electrodes can be placed on the side of the electrode closest to the substrate or the opposite side of the electrode away from the substrate. The input connections are preferably formed by depositing an insulating material such as silicon dioxide between the electrode layer and the input connection. Each input connection is connected to the appropriate electrode through a via in the insulator such as shown in . In an embodiment wherein an input connection is located on the side of an electrode away from the substrate the input connection can be fabricated by depositing a thin layer of insulator over the electrode layer and then growing an input connection line over the insulating layer for each input connection.

In an example embodiment a liquid crystal layer for example comprising liquid crystal 18349 available from Merck having a thickness of about 25 m will give an optical power of about 0.5 diopters for a lens diameter of approximately 1 cm. More optical power can be achieved by increasing the liquid crystal layer thickness but eventually non linearity in the fields will degrade the optical performance the switching relaxation time between the various powers will also increase with liquid crystal thickness. Additional optical power can also be achieved by stacking multiple electro optic devices .

An appropriate voltage is applied to the device namely the electrode layer through the input connections as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The unpatterned electrode layer serves as a ground. The voltage is applied to the device based on a number of factors including but not limited to the liquid crystal material utilized and the thickness of the liquid crystal material between electrodes. Various methods are known in the art for controlling the voltage applied to the electrode for example a circuit a processor or micro processor.

A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a tunable electro optic device that utilizes phase wrapping. The device has the advantage of achieving higher optical power through the use of phase resets.

In contrast to the phase wrapping method described in the Background the embodiment of the present invention does not require each electrode ring to have an individual output connection but at the same time allows for a phase wrapped lens that is tunable.

In this embodiment patterned electrodes are provided on both substrate surfaces on either side of the liquid crystal material and thus a fixed piston phase term can be added to each set of electrodes in one section of the blazed electrode structure. This allows for the phase change across each group of electrodes to be the same and then also to be phase matched with respect to the previous group.

One example of the approach of the embodiment of the invention including a tunable lens with phase wrapping is as follows.

As an example of the technique it is assured that a device is desired that is optically tunable over a range of 1.5 diopters in 0.25 diopter steps or less. To achieve this tunable electro optic lens a fine ring structure is fabricated that in this example has all electrodes in groups of 4 rings i.e. electrode ring n has the same voltage has ring n 4 . A counter electrode ring structure is present on the other substrate where each electrode ring of the counter electrode ring has a much wider area and covers one group of rings of the opposing electrode i.e. 4 fine rings generally in a direction substantially perpendicular or normal to the plane of the substrate. illustrates the design for the coarse counter electrode layer that provides the piston like phase change over several groups of 4 fine ring electrodes that are illustrated in . The wide rings m are grouped into 12 rings ring m has the same voltage as ring m 12 . Thus there are 16 input connections needed to electrically drive the lens 12 for the wide rings of the counter electrode and 4 for the fine rings of the first electrode. With this design one is able to select how many groups of fine electrodes are used to get to one wave of phase retardation realizing that the minimum number of fine rings or voltages per retardation wave for an accurate phase representation is 8. Therefore one can select to have 2 3 4 6 or 12 groups of 4 fine electrode rings per wave of phase retardation with 12 groups per 1 wave of retardation yielding the greatest efficiency but smallest optical power and 2 groups per wave yielding the least efficiency but greatest optical power.

For this example the range of the required change is 1.5 diopters so a variable lens that has a power range from 0.75 to 0.75 diopters is needed. By the choice of how the electrodes are grouped if the highest power of the lens needs to be 0.75 diopters then the power of the lens with 2 3 4 6 or 12 groups of electrodes will be 0.75 0.5 0.375 0.25 or 0.125 diopters. Because the device works with the opposite electrical polarity it will also generate the identical negative optical powers as well.

Thus this embodiment of phase wrapped electronic lens is tunable over 11 levels of optical power. Of course this power range can be offset by adding a fixed power lens. For example by combining the device in the example above with a 2.25 diopter conventional lens one can tune from 1.5 to 3.0 diopters in 11 steps. Alternatively by combining it with a 1.75 diopter conventional lens one can tune from 1.0 to 2.5 diopters.

To more clearly illustrate the voltages applied to the electrodes a LC device is needed where the phase retardation is a linear function of the voltage applied and rather than specify voltages one can say that each electrode has a voltage that yields particular phase retardation relative to the center electrode.

With that definition for the case of a negative lens the voltages applied to the four fine electrodes in each group are 

As a particular example consider tuning this lens to be 0.5 diopters j 3 . The voltage applied to the fine electrodes will correspond to a phase of 

Then counting from the center electrode and going out the relative phase at the location of each fine ring will be 

The voltages addressed to the fine electrodes and counter electrodes corresponding to each of the optical powers as illustrated above can be stored in a memory chip that communicates with a power supply and the lens. The chip is programmed to provide the required optical power on demand.

Tunable lens devices for example devices illustrated in the drawings of the present invention can be utilized in numerous different applications including but not limited to lenses for example glasses or spectacles cameras various displays telescopes zoom lenses wavefront correctors and equipment used to diagnose imperfections in the human eye. The tunable lenses of the invention can be utilized wherever conventional lenses and optics are utilized.

While in accordance with the patent statutes the best mode and preferred embodiment have been set forth the scope of the invention is not limited thereto but rather by the scope of the attached claims.
