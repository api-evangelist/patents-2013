The following description relates to one or more techniques to display a preview image showing an anticipated print result of a page in advance of an attempt at printing the page.

A technique has been known which is adapted to create a preview image based on document data in accordance with print settings configured on a print setting screen and to display the preview image in advance of printing of the document data.

In the meantime there may be a printer configured to restrict a printing operation based on a predetermined criterion. For instance there may be a printer configured to prohibit a printing operation in response to an accumulated number of printed sheets reaching the maximum number of printable sheets. However techniques known so far have not provided any suggestion regarding a preview image configured to be displayed in view of restrictions of a printing operation.

Aspects of the present invention are advantageous to present one or more improved techniques to display a preview image in view of restrictions of a printing operation.

According to aspects of the present invention a preview display device is provided which includes a display unit and a controller configured to determine whether a print requested page requested to be printed is permitted to be printed based on print restriction information and control the display unit to display a preview image showing a print result of the print requested page in advance of printing of the print requested page in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing the print requested page determined to be permitted to be printed from the preview image showing the print requested page determined to be not permitted to be printed.

According to aspects of the present invention further provided is a method configured to be implemented on a processor connected with a display unit the method including determining whether a print requested page requested to be printed is permitted to be printed based on print restriction information and controlling the display unit to display a preview image showing a print result of the print requested page in advance of printing of the print requested page in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing the print requested page determined to be permitted to be printed from the preview image showing the print requested page determined to be not permitted to be printed.

According to aspects of the present invention further provided is a non transitory computer readable medium storing computer readable instructions configured to when executed by a processor coupled to a display unit cause the processor to determine whether a print requested page requested to be printed is permitted to be printed based on print restriction information and control the display unit to display a preview image showing a print result of the print requested page in advance of printing of the print requested page in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing the print requested page determined to be permitted to be printed from the preview image showing the print requested page determined to be not permitted to be printed.

It is noted that various connections are set forth between elements in the following description. It is noted that these connections in general and unless specified otherwise may be direct or indirect and that this specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect. Aspects of the invention may be implemented on circuits such as application specific integrated circuits or in computer software as programs storable on computer readable media including but not limited to RAMs ROMs flash memories EEPROMs CD media DVD media temporary storage hard disk drives floppy drives permanent storage and the like.

Hereinafter a first embodiment according to aspects of the present invention will be described with reference to .

Initially referring to a configuration of a printing system will be described. The printing system includes a personal computer hereinafter which may be referred to as PC and a printer . The PC is communicably connected with the printer via a communication line such as a universal serial bus hereinafter which may be referred to as USB a local area network hereinafter which may be referred to as LAN and the Internet.

Subsequently referring to an electrical configuration of the PC will be described. The PC includes a CPU a ROM a RAM a display unit an operation unit a storage unit and a communication interface .

The CPU is configured to when executing programs stored in the ROM and the storage unit control each element of the PC . The ROM is configured to store data and programs executable by the CPU . The RAM is configured to be used as a main storage device when the CPU executes various kinds of processing.

The display unit includes a display device such as a liquid crystal display device and a display driving circuit for driving the display device. The operation unit includes input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse and hardware elements for connecting the input devices with the PC .

The storage unit includes non volatile memories such as a hard disk drive and a flash memory. The storage unit is configured to store various types of data and various programs which include an operating system hereinafter which may be referred to as OS an application program hereinafter which may be referred to as an application a printer driver for controlling the printer and a print preview program . The programs stored in the storage unit are executable by the CPU . It is noted that the CPU the ROM the RAM and the storage unit which work in cooperation with each other form a controller for controlling various operations of the PC .

The communication interface I F includes a hardware element for communicably connecting the PC with the printer . The communication interface may be configured to communicate with the printer via a communication cable such as a USB wireless communication such as Bluetooth trademark registered by BLUETOOTH SIG INC. or a communication network such as a LAN and the Internet. Further when configured to perform communication via the communication network the communication interface may be connected with the communication network in a wired manner or a wireless manner.

The printer is configured to form an image on a sheet such as a printing paper based on print data received from the PC in a predetermined printing method such as an electro photographical method and an inkjet method.

The printer is configured to accept print restrictions set therefor. The following descriptions will be provided about a restriction of the number of printable sheets and restrictions of printing conditions as examples of the print restrictions. For instance a restriction of the number of printable sheets may be applied by setting a maximum number an upper limit number of printable sheets for each individual user. In this case for instance the printer counts an accumulated number of printed sheets for each individual user. When the accumulated number of printed sheets reaches the maximum number of printable sheets set for a user the user is prohibited from performing a printing operation until the accumulated number of printed sheets is initialized reset to zero by an administrator of the printer . It is noted that the maximum number of printable sheets is not limited to being set for each individual user but may be set in an arbitrary unit e.g. for each individual printer or for each individual one of departments to which the users belong to. Further the accumulated number of printed sheets is not limited to being initialized by the administrator but may be automatically initialized every unit time e.g. at time intervals of one day .

Further for instance restrictions of printing conditions may be applied by setting printing conditions for permitting execution of a printing operation for each individual user. The printing conditions include various conditions such as high quality image printing low quality image printing color printing monochrome printing N in one printing and enlarged reduced printing. For example the high quality image printing the color printing and the enlarged printing generally result in high printing costs. Therefore by not permitting such printing conditions it is possible to reduce the printing cost. It is noted that printing conditions for permitting execution of a printing operation may be set in an arbitrary unit e.g. for each individual printer or for each individual one of departments to which the users belong to. Further the restrictions of printing conditions may be achieved by setting unallowable printing conditions instead of setting allowable printing conditions . In this case printing conditions other than the unallowable printing conditions are allowable. The following description will be provided under an assumption that a determination as to whether to permit the color printing is made for each individual user.

Suppose for instance that a user who is not permitted to employ the color printing selects the color printing on a below mentioned print setting screen see . In this case the printer prints only monochrome pages of the pages requested to be printed but does not print color pages of the requested pages. Alternatively when the user who is not permitted to employ the color printing selects the color printing the printer may be prohibited from printing all the requested pages including the monochrome pages.

In the printer stored are information indicating the maximum number of printable sheets and information indicating allowable printing conditions for permitting execution of a printing operation for each individual user. Hereinafter these pieces of information may be referred to as print restriction information.

Next referring to explanations will be provided about a print setting screen displayed by the printer driver and a print preview screen displayed by the print preview program . shows a printing screen displayed by the application as well as the print setting screen and the print preview screen .

By selecting the printer as an intended printer and clicking a properties button on the printing screen the user is allowed to issues an instruction to cause the printer driver to display the print setting screen . Upon receipt of the instruction to display the print setting screen the printer driver causes the display unit to display the print setting screen . As shown in on the print setting screen the user is allowed to configure setting values for printing conditions such as an orientation of a printing sheet the number of print copies and color printing monochrome printing . Furthermore the print setting screen may be configured to accept setting values set thereon for other printing conditions such as high quality image printing low quality image printing N in one printing and enlarged reduced printing.

When the user clicks an OK button on the print setting screen the printer driver updates default setting values for the printing conditions stored on the RAM with setting values configured on the print setting screen and closes the print setting screen . Meanwhile when a cancel button is clicked the printer driver cancels the setting values configured on the print setting screen and closes the print setting screen .

When the user clicks a print button on the printing screen the application issues a request for printing of pages to the printer driver via the OS . The request includes page data of the pages to be printed. Upon receipt of the request from the application the printer driver creates print data for each of the pages requested to be printed and creates from the created print data a preview image showing an anticipated print result in advance of an attempt at printing the corresponding page. Then the printer driver lunches the print preview program.

The print preview program launched by the printer driver causes the display unit to display the print preview screen and to display the preview image created by the printer driver on the print preview screen . The print preview screen as exemplified in shows a list of page numbers of the pages requested to be printed in a left side area on the print preview screen . When the user clicks one of the page numbers a preview image of the page corresponding to the clicked page number is displayed in a right side area on the print preview screen .

On the print preview screen displayed are a print button and a cancel button . When the print button is clicked the print preview program transmits the print data created by the printer driver to the printer and causes the printer to perform a printing operation. When the cancel button is clicked the print preview program cancels the print data and terminates the process.

As will be described in detail in response to receipt of the request for printing of the pages the printer driver acquires user identification information and requires print restriction information corresponding to the acquired user identification information. Then with respect to each individual page of the requested pages the print preview program determines whether the printer permits printing of the page based on the print restriction information acquired by the printer driver . Further the print preview program causes the print preview screen to display a preview image of the page in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing a printable page permitted to be printed by the printer from the preview image showing an unprintable page not permitted to be printed.

More specifically in the first embodiment the print preview program causes the print preview screen to display a preview image of a printable page and a preview image of an unprintable page in respective different display modes. For instance exemplifies the print preview screen displaying the preview image of a printable page permitted to be printed. As shown in the preview image and the page number of the printable page permitted to be printed are displayed without being shown in a gray out state.

On the contrary exemplifies a case where the print preview screen displays a preview image of an unprintable page not permitted to be printed more specifically a preview image of Page 4 . As shown in the preview image and the page number of the unprintable page not permitted to be printed are displayed in a gray out state.

Subsequently explanations will be provided about a process by the printer driver and a process by the print preview program in response to the application issuing the request for printing of the pages to be printed with reference to flowcharts.

Referring to an explanation will be provided about a process by the printer driver in response to the request for page printing from the application . The process is launched when the application issues the request for page printing to the printer driver . Hereinafter the pages requested by the application to be printed may be referred to as the pages to be printed. Further the following description will be provided under an assumption that the user sets the color printing on the print setting screen .

In S the printer driver more specifically the CPU executing the printer driver creates print data for each of the pages to be printed based on the printing conditions stored in the RAM . For instance when the color printing is set as a printing condition the printer driver creates color print data for color pages and creates monochrome print data for monochrome pages. Meanwhile when the monochrome printing is set as a printing condition the printer driver creates monochrome print data for each of the pages to be printed regardless of whether the page is a color page or a monochrome page. In S the printer driver creates a preview image showing an anticipated print result in advance of an attempt at performing a printing operation for each piece of the print data created in S. In this case the preview images are created from the print data created in S. Alternatively the preview images may be created directly from the page data of the pages to be printed.

In S by issuing a request for user identification information of a user who is currently logging in to the OS using an application programming interface API or by reading out the user identification information previously set by the user in the printer driver the printer driver acquires the user identification information. Further the printer driver acquires print restriction information corresponding to the acquired user identification information. In S the printer driver launches the print preview program and terminates the process shown in .

Subsequently with respect to processes by the print preview program launched by the printer driver in S explanations will be provided separately about a process when the print preview program is launched and a process when the print button is clicked on the print preview screen .

In S the print preview program more specifically the CPU executing the print preview program sets the number of print requested sheets N to zero as an initial value. The number of print requested sheets N is a parameter counter configured to count the number of sheets to be printed based on the print data created in accordance with the request for page printing. In S the print preview program selects a single piece of print data from among the print data created by the printer driver for each of the pages to be printed. The selection is made in an order of the page numbers from a piece of print data of the first page.

In S the print preview program determines whether the maximum number of printable sheets is set for the print requesting user who has issued the request for page printing based on the print restriction information acquired in S. It is noted that the acquisition of the print restriction information from the printer may be carried out not by the printer driver but by the print preview program . When determining that the maximum number of printable sheets is set for the print requesting user S Yes the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the maximum number of printable sheets is not set for the print requesting user S No the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program determines whether the number of print requested sheets N is equal to or more than a remaining number of printable sheets. The remaining number of printable sheets is the number of sheets resulting from subtracting the accumulated number of printed sheets at a time immediately before the present process is launched from the maximum number of printable sheets for the print requesting user. Namely during the execution of the process the remaining number of printable sheets is constant. The accumulated number of printed sheets is counted for each individual user by the printer . The printer driver acquires from the printer the accumulated number of printed sheet for the print requesting user in S. In this regard instead the print preview program may acquire from the printer the accumulated number of printed sheet for the print requesting user. When determining that the number of print requested sheets N is equal to or more than the remaining number of printable sheets S Yes the print preview program goes to S determining that it is not permitted to print the page selected in S or the subsequent pages. Meanwhile when determining that the number of print requested sheets N is less than the remaining number of printable sheets S No the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program stores information for displaying all preview images of the single piece of print data selected in S and the subsequent pieces of print data in a gray out state. Thereby when a page number is selected on the print preview screen from among page numbers corresponding to the print data selected in S and the subsequent pieces of print data a preview image of the selected page number is displayed in a gray out state. In S the print preview program determines whether the print requesting user is permitted to employ the color printing based on the print restriction information. When determining that the print requesting user is not permitted to employ the color printing S No the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the print requesting user is permitted to employ the color printing S Yes the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program determines whether the print data selected in S is data expressing a color page. For instance the determination in S may be made by examining whether pixels constituting the print data selected in S contain a pixel expressing a chromatic color. When determining that the print data selected in S is data expressing a color page S Yes the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the print data selected in S is not data expressing a color page S No the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program stores information for displaying the preview image of the print data selected in S in a gray out state. Thereby when the page number corresponding to the print data selected in S is selected on the print preview screen the preview image of the selected page number is displayed in a gray out state.

In S the print preview program determines whether the print data selected in S is data expressing a white page. For instance the determination in S may be made by examining whether a ratio of pixels expressing white color to all the pixels constituting the print data selected in S is equal to or more than a predetermined ratio. The pixels expressing white color may include pixels having CMYK densities equal to or close to 0 0 0 0 in the case where the print data is expressed by a CMYK color space. Further when the print data is expressed by an RGB color space the determination as to whether a target pixel contained in the print data is a pixel expressing white color may be made based on an RGB density of the target pixel. When determining that the print data selected in S is not data expressing a white page S No the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the print data selected in S is data expressing a white page S Yes the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program stores information for displaying the preview image of the print data selected in S without being shown in a gray out state. Thereby when the page number corresponding to the print data selected in S is selected on the print preview screen the preview image of the selected page number is displayed without being shown in a gray out state. In S the print preview program increments the print requested sheet number N by one. In S the print preview program determines whether there is another piece of print data. When determining that there is not another piece of print data S No the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that there is another piece of print data S Yes the print preview program goes back to S.

In S the print preview program displays the print preview screen as shown in . On the print preview screen a preview image of the first page is displayed as a default display in a state where the first page is selected. When information for displaying the preview image of the first page in a gray out state is stored in S or S the preview image of the first page is displayed in a gray out state. Meanwhile when information for displaying the preview image of the first page without being shown in a gray out state is stored in S or S the preview image of the first page is displayed as originally created by the printer driver . It is noted that the display mode for displaying the print preview screen is not limited to the mode shown in but may be a mode in which preview images of all the pages to be printed are reduced and arranged side by side.

The above descriptions have been provided under the assumption that the user has set the color printing on the print setting screen . However when the user has set the monochrome printing the print preview program may be configured to advance to S without executing S or S for the following reason. That is when the monochrome printing is set monochrome print data is created for any of the pages to be printed even though the page is originally a color page. Namely it is always determined in S that the print data selected in S is not data expressing a color page S No .

Next an explanation will be provided about a process to be performed when the print button is clicked on the print preview screen . When the print button is clicked the print preview program terminates the displaying of the print preview screen . Further the print preview program transmits all pieces of print data created in S to the printer and causes the printer to perform a printing operation. In this respect however when the pages to be printed include an unprintable page not permitted to be printed print data of the unprintable page is not allowed to be printed by the printer . In this case the printer performs a printing operation based on only print data of printable pages permitted to be printed.

As described above according to the print preview program of the first embodiment a preview image is displayed on the print preview screen in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing a printable page permitted to be printed by the printer from the preview image showing an unprintable page not permitted to be printed. Thus it is possible to display the preview image in view of the print restrictions of the printer . Thereby the user is allowed to easily discriminate printable pages from unprintable pages in advance of the printing operation.

Further according to the print preview program of the first embodiment when the accumulated number of printed sheets reaches the maximum number of printable sheets the user is allowed to easily discriminate printable pages from unprintable pages in advance of the printing operation.

Further according to the print preview program of the first embodiment when a printing condition for restricting the printing operation is set the user is allowed to easily discriminate printable pages from unprintable pages in advance of the printing operation.

Further according to the print preview program of the first embodiment even though a target page is a printable page permitted to be printed when the target page is a white page a preview image of the target page is displayed in the same display mode as a preview image of an unprintable page. Therefore the user is allowed to easily realize that the white page is not permitted to be printed in advance of the printing operation.

Subsequently a second embodiment will be described with reference to . The print preview program of the second embodiment displays a print preview screen as shown in instead of the print preview screen of the first embodiment. On the print preview screen a confirmation box is displayed on a left side of each page number. Each confirmation box is configured to be checked i.e. put into a state where a check mark is placed therein when selected by the user. According to the print preview program of the second embodiment when the print button is clicked only print data of checked pages i.e. pages of which the confirmation boxes thereof are checked is transmitted to the printer . Then the printer is caused to perform a printing operation based on the print data of the checked pages.

Suppose for instance that the number of the print requested pages is six and the remaining number of printable sheets is three. In this case when displaying the print preview screen the print preview program sets ON checked the confirmation boxes of the first to third pages permitted to be printed and sets OFF unchecked the confirmation boxes of the fourth to sixth pages as initial states of the confirmation boxes

Namely in the second embodiment by setting ON the printable pages permitted to be printed and setting OFF the unprintable pages not permitted to be printed the print preview program displays a preview image in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing a printable page from the preview image showing an unprintable page.

In this respect however even though a target page is a printable page permitted to be printed when the target page is a white page the print preview program sets OFF an initial state of the confirmation box of the target page.

In the above example suppose for instance that the user wishes to print the sixth page instead of the first page. Further suppose for instance that the user clicks sets ON the confirmation box of the sixth page before setting OFF the confirmation box of the first page. When a confirmation box currently set OFF is clicked and immediately set ON the confirmation box of an unprintable page not permitted to be printed by the printer might be set ON.

In view of the above problem the print preview program is configured to when a confirmation box currently set OFF is clicked determine whether a page corresponding to the clicked confirmation box is a printable page based on the print restriction information. Then when determining that the page corresponding to the clicked confirmation box is a printable page the print preview program sets ON the clicked confirmation box . Meanwhile when determining that the page corresponding to the clicked confirmation box is an unprintable page the print preview program does not set ON the clicked confirmation box

For instance in the aforementioned example when the confirmation box of the sixth page is set ON the accumulated number of printed sheets exceeds the maximum number of printable sheets set for the user. Therefore the confirmation box of the sixth page is left OFF. In order to print the sixth page in the aforementioned example the user may first set OFF the confirmation box of the first page. When the confirmation box of the first page is set OFF the number of sheets pages to be printed is reduced from three to two and one more page is allowed to be printed. Therefore after the confirmation box of the first page is set OFF it is possible to set ON the confirmation box of the sixth page.

Further suppose as another example that the print requesting user is not permitted to employ the color printing. Additionally suppose that the first to third pages are monochrome pages and the fourth to sixth pages are color pages. In this case even though the confirmation box of the sixth page is clicked after the confirmation box of the first page is set OFF the confirmation box of the sixth page is left OFF since the sixth page is a color page. Namely in this case it is possible to switch only the confirmation boxes of the first to third pages between the ON state and the OFF state.

Subsequently with respect to processes by the print preview program explanations will be provided separately about a process when the print preview program is launched and a process when an unchecked confirmation box i.e. a confirmation box in the OFF state is clicked on the print preview screen .

Referring to an explanation will be provided about a process to be performed when the print preview program is launched in the second embodiment. In the following description operations by the print preview program in the second embodiment that are substantially identical to the corresponding operations by the print preview program in the first embodiment will be provided with the same reference characters as those in the first embodiment. Further explanations of such operations will be omitted. In the second embodiment the print preview program is configured to execute S S and S see instead of S S and S in the first embodiment.

In S the print preview program more specifically the CPU executing the print preview program sets OFF all the confirmation boxes of the single piece of print data selected in S and the subsequent pieces of print data. In S the print preview program sets OFF the confirmation box of the single piece of print data selected in S.

In S the print preview program sets ON the confirmation box of the single piece of print data selected in S.

Next referring to an explanation will be provided about a process to be performed when an unchecked confirmation box a confirmation box in the OFF state is clicked on the print preview screen .

In S the print preview program more specifically the CPU executing the print preview program sets a parameter M to the number of confirmation boxes currently in the ON state as an initial value of the parameter. The parameter M indicates the number of confirmation boxes currently in the ON state. It is noted that the confirmation box clicked this time is not included in the confirmation boxes currently in the ON state. In S the print preview program determines whether the maximum number of printable sheets is set for the print requesting user who has issued the request for page printing based on the print restriction information. When determining that the maximum number of printable sheets is set for the print requesting user S Yes the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the maximum number of printable sheets is not set for the print requesting user S No the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program determines whether the parameter M indicating the number of confirmation boxes currently in the ON state is equal to the remaining number of printable sheets. When determining that the parameter M is equal to the remaining number of printable sheets S Yes the print preview program goes to S determining that it is not possible to perform any further printing operation and determining not to set ON the clicked confirmation box . Meanwhile when determining that the parameter M is less than the remaining number of printable sheets S No the print preview program goes to S.

In S the print preview program causes the display unit to display a warning see notifying that it is not possible to select the page corresponding to the clicked confirmation box since the accumulated number of printed sheets exceeds the maximum number of printable sheets. In S the print preview program determines whether the print requesting user is permitted to employ the color printing based on the print restriction information. When determining that the print requesting user is permitted to employ the color printing S Yes the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the print requesting user is not permitted to employ the color printing S No the print preview program goes to S. In S the print preview program sets ON the clicked confirmation box

In S the print preview program determines whether print data corresponding to the clicked confirmation box is of a color page. When determining that the print data corresponding to the clicked confirmation box is not of a color page S No the print preview program goes to S. Meanwhile when determining that the print data corresponding to the clicked confirmation box is of a color page S Yes the print preview program goes to S. In S the print preview program causes the display unit to display a warning see notifying that it is not possible to select the page corresponding to the clicked confirmation box since the print requesting user is not permitted to employ the color printing.

As described above according to the print preview program of the second embodiment a preview image is displayed in a manner to distinguish the preview image showing a printable page permitted to be printed by the printer from the preview image showing an unprintable page not permitted to be printed. Thus it is possible to display a preview image in view of the print restrictions of the printer . Thereby the user is allowed to easily discriminate printable pages from unprintable pages in advance of the printing operation.

Further according to the print preview program of the second embodiment a preview image of a printable page permitted to be printed is displayed in a state selected as a preview image of a page to be printed. Therefore it is possible to reduce a burden placed on the user who is about to select on the print preview screen a preview image of a page to be printed.

Further according to the print preview program of the second embodiment a preview image of a white page even though the page is a printable page permitted to be printed is displayed in a state not selected as a preview image of a page to be printed. Therefore it is possible to reduce wasteful printing operations such as printing of a white page.

Further according to the print preview program of the second embodiment when clicking a confirmation box of an unprintable page on the print preview screen the user is allowed to realize that the page corresponding to the displayed preview image is not permitted to be printed.

Hereinabove the embodiments according to aspects of the present invention have been described. The present invention can be practiced by employing conventional materials methodology and equipment. Accordingly the details of such materials equipment and methodology are not set forth herein in detail. In the previous descriptions numerous specific details are set forth such as specific materials structures chemicals processes etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However it should be recognized that the present invention can be practiced without reapportioning to the details specifically set forth. In other instances well known processing structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.

Only exemplary embodiments of the present invention and but a few examples of their versatility are shown and described in the present disclosure. It is to be understood that the present invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein. For example the following modifications are possible. It is noted that in the following modifications explanations of the same configurations as exemplified in the aforementioned embodiments will be omitted.

In the aforementioned embodiments as the print restriction information exemplified are the maximum number of printable sheets and the printing conditions for permitting execution of a printing operation. Nonetheless the print restriction information may include information indicating a print permitted remaining amount that is such a remaining amount of a consumable supply for printing as to permit the printer to perform a printing operation. As the consumable supply used for printing for instance exemplified are sheets and coloring agent such as toner and ink. In this case in response to a print request the printer driver acquires from the printer the remaining amount of the consumable supply. Then with respect to the print data created for each page in S the print preview program estimates an amount of the consumable supply used for other pieces of print data to be printed prior to printing of a target piece of print data. Further the print preview program determines an amount resulting from subtracting the estimated amount from the acquired amount as a remaining amount of the consumable supply immediately before printing of the target piece of print data. Then when the determined remaining amount is equal to or more than a previously set print permitted remaining amount the print preview program determines that the target piece of print data is permitted to be printed by the printer . Meanwhile when the determined remaining amount is less than the previously set print permitted remaining amount the print preview program determines that the target piece of print data is not permitted to be printed by the printer . The print permitted remaining amount may be applied in combination with the maximum number of printable sheets. Alternatively the print permitted remaining amount may be applied in combination with the printing conditions for permitting execution of a printing operation or in combination with the maximum number of printable sheets and the printing conditions for permitting execution of a printing operation.

In the aforementioned first embodiment the gray out state is exemplified as a display mode for displaying a preview image of an unprintable page not permitted to be printed. However the display mode for displaying a preview image of an unprintable page not permitted to be printed is not limited to the gray out state.
