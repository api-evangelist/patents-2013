title: Methods and devices for providing a self-stretching policer
abstract: An example method for providing a self-stretching policer in a Quality of Service (QoS) community including a root node and one or more agent nodes can include maintaining and enforcing a policer policy in the root node. The policer policy can include at least one packet classification rule and corresponding police action, and the policer policy can be enforced by taking the corresponding police action if a traffic flow violates the packet classification rule. The method can include collecting policer statistics and determining if the traffic flow violates the packet classification rule by greater than a predetermined threshold using the policer statistics. If the traffic flow violates the packet classification rule by greater than the predetermined threshold, the method can include transmitting the policer policy to one or more of the agent nodes.
