The present application claims priority to and incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese Patent Application No. 2013 207562 filed in Japan on Oct. 2 2013.

Known is a technique for confirming the safety of a user using a device that is communicable with a base station. For example in such a technique the safety of the user is confirmed by transmitting the present location from a cellular telephone terminal owned by the user to a predetermined destination.

However according to the above described related art the safety of the user is not necessarily confirmed. Specifically for example in an area dotted with base stations such as a mountainous area there is a region outside a communication range in which radio waves emitted from the base stations do not reach the cellular telephone terminal and communication is disabled. Therefore there is a case in which the present location cannot be transmitted from the cellular telephone terminal to the predetermined destination. Accordingly in the above described related art the safety of the user is not necessarily confirmed.

It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology.

The above and other objects features advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Hereinafter modes hereinafter referred to as embodiments for implementing a distribution device a distribution method and a terminal device according to the present application will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiments do not limit the distribution device the distribution method and the terminal device according to the present application. The same reference numerals are attached to the same parts throughout the embodiments and redundant description thereof is not repeated.

First using an example of a distribution process according to an embodiment will be described. is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of a distribution process by a distribution system according to the embodiment. In the example of the distribution process is performed to distribute an alert to a terminal device by a distribution device .

The distribution process is described here for a case in which a user who owns a terminal device is climbing a mountain. In the example of the user is scheduled to arrive a scheduled path RT. The path starts from a start S in a coverage region A in which the terminal device is communicable and reaches a goal G by way of an out of coverage region in which the terminal device is not communicable a coverage region A and a coverage region A.

First the user operates the terminal device before starting mountain climbing to launch a transmission application that transmits location information to the distribution device at a predetermined point. The terminal device accepts setting of the scheduled path RT from the user. Then the terminal device transmits the accepted scheduled path RT to the distribution device .

The distribution device accepts the set scheduled path RT from the terminal device . The distribution device extracts starting points SP and SP and ending points EP and EP from the accepted scheduled path RT. The starting point means a point at which a coverage region is switched to an out of coverage region along the scheduled path. The ending point means a point at which an out of coverage region is switched to a coverage region.

Specifically as illustrated in the distribution device extracts the starting point SP at which the coverage region A is switched to the out of coverage region and the starting point SP at which the coverage region A is switched to the out of coverage region. The distribution device also extracts the ending point EP at which the out of coverage region is switched to the coverage region A and the ending point EP at which the out of coverage region is switched to the coverage region A. Similarly to the distribution device the terminal device extracts the starting points SP and SP and the ending points EP and EP from the scheduled path RT.

The terminal device and the distribution device perform the processing described above before the user starts to climb the mountain. Then the terminal device and the distribution device perform the processing described below after the user starts to climb the mountain.

Upon arriving at the starting point SP the terminal device transmits the location information of the starting point SP which is the present location to the distribution device . Upon receiving the location information of the starting point SP from the terminal device the distribution device calculates an expected time needed for the user to arrive from the starting point SP to the ending point EP both indicated in the received location information. For example the distribution device calculates the expected time by dividing the distance between the starting point SP and the ending point EP by the walking speed of a general user.

After that upon arriving at the ending point EP the terminal device transmits the location information of the ending point EP which is the present location to the distribution device . If the location information of the ending point EP is not received within the calculated expected time the distribution device distributes an alert indicating that the user has lost his her way to the terminal device that is a predetermined distribution destination registered in advance. Accordingly information indicating that the user has lost his her way is displayed on the terminal device .

Similarly the terminal device and the distribution device repeatedly perform the processing described above until the user arrives at the goal G. Specifically upon arriving at the starting point SP the terminal device transmits the location information of the starting point SP to the distribution device . Upon receiving the location information of the starting point SP from the terminal device the distribution device calculates an expected time needed for the user to arrive from the starting point SP to the ending point EP both indicated in the received location information.

After that upon arriving at the ending point EP the terminal device transmits the location information of the ending point EP to the distribution device . If the location information of the ending point EP is not received within the calculated expected time the distribution device distributes the alert to the terminal device .

As described above if the location information of an ending point is not received within an expected time the distribution device according to the embodiment distributes the alert to the terminal device so that it is possible to find at an early stage that the user has lost his her way. Accordingly the owner of the terminal device can confirm the safety of the user even when the terminal device is in an out of coverage region.

The distribution device according to the embodiment described above may be embodied in various different forms other than the above embodiment. Other embodiments of the distribution device will be described hereinafter.

In the above embodiment the expected time is calculated by dividing the distance between a starting point and the corresponding ending point by the walking speed of the user. Alternatively the distribution device described above may calculate the expected time based on the environment of the scheduled path RT or various pieces of information about the characteristics of the user.

Specifically the calculation unit calculates the expected time with correction according to the environment of the scheduled path from the starting point to the ending point. The distribution device is assumed to store therein information about the temperature humidity wind speed wind direction weather obliquity and a road surface of the scheduled path. In this case for example if the temperature and the humidity of the scheduled path are higher than predetermined threshold values the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer. This is because it is considered that a higher temperature and humidity lead to a larger physical consumption of a general user. For example if the weather at the path is raining the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer. This is because it is considered that the road surface is slippery when it is raining and a general user takes more time to walk on the surface. For example if the direction of the wind is opposing and the wind speed is higher than the predetermined threshold value the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer. This is because it is considered that a strong opposing wind lowers the walking speed of a general user.

For example if the obliquity of the scheduled path is large the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer. This is because it is considered that a larger obliquity of the road surface lowers the walking speed and leads to a larger physical consumption of a general user. For example if a large percentage of the road surface of the scheduled path is covered with rocks and screen for example which are difficult to walk over as compared to dirt the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer.

As described above the distribution device calculates the expected time with correction according to the environment of the scheduled path so that the distribution device can calculate the expected time with high accuracy according to the environment of the scheduled path. In this manner the distribution device can distribute an alert to the terminal device at a timing according to the environment of the scheduled path.

In another example the calculation unit calculates the expected time with correction according to the characteristics of the user. Specifically the calculation unit analyzes the characteristics of the user based on the past climbing history of the user and calculates the expected time with correction according to the analyzed characteristics of the user. The distribution device is assumed to hold the past climbing history of each user.

For example if it is found from the past climbing history of the user that the walking speed of the user tends to be lower at an uphill road the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer at an uphill path. For example if the walking speed of the user tends to be higher at a downhill road the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be shorter at a downhill path. For example if the walking speed of the user tends to be lower when the obliquity is larger than a predetermined value the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer for a path where the obliquity is larger than the predetermined value.

For example if the walking speed of the user tends to be lower when the user walks for a predetermined time or more the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer after the predetermined walking time of the user has elapsed.

In another example the calculation unit calculates the expected time with correction according to the belongings of the user. For example the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer with heavier belongings. This is because it is considered that heavier belongings lower the walking speed of a general user. For example the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer with larger belongings. This is because it is considered that larger belongings make walking difficult and thus lower the walking speed of a general user. For example if the walking speed of the user tends to be lower when the weight of the belongings is a predetermined value or more the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer when the weight of the belongings of the user is the predetermined value or more.

For example if a trekking pole is included in the belongings of the user the calculation unit calculates the expected time with a smaller positive correction amount due to the obliquity. This is because it is considered that the deceleration of the walking speed of a general user on the road surface of which obliquity is high may be reduced when the user uses the trekking pole. For example the distribution device acquires the information about the belongings of the user by causing the user to input information about the belongings from the terminal device .

In another example the calculation unit calculates the expected time with correction according to a time period in which the user walks. For example the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer in a time period from sunset to sunrise. This is because it is considered that the walking speed of a general user is decelerated when the sun goes down and visibility becomes poor.

In another example the calculation unit calculates the expected time with correction according to a track record of another user who has walked on the same scheduled path. For example if another user takes time longer than the expected time to arrive to the ending point the calculation unit calculates the expected time to be longer. This is because it is considered that an error generated in the walking speed of a general user is similar to that of another user if they walk on the same path.

As described above the distribution device calculates the expected time with correction according to the characteristics of the user so that the distribution device can calculate the expected time with high accuracy according to the characteristics of the user. In this manner the distribution device can distribute an alert to the terminal device at a timing according to the characteristics of the user.

The above embodiment describes an example in which the distribution device distributes an alert indicating that the user has lost his her way to the terminal device . Alternatively the distribution device described above may distribute various alerts to the terminal device .

Specifically the distribution device acquires various pieces of information from the terminal device . For example the distribution device acquires the amount of water held by the user from the terminal device . The distribution device calculates the amount of water to be consumed based on a required time from the start to the goal the temperature of the scheduled path and the humidity of the scheduled path. If the calculated amount of water to be consumed is larger than the held water amount the distribution device distributes an alert indicating shortage of water to the terminal device . Accordingly the alert is displayed on the terminal device .

As described above the distribution device distributes the alert to the terminal device so that the user can recognize that he she needs to get water.

The above processing is not limited to a case in which the distribution device calculates the amount of water to be consumed to distribute the alert. Alternatively if the terminal device calculates the amount of water to be consumed to be larger than the held water amount the alert may be displayed on the terminal device .

In the above embodiment the distribution device calculates the expected time. The distribution device described above may add a buffer accepted as an error to the expected time.

For example the distribution device calculates as the buffer the mean value of errors between the expected time and an actual required time in the past climbing history of the user. Then if the location information of the ending point is not received within a time obtained by adding the buffer to the expected time the distribution device distributes an alert to the terminal device .

The distribution device may correct the buffer according to various situations. For example if the user walks not along the scheduled path the distribution device searches for paths by which the user can return to the ending point from a point where the user has deviated from the scheduled path. Subsequently the distribution device calculates the longest time required for the user to arrive to the ending point along the searched paths. Then the distribution device calculates a difference between the calculated required time and the expected time as a buffer.

The distribution device may correct the buffer based on a change in the weather. For example the distribution device corrects the buffer to be longer if the weather changes from sunny to raining. For example the distribution device corrects the buffer to be longer if the temperature rises or falls abruptly. For example the distribution device corrects the buffer to be longer if the wind speed increases abruptly.

The distribution device may correct the buffer based on the track record of the user up to the starting point. For example if the walking speed of the user up to the starting point is higher than the mean value of the walking speed of the user the distribution device corrects the buffer to be shorter. For example if an elapsed time up to the starting point is shorter than expected the distribution device corrects the buffer to be shorter.

As described above the distribution device sets the buffer so that the distribution device can distribute an alert to the terminal device at a timing according to the current situation.

In the above embodiment the distribution device distributes an alert to the terminal device . Alternatively the distribution device may estimate the present position of the user. Specifically the distribution device estimates the present position of the user in an out of coverage region based on location information received by the receiving unit . For example the distribution device estimates the present position of the user by calculating a range in which the user can move from a position indicated by the received location information using the received location information time when the location information is received and the walking speed of the user.

If the location information of the ending point is not received within the expected time the distribution device distributes the estimated present position to the terminal device . Accordingly the owner of the terminal device can recognize the present position of the user so that the user can be discovered at an early stage.

Among the processes described in the above embodiments all or part of the processes described as automatically performed may be manually performed or all or part of the processes described as manually performed may be automatically performed using a known method. Information including the processing procedures the specific names and the various pieces of data or parameters described above or illustrated in the drawings may be optionally modified unless specifically described.

The components of the devices in the drawings are conceptually illustrated as functionalities and not necessary to be physically configured as illustrated in the drawings. That is a specific form of distribution or integration of the devices is not limited as illustrated in the drawings. Alternatively all or part of the devices may be functionally or physically distributed or integrated by arbitrary units according to various loads or use situations.

For example the radio wave information storage unit illustrated in may be held by a storage server and the like not by the distribution device . In this case the distribution device acquires information about radio waves in each region by accessing the storage server.

The distribution device may also be a calculation device that does not perform the distribution process of alerts and performs only a calculation process by the calculation unit . In this case the calculation device does not include at least the distribution unit . The distribution device including the distribution unit distributes alerts to the terminal device and the like.

For example the distribution device according to the above embodiment is implemented with a computer having a configuration as illustrated in . is a hardware configuration diagram illustrating an example of the computer that implements the function of the distribution device . The computer includes a CPU a RAM a read only memory ROM a hard disk drive HDD a communication interface I F an input output interface I F and a media interface I F .

The HDD stores therein a computer program executed by the CPU data used by the program and the like. The communication interface receives data from other equipment via the network N transmits the received data to the CPU and transmits data generated by the CPU to the other equipment via the network N.

The CPU controls an output device such as a display or a printer and an input device such as a keyboard or a mouse via the input output interface . The CPU acquires data from the input device via the input output interface . The CPU outputs generated data to the output device via the input output interface .

The media interface reads out a computer program or data stored in a recording medium and provides the program or the data to the CPU via the RAM . The CPU loads the program on the RAM from the recording medium via the media interface and executes the loaded program. For example the recording medium is an optical recording medium such as a digital versatile disc DVD and a phase change rewritable disk PD magneto optical recording medium such as a magneto optical disk MO a tape medium a magnetic recording medium and a semiconductor memory.

As described above the distribution device according to the embodiment includes the receiving unit the calculation unit and the distribution unit . The receiving unit receives location information from a terminal device owned by a user. When the receiving unit receives the location information of a starting point corresponding to an example of a first coverage region the calculation unit calculates an expected time within which the user arrives from the starting point by way of an out of coverage region in which communication cannot be performed to the corresponding ending point corresponding to an example of a second coverage region . If the location information of the ending point is not received from the terminal device within the expected time calculated by the calculation unit the distribution unit distributes an alert to the terminal device corresponding to an example of a predetermined distribution destination .

Accordingly the distribution device according to the embodiment can find at an early stage that the user has lost his her way. The owner of the terminal device can confirm the safety of the user even if the terminal device is in the out of coverage region.
