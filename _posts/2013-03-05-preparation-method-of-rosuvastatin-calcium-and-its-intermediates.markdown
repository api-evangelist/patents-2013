The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical chemistry in particular it relates to a preparation method of industrialized Rosuvastatin calcium Formula 1 wherein this calcium salt is used for the production of medicines that lowering LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in vivo. Furthermore the present invention relates to the intermediate crystal of this preparation method.

The formation of coronary artery disease that blocks blood circulation is closely related to the high levels of low density lipoprotein LDL in the blood Goodman and Gilman the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Page 879 9Edition 1996 . At present statins are the most effective drugs to reduce the concentration of LDL particles in the blood for patients having the risk for cardiovascular disease and therefore they are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia hyperlipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis etc. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol by their competitive inhibition to 3 hydroxyl 3 methyl glutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA reductase which results in reduction in the concentration of LDL particles in the blood and therefore reduces the possibility of suffering from coronary artery disease J. A. M. A. 1984 251 351 74 .

At present there is a number of statins with different structures available in the market including Lovastatin Simvastatin Pravastatin Fluvastatin Cerivastatin Atorvastatin Rosuvastatin and Pitavastatin etc. As a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Rosuvastatin calcium that is E 7 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methyl sulfonyl amino pyrimidyl 5 3R 5S 3 5 dihydroxy 6 heptenoic calcium is a so called super statin and compared with the first generation statins Rosuvastatin calcium is more effective in reducing the concentration of LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in vivo.

The commercial name of Rosuvastatin is CRESTOR and it should be taken orally once per day for the treatment of hyperlipoidemia Ann Rep Shionogi 1996 Direct communications Shionogi Feb. 8 1999 and Feb. 25 2000 . The daily dosage can be about 5 mg to about 40 mg. As for patients who do not require a considerable reduction of LDL C or patients who have predisposing factors of myonosus the recommended dosage is 5 mg as for common patients the recommended dosage is 10 mg as for patients who have hyper cholesterolemia and require a relatively high lipid target 190 mg dL the recommended dosage is 20 mg while for patients who do not show response at low dosage the recommended dosage is 40 mg. Rosuvastatin Calcium could also be used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia hyperproteinemia and atherosclerosis.

Synthesis and preparation of Rosuvastatin calcium was first disclosed in EP 0521471 wherein 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 N methyl N methyl sulfonyl amino 5 pyrimidinecarbaldehyde and Methyl 3R 3 tert butyldimethylsilyloxy 5 oxo 6 triphenylphosphoranylidene hexanate reacted and refluxed in the presence of acetonitrile subsequently silyl group underwent pyrolysis under the action of HF the obtained compound was reduced by NaBH as a result Rosuvastatin methyl ester was formed. Said ester was hydrolyzed by NaOH at room temperature in the presence of ethanol at the end of the reaction ethanol was removed ether was added and Rosuvastatin sodium was obtained. The obtained Rosuvastatin sodium was dissolved in water under a nitrogen atmosphere. CaClwas added to said water solution and precipitate of Rosuvastatin calcium was obtained. Wherein the method disclosed by said patent required column chromatography to be carried out which leads to increase in the complexity of process and production cost and therefore it is not conducive to the goal that reducing the medical cost to benefit more patients. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Vol. 5 NO. 2 pp 437 444 1997 also reported a synthetic method of Rosuvastatin calcium and said method was similar to that disclosed in EP0521471.

In EP0521471 even after column chromatography the obtained Rosuvastatin methyl ester was still syrupy this syrupy Rosuvastatin methyl ester was difficult to be purified by recrystallization its purity was lower than 97 and the content of diastereomer was above 5 . EP0521471 described the formation of Rosuvastatin sodium via hydrolysis in ethanol the obtained was beat with ethyl ether and crystallized Rosuvastatin sodium crystal powder was obtained however the formation of crystallized solid powder could only be realized in the laboratory by beating with ethyl and it was very difficult to scale up and be applied to large scale industrialized production furthermore the purification effect is not satisfactory due to the fact that diastereomer could not be separated by this process. EP0521471 disclosed the direct synthesis of Rosuvastatin calcium from Rosuvastatin sodium however these steps make the calcium salt difficult to be purified by recrystallization of Therefore the content of diastereomer in Rosuvastatin calcium obtained from Rosuvastatin methyl ester was around 0.8 several unknown impurities with concentration of above 0.1 were observed leading to difficulty in obtaining highly purified Rosuvastatin calcium and industrialization of Rosuvastatin calcium. Furthermore since the compound of Formula 3 presented in said EP0521471 and its improved method is taken in excess the utilization rate of high cost compound as shown in Formula 3 was lower than 50 and the production cost was strongly affected. Accordingly it is required to purify the compound as shown in Formula 4 or compound as shown in Formula 5 by column chromatography in current technique otherwise purification is very difficult to be realized via direct recrystallization. However the production cost of column chromatography is high and it is difficult to be applied in industrialization.

Improvements of synthetic process of EP0521471 have been reported. For instance international application WO03087112 improved phosphorus ylide reagent based on EP0521471 wherein diester glutarate was converted to monoester glutarate via biological enzyme method subsequently the resultant was converted into tert butyl ester containing silane blocking group as a result phosphorus ylide reagent different from that of EP0521471 in term of ester group was obtained WO03097614 disclosed improvement of synthetic process of main chain aldehyde N 4 4 fluorophenyl 5 formyl 6 1 methylethyl 2 pyrimidyl N methyl methansulfnamide however preparation method of final product was similar to EP0521471 international application WO2005023778 reported industrial preparation method of Rosuvastatin calcium in substance free of impurities however the synthesis method of Rosuvastatin ester was still similar to that disclosed in EP0521471 furthermore no detailed information was available on how to prepare highly purified Rosuvastatin ester international application WO2006091771 described improvement of synthesis of Rosuvastatin calcium wherein the major difference between WO2006091771 and EP0521471 was that ester group of side chain was replaced by ter butyl ester group but it was still very difficult to prepare highly purified Rosuvastatin according to the method of said application.

Besides preparation methods based on EP0521471 other synthetic methods which are different from the synthetic route of EP0521471 have been reported as well. For instance international application WO0049014 priority date Feb. 17 1999 reported a preparation method of Rosuvastatin calcium. Wherein tert butyl 2 4R 6S 6 formyl 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxan 4 yl acetate with two chiral centers was acted as side chain said chain reacted with phosphorus ylide reagent diphenyl 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 methyl methylsulfonyl amino pyrimidin 5 ylmethyl phosphine oxide and took place Wittig condensation subsequently acetonylidene blocking group was removed via acidic hydrolysis the obtained was saponified in the presence of alkali in this way sodium salt was converted to calcium salt.

EP1035127 disclosed a preparation method of intermediate of Rosuvastatin calcium wherein said intermediate can be used in the synthetic route of WO0049014 WO2004108691 described improvement of the formation of Rosuvastatin salt from Rosuvastatin calcium however said improvement was based on the preparation method of Rosuvastatin calcium reported in WO0049014 international application WO2005042522 reported a preparation method based on WO0049014 wherein the crystallized intermediate was separated and used for the synthesis of Rosuvastatin.

Furthermore improvements of the synthesis of Rosuvastatin calcium and its intermediate have been reported. For instance international application WO0042024 focused on some specific crystal forms of Rosuvastatin calcium international applications WO0154668 and WO0154669 disclosed a composition of Rosuvastatin calcium international application WO0160804 described crystalline salt of Rosuvastatin wherein said crystalline salt could be used for the purification of Rosuvastatin calcium international application WO0241895 disclosed the use of Rosuvastatin in the treatment of an indication that is heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia international application WO2004014872 described improvements of the salt formation of Rosuvastatin calcium wherein the improved processing conditions were used for preparation of highly filtrated solid international application WO2004103977 disclosed improvement of synthesis of pyrimidyl heterocycle intermediate of Rosuvastatin calcium international application WO2007000121 reported improvement on the preparation of Rosuvastatin calcium from Rosuvastatin lactone intermediate international application WO2006079611 described other crystal forms of Rosuvastatin calcium crystal form B and C Chinese patent application CN1872841 disclosed recrystallization method of compound as shown in Formula 5 wherein said compound was recrystallized under the action of mixed solvent containing methylbenzene and ethyl ether as a result intermediate with purity of higher than 98 was obtained however Rosuvastatin methyl ester still required to be purified by column chromatography the purity of said Rosuvastatin methyl ether was very low the content of diastereomer was 0.5 and the total content of other impurities was 1 international application WO2006136408 reported a preparation method of Rosuvastatin calcium and other Rosuvastatin salt from Rosuvastatin ester international application international application WO2007022488 reported crystalline intermediate of Rosuvastatin and a process for the preparation thereof.

Based on the process route and its related patent applications the present invention provides an improved preparation method of Rosuvastatin calcium after intensive study wherein asymmetric reduction of borane is optimized and crude Rosuvastatin ester with relatively low content of diastereomer is obtained.

Moreover due to the fact that the yield of esterification of Rosuvastatin acid is relatively high and the conversion rate is as high as 99.0 under optimized conditions although more steps are involved in the present invention the yield is still relatively high ester that is difficult to crystallize is converted to ester that is easy to crystallize at the same time diastereomer and other impurities are removed during said step by recrystallization and other simple steps.

The terms used in the present invention have common definitions to those skilled in the pharmacochemistry field. Alcohol ether crown ether ester ketone aromatic hydrocarbon alkane and halogen are frequently used chemicals and people skilled in the art should be able to choose said chemicals according to embodiments of the present invention. The preferred alcohol ether ester ketone aromatic hydrocarbon and alkane should contain less than 10 carbons. Furthermore the low alkyl group of present invention refers to C1 10 alkyl group i.e. the alkyl group containing 1 10 carbons and the C1 6 alkyl group is preferred.

Large scale industrial preparation of compound as shown in Formula 2 and compound as shown in Formula 3 could be realized based on EP0521471 and its related improvements however large scale preparation of compound as shown in Formula 4 and compound as shown in Formula 2 is still difficult. Preparation of compound as shown in Formula 4 based on current techniques requires a relatively large amount of expensive compound as shown in Formula 3 the price of compound as shown in Formula 3 is 5 times higher than that of compound as shown in Formula 2 the molar ratio between compound as shown in Formula 3 and compound as shown in Formula 2 is 1.5 1 the formed compound as shown in Formula 4 has to be purified via column chromatography or the formed compound as shown in Formula 5 has to be purified via column chromatography otherwise syrupy material that is difficult to crystallize will be obtained and therefore the yield is relatively low taking compound as shown in Formula 2 as an example the yield of crude product obtained after column chromatography is 71.3 the utilization rate of compound as shown in Formula 3 is lower than 50 and the production cost is increased. Wherein without the application of column chromatography the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide is relatively difficult to be removed and the removal rate is generally lower than 60 .

In order to realize the large scale industrial production of Rosuvastatin calcium reaction of step 1 is optimized in the present invention wherein the ratio of compound as shown in Formula 3 is lowered as a result the reaction efficiency is not affected and the utilization rate of compound as shown in Formula 3 is improved. When an excess amount of compound as shown in Formula 3 is present compound as shown in Formula 2 is difficult to fully convert after the completion of the reaction of step 1 . Due to the presence of an excess amount of compound as shown in Formula 3 the introduced impurities strongly influence the crystallization of compound as shown in Formula 2 and therefore purification means that are difficult to be used in industrialization such as column chromatography have to be applied.

Furthermore as the melting point of compound as shown in Formula 3 is relatively low it is difficult to crystallize at lower purity therefore the removal of triphenylphosphine oxide from compound as shown in Formula 4 via recrystallization is strongly influenced. When the molar ratio between compound as shown in Formula 2 and compound as shown in Formula 3 is 0.9 1.2 1 preferred ratio is 1 1 almost no compound as shown in Formula 3 is left after the completion of the reaction of step 1 in this way the maximum utilization of compound as shown in Formula 3 is achieved. Even when a small amount of compound as shown in Formula 2 remains the influence of compound as shown in Formula 2 on the crystallization of compound as shown in Formula 5 is insignificant for its melting point is relatively high and it is easy to crystallize accordingly compound as shown in Formula 5 could be easily crystallized without the application of column chromatography. Therefore the impurity removal rate of said step is high wherein the removal rate of triphenylphosphine oxide is higher than 80 .

The inventors have surprisingly found that the amount of solvent influences the reaction rate and quality of said step 1 when the ratio between said solvent and compound as shown in Formula 3 is 0.1 5 mL g the preferred ratio is 0.3 2.0 and the most preferred ratio is 0.5 mL g the reaction rate is increased the reaction time is shortened and the control of impurity is more efficient when the ratio between said solvent and compound as shown in Formula 3 is 5 20 the reaction rate is lower and the amount of impurity increases.

Compound as shown in Formula 4 and compound as shown in Formula 5 need not to be purified via column chromatography and compound as shown in Formula 5 could be directly purified via recrystallization with the solvent. Highly purified compound as shown in Formula 5 facilitates the control of follow up reaction the quality of Rosuvastatin calcium impurity control and the overall yield. Compound as shown in Formula 5 could crystallize in several solvents and said solvent can be selected from the group consisting of alcohol ether ester ketone aromatic hydrocarbon alkane and mixture thereof the preferred solvent is ethyl ether or a mixture containing acetone and isopropyl ether. Wherein it could be multi recrystallization and the solvent used in each recrystallization is different for instance ethyl ether is used as solvent for the first recrystallization and a mixture containing acetone and isopropyl ether is used for the second recrystallization to further refine.

According to EP0521471 and its related improvements oily Rosuvastatin methyl ester is obtained via reduction of 3R 6E 7 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 1 methylethyl 2 methyl methyl sulfonyl amino 5 pyrimidyl 3 hydroxyl 5 oxo 6 methyl heptenoate and therefore the obtained is difficult to directly recrystallize. According to said patent even after the purification of Rosuvastatin methyl ester by column chromatography the quality of obtained Rosuvastatin calcium is relatively poor the content of diastereomer is generally greater than 0.5 and the total content of other impurities is higher than 1.5 . As for asymmetric reduction via sodium borohydride complexing with methoxydiethylborane although the selectivity is high generally greater than 98 2 the formation of diastereomer during reduction is still unavoidable and the content of diastereomer is between 0.5 2.0 therefore in order to obtain a relatively high diastereomeric excess de the obtained has to be purified via recrystallization.

The inventors have found that almost all Rosuvastatin esters can crystallize however the properties of these esters especially their crystallization are considerably different wherein Rosuvastatin methyl ester is the most difficult one to crystallize. Generally speaking when the purity of Rosuvastatin methyl ester is lower than 80 it is almost impossible to crystallize when the purity of Rosuvastatin methyl ester is lower than 95 the crystallization is relatively slow and an inoculating seed has to be added to induce or a relatively long stirring time is necessary if the purity is high crystallization in several different solvents is also possible on the contrary the crystallization properties of Rosuvastatin ethyl ester Rosuvastatin propyl ester Rosuvastatin isopropyl ester Rosuvastatin n butyl ester Rosuvastatin iso butyl ester and Rosuvastatin tert butyl ester is relatively good especially Rosuvastatin isopentyl ester has excellent crystallization for it is easy to crystallize and precipitate from several solvents even its purity is relatively low. Therefore recrystallization is not necessary in step 3 of the present invention and it is performed in later steps on other Rosuvastatin esters which are much easier to crystallize.

THF and methanol could be used as solvent in step 3 of the present invention wherein dialkyl methoxyborane is added at low temperature for example 78 C. subsequently reductant such as sodium borohydride is added and Rosuvastatin methyl ester is obtained. The selectivity depends on different boron reagent. In general the larger the alkyl group the more crowded the space and as a result the higher the selectivity therefore the dialkyl methoxyborane is preferably selected from the group consisting of diethyl methoxyborane dipropyl methoxyborane dibutyl methoxyborane diisobutyl methoxyborane di 1 2 dimethyl propyl methoxyborane or dicyclohexyl methoxyborane. The reaction should proceed at low temperature and the volume ratio between THF and methanol of mixed solvent is 2 1 5 1 and the preferred ratio is 3 1 4 1 the preferred ratio between volume of the solvent and mass of the compound as shown in Formula 5 is 10 80 mL g and the more preferred ratio is 30 50 mL g . Furthermore in order to destroy the reductant so as to terminate step 3 glacial acetic acid is preferably added to terminate said step.

Step 4 and step 7 of the present invention relate to the formation of soluble Rosuvastatin salt for instance Rosuvastatin sodium via alkaline hydrolysis of Rosuvastatin ester. Wherein reactions of step 4 and step 7 proceed in the presence of solvent and said solvent can be selected from THF alcohol or acetonitrile and the preferred solvent is acetonitrile the reaction temperature of said step 4 and step 7 is 10 80 C. and the preferred temperature is 20 40 C. the molar ratio between NaOH and Rosuvastatin ester of said step 4 and step 7 is 1.05 2.0 1 and the preferred ratio is 1.1 1. Furthermore after the completion of the reaction of step 7 in order to remove impurities the product obtained from step 7 is extracted with water immiscible solvent and the preferred water immiscible solvent is ethyl acetate or ethyl ether.

Rosuvastatin acid is syrupy and it is relatively unstable as well as is easy to convert to Rosuvastatin lactone. Therefore as for conversion of Rosuvastatin acid from Rosuvastatin sodium the preferred conditions are as follows water insoluble solvent is added to aqueous solution of Rosuvastatin sodium subsequently inorganic acid or organic acid is added to said mixture in this way Rosuvastatin acid is dissociated and dissolves in said water immiscible solvent. Wherein the preferred solvent is selected from ester ether or halohydrocarbon and the most preferred solvent is ethyl ether. Furthermore the added inorganic acid or organic acid is selected from hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid formic acid or glacial acetic acid and the preferred acid is hydrochloric acid. After the addition of inorganic acid or organic acid the pH value of said reaction system is controlled to be at 1 6 and the preferred pH value is 3 5. The acidification temperature is normally below 40 C. and it is preferred that the reaction mixture is continuously mixed so that the dissociated Rosuvastatin acid could dissolve in water insoluble solvent. Subsequently the obtained is allowed to stand for layering the water phase is extracted with water insoluble solvent and then combined and dried. It is preferred that a certain amount of alkali for instance NaCO KCOor other weak bases is added during the condensation of acid so as to reduce the reaction rate of lactonization as side reaction.

Esterification of Rosuvastatin acid should be carried out in the absence of acid. As under acidic condition especially when the strong acid is present and the reaction temperature is relatively high Rosuvastatin acid is very easy to convert to Rosuvastatin lactone and allylic 5 hydroxyl racemization is easy to take place. Preparation of Rosuvastatin ester from Rosuvastatin acid is preferred to be performed under alkaline or neutral conditions however under said conditions lactonization could not be prevented and the formed ester could still convert to lactone at relatively high reaction temperature in the presence of alkali if the reaction time is relatively long. To solve these problems especially to ensure a relatively high yield during the multi step reaction of present invention it is shown in present invention that the effective utilization rate of Rosuvastatin is not significantly influenced by hydrolysis esterification of the present invention the utilization rate of Rosuvastatin during formation of Rosuvastatin sodium via hydrolysis reaches 97 99 and the overall yield of said two steps is above 94 . Wherein the esterification of Rosuvastatin acid and alkylation reagent takes place under the alkaline condition and the preferred alkylation reagent is halohydrocarbon wherein the preferred halogen atom is selected from Cl Br or I the more preferred halogen is Br or I and the most preferred halohydrocarbon RX is 1 bromo 3 methylbutane.
