In particular embodiments privacy settings may allow a user to control what information if any identifying the user the event or both may be included with a notification.

In particular embodiments a notification includes a variable predetermined string of symbols for the event associated with the notification. The string of symbols may identify the event that has occurred. For example a developer or advertiser of a software application may wish to identify when particular software application related events have occurred and may include software code e.g. in compliance with an SDK or provided at least in part by an API that executes when the desired event occurs. The code may include a string that identifies the event. The string may be text e.g. the user has reached level 10 or the user has used the application everyday for the past week may be a code associated with the event e.g. 2Df g 3 or any other suitable string. In accordance with the SDK and or API a string may be create removed or varied by the developer advertiser or any other suitable entity so that any suitable event may be identified. Any number of strings may be used to identify a corresponding number of events and strings may be added removed or varied as the events to identify are added removed or varied.

In particular embodiments a notification includes one or more variable numbers describing a value of a one or more attributes associated with the user initiated event. For example if an event is a user logging into or initiating an application the variable number may described the time period since the user s last login or use of the application. As another example if the event is a financial transaction initiated from the application or for products associated with the application e.g. items in a game etc. then the variable number may describe the value of the transaction e.g. the total amount of items bought the total money spent etc. . The variable number may also or in the alternative describe specifics about whether the user is a repeat purchaser for example by indicating how many times the user has bought something in or through that application. As another example a variable number may describe the amount of time a user has used the application over the lifetime of the application in a consecutive period etc. or a feature of the application. As another example a variable number may describe the time at which the event occurred. In particular embodiments the variable number may be determined from a social networking system such as from information associated one or more nodes or edges in a social graph associated with the social networking system. While this disclosure provides specific examples of variable numbers describing example values of example attributes associated with example user initiated event this disclosure contemplates any suitable variable number describing any suitable value of any suitable attribute associated with an suitable user initiated event.

In particular embodiments a notification includes one or more variable parameters describing one or more attributes of a user at or near the time or the event or an attribute of the variable number. For example a variable parameter may describe the currency associated with an amount of money spent in a financial transaction on or in the application. As another example a variable parameter may describe an attribute of the user such as for example that the user is a repeat purchaser is a customer of a particular class e.g. a member with particular status or benefits has one or more attributes e.g. sex age income uses the particular client device and or other particular devices has used or shown interest in other applications etc. In particular embodiments the variable parameter may be determined from a social networking system such as from information associated with one or more nodes or edges in a social graph associated with the social networking system. While this disclosure provides specific examples of variable parameters associated with specific attributes of a user or an attribute of a variable number this disclosure contemplates any suitable variable parameter associated with any suitable attribute of a user or any suitable variable number.

After the notification is received at step the notification is correlated with the user associated with the event such as by identifying the user associated with the event. For example the user may be identified directly from information received with or in association with the notification. Such information may include the user s name a unique ID number associated with the user e.g. an ID number associated with a social network or with a hash or other encoded information uniquely associated with the user. As another example the user may be indirectly identified from information received with or in association with the notification. For example the information may identify the user s client device e.g. by an addressable hardware component an account associated with the device etc which may be correlated with that user e.g. by a cookie associated with the user and residing on the same device by an account associated with the user and the device etc. . Information identifying a user and or a client device may use any of the methods for tracking mobile application or mobile device information described in patent application Ser. No. 13 748 560 titled Conversion Tracking for Installation of Applications on Mobile Devices and filed 23 Jan. 2013 which is incorporated by reference herein. While this disclosure provides specific examples of information and methods identifying a user associated with a user initiated event this disclosure contemplates any suitable information and methods identifying that user.

At step a description of the event is determined at least in part on the string of symbols received in the notification. For example the string may explicitly describe the event such as the user has installed the application. As another example the string may be a code e.g. 194836 that maps to a specific event generally for that advertiser or developer of the software application for that software application of for that specific user. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of determining the event based at least in part on the received string of symbols.

Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

Once an event is correlated with a particular user that information may be used to determine information relevant to or about that user. For example such information may be used to calculate a lifetime value of the user for the software application or similar software applications. As another example such information may be used to generate more effective ads and ad campaigns both for users correlated to events and for other user having one or more similar characteristics as the users correlated to events. For example particular embodiments may facilitate the delivery of advertisements to users that are more likely to find the advertisements more relevant or useful. For example an advertiser may realize higher conversion rates and therefore higher return on investment ROI from advertising by identifying and targeting users that are more likely to find its advertisements more relevant or useful. In the context of a social networking system an advertiser may use user profile information in social networking system to identify those users. In addition or as an alternative social networking system may use user profile information in social networking system to identify those users for the advertiser.
