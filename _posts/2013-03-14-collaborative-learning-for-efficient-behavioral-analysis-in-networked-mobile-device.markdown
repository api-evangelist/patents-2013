A further aspect includes a system of at least a first mobile device and a second mobile device configured to perform the operations of the methods summarized above. Any number of mobile devices may be included in such a system.

The various aspects will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.

The various aspects provide mobile devices systems and methods for efficiently identifying classifying modeling preventing and or correcting the conditions and or mobile device behaviors that often degrade a mobile computing device s performance power utilization levels network usage levels security and or privacy over time. By configuring a plurality of mobile devices to work in conjunction each other and share the results of their analyses the various aspects enable each mobile device to improve the performance of its behavior analysis operations more accurately identify performance degrading behaviors of the mobile device and react to performance limiting and undesirable operating conditions much faster and with lower power consumption than if such analysis were accomplished independently within each mobile device.

A number of different cellular and mobile communication services and standards are available or contemplated in the future all of which may implement and benefit from the various aspects. Such services and standards include e.g. third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE systems third generation wireless mobile communication technology 3G fourth generation wireless mobile communication technology 4G global system for mobile communications GSM universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS 3GSM general packet radio service GPRS code division multiple access CDMA systems e.g. cdmaOne CDMA1020 enhanced data rates for GSM evolution EDGE advanced mobile phone system AMPS digital AMPS IS 136 TDMA evolution data optimized EV DO digital enhanced cordless telecommunications DECT Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX wireless local area network WLAN Wi Fi Protected Access I II WPA WPA2 and integrated digital enhanced network iden . Each of these technologies involves for example the transmission and reception of voice data signaling and or content messages. It should be understood that any references to terminology and or technical details related to an individual telecommunication standard or technology are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims to a particular communication system or technology unless specifically recited in the claim language.

The terms mobile computing device and mobile device are used interchangeably herein to refer to any one or all of cellular telephones smartphones personal or mobile multi media players personal data assistants PDA s laptop computers tablet computers smartbooks ultrabooks palm top computers wireless electronic mail receivers multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones wireless gaming controllers and similar personal electronic devices which include a memory a programmable processor for which performance is important and operate under battery power such that power conservation methods are of benefit. While the various aspects are particularly useful for mobile computing devices such as smartphones which have limited resources and run on battery the aspects are generally useful in any electronic device that includes a processor and executes application programs.

The term performance degradation is used herein to refer to a wide variety of undesirable mobile device operations and characteristics such as longer processing times slower real time responsiveness lower battery life loss of private data malicious economic activity e.g. sending unauthorized premium SMS message denial of service DoS operations relating to commandeering the mobile device or utilizing the phone for spying or botnet activities etc.

Generally the performance and power efficiency of a mobile device degrade over time. Recently anti virus companies e.g. McAfee Symantec etc. have begun marketing mobile anti virus firewall and encryption products that aim to slow this degradation. However many of these solutions rely on the periodic execution of a computationally intensive scanning engine on the mobile device which may consume many of the mobile device s processing and battery resources slow or render the mobile device useless for extended periods of time and or otherwise degrade the user experience. In addition these solutions are typically limited to detecting known viruses and malware and do not address the multiple complex factors and or the interactions that often combine to contribute to a mobile device s degradation over time e.g. when the performance degradation is not caused by viruses or malware . For these and other reasons existing anti virus firewall and encryption products do not provide adequate solutions for identifying the numerous factors that may contribute to a mobile device s degradation over time for preventing mobile device degradation or for efficiently restoring an aging mobile device to its original condition.

Mobile devices are resource constrained systems that have relatively limited processing memory and energy resources. Modern mobile devices are also complex systems and there are a large variety of factors that may contribute to the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of a mobile device over time including poorly designed software applications malware viruses fragmented memory background processes etc. Due to the number variety and complexity of these factors it is often not feasible to evaluate all the factors that may contribute to the degradation in performance and or power utilization levels of the complex yet resource constrained systems of modern mobile devices.

To provide better performance in view of these facts the various aspects include mobile devices that include behavior monitoring and analysis modules configured to work in conjunction with other mobile devices to intelligently and efficiently identify factors that may contribute to the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of mobile devices over time. Each mobile device may be configured with behavior monitoring and analysis modules that include learning capabilities to develop their own classifier models from observed behaviors and performance consequences. While such learning methods may be effective they are nevertheless limited to the behaviors and operating conditions that have been observed by an individual mobile device. The various embodiments overcome such limitations by configuring the mobile devices to collaborate with other mobile devices thereby enabling better capability of all devices to accurately identify performance degrading behaviors and factors. This collaboration may be accomplished by broadcasting a behavior vector to other mobile devices so that the behavior vector can be processed by each mobile device s classification model. The results of such processing such as a determination of whether the behavior vector indicates benign not benign or suspicious operating conditions are then returned to the broadcasting mobile device which can combine received results with the results of its own classifier model to arrive at a better determination of the condition.

Each of a plurality of mobile devices may be configured to perform behavior observation and analysis operations to identify programs processes that have a high potential to contribute to the mobile device s degradation e.g. programs that are actively malicious poorly written etc. . Such behavior observation and analysis operations may include an observer process daemon module or sub system herein collectively referred to as a module of a mobile device instrumenting or coordinating various application programming interfaces APIs at various levels of the mobile device system and collecting behavior information from the instrumented APIs. The observer module may communicate e.g. via a memory write operation function call etc. the collected behavior information to a classifier module and or an analyzer module e.g. via a memory write operation etc. of the mobile device which may analyze and or classify the collected behavior information generate behavior vectors generate spatial and or temporal correlations based on the behavior vector and information collected from various other mobile device sub systems and determine whether a particular mobile device behavior software application or process is benign suspicious malicious or performance degrading.

In various aspects the analyzer module and or classifier module of each mobile device may be configured to generate execute or apply one or more classifiers or data behavior models. For example the analyzer module and or classifier module may be configured to perform real time analysis operations which may include applying data algorithms and or behavior models to behavior information collected by the observer module to determine whether a mobile device behavior is benign suspicious malicious or performance degrading. In an aspect the analyzer module and or classifier module may determine that a mobile device behavior is suspicious when the analyzer classifier module does not have sufficient information to determine with a high degree of confidence that a mobile device behavior is either benign or malicious.

In an aspect mobile devices may be configured to establish or join a trust network that includes a plurality of pre screened or trusted mobile devices. In various aspects establishing or joining a trust network may include each mobile device performing group formation operations that include establishing communication links to the other mobile devices another via peer to peer WiFi Direct or other similar technologies. Mobile devices may also be connected via a shared secure network enterprise virtual private network and other similar technologies or group classifications. In an aspect a trusted network may include mobile devices that are the same network or which have direct communication links.

Each mobile device in the trusted network may be configured to perform collaborative learning operations that include sharing the generated behavior vectors the results of the real time analysis operations and other similar information with other mobile devices in the trusted network. For example a first mobile device in the trusted network may perform real time behavior analysis operations by applying a data behavior model or classifier to behavior information collected by an observer module of the first mobile device to generate a first unit of analysis results suitable for use in determining whether a mobile device behavior is benign or not benign.

The first mobile device may broadcast or otherwise send the behavior vector to a second mobile device which may receive the behavior vector and apply the received behavior vector to its own behavior models or classifiers to generate a second unit of analysis results. The second mobile device may then send the second unit of analysis results to the first mobile device which may combine or collate the second unit of analysis results with the previously generated real time analysis results and use the combined collated results to better evaluate and classify an observed mobile device behavior perform more accurate classification analysis operations and or generate more accurate data behavior models. Thus by combining the results of two weak learners e.g. results of the initial analysis performed in the first and second mobile devices the first mobile device is able to become a strong learner capable of generating more accurate analysis results that better identify suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behaviors software applications processes etc.

In various aspects the mobile devices may be configured to combine received and self generated analysis results using any known method of combining results of weak learners such as statistical analysis methods boosted decision tree analysis see below machine learning methods and context modeling techniques. A mobile device that is a weak learner may become a strong learner by combining results of multiple weak learners e.g. its own results and results received from at least one other mobile device . The mobile devices may be further configured to exchange their combined stronger results or updated behavior models generated based on the combined stronger results for use in further determining whether a mobile device behavior is benign or malicious performance degrading. In this manner the mobile device may perform collaborative learning operations for near continuous refinement of the classification accuracy of the mobile devices.

In addition to exchanging the results of the real time behavior operations each mobile device may also be configured to generate or update its data behavior models by performing executing and or applying machine learning and or context modeling techniques to behavior information and or the results of behavior analyses provided by many mobile devices. For example a mobile device may receive a large number of reports from many mobile devices and analyze consolidate or otherwise turn such information into focused behavior models that can be used to better classify a mobile device behavior.

In an aspect a mobile device may be configured to continuously reevaluate the results of behavior analysis operations performed on the mobile device as new behavior analysis results are received from other mobile devices. The mobile device may collate combine amalgamate or correlate the results and generate new or updated data behavior models based any combination of the received results historical information e.g. collected from prior executions previous applications of behavior models etc. combined results new information machine learning context modeling detected changes in the available information mobile device states environmental conditions network conditions mobile device performance battery consumption levels etc.

In an aspect each mobile device in a trusted network may be configured to broadcast its behavior vector signature accordingly to a schedule which may be set by a mobile device in the trusted network that is designated pre selected or elected as a group leader. The other mobile devices in the network may activate broadcast receiver circuitry at the scheduled times to receive the broadcast.

In various aspects the modules may be implemented within parts of the operating system e.g. within the kernel in the kernel space in the user space etc. within separate programs or applications in specialized hardware buffers or processors or any combination thereof.

Radio level observations may further include monitoring network traffic usage statistics or profiles.

Sensor level observations may include monitoring a magnet sensor or other sensor to determine the usage and or external environment of the mobile device. For example the mobile device processor may be configured to determine whether the phone is in a holster e.g. via a magnet sensor configured to sense a magnet within the holster or in the user s pocket e.g. via the amount of light detected by a camera or light sensor . Detecting that the mobile device is in a holster may be relevant to recognizing suspicious behaviors for example because activities and functions related to active usage by a user e.g. taking photographs or videos sending messages conducting a voice call recording sounds etc. occurring while the mobile device is holstered could be signs of nefarious processes executing on the device e.g. to track or spy on the user .

Other examples of sensor level observations related to usage or external environments may include detecting near field communications NFC collecting information from a credit card scanner barcode scanner or mobile tag reader detecting the presence of a USB power charging source detecting that a keyboard or auxiliary device has been coupled to the mobile device detecting that the mobile device has been coupled to a computing device e.g. via USB etc. determining whether an LED flash flashlight or light source has been modified or disabled e.g. maliciously disabling an emergency signaling app etc. detecting that a speaker or microphone has been turned on or powered detecting a charging or power event detecting that the mobile device is being used as a game controller etc. Sensor level observations may also include collecting information from medical or healthcare sensors or from scanning the user s body collecting information from an external sensor plugged into the USB audio jack collecting information from a tactile or haptic sensor e.g. via a vibrator interface etc. collecting information pertaining to the thermal state of the mobile device etc.

To reduce the number of factors monitored to a manageable level in an aspect the behavior observer module may perform coarse observations by monitoring observing an initial set of behaviors or factors that are a small subset of all factors that could contribute to the mobile device s degradation. In various aspects the behavior observer module may receive the initial set of behaviors and or factors from other mobile devices a network server or a component in a cloud service or network .

The behavior analyzer module and or classifier module may receive the observations from the behavior observer module compare the received information i.e. observations with contextual information received from the external context information module and identify subsystems processes and or applications associated with the received observations that are contributing to or are likely to contribute to the device s degradation over time or which may otherwise cause problems on the device.

In an aspect the behavior analyzer module and or classifier module may include intelligence for utilizing a limited set of information i.e. coarse observations to identify behaviors processes or programs that are contributing to or are likely to contribute to the device s degradation over time or which may otherwise cause problems on the device. For example the behavior analyzer module may be configured to analyze information e.g. in the form of observations collected from various modules e.g. the behavior observer module external context information module etc. learn the normal operational behaviors of the mobile device and generate one or more behavior vectors based the results of the comparisons. The behavior analyzer module may send the generated behavior vectors to the classifier module for further analysis. The behavior analyzer module may also send the generated behavior vectors to one or more other mobile devices that are in the same trusted network as the mobile device.

The classifier module may receive the behavior vectors and compare them to one or more behavior modules to determine whether a particular mobile device behavior software application or process is performance degrading malicious benign or suspicious.

When the classifier module determines that a behavior software application or process is malicious or performance degrading the classifier module may notify the actuator module which may perform various actions or operations to correct mobile device behaviors determined to be malicious or performance degrading and or perform operations to heal cure isolate or otherwise fix the identified problem.

When the classifier module determines that a behavior software application or process is suspicious the classifier module may notify the behavior observer module which may adjust the adjust the granularity of its observations i.e. the level of detail at which mobile device behaviors are observed and or change the behaviors that are observed based on information received from the classifier module e.g. results of the real time analysis operations generate or collect new or additional behavior information and send the new additional information to the behavior analyzer module and or classifier module for further analysis classification. Such feedback communications between the behavior observer module and the classifier module enable the mobile device to recursively increase the granularity of the observations i.e. make finer or more detailed observations or change the features behaviors that are observed until a source of a suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior is identified until a processing or batter consumption threshold is reached or until the mobile device processor determines that the source of the suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior cannot be identified from further increases in observation granularity. Such feedback communication also enable the mobile device to adjust or modify the data behavior models locally in the mobile device without consuming an excessive amount of the mobile device s processing memory or energy resources.

In an aspect the behavior observer module and the behavior analyzer module may provide either individually or collectively real time behavior analysis of the computing system s behaviors to identify suspicious behavior from limited and coarse observations to dynamically determine behaviors to observe in greater detail and to dynamically determine the level of detail required for the observations. In this manner the behavior observer module enables the mobile device to efficiently identify and prevent problems from occurring on mobile devices without requiring a large amount of processor memory or battery resources on the device.

The behavior observer module of a first mobile device may monitor observe mobile device behaviors generate observations or behavior vectors and send the observations behavior vectors to the classifier module . The classifier module may perform real time analysis operations which may include generating or evaluating behavior vectors applying data behavior models to behavior information collected by the behavior observer module and determining whether a mobile device behavior is benign suspicious or malicious performance degrading. The classifier module may determine that a mobile device behavior is suspicious when the classifier module does not have sufficient information to classify or conclusively determine that the behavior is either benign or malicious.

In an aspect the first mobile device may be configured to send the behavior vector along with signatures confidence values classifier parameters and other similar information to one or more of the plurality of mobile devices in the trust network. In various aspects the first mobile device may send the behavior vector when collaborative conditions exist and or when the classifier module does not have sufficient information to classify or conclusively determine that the behavior is benign or malicious.

One or more of the plurality of mobile devices may receive the behavior vector and perform real time analysis operations by applying the received behavior vector to a classifier or data behavior model in the receiving mobile device to generate analysis results and send the analysis results back to the first mobile device . The first mobile device may receive the analysis results and collate combine amalgamate or correlate the received results with the results of real time analysis operations generated by the classifier module of the first mobile device . In various aspects the received and self generated results models may be combined using known methods of combining results of weak learners such as statistical analysis methods boosted decision tree analysis see below machine learning methods and context modeling techniques. The first mobile device may then use to the combined collated results to determine whether the mobile device behavior is benign or malicious performance degrading with a higher degree of confidence.

In an aspect the classifier module in each individual mobile device may be a weak machine learning classifier and the combination of the results of the multiple classifiers may create a strong machine learning classifier.

In an aspect each classifier module of the plurality of mobile devices may output a behavior signature analysis results and a confidence value. The behavior signature may be a concise representation of a mobile device behavior such as a vector of numbers state diagram etc.

In an aspect the mobile devices may be configured to perform hand shaking operations and other coordination operations to accomplish the collaboration operations and or to share the behavior signature analysis results and confidence values information.

In an aspect the classifier module may also be configured to communicate the results of its real time analysis operations to its behavior observer module when the combined collated results are not sufficient to conclusively classify i.e. with a high enough degree of confidence a mobile device behavior as either benign or malicious. The behavior observer module may adjust the granularity of its observations i.e. the level of detail at which mobile device behaviors are observed and or change the behaviors that are observed based on information received from the classifier module e.g. based on the results of the real time analysis operations generate or collect new or additional behavior information. In this manner the mobile device may recursively increase the granularity of the observations i.e. make finer or more detailed observations or change the features behaviors that are observed until the generated behavior vector is suitable for identifying a source of a suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior or until a processing or battery consumption threshold is reached or until the mobile device processor determines that the source of the suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior cannot be identified from further increases in observation granularity.

In addition the mobile device may repeatedly send new and updated behavior vectors to the plurality of mobile devices and receive new improved or updated analysis results . The iterative and repeated sharing of such information allows for collaborative learning more accurate classification of mobile device behaviors and near continuous refinement the of data behavior models used by the mobile devices . Further the more trusted mobile devices that send their analyses results in this manner the better the combination result that each mobile device can achieve.

If the mobile device processor determines that collaborative conditions do not exist i.e. determination block No in block the mobile device processor may classify the mobile device behaviors based on the results of the analysis and or classification operations performed in the mobile device. When the mobile device processor determines that collaborative conditions do exist i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may broadcast its behavior vector or signature data behavior models and or classifier parameter for reception by other mobile devices in the trust network.

In block the mobile device processor may wait for and receive the analysis classification results from the other mobile devices in the trusted network. In block the mobile device processor may collate or combine the received results. In block the mobile device processor may classify a mobile device behavior based on the combined collated results. In block the mobile device processor may generate or output updated behavior vectors signatures analysis results confidence values and other similar information based on the classifications.

The operations of blocks may be repeated until a source of a suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior is identified a processing or battery consumption threshold is reached or until the mobile device processor determines that the source of the suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior cannot be identified.

In block the mobile device processor may send the behavior vector to a second mobile device having a second classifier model. In an embodiment the second mobile device may be included in the plurality of trusted mobile devices and sending the behavior vector to the second mobile device may include sending the behavior vector to one of the plurality of trusted mobile devices. In block a processor of the second mobile device may apply the received behavior vector to the second classifier model and send the results to the first mobile device processor. That is in blocks and the first mobile device may send the behavior vector to a second mobile device and the second mobile device may apply the behavior vector to a second classifier model obtain a second determination of whether the mobile device behavior is benign or not benign and send the second determination to the first mobile device. As part of this operation the second classifier model may also generate or calculate a confidence value for the second determination which may also be sent to the first mobile device.

In block the first mobile device processor may receive and collate combine the results of applying the behavior vector to the first classifier model in the first mobile device and the results of applying the behavior vector to the second classifier model in the second mobile device. That is in block the first mobile device may collate the first determination generated in the first mobile device and the second determination generated in the second mobile device to generate collated results. In an embodiment collating the first determination and the second determination to generate collated results may include generating a weighted linear combination of the first determination and the second determination. In embodiment collating the first determination and the second determination to generate collated results may include multiplying the first determination by a first confidence value obtained from the first classifier model to generate a first result multiplying the second determination by a second confidence value received from the second mobile device to generate a second result and summing the first result with the second result. In block the first mobile device processor may determine whether the mobile device behavior is benign or not benign based on the collated results.

The observer mode module may receive control information from various sources which may include an analyzer unit e.g. the behavior analyzer module described above with reference to and or an application API. The observer mode module may send control information pertaining to various observer modes to the adaptive filter module and the high level behavior detection module .

The adaptive filter module may receive data information from multiple sources and intelligently filter the received information to generate a smaller subset of information selected from the received information. This filter may be adapted based on information or control received from the analyzer module or a higher level process communicating through an API. The filtered information may be sent to the throttle module which may be responsible for controlling the amount of information flowing from the filter to ensure that the high level behavior detection module does not become flooded or overloaded with requests or information.

The high level behavior detection module may receive data information from the throttle module control information from the observer mode module and context information from other components of the mobile device. The high level behavior detection module may use the received information to perform spatial and temporal correlations to detect or identify high level behaviors that may cause the device to perform at sub optimal levels. The results of the spatial and temporal correlations may be sent to the behavior vector generator which may receive the correlation information and generate a behavior vector that describes the behaviors of particular process application or sub system. In an aspect the behavior vector generator may generate the behavior vector such that each high level behavior of a particular process application or sub system is an element of the behavior vector. In an aspect the generated behavior vector may be stored in a secure buffer . Examples of high level behavior detection may include detection of the existence of a particular event the amount or frequency of another event the relationship between multiple events the order in which events occur time differences between the occurrence of certain events etc.

In the various aspects the behavior observer module may perform adaptive observations and control the observation granularity. That is the behavior observer module may dynamically identify the relevant behaviors that are to be observed and dynamically determine the level of detail at which the identified behaviors are to be observed. In this manner the behavior observer module enables the system to monitor the behaviors of the mobile device at various levels e.g. multiple coarse and fine levels . The behavior observer module may enable the system to adapt to what is being observed. The behavior observer module may enable the system to dynamically change the factors behaviors being observed based on a focused subset of information which may be obtained from a wide verity of sources.

As discussed above the behavior observer module may perform adaptive observation techniques and control the observation granularity based on information received from a variety of sources. For example the high level behavior detection module may receive information from the throttle module the observer mode module and context information received from other components e.g. sensors of the mobile device. As an example a high level behavior detection module performing temporal correlations might detect that a camera has been used and that the mobile device is attempting to upload the picture to a server. The high level behavior detection module may also perform spatial correlations to determine whether an application on the mobile device took the picture while the device was holstered and attached to the user s belt. The high level behavior detection module may determine whether this detected high level behavior e.g. usage of the camera while holstered is a behavior that is acceptable or common which may be achieved by comparing the current behavior with past behaviors of the mobile device and or accessing information collected from a plurality of devices e.g. information received from a crowd sourcing server . Since taking pictures and uploading them to a server while holstered is an unusual behavior as may be determined from observed normal behaviors in the context of being holstered in this situation the high level behavior detection module may recognize this as a potentially threatening behavior and initiate an appropriate response e.g. shutting off the camera sounding an alarm etc. .

The various aspects may provide cross layer observations on mobile devices encompassing webkit SDK NDK kernel drivers and hardware in order to characterize system behavior. The behavior observations may be made in real time.

The observer module may perform adaptive observation techniques and control the observation granularity. As discussed above there are a large number i.e. thousands of factors that could contribute to the mobile device s degradation and it may not be feasible to monitor observe all of the different factors that may contribute to the degradation of the device s performance. To overcome this the various aspects dynamically identify the relevant behaviors that are to be observed and dynamically determine the level of detail at which the identified behaviors are to be observed.

In determination block the mobile device processor may determine whether suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis. When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes in block the processor may initiate a process to correct the behavior and return to block to perform additional coarse observations.

When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can not be identified and or corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No in determination block the mobile device processor may determine whether there is a likelihood of a problem. In an aspect the mobile device processor may determine that there is a likelihood of a problem by computing a probability of the mobile device encountering potential problems and or engaging in suspicious behaviors and determining whether the computed probability is greater than a predetermined threshold. When the mobile device processor determines that the computed probability is not greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is not a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block No the processor may return to block to perform additional coarse observations.

When the mobile device processor determines that there is a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may perform deeper logging observations or final logging on the identified subsystems processes or applications. In block the mobile device processor may perform deeper and more detailed observations on the identified subsystems processes or applications. In block the mobile device processor may perform further and or deeper behavioral analysis based on the deeper and more detailed observations. In determination block the mobile device processor may again determine whether the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis. When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can not be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No the processor may repeat the operations in blocks until the level of detail is fine enough to identify the problem or until it is determined that the problem cannot be identified with additional detail or that no problem exists.

When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may perform operations to correct the problem behavior and the processor may return to block to perform additional operations.

In an aspect as part of blocks of method the mobile device processor may perform real time behavior analysis of the system s behaviors to identify suspicious behavior from limited and coarse observations to dynamically determine the behaviors to observe in greater detail and to dynamically determine the precise level of detail required for the observations. This enables the mobile device processor to efficiently identify and prevent problems from occurring without requiring the use of a large amount of processor memory or battery resources on the device.
