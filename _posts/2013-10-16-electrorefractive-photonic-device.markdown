title: Electro-refractive photonic device
abstract: The various technologies presented herein relate to phase shifting light to facilitate any of light switching, modulation, amplification, etc. Structures are presented where a second layer is juxtaposed between a first layer and a third layer with respective doping facilitating formation of p-n junctions at the interface between the first layer and the second layer, and between the second layer and the third layer. Application of a bias causes a carrier concentration change to occur at the p-n junctions which causes a shift in the effective refractive index per incremental change in an applied bias voltage. The effective refractive index enhancement can occur in both reverse bias and forward bias. The structure can be incorporated into a waveguide, an optical resonator, a vertical junction device, a horizontal junction device, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a tuneable optical filter, etc.

This application also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 738 867 filed on Dec. 18 2012 entitled ELECTROREFRACTIVE PHOTONIC DEVICE the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

It has long been known that elements that shift the phase of an optical signal in response to an input signal are extremely useful for the control of optical signals both as such and as components of more complex devices. For example filters switches and modulators can all be constructed at least in part from phase shifting elements.

Useful phase shifting elements have been based on various underlying physical phenomena. Among these phenomena is the free carrier effect in semiconductive optical media whereby the refractive index of an optical medium at a given wavelength is dependent on the density of free carriers i.e. of mobile electrons and or holes in the optical medium.

A free carrier modulator can be implemented in silicon whereby the application of a forward or reverse bias voltage modulates the carrier density in the region of a p n junction. Changes in the carrier density lead to changes in the refractive index in the optical path which lead in turn to modulation of the phase of the propagating optical signal.

A resonant free carrier modulator can have a resonant frequency that exhibits a shift which is proportional to with further depending on an overlap between the change of the depletion width in the junction region and the energy distribution of the guided resonant optical mode. The depletion width in turn is controlled by a bias voltage applied across the junction. Accordingly the same electrorefractive effect that modulates the refractive index can also be utilized to shift the resonant frequency of a device whereby the resonant frequency can be a function of the refractive index thus leading to applications in spectrally selective modulation and filtering.

As mentioned refractive index can depend on carrier concentrations Eqn. 1 provides an empirical expression for the refractive index change n in the junction region in silicon at a wavelength of 1550 nm Eqn. 1 where j 1 N is the electron or hole concentration and the parameters A B C and D are provided in the following table 

An estimation of how a depletion width w can be varied by a voltage applied across a junction can be determined per Eqn. 2 

Junction based free carrier modulators and similar devices have advantageous properties. However the free carrier effect for such devices is often weaker than other physical mechanisms for producing refractive index changes. Therefore there remains a need for further enhancements in the effectiveness of junction based free carrier modulators and the like.

The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

Various exemplary embodiments presented herein relate to phase shifting of a signal. In an exemplary embodiment an apparatus is presented the apparatus comprising a first semiconductive contact region having a first predominant carrier type a second semiconductive contact region having a second predominant carrier type opposite to the first predominant carrier type and an optical confinement structure that can comprise of two layers of the first predominant carrier type and one layer of the second predominant carrier type. In a further embodiment the second type layer can be juxtaposed between the first type layers and can form a p n junction with each said first type layer and further the first contact region can contact the first type layers and the second contact region can contact the second type layer such that in operation a sufficient voltage applied across the contact regions and constituting a forward bias relative to said regions can create a forward bias across both said p n junctions and a sufficient voltage can be applied across the contact regions and constituting a reverse bias relative to said regions can create a reverse bias across both said p n junctions.

Another exemplary embodiment is presented comprising a method for forming and operating a phase shifting device the method comprising forming a first semiconductive contact region having a first predominant carrier type forming a second semiconductive contact region having a second predominant carrier type and forming an optical confinement layer between the first semiconductive contact and the second semiconductive contact. In an embodiment a first side of the optical confinement layer can abut a side of the first semiconductive region and a second side of the optical confinement layer can abut a side of the second semiconductive region. The method further comprising forming a first layer in the optical confinement layer by doping the first layer with the first predominant carrier type and forming a second layer in the optical confinement layer by doping the second layer with the second predominant carrier type wherein the second layer is formed over the first layer and further forming a third layer in the optical confinement layer by doping the third layer with the first predominant carrier type. The third layer can be formed over the second layer and the respective layers are conformed such that in operation an effective bias applied between the first semiconductive contact region and the second semiconductive contact region can generate a first carrier depletion zone at a first junction formed between the first layer and the second layer. Further application of the bias can generate a second carrier depletion zone at a second junction formed between the second layer and the third layer.

A further exemplary embodiment for electrorefractive optical phase modulation can comprise a method which can include admitting a light beam through a waveguiding structure comprising a stack of three semiconductor layers conformed such that a central layer forms a p n junction with each of the two outlying layers. The method further comprising energizing the semiconductor stack with a voltage applied across a pair of semiconductor contact layers having opposite predominant carrier types such that a forward bias applied across said contact layers causes both p n junctions to be forward biased and vice versa. The method further comprising varying the applied voltage between forward and reverse bias such that carrier densities near the p n junction are correspondingly varied.

The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various technologies relating to phase shifting of an optical signal are presented wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that such aspect s may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.

Further the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or . That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B. In addition the articles a and an as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean one or more unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form. Additionally as used herein the term exemplary is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something and is not intended to indicate a preference.

In an embodiment regions and can be formed from silicon Si . However other elements compounds and or compositions may also be utilized and are not excluded. For example germanium Ge may be a useful composition for applications that are compatible with the optical properties of germanium. Similarly gallium arsenide GaAs may be utilized along with other III V compounds and II VI compounds or other semiconductors.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that the design of is a vertical junction design in that the p n junctions are disposed substantially in horizontal planes as seen in the figure and thus parallel to a substrate on which device can be formed. Any suitable technique can be utilized to define contact regions and .

Given such techniques are conventional they are not described in detail herein. Ion implantation is a technique suitable for defining layers and whereby a selected dopant s can be implanted at a desired depth s by appropriately setting the implantation energy ies . Specific examples of dopant species and implant energies are further presented herein.

Vertical junction designs may in some cases be advantageous due to relatively simple fabrication processes. However horizontal junction devices and angled junction devices e.g. the p n junction is between vertical and horizontal may in some cases also be desirable and are not excluded from the scope of the invention even if not included amongst the explicitly presented embodiments herein. It is to be appreciated that the profile of the junction cross section may be a curved line a jagged line a sawtooth line a squaretooth profile or any other shape that would enhance the length of a junction region formed between any of regions and and or layers and or .

In use an optical beam to be phase shifted is directed through structure in the direction perpendicular to the plane of . The wavelength of the optical beam may have any value within the transmissive window of silicon or such other material of which structure is composed e.g. Ge GaAs etc. . For silicon a typical effective wavelength range is about 1.1 to about 3.0 micrometers. If structure is intended to provide optical resonance it can be dimensioned accordingly as understood by those skilled in the art. For example a typical thickness for a silicon dioxide clad SiO silicon microdisk resonator for operation at typical wavelengths can be about 220 nm and typical widths would be in the range of about 3.5 micrometers to about 10 mm although widths of any required dimension can be utilized in accordance with size limitations of the chip the mode size of light comprising the optical beam or an achievable resolution s of the fabrication process creating the silicon microdisk resonator.

In use a bias can be applied between contacts and . It is to be understood that if the bias direction is forward relative to regions and then the junction between layer and each of layers and will likewise be forward biased. Conversely if the bias direction is reverse relative to regions and then the junction between layer and each of layers and will likewise be reverse biased. Application of a forward bias relative to regions and indicates that the more positive pole is applied to the p region and the more negative pole is applied to the n region. A negative bias indicates an opposite scenario whereby application of a reverse bias relative to regions and indicates that the more positive pole is applied to the n region and the more negative pole is applied to the p region. Depending on a specific application the bias may be provided by any suitable technique such as for example by a DC voltage source by a microwave frequency voltage source etc. The bias can be controlled in accordance with the desired operation that the device is to perform e.g. modulation switching filtering etc.

In this regard it is to be noted that a typical useful range for the voltage applied to a silicon based device as described in the various embodiments presented herein would be about 1 to about 7 volts where such values correspond to a range between the turn on voltage for forward bias to the breakdown voltage in reverse bias. As understood by those skilled in the art when operated in forward or reverse bias the signal input to the device can be AC or DC coupled. It is to be noted that a device e.g. device as described herein can be compatible with differential signaling.

Further the various devices and associated embodiments presented herein may facilitate several further advantages in addition to an increased sensitivity to the applied voltage. For example for filter applications it can be possible to shift a resonant wavelength by varying the applied voltage without a requirement to heat the device for thermal tuning. This possibility can be due in part to a larger resonant frequency shift available to a device with a longer depletion region as presented in accord with the various embodiments presented herein. Owing to the electro optic effect generally having a faster timescale than the thermo optic effect this can lead to the possibility of operating at higher frequencies than might otherwise be possible.

In particular it is to be noted that higher frequencies of operation are generally more attainable with reverse bias than with forward bias. However exploitation of this property in a junction based free carrier index shifting device has been limited until now because of the relative weakness of the index shifting effect in reverse bias. However by providing a dual p n junction as presented in the various embodiments herein the effect can be enhanced to a sufficient extent to render filtering practical at high frequencies such as about 100 GHz or more.

Methods for the specific design and fabrication of the device described herein are well known to those skilled in the art. In particular the total thickness of region can be dictated by the pertinent refractive index and by the desired wavelength of operation of the device. The total thickness T of region can in a typical embodiment be divided approximately equally among layers and . The various effects of varying the respective thicknesses of layers and and of varying the dopant densities therein can be based on various factors. For example the dopant densities in layers and can be selected based at least in part on an optimal balance between a desired strength of the free carrier effect and an acceptable level of optical loss. Accordingly increasing the dopant density can tend to increase the refractive index change but an increased dopant density can also tend to increase loss from the optical signal beam due to absorption and scattering.

As presented illustrates a phase shifting device with an optical design which can be conformed in a ridge waveguide geometry i.e. a rectangular geometry. However it is to be appreciated that the various embodiments presented herein can be readily applied to other optical geometries such as those of optical resonators having a disk configuration and a ring configuration. illustrates a phase shifting device having a disk geometry according to an embodiment. As shown in contact region connects metal contact with doped layer and contact region connects metal contact with doped layers and with dual p n junctions occurring as indicated. Similar to the depletion region as shown in depletion regions can be formed in device layer forms p n junctions with both of the juxtaposing layers and the upper surface of layer can form a p n junction with the lower surface of layer and the lower surface of layer can form a p n junction with the upper surface of layer . Biasing across contacts and as previously described can be applied in reverse bias and also in forward bias. As shown device can be utilized in an embodiment with waveguides and operation of which is expanded upon in .

Utilizing an optical resonator s can be advantageous for applications of the phase shifting device directed towards optical filtration as well as modulation. In an embodiment the electro optic effect on the free carrier distribution due to the applied voltage can be utilized to shift a resonant wavelength. Thus modulation may be effectuated by shifting the device e.g. any of devices and or in and out of resonance with the signal wavelength. Similarly a tunable filter may be provided by shifting the resonant wavelength to coincide with a desired signal channel. It should be noted that for purposes of optical filtration filters of first second or any higher order may be constructed in accord with the various embodiments presented herein. As will be understood by those skilled in the art a higher order filter can be constructed based on a combination of two or more mutually optically coupled resonator structures having a configuration s as presented herein.

The following present typical design and fabrication parameters utilized for a silicon based microdisk modulator having a single vertical p n junction. It is to be appreciated that the following parameters can be readily adjusted to facilitate fabrication of a device e.g. device and or based on the embodiments presented herein e.g. the operations are adjusted to facilitate incorporation of three layers e.g. layers and as required to form a device having dual p n junctions. A typical modulator device can fabricated from a silicon on insulator SOI wafer with a 250 nm silicon layer and a buried oxide layer which may be of variable thickness depending on the application semiconductor and or a wavelength of light comprising the optical beam. For modification to a device e.g. device and or based on the embodiments presented herein the 250 nm silicon layer can be apportioned equally or unequally among layers and . A deep ultraviolet laser scan and reactive ion etch can be utilized to define the various modulator features. Further a sacrificial oxidation at about 950 C. can be performed to remove etch damage followed by oxidation at about 1100 C. to passivate the silicon sidewall preparatory to doping by ion implantation. The designed doping concentration in the p type and n type layers can be about 2 10cm however such concentration can vary according to application wavelength of the optical beam and or a substrate material. After ion implantation in the diode and contact layers the device can be annealed at about 900 C. followed by deposition of a 1.6 micrometer layer of plasma enhanced tetraethyl orthosilicate PETEOS and chemical mechanical polishing of the PETEOS back to 0.9 micrometers. Low resistance contacts e.g. contacts and can then be formed followed by chemical mechanical polish and metallization as required to form interconnect and contact pads. In another embodiment implant parameters can be for the layers and in the junction region the top and bottom n type layers can be implanted with phosphorus at a dose of 8 10cmat energies of 380 and 38 keV while for the middle p type layer boron difluoride can be implanted at a dose of 1.12 10cmat an energy of 187 keV. The implant layers can be reversed by using appropriate dopant energies to create p type layers on the top and bottom and an n type layer in the middle.

Accordingly resonant filtration and switching operations can be performed by device in conjunction with waveguides and . For example when device is operating in on resonance mode zero power or low power is being transmitted at as the input light is being coupled into the resonator such that a corresponding amount of optical energy excites the resonant field in resonator and is transmitted at .

Alternatively for example when device is operating in off resonance mode full power is being transmitted at as no light is coupled with device and accordingly no light is being transmitted at .

In an exemplary mode of operation device can have a reverse bias of about 0.5 volts applied during on resonance mode while in off resonance device can have a forward bias of about 0.5 volts applied. In implementations a forward bias of 0.5V may be sufficient to shift the device off of resonance while still low enough that the diode remains turned off relative to the forward biased current flow. Hence advantage is taken of the switching between on resonance and off resonance occurring at about 0.5V either side of 0 volts as the depletion zone e.g. zone expands and contracts per applied voltage to a greater degree at about 0.5V than is achieved at higher applied voltages such as 2 volts during a reverse bias for example. In an embodiment AC coupling can be applied to device to facilitate efficient operation with less voltage.

As shown in the ability to detune to 100 GHz renders the embodiments presented herein applicable to such applications as optical filtering packet switching etc. The embodiments facilitate operation of a device that can jump channels for example which can be hard to achieve with a conventional single p n junction device. plot presents the frequency detuning GHz versus the bias voltage V . As previously presented at a biasing range of about 0.5V either side of 0 volts range F the extent of the depletion zone e.g. zone can be modified to a greater degree than at e.g. an applied voltage of 2 volts.

At an optical confinement structure can be formed where in an embodiment the structure can comprise a three layer stack wherein the second layer in the stack is formed on the first layer and the third layer is formed on the second layer. The second layer is juxtaposed between the first and third layers. The first layer can be formed by doping with a first dopant the second layer can be formed over the first layer by doping with a second dopant and the third layer can be formed over the second layer by doping with the first dopant. In an embodiment the three layer stack can be fabricated with three doped layers formed in a single layer. For example in an embodiment the three layers or regions can be formed by an ion implantation technique with a first region being formed in the single layer by doping a lower volume of the single layer with a first dopant. A second region can be formed on the first region by doping a middle volume of the single layer with a second dopant. A third region can be formed on the second region by doping an upper volume of the single layer with the first dopant. Accordingly the single layer is doped to comprise a lower region and an upper region with a first dopant and a second region formed therebetween comprising of a second dopant. Hence the single layer can be a single volume of material capable of having three doped regions contiguously formed therein.

It is to be appreciated that while the various embodiments presented herein relate to a structure comprising a three layer stack the various embodiments are not so limited. Instead the stack can comprise R layers wherein R is any of a range of positive integers greater than two. For some applications R can be determined in accordance with dimensioning requirements of the application. For example a dimensioning limitation may be based at least in part on the wavelength of the light to be optically shifted such as the light in the 1550 nm telecommunication band for applications using that band.

At during fabrication of the three layer stack each of the layers can undergo ion implantation. For example after the first layer is formed and dimensioned to a required size the layer can be doped with a required dopant e.g. boron difluoride or other suitable material to form a p type layer and arsenic phosphorus or other suitable material to form an n type layer. As each layer is formed the dopant polarity can be alternated so that a stack is formed comprising a pnp structure or a npn structure as previously described.

At a bias can be applied across the three layer stack to change the carrier concentration in the depletion region at each of the p n junctions formed at respective surface interfaces between a p type layer and a n type layer. The carrier depletion layer can lead to a shift in the effective refractive index of the plurality of layers in the stack when a forward and or reverse bias is applied. Accordingly the change in effective refractive index can facilitate operations including light switching light modulation light phase change light filtering light attenuation etc.

To facilitate application of the respective forward or reverse bias the three layer stack regions can be coupled to respective predominant p type carrier and predominant n type carrier doped semiconductive contact regions which can be further connected to electrical contacts across which the required bias can be applied. For example the p type and n type doped contact regions can be heavily doped to facilitate good ohmic contact between the electrical contacts and the respective p or n stack layers.

At in a first operation a reverse bias can be applied to the phase shifting device to facilitate operation of the pnp device in an on resonant mode. Accordingly during operation in the on resonant mode the phase shifting device becomes optically coupled to the input waveguide with the light transmitted in the input waveguide being subsequently transmitted into the phase shifting device. Light captured in the phase shifting device can increase in intensity such that coupling between the phase shifting device and the drop waveguide occurs leading to the light inputted into the input throughput waveguide to be switched to the drop waveguide.

At in a second operation a forward bias can be applied to the phase shifting device to facilitate operation of the pnp device in an off resonant mode. Accordingly during operation in the off resonant mode the phase shifting device is optically de coupled from the input waveguide whereby the light transmitted in the input waveguide remains in the waveguide.

What has been described above includes examples of one or more embodiments. It is of course not possible to describe every conceivable modification and alteration of the above structures or methodologies for purposes of describing the aforementioned aspects but one of ordinary skill in the art can recognize that many further modifications and permutations of various aspects are possible. Accordingly the described aspects are intended to embrace all such alterations modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Furthermore to the extent that the term includes is used in either the details description or the claims such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term comprising as comprising is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.
