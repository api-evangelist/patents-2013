The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.

The present invention relates generally to control systems for suspended objects and more specifically to a control system and method for stabilizing a single line suspended mass in yaw.

Transporting objects suspended in air can be a difficult task particularly when dealing with extreme weather conditions and harsh environments. These outside disturbances can greatly increase the risk of injury to those people charged with controlling the suspended objects as well as bystanders in proximity to the suspended object. Furthermore the load being moved is susceptible to damage as the outside forces alter the roll pitch and yaw of the suspended object.

Multiple cables may be utilized to lift loads and control spinning or yaw. However controlling multiple lift cables adds greatly to system cost complexity and maintenance while reducing the maneuverability of the lifting mechanism. Further the angular position of the load in this case is typically not readily adjustable and often must remain in a single orientation.

Torque balanced cables may be used to control yaw but are not resistant to disturbances from weather impacts or other outside forces. In extreme environments a torque balanced cable will do little to resist changing yaw.

The problems discussed above are well known in the construction industry in dealing with transporting supplies from the ground to a point high above ground e.g. a skyscraper oil rig and the like.

When dealing with operations at sea such as Navy shipboard exercises or private rescue operations for people and or vessels a wave slap event or excessive wind can cause the suspended mass to rotate multiple revolutions which in turn may cause severe damage to the fairings and in extreme cases the cables may be damaged beyond use.

U.S. Pat. No. 8 226 042 to Howell et al. issued Jul. 24 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference describes a spin control system that includes first and second thrusters coupled to an object hanging from a suspension member. When activated the first and second thrusters generate thrust in opposing directions that are substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the suspension member. When the object spins a controller activates at least one of the first and second thrusters to approximately align the object with a reference position.

While U.S. Pat. No. 8 226 042 teaches the basic equipment that could be utilized in a spin control system the patent does not describe a control system that is effective in using the thrusters for controlling spin or yaw. The patent requires unspecified reference information or manual inputs that can be used to predict the spin rotation which then determine which thruster to operate. The patent also assumes that the suspended equipment remains in a particular reference position that does not vary in pitch or roll which can affect the working distance between the thruster and cable and the resulting amount of foot pounds of force produced by the thrusters. Moreover the patent does not provide the factors involved in making a prediction of the anticipated direction of spin or method for responding without a prediction of anticipated direction of spin. Also the patent does not teach any means to counteract environmental factors cable spring and damping factors that affect spin and pitch changes or system noise from the thrusters winches helicopter or other system noise that affects the ability of the control system to operate effectively for this purpose.

Accordingly a need exists for an improved spin or yaw stabilization control system that can more effectively counter undesired rotation of a single cable suspended mass in yaw. Accordingly those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses the above discussed issues.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved control system and method for stabilizing a position of a suspended mass.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a control system and method for stabilizing a suspended mass that actively controls the yaw position of the mass with respect to a defined reference position.

Another object of the invention is to provide a control system and method for stabilizing a suspended mass that can allow careful angular manipulation of loads in tight spaces during lifting as well as maintain a load in a steady position during inclement weather and harsh environments.

A further object of the invention is to provide an improved control system and method for stabilizing a suspended mass that requires only one suspension cable which greatly reduces the required system complexity cost and maintenance for the lifting mechanism.

Accordingly the present invention comprises a control system for stabilizing a suspended load in yaw. The suspended load is subject to variable environmental disturbances acting on the suspended load that affect the yaw. In one embodiment the invention may comprise a single suspension cable attached to the suspended load at least one sensor is operable for measuring the yaw of the suspended load and at least one thruster is affixed to the suspended load at a position laterally offset from the single suspension cable. The thruster is oriented to produce a force moment to stabilize the suspended load in yaw.

A control processing unit is operably connected with the sensor and the thruster. The control processing unit utilizes a control feedback loop to control the thruster to stabilize the suspended load in yaw. The control feedback loop may comprise at least one filter that receives data from the sensor.

The system may further comprise a user interface for interacting with the control processing unit that allows a user to input an estimate of the variable environmental disturbances.

The control system may further comprise a cable connection between the suspension cable and the load that results in pitch or roll of the suspended load during operation and may further comprise a sensor for measuring the pitch or roll. The control processing unit can be configured for determining differences in a force moment produced by the thruster as a result of the pitch or roll.

The suspension cable may have a variable length during operation whereby the suspension cable comprises a variable spring parameter and a variable damping parameter during operation. The control system can be configured to utilize at least one value for each of the variable spring parameter and the variable damping parameter for controlling the thruster.

In one embodiment the control system assumes a constant value for each of the variable spring parameter and the variable damping parameter. Depending on the implementation the constant value for each of the variable spring parameter and the variable damping parameter becomes more accurate as the variable length of the cable shortens.

In another embodiment the control system may further comprise a cable length sensor and a lookup table. The control system can be configured to utilize the cable length sensor to select values from the lookup table for each of the variable spring parameter and the variable damping parameter based on a length of the suspended cable.

The cable length sensor may comprise at least one of an encoder or an accelerometer. A. low pass filter may be used to receive data from the cable length sensor.

In another embodiment the sensor for measuring yaw of the suspended load may comprise a GPS sensor. The GPS sensor can be further configured to measure a length of the single suspension cable.

The filter in the feedback loop of the control system may comprise a software filter that is selectable between a Kalman filter and a low pass filter.

The system may further comprise a user interface operable for interacting with the control processing unit that allows a user to selectively change a selected yaw position of the suspended load during a lift.

The system may further comprise a user interface for interacting with the control processing unit allowing a user to input at least one of a cable length a load weight or desired yaw position of the suspended load.

Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein. It is to be understood however that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system structure or manner.

The proposed invention is a control system for a mass hanging from a single cable. By a single cable it is meant that the resultant force vector on the single cable is directed in a substantially single direction in line with the cable. A single cable may comprise multiple strands or groups of strands and may effectively comprise several cables intertwined together that direct the force generally in line with the cable. A single cable may typically utilize a single winch or group of pulleys or the like. Moreover a single cable may connect directly to a load or may connect with a harness comprising several different cables that are oriented in different directions whereby a single winch or the like is utilized for the lift. Different cables would be those that have different force vectors in different directions on different cables.

The system may be utilized with various lifting systems such as cranes and winches. Also the winch may be mounted on a helicopter for lifting loads out of the water or off a hard surface. Control system seeks to track a desired yaw orientation of the load and prevent spinning of the load. The desired yaw orientation may or may not change with height depending on the lift requirements.

Significant spinning or yaw control problems can be created as a result of random disturbances that may act on suspended mass or load in the Y axis direction and or the X axis direction that affect pitch or roll sometimes referred to herein as and which may cause a moment in yaw . The pitch and or roll of the system due to oscillation of cable may affect yaw and or the force moment created by thruster system and accordingly can be accounted for by the control system of the present invention.

Also of note is the relative location of thruster system laterally with respect to cable . Knowledge of the location is important in the design of control system and must be known for determining the force moment. As discussed herein in some cases movement of the load may cause changes in the force moment that should be accounted for.

Thruster system may comprise one or more thrusters of various types examples of which are shown in previously discussed U.S. Pat. No. 8 226 042. In that example two thrusters pointed in opposite directions comprise electrically controlled turbines which generate thrust that scales linearly with voltage. In another example a single thruster with two open ends may be utilized where the rotor or blades are reversible. Other possible examples of thrusters may utilize compressed air or jets such as hydrogen peroxide rockets which may be controlled with electrically controllable valves or the like. Depending on the type of thruster a more complex transfer function for the thruster can be utilized. Moreover the present invention could be modified to accommodate thrusters that also act to control pitch or roll if desired.

In this example F is the force output by thruster system and D is the disturbances caused by the environment on line and suspended mass . The distance along side a of mass or load if at a pitch of angle as indicated may result in a parallel distance of thruster between cable and a line that runs through the center of thruster and is parallel to cable which distance can vary with the pitch. Likewise swinging of the cable may affect operation of the control system. Constants of the system include b and k.

In one embodiment suspended mass can be assumed to be symmetric in all axes and isotropic so center of mass and the center of area are the same. In other cases the force due to gravity will act through center of mass and the disturbances due to wind or other environmental forces will act through the center of area which is exposed to the forces.

A yaw initial state or initial reference position for the yaw or quantity can be determined based on initial positioning of the load. For example the yaw initial state or reference state may be designated as the static orientation of mass or load before the load is lifted by line . In this case control system must be active and measuring for a short time before load is lifted to determine the initial state. Likewise the desired reference position or desired yaw position for the load must be known relative to the initial state.

The yaw position and or spin and derivatives thereof can be measured with sensors such as rate gyroscopes and or other sensors. However the invention is not limited to use of rate gyroscopes. In one embodiment sensors may comprise dual GPS hardware that could be utilized to determine not only true angular positioning but also to calculate the length of cable being used and or the absolute height location of the load.

In one possible embodiment sensors such as inexpensive lightweight sturdy low power requirement and compact rate gyroscopes are placed onto the mass or load that detect both yaw rotation spin and yaw angular orientation of mass or load . Sensors can be used to measure the first derivative of which can then be integrated to find . In most cases applicable to control system the angular accelerations measured are expected to be relatively low and because of this care can then be taken to select rate gyroscopes with a smaller range of operation e.g. less than 150 degrees per second to avoid excessive quantization errors.

Because the moment created by thruster system is a function of the parallel distance to cable connection point as seen in if load is expected to vary in roll and or pitch then pitch and or roll must also be measured. Accordingly sensors may comprise different rate gyroscopes to measure pitch and or roll.

For example the measurement of pitch can be accomplished with sensors in the same way as such as with a rate gyroscope but in the other axis. For a static load the pitch is generally not anticipated to change significantly once load is completely off the ground. However if line is fastened on one end of load then the pitch will change drastically during the lifting process until load is off the ground. This is important because the moment arm of thruster system is greatly changed as a result of the pitch change. Oscillations due to cable stretch can also cause pitch changes.

Referring now to the hardware can be configured such that thruster system and sensors are run on separate power supplies with common grounds. In this example thruster system is powered by power supply through power line and operably connected with control processing unit by data line . Sensors such as one or more rate gyroscopes or other sensors discussed herein are connected with control processing unit by power line and data line . Control processing unit is powered by power supply through power line .

Interacting with central control processing unit is user interface for selecting parameters such as weight and size of load and the sensor package containing gyroscopes or other sensors. User interface connects with control processing unit through dedicated data line and dedicated power line . It will be noted that user interface may also be wirelessly connected to interface without the need for power connection. User interface may provide further options for use some of which are discussed herein.

Because gyroscopes and or other sensors are inherently noisy and the signal must be integrated there is potential for large errors to accumulate. If the disturbances are expected to be relatively light such as from a light wind then a Kalman filter is used in conjunction with the known system model to estimate the true position state based on measurements which can be assumed to be noisy.

The lift requirements may involve a single or pure lift that lifts load to a desired position. Alternatively the lift requirements may involve multiple height lifts where load is raised to a particular height or set of heights or may involve a relatively long lift. For the single or pure lift the cable variables of interest such as spring and damping constants may be considered as one value as discussed below. However for multiple lifts such factors may vary significantly enough to need special consideration.

Referring to in single lift control loop the desired yaw position with respect to the reference position is provided as indicated at . If desired the desired yaw position may be manually input with user interface see . In this embodiment proportional integral derivate PID controller utilizes the difference between an error signal and desired yaw position to produce a control signal that includes system noise which may comprise noise from the thrusters winch helicopter if used cable stretch factors such as spring and damping and other system noise. System comprises thrusters that respond to the control signal plus noise. Sensors measure the yaw position or pitch or roll and produce feedback that includes sensor noise . This feedback signal is applied to Kalman filter that attempts to more accurately determine the correct sensor signal. Kalman filter uses a recursive Bayesian analysis to determine a probable state based on the combination of a noisy measurement and a linearized estimate of load .

In cases where Kalman filtering is impractical for example a multi height manipulation case to be discussed hereinafter simple low pass filtering and high quality sensors can be used as discussed with respect to .

As the difference in these two cases is preferably only in control software the user can select which type of system to be used as discussed hereinafter with respect to which shows a combined system utilizing user interface . The user may also input factors such as whether the expected disturbances acting on load will be high or low utilizing user interface . An example of a low disturbance environment would be a construction site on a calm day. A high disturbance environment would be a coast guard helicopter lifting something out of the ocean during a storm such as a person or a vessel.

With an accurate estimation of PID controller can be implemented to operate control system as shown in the block diagram for the basic system pure lifting depicted in .

The major concern with regard to linearization is the fact that the spring and damping parameters of cable will change as mass or load is lifted. It is normally expected that the spring constant will rise and the damping will fall as cable is shortened and load is raised.

For pure lifting cases where load is expected to be grabbed at the ground and lifted all the way up PID controller can be tuned to be optimal at the top of the lift while remaining stable at the lower portion. This is effectively linearizing the non linear lift system model about the highest possible position. As one example of such a system the damping and spring parameters of cable are measured when cable is short or at another desired position and then it is assumed that those values remain constant. These parameters may also be obtained for standard cable sizes and materials by referring to already published or known data for the specific cable. If a constant cable parameter assumption is made PID controller design becomes a linear 2nd order system problem with sensor noise and system noise . System noise may comprise noise of overall lifting and control system such as thrusters winch and the like being accounted for when stabilizing load .

If the upper position of the lift is used as the parameter assumption as discussed above load may oscillate some amount at or near the bottom position where the assumed values for spring and damping constants are less accurate. As load rises however control system will become more and more capable of steadying load resulting in the desired correct orientation near the end of the lift.

Referring now to multi level control loop can be utilized for cases where suspended load is manipulated at varying heights. For example the desired orientation may be changed at different heights to avoid obstacles. Accordingly in this embodiment it is preferable to track and account for the length of cable being used. Experimentally a function for spring and damping parameters can be determined for each given cable length and based on the baseline values for cable previously determined for the pure lifting case.

Various types of sensors such as accelerometers encoders GPS sensors and the like can be utilized to determine cable length. In this example acceleration is measured to determine cable length.

With spring and damping parameters known for different cable lengths PID controller can be tuned for the whole of the possible range of cable lengths for cable and my utilize finite sections for this purpose. Accordingly the PID constants stored in lookup table can provide damping and spring parameter for different lengths of cable . If the various system parameters are known then the design of PIP controller can be accomplished in control system software.

During operation and referring to controller utilizes the height based on sensors such as but not limited to an integrated accelerometer in the case of a stationary upper cable attachment point or rotary encoder at the cable coil if the upper attachment point is free to move. PID controller accounts for system noise generated by the overall lifting system . Detected signals such as pitch and yaw can be determined by accounting for sensor noise and then fed through low pass filter before comparison with the desired reference position . Similarly acceleration if detected using an accelerometer can be found by accounting for sensor noise and then fed through low pass filter to determine cable length. Finally the appropriate values for k and b will be found by looking up the corresponding values for the PID parameters to create the control signal in lookup table and sent back to controller .

The control system of shows a combination of the control systems and discussed hereinbefore. The type of lifting case either pure or single lifting scenario or multi height lifting case is selected at . Measured parameters are provided at . Various other user inputs such as expected high or low environmental forces can be provided as part of user inputs . The desired position as compared to a reference position is provided at . For each case in yaw the position of load is found by rate gyroscopes at and the signal conditioned at and or to filter out signal noise and lift system noise. For the single or pure lift system a control signal for the system is calculated at step before being transmitted to the thruster system for stabilizing and or manipulating suspended mass or load .

For the multiple height manipulation case reference position is established and a user selects the multiple height manipulation case at . Measured or selected parameters may be provided or input at step . Various other user inputs can be provided at step . The position of load is measured by rate gyroscopes or sensors at step and the signal conditioned at step . The length of cable is measured by an accelerometer or rotary encoder at step before being conditioned through a low pass filter at step . This signal is compared to the parameters input at step in a lookup table for acceleration and theta values at step . Finally an output signal is sent to the thruster system at step .

Accordingly the control system is able to stabilize the suspended load rotation on the single cable with thrusters placed on the load that produce a force orthogonal to the cable. The thrusters are utilized to create a counter movement such that the angular positioning converges to a given reference or orientation of the mass or load.

The present invention contemplates system implementations for both a loading that is substantially effective as the length of the cable changes and also for multi height manipulation cases where cable changes are substantial or that the suspended masses or loads may be better controlled with specific controls based on the different levels.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
