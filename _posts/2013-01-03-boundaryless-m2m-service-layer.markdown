title: Boundary-less M2M service layer
abstract: A system may include a boundary-less machine-to-machine (“M2M”) service layer, which may reside between an application layer and a core network layer. The boundary-less M2M service layer may allow M2M applications to interact with multiple applications (e.g., multiple M2M applications, multiple non-M2M applications, or a mix of both). The boundary-less M2M service layer may also allow M2M devices and applications to interact over various types of networks, such as wireless and wireline networks.

Machine to machine M2M technologies may refer to computing devices that transmit information such as sensed information e.g. temperature values inventory levels etc. to other computing devices which may act on the information. M2M technologies typically use a sensor or meter to capture the raw data. The raw data may be relayed through a network to an application e.g. a software program that translates the raw data into meaningful information e.g. a temperature spike items need to be restocked etc. .

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

A system and or method described herein may provide a boundary less machine to machine M2M service layer BMSL which may allow M2M applications and devices to interact with any type of application such as non M2M applications and or other M2M applications via any type of network such as wireless and or wireline networks . For example as shown in a BMSL may act as an interface between a set of networks e.g. a wireless network and a wired network and a set of applications e.g. a set of M2M applications and a set of non M2M applications . In some implementations the BMSL may allow an M2M application to interact with multiple other M2M and or non M2M applications within a single session e.g. within a single Packet Data Protocol PDP context .

The BMSL may act as a single point of control for M2M applications session oriented communications and or session less communications. By acting as a single point of control the BMSL may allow a high level of configurability for an administrator of the BMSL. Additionally since the BMSL may act as a single point of control the BMSL may provide the opportunity for more simplified billing of users of applications or services. Since the BMSL may act as a single point of control the BMSL may allow for the collection of statistics based on which service providers may make business decisions e.g. decisions regarding subscription rates network infrastructure advertising etc. .

Furthermore in some implementations the BMSL may allow M2M devices to communicate with applications and or other devices via any type of access network e.g. wireless access networks and or wired access networks and or core network e.g. core networks that include an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem IMS and or core networks that do not include an IMS . In this sense the BMSL may be viewed as an abstraction layer between a core network and applications that communicate with M2M devices.

The BMSL of some implementations may enforce quality of service QoS and or other policies that are associated with one or more associated networks e.g. one or more core networks via which the BMSL facilitates communications between M2M devices and applications . In some implementations the BMSL may enforce application interaction rules e.g. conditions under which communications associated with one application may interrupt communications associated with another application . In some implementations the BMSL may provide load balancing services for applications e.g. may throttle and or redistribute requests for particular applications based on load associated with the applications .

Based on at least some of the advantages mentioned above the BMSL may provide a framework for real time integration with multi vendor applications to existing core network infrastructures which may allow service providers to provide enhanced functionality without significant cost. This may enable new business models for service delivery and provide the ability for fast customization of services.

MGW may include one or more devices that convert digital media streams between different telecommunication networks. For example MGW may implement a VoIP MGW which may convert time division multiplexing TDM voice signals to a media streaming protocol such as Real time Transport Protocol RTP . MGW controller may include one or more devices that receive signaling information e.g. dialed phone number digits and may control MGW based on the signaling information e.g. instruct MGW to alert a called party .

BMSL may include one or more devices that allow M2M applications to interact with any type of application e.g. other M2M applications and or non M2M applications and may further allow M2M devices to interact with applications via any type of access network e.g. via a RAN or a wireline network . BMSL may include for example application broker and M2M Policy and Rules Function MPRF .

Application broker may include one or more devices that allow communication between multiple M2M applications and between M2M and non M2M applications. For example application broker may implement a BMSL application programming interface API which may handle functions invoked by M2M applications according to the BMSL API. For instance the BMSL API may allow a particular M2M application to request that a voice call be made with certain parameters e.g. a phone number to be dialed a message to be played etc. . In such a situation the M2M application may send a request to application broker that a voice call be made along with the parameters. Based on this request and possibly other factors such as policies and or rules application broker may cause the voice call to be made e.g. via a non M2M VoIP application according to the parameters.

As another example the BMSL API may allow M2M applications to communicate with each other. For instance the BMSL API may include an interface function which allows an M2M application to send data to another M2M application and causes the other M2M application to receive the data e.g. to listen for the data . For instance assume that a temperature monitoring M2M application receives information regarding a temperature of a house from a particular M2M device e.g. a M2M device that includes a thermometer . When the temperature reaches a certain level the temperature monitoring M2M application may send a message to application broker . This message may be addressed to another application such as a mobile personal emergency response system mPERS application indicating that the temperature has reached the certain level. While the mPERS application may traditionally be a M2M application e.g. an application that is designed to receive and interpret data received from M2M devices the mPERS application according to some implementations may be able to receive and interpret data from other applications e.g. the temperature monitoring M2M application via the interface provided by the BMSL API.

In some implementations application broker may perform access control for multiple applications. For example assume that multiple communications are received during a single session e.g. during a phone call . For instance continuing with the above example assume that the mPERS causes a voice call to be made to a particular user e.g. a subscriber associated with M2M device based on the temperature reaching the certain level. Further assume that the particular user is already on a voice call. Application broker may determine e.g. based on a set of policies and or rules as described below with respect to MPRF whether to interrupt the user s voice call in order to provide the user with information regarding the temperature.

In some implementations application broker may handle application communications in a particular order based on for example the type of communication received the identity of an application from which the communication was received etc. For instance as described below with respect to for example application broker may await the output of one application before invoking another application during the same session. In this sense application broker may use the output of one application as input for another application.

Application broker of some implementations may assist in enforcing a set of policies associated with communications to and or from M2M devices and or application servers . For instance application broker may provide information to PCRF regarding communications sent to and or received from IMS network based on which IMS network may enforce a particular QoS. In this sense even over different networks e.g. different core networks and or different access networks application broker may provide network functionality for which various applications are designed e.g. applications that are designed for wireless and or wireline networks . For example a particular M2M application may be designed with a particular QoS requirement which may be typically associated with a wireline access network. In some implementations application broker may allow a particular M2M device to communicate with the M2M application via a wireless access network by causing the particular QoS requirement to be enforced by the wireless access network.

MPRF may store conditions and policies based on which application broker may perform some or all of the functionality described above. For example MPRF may store identification information regarding M2M applications identification and or subscriber information associated with M2M devices QoS information e.g. bandwidth or latency requirements delivery guarantees access technology delivery delay tolerance etc. M2M access network type M2M acquisition point driver M2M application access modem mapping policies and or other types of policies and or rules related to M2M devices or applications.

MPRF may receive the information regarding conditions and policies from one or more other devices such as from a network device associated with a core network. For instance in some implementations MPRF may receive information from PCRF of IMS network . Additionally or alternatively MPRF may receive information from an administrator associated with MPRF e.g. a service provider associated with BMSL .

For instance referring to an example discussed above in which a particular M2M application requests that a voice call be made to a particular phone number MPRF may provide the particular phone number to application broker . Based on whether the policies and or rules stored by MPRF specify to do so MPRF may additionally provide other information e.g. information that was not specifically requested to be sent by a particular M2M application such as a name and or a telephone number of a subscriber associated with M2M device .

Referring to another example discussed above in which application broker uses the output of one application as input for another application MPRF may store information identifying a manner in which to handle outputs and inputs of particular applications. For instance MPRF may store information identifying that when a particular type of communication is received from a M2M application e.g. a request for a voice call to be made actions taken based on the communication should be based on additional information e.g. the request for the voice call should additionally include subscriber information such as name and telephone number .

As further shown in environment may include a set of application servers . Application servers may include for example M2M wireless application server non M2M wireless application server M2M wireline application server and non M2M wireline application server . Although shown in this figure as a set of application servers e.g. a set of server devices one or more of application servers may be implemented as a virtual device e.g. as software running on a set of physical devices . Furthermore in some implementations multiple application servers may be implemented within a single server device while in some implementations a single application server may be implemented across multiple server devices. Additionally environment may include fewer application servers more application servers different application servers and or differently arranged application servers . For example in some implementations environment may include multiple M2M wireless application servers no non M2M wireless application servers etc.

M2M wireless application server may execute one or more applications as implemented in software and or hardware which are designed to interact with M2M devices via a wireless access network e.g. may be designed to send and or receive communications by using one or more wireless protocols and or may be designed with a particular QoS requirement . Some such applications may include for example a telematics M2M application e.g. an application that receives and processes information from M2M devices that collect telemetry information such as telemetry information associated with vehicles a healthcare application e.g. an application that receives and processes information from M2M devices that collect health related information such as heartbeat information blood sugar information blood pressure information etc. or a home security M2M application e.g. an application that receives and processes information from M2M devices that collect home security information such as video monitoring information security system information etc. .

One or more M2M applications associated with application server may be designed according to a BMSL API of some implementations. That is a particular M2M application associated with application server may be capable of communicating with other applications e.g. other M2M applications or non M2M applications . For example the BMSL API may provide a function which may be invoked by the particular M2M application which may allow the particular M2M application to output data. In some implementations the BMSL API may allow the particular M2M application to specify a recipient application e.g. identify by an application identifier . In some implementations BMSL e.g. application broker may identify a recipient application based on policies and or rules e.g. as stored by MPRF .

Non M2M wireless application server may execute one or more applications as implemented in software and or hardware which are not necessarily designed to interact with M2M devices e.g. smartphones tablet computers or the like via a wireless access network e.g. may be designed to send and or receive communications by using one or more wireless protocols and or may be designed with a particular QoS requirement . Such applications may include for example a voice call application such as a VoIP application a videoconferencing application a file transfer application etc.

One or more non M2M applications associated with application server may be designed according to a BMSL API of some implementations. That is a particular non M2M application associated with application server may be capable of communicating with other applications e.g. other M2M applications or non M2M applications . For example the BMSL API may provide a function which may be invoked by the particular non M2M application which may allow the particular non M2M application to output data. In some implementations the BMSL API may provide an interface e.g. a logical interface via which the particular non M2M application may receive information from one or more other applications e.g. a M2M application that invokes a function of the BMSL API through which the M2M application provides information to the non M2M application .

M2M wireline application server may execute one or more applications as implemented in software and or hardware which are designed to interact with M2M devices via a wireline access network e.g. may be designed to send and or receive communications by using one or more wireline protocols and or may be designed with a particular QoS requirement . One or more M2M applications associated with application server may be designed according to a BMSL API of some implementations. That is a particular M2M application associated with application server may be capable of communicating with other applications e.g. other M2M applications or non M2M applications .

Non M2M wireline application server may execute one or more applications as implemented in software and or hardware which are designed to interact with non M2M devices e.g. smartphones tablet computers or the like via a wireline access network e.g. may be designed to send and or receive communications by using one or more wireline protocols and or may be designed with a particular QoS requirement . One or more non M2M applications associated with application server may be designed according to a BMSL API of some implementations. That is a particular non M2M application associated with application server may be capable of communicating with other applications e.g. other M2M applications or non M2M applications . For example the BMSL API may provide a function which may be invoked by the particular non M2M application which may allow the particular non M2M application to output data. In some implementations the BMSL API may provide an interface e.g. a logical interface via which the particular non M2M application may receive information from one or more other applications e.g. a M2M application that invokes a function of the BMSL API through which the M2M application provides information to the non M2M application .

M2M client application may include for example an application implemented via hardware and or software that collects and or outputs data. For example M2M client application may receive temperature data from a temperature sensing device associated with M2M device and may output some or all of the received temperature data to M2M application server via M2M gateway .

BMSL client may include for example an application implemented via hardware and or software that allows M2M device to communicate with a BMSL e.g. with BMSL . In some implementations BMSL client may receive data from M2M client application e.g. via M2M gateway and may output the data to BMSL . In some implementations when outputting data to BMSL BMSL client may modify the data and or add additional data. For example in some implementations when outputting data to BMSL BMSL client may include information such as a device type of M2M device e.g. information identifying a type of sensor included in M2M device such as a thermometer a pressure sensor a video camera etc. type of data outputted by M2M device e.g. temperature data pressure data video data etc. a device identifier of M2M device e.g. an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity IMEI etc. authentication information that allows BMSL to authenticate M2M device e.g. authentication information via which BMSL may accept communications to and or from M2M device address information associated with BMSL e.g. a Uniform Resource Locator URL a Uniform Resource Identifier URI an IP address etc. and or other information.

In some implementations M2M client application and or BMSL client may be dynamic in that a user of device may replace a particular M2M client application and or BMSL client with a different respective M2M client application and or BMSL client . For example a user may purchase M2M device which may initially include M2M gateway . The user may download a particular M2M client application which may for example dictate the manner in which device collects and or outputs data e.g. a collection and or output interval . The user may also download a particular BMSL client which may be provided by for example a service provider associated with BMSL .

M2M client application and M2M gateway may communicate via a logical interface such as a device application interface e.g. a dIa interface as specified by for example the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI M2M technical specification TS 102.921 TS 102.690 and or TS 102.689 . The dIa interface may define a set of communications via which M2M gateway may receive information regarding capabilities of M2M client application . In some implementations M2M client application and M2M gateway may communicate via an enhanced dIa interface shown in as dIa . Using dIa M2M client application and or M2M gateway may transmit messages to each other with information beyond a specified dIa standard. In some implementations M2M gateway may communicate with BMSL client using the dIa interface and in some implementations M2M device may communicate with BMSL using the dIa interface.

As shown in CDF CGF may communicate with BMSL via a logical interface such as a Rf interface. The Rf interface may be based on e.g. may be an enhanced version of a Rf interface as specified by for example the 3GPP TS 32.225 and TS 32.299. The Rf interface may facilitate interaction between a Charging Trigger Function CTF and CDF CGF . In some implementations a Rf interface may connect CDF CGF to BMSL e.g. to application broker and one or more other devices e.g. a Network Service Capability Layer NSCL CTF . Using Rf CDF CGF and BMSL may communicate with information beyond a specified Rf standard. For example the Rf interface may include information regarding application brokering events and M2M NSCL data communication events.

Via the Rx interface PCRF may output application level session information such as IP service data flow SDF filters for policy control and or charging bandwidth requirements for QoS sponsor data e.g. application ID usage threshold event triggers etc. . Furthermore via the Rx interface PCRF may provide M2M session less QoS data bearer setup trigger information and or other M2M domain specific parameters to BMSL .

As further shown in HSS AAA server may communicate with BMSL via a logical interface such as a Sh interface. The Sh interface may be based on e.g. may be an enhanced version of a Sh interface as specified by for example the 3GPP TS 29.328 and TS 29.329 . Using the Sh interface transparent data such as service related information and telecom user related information e.g. a Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number MSISDN visited network capabilities serving user cell identifier address of a serving network element etc. may be communicated to BMSL by HSS AAA server . In some implementations using the Sh interface HSS AAA server may output other information such as extensions or parameters that can be used by application broker to proxy IMS traffic between a M2M application and a IMS user agent UA associated with M2M Device via a IMS Back to Back User Agent B2BUA .

The mIa interface may be based on e.g. may be an enhanced version of a M2M application mIa interface as specified by for example the ETSI M2M TS 102.921 TS 102.690 and or TS 102.689 . Via the mIa interface application server and BMSL e.g. application broker may communicate according to a BMSL API e.g. an API that allows application server to communicate with other application servers via application broker . Additionally or alternatively via the mIa interface BMSL and application server may communicate information regarding voice and or video IMS triggers as well as M2M domain specific parameters.

As shown in application broker and MPRF may communicate via a logical interface such as an Mp interface.

Although examples of interfaces are shown in in some implementations additional different fewer or differently arranged interfaces may be used. For instance in some implementations in lieu of a Rx interface PCRF and BMSL may be communicatively coupled via a Rx interface and or another interface.

Process may include receiving an M2M communication from an M2M device block . For example application broker may receive data from M2M device . Application broker may receive the data via any type of access network and or any type of core network e.g. IMS network or network . For example the data may be received by application broker via a mId interface.

Process may also include identifying an M2M application associated with the M2M communication block . For example application broker may determine based on the communication a particular M2M application that is associated with the communication. Application broker may identify the application based on for example a set of policies and or rules stored by and or received from MPRF . For instance MPRF may store information that correlates M2M devices e.g. by device identifier of M2M device to applications. Additionally or alternatively the communication received at block may include information that identifies the application associated with the communication.

Process may further include outputting the M2M communication to the identified M2M application block . For example application broker may output the M2M communication received at block to a particular application server which is associated with the identified M2M application. As shown in application broker may output the M2M communication to application server via a mIa interface.

Process may additionally include receiving a non M2M communication from the M2M application block . For example application broker may receive a communication from the particular application server via the mIa interface which is intended for a non M2M application e.g. a VoIP application .

Process may also include identifying a non M2M application associated with the non M2M communication block . For example application broker may identify the non M2M application based on a set of policies and or rules stored by and or received from MPRF . For instance MPRF may store information that correlates applications to each other. In this example MPRF may store information that correlates the M2M application to a particular non M2M application e.g. the information may indicate that information received from the M2M application should be forwarded to the non M2M application . Additionally or alternatively the non M2M communication may include information identifying the non M2M application e.g. an application identifier associated with the non M2M application .

Additionally or alternatively the non M2M communication may include a request for a particular service e.g. a voice call service a video call service a video conferencing service a short messaging service SMS a multimedia messaging service MMS a file transfer service a web browsing service an e mail service etc. . Based on this request for the service application broker may identify a non M2M application to which the communication should be forwarded e.g. a non M2M VoIP application . In some implementations application broker may make this determination based on information received from MPRF . That is the mIa interface may allow an M2M application to request services and policy information stored by MPRF may indicate how such service requests should be handled e.g. applications associated with the services load balancing rules for distributing the requests for service etc. .

Process may further include identifying additional parameters associated with the non M2M communication block . For example MPRF may store policy and or rule information indicating additional parameters to include with the non M2M communication when forwarding the non M2M communication to a non M2M application. These parameters may be based on for example predetermined arrangements between application vendors and or service providers.

For example one particular policy and or rule may indicate that communications from a particular application should be modified before forwarding the communications to another application e.g. a subscriber name and or telephone number should be added before forwarding the communications to another application . As another example one particular policy and or rule may indicate that communications to a particular application should be modified before forwarding the communications to the particular application. As yet another example one particular policy and or rule may indicate that communications of a certain type e.g. requests for a voice call to be made should be modified in a certain way while communications of another type e.g. requests for an email to be sent should be modified a different way and or unmodified .

Process may additionally include providing the non M2M communication to the non M2M application based on the additional parameters block . For example application broker may output the non M2M communication received at block as potentially modified based on information identified at block to the identified non M2M application. For instance application server may output the non M2M communication to application server via the mla interface.

The home monitoring application may analyze the received data and may determine that an event has occurred. For example the home monitoring application may determine that a burglar has broken into a home in which camera is located that a person has fallen down and has not moved for five minutes or another event. Based on making this determination and as shown in the home monitoring application may send a communication to the BMSL.

For example assume that the home monitoring application has determined that a person has fallen down and has not moved for five minutes. In this situation the home monitoring application may send a request for an emergency response. In some implementations this request may be a request for an emergency response according to a mIa interface without specifically identifying an application that should handle the emergency response. In some such implementations the BMSL may determine an appropriate application to handle the request e.g. an M2M application that handles request for emergency responses . As shown in assume that the BMSL identifies a M2M emergency response application to handle the request.

The BMSL may output a communication to the identified M2M emergency response application based on the communication received from the home monitoring application. In some implementations the BMSL may add additional information to the communication to the M2M emergency response application which was not included in the communication from the home monitoring application. For instance assume that the communication from the home monitoring application did not include a subscriber address associated with camera . In some implementations the BMSL may include the subscriber address in the communication provided to the M2M emergency response application e.g. based on information received from and or stored by an MPRF associated with the BMSL .

The M2M emergency response application may receive the communication e.g. the communication indicating that a person has fallen down and has not moved for five minutes and may determine a proper response e.g. place a voice call requesting an ambulance for the subscriber s address . As shown in the M2M emergency response application may output a communication to the BMSL. This communication may include for example a service request for a voice call and may include an audio recording to play over the voice call e.g. an automatically generated audio recording that indicates the type of emergency the address to send an ambulance etc. . In some implementations the communication may include information regarding an emergency telephone number to call e.g. 9 1 1 . Additionally or alternatively the BMSL may determine an appropriate emergency telephone number e.g. based on policies and or rules stored by an MPRF associated with the BMSL .

Continuing with this example the BMSL may identify a non M2M VoIP application over which the voice call may be made. The BMSL may output a communication to the VoIP application which may cause the VoIP to initiate a voice call e.g. a voice call to an emergency telephone number and to play the automatically generated recording.

In the example shown in the BMSL may process all of the above described communications within a single session e.g. within a single PDP context . By processing these communications within a single session the BMSL may use the output of one application as input for another application. Furthermore processing these communications within a single session may save time and or resources that would be expended by implementations which would open multiple sessions.

The health monitoring application may analyze the received data and may determine that an event has occurred. For example the health monitoring application may determine that a measured heartbeat is above a high threshold is below a low threshold or that another event has occurred. Based on making this determination and as shown in the health monitoring application may send a communication to the BMSL.

For example assume that the health monitoring application has determined that a measured heartbeat has exceeded a threshold level. In this situation the health monitoring application may output a notification of this event. In some implementations this notification may include a request to notify a physician and or family members of a person whose heartbeat is being measured. Alternatively in some implementations this notification may not include a request to notify a physician or family members. In some such implementations policy information e.g. as stored by an MPRF associated with the BMSL may indicate that the physician and family members should be notified when a notification of a heartbeat event is received from the health monitoring application.

The BMSL may identify contact information for the physician and the family members. For example an MPRF associated with the BMSL may store information regarding a device e.g. a telephone number of a beeper associated with the physician and may also store information regarding one or more devices e.g. telephone numbers of telephones such as landline or cellular telephones associated with the family members. The BMSL may also identify one or more applications by which the physician and the family member may be contacted.

For example the BMSL may identify a VoIP application e.g. a non M2M application which may be used to dial the beeper associated with the physician. The BMSL may also identify a conferencing application which may be used to simultaneously call multiple telephones e.g. multiple telephones associated with multiple family members .

In some implementations the M2M telematics device may be associated with a video output device such as an in vehicle video monitor. Via this video monitor the M2M telematics device may output video pertaining to telematics measured by the telematics device streaming home surveillance video and or television programs. In this sense the BMSL may serve as a unifying service layer and may enable the in vehicle telematics device to deliver multiple types of content from M2M or non M2M application domains.

Bus may include one or more communication paths that permit communication among the components of device . Processor may include a processor microprocessor or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions. Memory may include any type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor and or any type of non volatile storage device that may store information for use by processor .

Input component may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to device such as a keyboard a keypad a button a switch etc. Output component may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator such as a display a speaker one or more light emitting diodes LEDs etc.
