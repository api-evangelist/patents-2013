This application is a Divisional application of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 108 313 filed on May 16 2011 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 352 142 filed Jun. 7 2010 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to building materials and more particularly to acoustical sound proofing materials that reduce the transmission of sound from one room to an adjacent room. Methods of making the acoustical sound proofing material are also disclosed.

Noise control is a rapidly growing economic and public policy concern for the construction industry. Areas with high acoustical isolation commonly referred to as soundproofed are requested and required for a variety of purposes. Apartments condominiums hotels schools and hospitals all require rooms with doors walls ceilings and floors that reduce the transmission of sound thereby minimizing or eliminating the disturbance to people in adjacent rooms. Soundproofing is particularly important in buildings adjacent to public transportation such as highways airports and railroad lines. One measure of the severity of multi party residential and commercial noise control issues is the widespread emergence of model building codes and design guidelines that specify minimum Sound Transmission Class STC ratings for specific wall and door structures within a building.

In the past walls typically were made up of studs with drywall on both exterior surfaces of the studs and baffles or plates commonly placed between the studs in an attempt to reduce the transmission of sound from one room to the next. Unfortunately even the best of such walls using standard drywall are capable of only reducing sound transmission by approximately 30 db and much of that is focused on mid range and high frequencies rather than lower frequencies which cause most of residential and commercial complaints.

Various techniques and products have emerged to abate this problem. For example replacement of wooden studs by steel studs resilient channels to offset and isolate drywall panels from studs mass loaded vinyl barriers cellulose sound board cellulose and fiberglass batt insulation and techniques such as staggered beam and double beam construction. All help reduce the transmission of noise but again not to such an extent that certain sounds e.g. lower frequencies high decibel in a given room are prevented from being transmitted to an adjacent room including rooms above or below.

Accordingly a need remains for an acoustical sound proofing material and a new method of construction to reduce the transmission of sound from a given room to an adjacent room.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 352 142 filed Jun. 7 2010 2010 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.

Disclosed herein are laminated structures comprising a first external layer and a second external layer an internal layer disposed between the first and the second external layers a first adhesive layer disposed between the first external layer and the internal layer wherein the first adhesive layer is patterned to cover only a first portion of the internal layer and a second adhesive layer disposed between the second external layer and the internal layer wherein the second adhesive layer is patterned to cover only a second portion of the internal layer on a side opposite the first adhesive layer and wherein the first portion is different than the second portion.

Also disclosed herein is a fire door comprising a first external door layer comprising a gypsum fiberboard and a second external door layer comprising a gypsum fiberboard an internal door core layer disposed between the first and the second external door layers wherein the internal door core comprises a gypsum panel board a first adhesive layer disposed between the first external door layer and the internal door core wherein the first adhesive layer comprises a viscoelastic hot melt adhesive and is patterned to cover only a first portion of the internal door core and a second adhesive layer disposed between the second external door layer and the internal door core wherein the second adhesive layer comprises a viscoelastic hot melt adhesive and is patterned to cover only a second portion of the internal door core on a side opposite the first adhesive layer and wherein the first portion is different than the second portion.

A method of making a laminate structure is also disclosed wherein the method comprises applying a first adhesive in a first discontinuous pattern on a surface of a first external layer and or an internal layer adhering the first external layer to the internal layer applying a second adhesive in a second discontinuous pattern on a surface of the internal layer opposite the first external layer and or on a second external layer and adhering the second external layer to the internal layer wherein the first discontinuous pattern and the second discontinuous pattern are offset such that no portion of the first adhesive overlaps with the second adhesive.

Disclosed herein are building materials particularly laminated structures for use in constructing walls floors ceilings or doors that provide a significant improvement in the sound transmission class STC rating associated with the structures. In one embodiment a laminated structure comprises two external layers at least one internal layer and two or more adhesive layers separated by the at least one internal layer wherein each of the two or more adhesive layers forms a discontinuous pattern between the internal layer and a selected one of the external layers and wherein the discontinuous patterns of the two or more adhesive layers are offset from one another such that no portion of one adhesive layer overlaps any portion of the other adhesive layers.

The adhesive layers reduce the transmission of vibrational energy from one layer to adjacent layer of the structure by mechanically isolating layers of the structure so that they vibrate independently. Moreover the discontinuous pattern formed by each adhesive layer serves to prevent lateral movement of air between layers by providing isolated uncoated i.e. adhesiveless sealed spaces defined by the substrate on top and bottom and adhesive layer on either side to which the air can travel. The sound waves therefore are not forced to transfer into the adjacent layers of the structure as they would be with continuous layers of adhesive disposed between the internal and external layers. Further misaligning the patterns of each adhesive layer provides a tortuous path for transfer of the sound waves through the structure which enhances the structure s ability to dissipate sound. Providing an offset pattern of adhesive layers such that no portion of one adhesive layer overlaps with any other adhesive layers means there is no direct line through the cross section of the laminated structure that a sound wave could pass without traveling through at least one of the uncoated spaces in at least one of the adhesive layers. The density gradients that are created in addition to the tortuous path of the adhesive and the air gap improves the attenuation response of the laminate.

An adhesive layer is disposed between the top layer and an internal layer . The adhesive layer can be disposed on an inner surface of the top layer or a top surface of the internal layer . The adhesive layer is configured to adhere the top layer to the internal layer . The adhesive layer can be formed from a hot melt adhesive a solvent based adhesive a water based adhesive a UV cured adhesive or other type of adhesive such as a UV cured polymer. Exemplary hot melt adhesives can include without limitation polymers such as butyl rubber silicone rubbers styrene butadiene styrene SBS styrene isoprene styrene SIS styrene butadiene SB styrene ethylene butadiene styrene SEBS and ethylene vinylacetate EVA resins such hydrocarbon and rosin type resins natural and petroleum waxes oils bitumen combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing and the like. Exemplary solvent based adhesives can include the adhesives described above dissolved or dispersed in a solvent vehicle. Exemplary water based adhesives are those based on emulsions of polymeric materials. Exemplary polymeric materials can include without limitation vinyl acetate and acrylic polymers and copolymers such as vinyl acetate acrylic and EVA as well as styrene acrylic vinyl chloride acrylic vinyl versatate and the like.

In one aspect the adhesive is viscoelastic. Viscoelastic materials exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation including resistance to shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied viscosity and instantaneous strain when stretched and return to their original state once the stress is removed elasticity . Viscoelastic adhesive layers have particular sound absorbing qualities that can further aid the soundproofing properties of the laminated structure . Energy in the sound waves interacting with the adhesive layer when constrained by the top layer and the internal layer will be dissipated by the elastic nature of the adhesive thereby reducing the energy of the sound transmitting through the laminate structure .

A wide variety of adhesive materials are known to have viscoelastic properties. Such adhesive materials can include without limitation those synthetic rubbers described above such as SBS and SIS other synthetic rubbers such as butyl rubber and styrene butadiene rubber SBR polytetrafluoroethylene fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymers polymethacrylates polydimethacrylates silicone based polymers combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing and the like. In addition to using thermoplastic hotmelts impact modified thermoset systems can also be used. Multiple systems such as but not limited to epoxy resins polyurethanes polyureas formaldehyde based resins combinations thereof and the like can be used to build the tie layer structure in the laminate.

In another aspect the adhesive is a viscoelastic hot melt adhesive. Such adhesives generally contain a thermoplastic base material in combination with various additives such as a tackifier. Representative base materials include EVA copolymers ethylene acrylate copolymers polyolefins such as polyethylene polyesters polyamides thermoplastic polyurethanes silicone rubbers and styrene block copolymers such as SIS SBR SEBS and styrene ethylene propylene SEP . Tackifiers tend to have low molecular weight and glass transition and softening temperature above room temperature providing them with suitable viscoelastic properties. Representative tackiferis include rosins and their derivates terpenes and modified terpenes hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins and their mixtures terpene phenol resins TPR used often with EVAs in amounts of up to about 40 weight percent of the adhesive. A specific exemplary hot melt adhesive includes a tackifier and a styrene block copolymer the hot melt adhesive having a viscosity at 350 degrees Fahrenheit F of about 22 000 to about 27 000 Centipoises cps and a Mettler softening point of about 269 F to about 291 F. The adhesive exhibits a peel strength of about 4.6 pounds per inch when tested in a 180 degree peel test according to ASTM D903 98. This viscoelastic hot melt adhesive is commercially available from Forbo Adhesives LLC under the tradename Swift 81866.

The adhesive layer can be spread over the inner surface of the top layer or the top surface of the internal layer in a discontinuous pattern. As such the adhesive layer will not cover the full surface of the top or internal layer. To aid in the sound proofing of the laminated structure the adhesive is applied to one of the layers in a non continuous film in order to leave parts or spots or zones of the layer uncoated with adhesive. The adhesive layer can be applied in a variety of discontinuous patterns. Exemplary patterns can include without limitation vertical strips horizontal strips dots squares rectangles polygons irregular shapes combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing and the like. In one aspect the adhesive layers are applied in the laminate structure as parallel strips. In another aspect the adhesive layers are applied in the laminate structure as parallel strips that are disposed perpendicular to the longest dimension of the structure. For example where the laminate structure is a door to be vertically disposed in a door frame the strips of the adhesive layer are disposed in parallel relationship to one another and in a horizontal orientation compared to the vertical orientation of the door. The spacing between the parallel strips of adhesive can be any distance effective to enhance the acoustical properties of the laminate structure. For example a spacing of about 1 to about 4 inches specifically about 2 inches enhances the acoustical properties of the laminate structure. Without being bound by theory it is believed such spacing between the parallel strips of adhesive provides fewer contact points between the layers of the structure which further serves to insulate and decouple the laminated structure.

Regardless of the desired pattern the adhesive layer will be a discontinuous layer between the top layer and the internal layer . In one aspect the adhesive layer is applied to cover about 5 to about 99 of the area of the top layer surface or the internal layer surface specifically about 5 to about 75 and more specifically about 9 to about 20 .

The adhesive layer can be applied to the top and or internal layer by any method effective in bonding the two layers together. For example the adhesive layer can be applied as beads lines spray film or a coated adhesive layer. When applied as lines or beads a bead applicator a continuous or discontinuous slot dye or spray applicator may be used to form a discontinuous pattern. When applied as an adhesive film a strip suitable for the desired discontinuous pattern of the adhesive layer can be cut from an adhesive tape roll the release sheet removed if applicable and the strip adhered to the desired location of the top or internal layer. The adhesive may also be applied by any of the well known processes for coating that include without limitation roll coating spray coating brushing hand applicator or other similar processes. The adhesive can also be applied with a putty knife caulking gun or other known means of applying a liquid adhesive coating. In one aspect the adhesive layer has a thickness of about 0.001 inches to about 0.1 inch specifically a thickness of about 0.005 inches to about 0.075 inches and more specifically a thickness of about 0.01 inches to about 0.04 inches.

The internal layer is the core of the laminated structure and provides additional structural integrity thereto. While the laminated structure comprises a single internal layer it is to be understood that other embodiments of the laminated structure described herein could have any number of internal layers depending upon the desired thickness weight strength STC and the like of the finished laminated structure. Likewise additional adhesive layers would be disposed between the additional internal layers so as to ensure a secure adhered laminate structure. Exemplary materials for use as an internal layer can include without limitation metal such as steel or aluminum vinyl cellulose wood gypsum wafer board particle board oriented strand board OSB medium density fiberboard MDF cement board plastic perforated metals paper metal plastic honeycomb structures sheet type intumescents combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing and the like.

As shown in the internal layer is disposed between the top layer and the bottom layer . Similar to adhesive layer a second adhesive layer is disposed between the internal layer and the bottom layer . The adhesive layer may be applied to the inner surface of the bottom layer or to the bottom surface of the internal layer . The adhesive layer is configured to adhere the bottom layer to the internal layer . The adhesive layer can be formed from the same adhesive material as the adhesive layer or it can be formed from a different adhesive from the above list of adhesives. Similarly the adhesive layer will also be applied in a discontinuous pattern between the two layers. The adhesive layer can have the same discontinuous pattern as that of the adhesive layer or it can have a different pattern. Regardless of the pattern the discontinuous pattern of the adhesive layer will be offset from the pattern of the adhesive layer . In other words the pattern of adhesive layer will be misaligned with the pattern of adhesive layer such that no portion of the adhesive layer overlaps aligns with a portion of the adhesive layer when viewed from the top layer through to the bottom layer or vice versa of the laminated structure . As shown in the portion of the adhesive layer do not overlap with any portion of the adhesive layer . Where the top surface of the internal layer is covered with an adhesive portion the corresponding portion of the internal layer on the opposite surface i.e. the bottom surface is free of any adhesive. Because no portion of one adhesive layer overlaps with portions of any of the other adhesive layers a circuitous path is formed throughout the laminate structure. This path allows sound waves to spread through the width of the structure which enhances the structure s ability to dissipate sound. Providing an offset pattern of adhesive layers means there is no direct line of continuous material through the cross section of the laminated structure that would permit sound waves to pass directly therethrough. Rather regardless of where the sound waves enter the structure they cannot pass through the structure without traveling through at least one of the uncoated spaces in at least one of the adhesive layers.

The external layers top and bottom and the internal layer s can have any thickness. The thickness of the layers are limited only by the acoustical attenuation i.e. STC number desired for the resulting laminate structure and by the weight of the resulting structure which may limit the ability to install the structure for its intended use. In one aspect the external layers and the internal layer s have the same thickness. In another aspect the external layers have a thickness different than that of the internal layer s . In still another aspect all the layers of the laminated structure have a different thickness.

A method of making the laminated structure includes applying a first adhesive in a first discontinuous pattern on a surface of a first external layer and or an internal layer to adhere the first external layer to the internal layer applying a second adhesive in a second discontinuous pattern on a surface of the internal layer opposite the first external layer and or on a second external layer to adhere the second external layer to the internal layer wherein the first discontinuous pattern and the second discontinuous pattern are offset such that no portion of the first adhesive layer overlaps with the second adhesive layer. Each external layer can be pressed under a predetermined pressure and temperature for a selected time to adhere the layer to the internal layer. In another embodiment the external layers can both be added to the internal layer s and then all the layers placed under a predetermined pressure and temperature for a selected time to form the laminated structure.

As mentioned previously the laminate structure can be particularly useful as a building material such as for use in constructing for example walls floors ceilings doors and the like. The laminate structure described herein comprises the soundproofing qualities that are desirable for such construction applications. In one aspect the laminate structure has a STC of about 30 to about 65 specifically about 37 to about 41. The sound transmission class numbers provided herein are numbers used in the architectural field to rate partitions doors and windows for their effectiveness in blocking sound. The number assigned to a particular partition design as a result of STC testing represents a best fit type of approach to a set of curves that define the sound transmission class. The test is conducted in such a way to make it independent of the test environment and gives a number for the partition only. The STC measurement method is defined by the American Society for Test and Materials ASTM test method E90 09 for laboratory sound measurement in one third octave bands of airborne sound transmission loss of building partitions and elements by ASTM E413 04 for rating sound insulation by ASTM E1332 90 for determination of Outdoor Indoor Transmission class and by ASTM E2235 04 for determination of decay rates for use in sound insulation methods. The higher the STC rating or number the more effective that material is at reducing sound transmission of the most common frequencies. An STC rating of 25 30 is considered poor and described as normal speech is understood easily and distinctly through the material while an STC rating of 30 35 is considered fair and is described as loud speech understood fairly well through the material. For partitions doors and the like used in current construction it is desirable to use materials and structures having STC ratings of good to very good. Such STC performance is achieved at STC ratings of 34 40 and 40 50 respectively. A good performance material is one through which loud speech is heard but hardly intelligible while a very good material will permit loud speech only to be heard faintly and not understood at all. 

The desire for such acoustical rated laminated structures has carried over into other building material applications including requirements for fire resistant applications such as walls and doors. The desire for noise control in combination with fire protection is increasing in the design and construction of new buildings and in the renovation of existing buildings. Fire doors as used in residential commercial and industrial applications are typically employed in conjunction with fire walls to provide fire protection between different zones of a structure and particularly to isolate high fire risk areas of a building from the remainder of the structure such as the garage of a dwelling from its living quarters. Fire doors usually are not capable of indefinitely withstanding the high temperature conditions of a fire but rather are designed to maintain the integrity of the fire wall for a limited time to permit the occupants of a building to escape and to delay the spread of the fire until fire control equipment can be brought to the scene.

In another aspect the fire retardant properties along with the STC rating can be enhanced by using the certain adhesives as described above along with intumescent agents. Certain thermoset adhesives maintain laminate integrity for much longer times in a fire when compared with their thermoplastics counterparts. For example such a thermoset adhesive can be configured to provide a viscoelastic sound damping system that has a high viscous component under normal room temperature operation as a result of which will have excellent STC ratings. In the event of a fire however temperature sensitive catalysts in the adhesive system can be configured to harden and bind the laminate to ensure extended laminate integrity.

Fire door ratings are based on specific ASTM tests e.g. method E152 where the door is expected to maintain structural integrity under fire exposure for various times. One particular mode of failure can be caused by disintegration of the adhesive layer that ties the laminate together. Therefore it is important to design a hot melt adhesive with the right balance between the viscoelastic properties the pattern of application and thermal properties critical to achieve both sound and fire performance. In one aspect such a hot melt adhesive would be configured to have good vibration damping i.e. more of a viscous response at normal operating temperatures in buildings. The adhesive would further be formulated to include temperature sensitive catalysts that trigger a crosslinking reaction at temperatures well above normal operating conditions but significantly below the disintegration temperature of the hot melt adhesive. In the event of a fire the hot melt adhesive system would cure establishing crosslinks and increasing the modulus of the adhesive thereby providing the laminate with increased structural and adhesive integrity for a longer period of time. The temperature dependent tunable catalytic reaction in the hot melt adhesive system can be achieved with for example temperature sensitive catalysts that work as described above and temperature sensitive inhibitors that lose functionality at higher temperature and trigger the crosslinking reaction. In another aspect the hot melt adhesive system can be configured such that a lack of oxygen triggers the crosslinking reaction. which is depleted by the fire. In other words oxygen inhibits the crosslinking reaction. Upon consumption of the oxygen by the fire the crosslinking reaction is triggered. Examples of a hot melt adhesive system in which the absence of oxygen can trigger the crosslinking reaction can include without limitation acrylates and other free radical systems.

In another aspect the hot melt adhesive system described above can further include other optional additives configured to improve sound performance without compromising fire rating. Exemplary additives include without limitation intumescent agents such as vermiculite and foaming agents. For example the foaming agent could comprise an open or closed cell structure wherein the primary foaming gas is carbon dioxide or oxygen depleting in nature. In this manner the foaming agent would improve sound performance of the laminate and could also improve fire performance. Other exemplary additives include talc gypsum and the like. The laminate structures can further include honeycomb shaped strips in conjunction with the discontinuous hot melt adhesive system to further improve the sound characteristics of the laminate without compromising the fire rating.

Various tests have been devised for fire doors to ensure that they meet established safety standards. One test measures the time that a given door withstands a certain temperature while maintaining its integrity. Another test measures the door s ability to withstand the forces of a high pressure water stream. Established fire door standards are incorporated into building codes and architectural specifications. For example ASTM Method E 152 National Fire Protection Association NFPA Method 252 2008 Canadian Standard Method CAN 104 and Underwriters Laboratories Method UL 10C Positive Pressure Fire Test for Door Assemblies requires a door to maintain its integrity for periods ranging up to 90 minutes e.g. 20 45 60 and 90 min while withstanding progressively higher temperatures and the erosive effects of a high pressure fire hose at the conclusion of the fire exposure. Similarly British Standard 476 part 22 provides a method for determining the fire resistance for periods ranging up to 120 minutes e.g. 90 and 120 min .

Accordingly another aspect of the present invention includes a fire door capable of satisfying both the acoustical ratings and the fire ratings desired in current construction. In one aspect the fire door has a 90 minute fire rating in accordance with ASTM E152 NFPA 252 CAN 104 and UL 10C and an STC rating of greater than 35 in accordance with ASTM E90 09 and ASTM E413 04. The fire door comprises two external layers comprising a gypsum fiberboard and at least one internal layer disposed between the two external layers. The internal layer includes a gypsum panel board and two or more adhesive layers separated by the internal layer. Further the two or more adhesive layers forms a discontinuous pattern between the internal layer and a selected one of the two external layers. Finally the discontinuous patterns of the two or more adhesive layers are offset from one another such that no portion of one adhesive layer overlaps any portion of the other adhesive layers.

The internal door core internal layer and the exterior door facings external layers of the fire door comprise two different substrates having different densities. The internal layer comprises a gypsum panel board having a density of about 42 to 46 pounds per cubic foot pcf . The external layers comprise a gypsum fiberboard having densities of about 60 pcf to about 80 pcf. The density and stiffness of these core layers are efficient in resisting sound vibration while the material of the layers have fire resistant properties as will be described in greater detail below.

The internal layer of the fire door comprises a post coated gypsum panel board comprising a set gypsum core disposed between two coated or uncoated non woven fibrous mats. If the mats are coated they are pre coated prior to enmeshing or entangling with the set gypsum board core. To this end the outer surfaces of the coated non woven mats are pre coated with a dried heat cured aqueous coating of an aqueous coating composition containing a combination e.g. a mixture of a mineral pigment or filler and an organic binder of a polymer latex adhesive. By pre coated is meant that the non woven fibrous mats have a dried adherent coating of what was originally an aqueous coating composition as hereinafter defined in more detail applied to one of their surfaces before the non woven mats are used to make the gypsum board for the internal layer of the fire door.

Exemplary polymer latex adhesive binders for use in formulating the mat coating include but are not limited to styrene butadiene rubber SBR styrene butadiene styrene SBS ethylene vinyl chloride EVCl polyvinylidene chloride PVdCl and poly vinylidene copolymers modified poly vinyl chloride PVC poly vinyl alcohol PVOH ethylene vinyl acetate EVA polyvinyl acetate PVA and polymers and copolymers containing units of acrylic acid methacrylic acid their esters and derivatives thereof acrylic type polymers such as styrene acrylate copolymers.

The composition of the set gypsum core of the gypsum board is generally similar to that used in other gypsum products known as gypsum wallboard dry wall gypsum board gypsum lath and gypsum sheathing. The set gypsum core is formed by mixing water with powdered anhydrous calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate hemi hydrate CaSO.1 2 HO also known as calcined gypsum to form an aqueous gypsum slurry and thereafter allowing the slurry mixture to hydrate or set into calcium sulfate dihydrate CaSO.2HO a relatively hard material.

The core of the gypsum board in the internal layer of the fire door will generally include at least about 80 wt. percent of set gypsum fully hydrated calcium sulfate . The composition from which the set gypsum core of the board is made can also include a variety of optional additives including for example those included conventionally in gypsum wallboard. Examples of such additives include set accelerators set retarders foaming agents and dispersing agents.

In one aspect in order to satisfactorily achieve the desired properties of fire resistance in the fire door the gypsum core includes at least about 0.2 lbs of reinforcing fibers for example chopped glass fibers per 100 square feet of gypsum board. Usually the gypsum core in the board will include about 0.4 to 0.6 lbs. of reinforcing fibers per 100 square feet to ensure that the board meets or exceeds the desired properties of fire resistance and acoustical rating.

Both surfaces of the set gypsum core are faced with pre coated fibrous mats. Thus coated mats are prepared in advance pre coated and are used in making the non woven fibrous mat faced gypsum board for the internal layer of the fire door. The coating on the mats is sufficiently porous to permit water in the aqueous gypsum slurry from which the gypsum core is made to evaporate during manufacture of the board. The gypsum board described herein is made by standard methods from an aqueous gypsum slurry well known to those of skill in the art. The non woven fibrous mats comprise a fiber material that is capable of forming a strong bond with the set gypsum comprising the core of the gypsum board through a mechanical like interlocking between the interstices of the fibrous mat and portions of the gypsum core filling those interstices. Examples of fiber materials useful for the non woven mats include 1 a mineral type material such as glass fibers 2 synthetic resin fibers and 3 mixtures or blends thereof. In an exemplary embodiment glass fiber mats are used for making the pre coated mat. Nonwoven mats such as made from chopped strands and continuous strands can be used. The strands of such mats typically are bonded together to form a unitary structure by a suitable adhesive. The fiber mats can range in thickness for example from about 0.51 to about 0.66 millimeters mm 20 26 mils . The aforementioned fibrous mats are known and are commercially available.

In addition to the components mentioned above the aqueous coating for the fibrous mats can also include water and other optional ingredients such as colorants e.g. dyes or pigments thickeners or rheological control agents defoamers dispersants and preservatives. The amounts of such additional ingredients are proportioned to provide the desired rheological properties e.g. viscosity to the aqueous formulation

Any suitable method for applying an aqueous coating composition to the non woven fibrous mat substrate can be used for making the pre coated mats such as roller coating curtain coating knife coating spray coating and the like including combinations thereof. Following application of the aqueous coating composition to the mat the composition is dried cured usually by heat to form the pre coated mat. Pre coated mats made in accordance with these teachings are substantially liquid impermeable but do allow water vapor to pass through during manufacturing of the board.

As noted above a mineral pigment or filler comprises the major component of the coating composition. Examples of mineral pigments for use in the coated mats can include but are not limited to ground limestone calcium carbonate clay sand mica talc gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate aluminum trihydrate ATH antimony oxide or a combination of at least one of the foregoing.

The inorganic pigment or filler materials also may inherently contain some naturally occurring inorganic adhesive binders. Examples of such fillers some listed with the naturally occurring binder include but are not limited to the following limestone containing quicklime CaO clay containing calcium silicate sand containing calcium silicate aluminum trihydrate containing aluminum hydroxide cementitious fly ash and magnesium oxide containing either the sulfate or chloride of magnesium or both. Depending on its level of hydration gypsum can be both a mineral pigment and an inorganic adhesive binder but it is only slightly soluble in water and the solid form is crystalline making it brittle and weak as a binder. As a result gypsum is not generally preferred for use.

Fillers which inherently include an inorganic adhesive binder as a constituent and which cure by hydration also advantageously act as flame suppressants. As examples aluminum trihydrate ATH calcium sulfate gypsum and the oxychloride and oxysulfate of magnesium all carry molecules of water bound into their molecular structure. This water referred to either as water of crystallization or water of hydration is released upon sufficient heating actually suppressing flames.

Low cost inorganic mineral pigments and fillers with the properties of those described in the preceding paragraph thus may provide three 3 important contributions to the coating mixture a filler a binder and a fire suppressor.

The resulting gypsum panel of the internal layer comprises a set gypsum core faced with two pre coated glass fiber mats. The surface of at least one of the mats is coated with a dried coating of an aqueous coating composition containing a combination e.g. a mixture of a mineral pigment a polymer latex adhesive and optionally an inorganic adhesive binder. The core of the gypsum panel board includes at least about 0.2 lbs. of reinforcing fibers per 100 square feet of board.

The gypsum panel board of the internal layer exhibits certain fire resistant qualities so that the fire door utilizing the board meets the fire regulations of the relevant municipal code. In particular the gypsum panel board satisfies the 90 minute fire rating of ASTM E 152. The gypsum panel board as described above for the internal layer is commercially available from Georgia Pacific Gypsum under the trade name Dens Deck Dens Deck Prime or Dens Deck DuraGuard .

The external layers of the fire door comprise a gypsum fiberboard. The gypsum fiberboards used for the external layers comprise set gypsum dihydrate a binder polymer and cellulosic fibers. The calcium sulfate dihydrate gypsum dihydrate of the gypsum fiberboard is derived from the hydration of any form of calcium sulfate which is in non fibrous form and which is capable of reacting with water to form set gypsum that is calcium sulfate dihydrate. Thus the calcium sulfate can be in anhydrous form or in the hemihydrate form. Of the beta forms of the hemihydrate use of the latter is preferred. The hemihydrate can be produced from the naturally occurring gypsum mineral by heating or calcining the dihydrate.

For many applications it is not important to inquire into the crystalline form of the hemihydrate however with respect to the fiberboards herein that is not the case. It is known that calcium sulfate hemihydrate can exist in two different crystalline forms namely a non fibrous form and a fibrous form for example elongated needles. In the fiberboards of the external layers a non fibrous form of calcium sulfate capable of reacting with water to form set gypsum is used. It should be understood however that a minor amount of a fibrous form of gypsum can be used as an optional constituent. A mixture of different sources of calcium sulfate can be used in the fiberboard include waste type materials such as desulfurized by product gypsum scrap gypsum wallboard and the like.

In the use of an aqueous dispersion to make the gypsum fiberboard for the facing of a fire door the nonfibrous calcium sulfate generally will comprise between about 60 and about 80 by weight of the solids. The gypsum dihydrate content of the fiberboard will be about 18.5 greater than the nonfibrous calcium sulfate content of the compositions from which it is made the difference representing the added water of hydration in the set gypsum dihydrate. That is by weight the set gypsum will comprise between about 75 and about 90 by weight.

The gypsum fiberboard for the external layers of the fire door may further include cellulosic fiber. Cellulosic fiber includes the fibrous component of plants such as cotton linen and flax for example. Among the various sources of cellulosic fiber paper stock is conveniently employed. That is the fiberboard can further include by weight about 12 to about 13 . The presence of the paper fiber makes it possible to produce a gypsum fiberboard having good physical characteristics such as flexural strength screw holding and surface hardness without having any separate surfacing membrane such as the paper surfacing on conventional gypsum board.

The paper fiber can be derived from virgin paper stock or previously used waste paper stock. The source of the paper can be for example wood cotton or linen rags straw etc. The origin or history of the paper is not a critical factor. The paper may be a product of the sulfite process the sulfate Kraft paper process or other processes. Among the types of paper stock successfully employed are virgin and brown Kraft papers and especially newsprint. Waste newspaper provides satisfactory results is inexpensive and its use helps to overcome an environmental pollution problem. Moreover the source of the paper stock can include the paper of ground paper faced gypsum wallboard.

The gypsum fiberboard can further include one or more performance boosting additives. Exemplary additives may include without limitation one or more defoaming agents dispersants accelerators and the like ingredients which are well known in the art and are employed at low concentration levels generally each at less than about 1 by weight of the solids. In the aggregate the performance booster generally will comprise about 1.5 to about 35 by weight of the solids and will preferably be selected from inorganic fiber clay vermiculite and binder polymer. Concrete 5 12 by wt. or Sodium Silicate may be added as a wet strength binder to boost hose stream performance. The specific nature of the additive will depend to some extent on the intended utility of the fire door.

Inorganic fiber as that term is employed herein includes glass textile fiber and mineral wool. Briefly the term mineral wool means glass or other mineral fibers prepared by attenuating a melt of glass basalt blast furnace slag or other vitreous mineral composition from the face of a heated centrifugal rotor or the like. This process is in contrast to that used to produce textile fibers where the melt is drawn through an orifice. An especially useful and readily available type of mineral wool is glass wool as found in glass wool insulation material. Glass textile fiber and glass wool jointly or severally are referred to herein as siliceous fiber. As employed in the gypsum fiberboard the glass textile fiber generally will be chopped e.g. the fibers may be about inch long.

The gypsum fiberboard for the fire door generally will include siliceous fiber. Siliceous fiber improves the fire resistance of the building material apparently by decreasing the tendency of the gypsum construction to crack under thermal stress. The siliceous fiber may be present up to about 7 by weight and may include glass textile fiber. The gypsum fiberboard used as facing of the fire door will include for example about 0.8 to about 2 siliceous fiber and a combination of about 0.4 chopped glass textile fiber and about 0.5 to about 1.5 glass wool by weight.

The performance booster may also include either clay vermiculite or both to boost the fire resistance of the fire door. Both of these materials may be present in amounts up to about 6 specifically about 3 4 by weight of the solids. The clay to be employed will generally be kaolin clay which is effective to control the shrinkage of the gypsum containing construction under extreme heat. The vermiculite should be raw i.e. unexpanded vermiculite which swells when heated helping to control shrinkage of the construction and possible cracking.

The gypsum fiberboard of the external layers may also include a binder polymer. The binder polymer affects the physical properties of the fiberboard especially the flexural strength. Furthermore the binder polymer improves the surface characteristics of the product such as smoothing the surface and making it easier to finish.

The binder polymer when present may comprise up to about 15 by weight of the solids specifically about 1 to about 3 by weight. A number of different polymeric materials may be employed as binder polymer including homopolymers such as poly vinyl acetate and polyacrylate as well as copolymers such as poly ethylene co vinyl chloride poly styrene co butadiene and poly vinyl acetate co methyl acrylate . Among the various binder polymer possibilities esters of poly vinyl alcohol are effective specifically poly vinyl acetate homopolymers. The binder polymer can be introduced as an aqueous emulsion many of which are commercially available.

The gypsum fiberboard composition will also include water in an amount in vast excess of that required to react with and hydrate the calcined nonfibrous gypsum. That is specifically at least about a 25 fold excess amount of water should be present. Contrary to the conventional wisdom the excess water provides processing advantages and leads to products which possess superior properties.

As mentioned the gypsum fiberboard of the external layers exhibit certain fire resistant qualities so that the fire door utilizing the board meets the fire regulations of the relevant municipal code. In particular the gypsum fiberboard satisfies the 90 minute fire rating of ASTM E 152. The gypsum fiberboard as described above for the external layers is commercially available from Georgia Pacific Gypsum under the trade name FIRESTOP.

The gypsum fiberboard of the external layers and the gypsum panel board of the internal layer described herein can be held together to form the fire door with adhesive layers disposed therebetween. As described above the adhesive layers join the substrate layers of the fire door but also create an air gap between the individual layers by their discontinuous application patterns. The gaps between the internal and external layer created by the discontinuous pattern of the adhesives are effective in absorbing and or spreading the sound waves passing through the fire door. The gypsum compositions for both the external and internal layers provide fire resistant qualities to the fire door. Moreover the density of the gypsum based substrates aids in resisting sound vibration. Combined with the staggered misaligned patterns of the two adhesive layers the fire door is effective in increasing transmission loss and STC ratings. When compared to traditional mineral core fire doors and heavier mass doors the fire door described herein has improved soundproofing qualities. See Table 2.

The laminated structures described above were used in the construction of doors that were then tested for soundproof quality. Five different door samples were tested in the fixed and operable conditions at an accredited laboratory according to the procedures listed in ASTM E90 04 and E 413 04 for nonoperable and operable STC ratings. Sound transmission loss tests were initially performed on the filler wall that was designed to test 40 inch by 86 inch and 80 inch by 86 inch test specimens. The filler wall achieved an STC rating of 67. The 40 inch by 86 inch plug was removed from the filler wall assembly. The door system was placed on a foam isolation pad in the test opening. For nonoperable fixed testing the test specimen was sealed on the periphery edges with a dense mastic. For operable testing the doors were mounted on hinges with door hardware vision panels and perimeter seals and the door panel was opened and closed 5 times prior to testing.

The sound transmission loss test consisted of the following measurements one background noise sound pressure level and five sound absorption measurements were conducted at each of the five microphone positions. Two sound pressure level measurements were made simultaneously in both rooms at each of the five microphone positions. The air temperature and relative humidity conditions were monitored and recorded during the background absorption source and receiving room measurements.

The STC rating was calculated in accordance with ASTM E413. Table 1 provides a description of the door samples tested.

Sample No. 1 was a Firedefender brand mineral core commercially available from Georgia Pacific LLC. It had a density of about 30 32 pcf and is composed of a blend of gypsum expanded perlite and inert binders.

Looking at the fixed STC testing both the high density and low density laminated doors outperformed the standard mineral gypsum door core. The standard gypsum core door had an STC rating of 34 while the high density laminated door had a rating of 40. With regard to the STC performance classes described above this shifts the door performance from a good rating to a very good rating. In operable STC testing the HD and LD laminated doors also outperformed the respective door cores made up of just the FIRESTOP although all the samples fall in the good classification. The HD and LD laminated doors however were substantially lighter than the HD and LD door cores alone. This represents reduced material cost as well as increased ease in installation.
