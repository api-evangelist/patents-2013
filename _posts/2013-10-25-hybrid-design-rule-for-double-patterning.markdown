title: Hybrid design rule for double patterning
abstract: Among other things, one or more systems and techniques for generating or implementing a hybrid design rule set are provide herein. A set of color design rules and a set of color agnostic design rules are generated and exposed for selective design rule assignment. In an embodiment, a first color design rule is assigned to a first polygon. In an embodiment, a first color agnostic design rule is assigned to a second polygon. In this way, color design rules and color agnostic design rules are selectively applied to polygons of a design layout. Color design rules are selected for space and design efficiency. Color agnostic rules are selected for conservative design layout for design ease. A design rule checking stage and a design rule fixing stage are performed such that the design layout is compliant after color decomposition without a second design rule fixing stage.

Electronic design tools allow designers to layout simulate and analyze electrical components such as integrated circuits. In an example a schematic designer creates a schematic diagram of an integrated circuit. The schematic diagram comprises symbols that represent components of the integrated circuit. However the schematic diagram does not represent a physical layout of the integrated circuit. A layout designer creates a physical layout of the integrated circuit using the schematic diagram. The physical layout comprises one or more polygons representing metal silicon or other components or portions thereof. The physical layout is decomposed where polygons are colored or assigned to one or more masks. In double patterning a first mask is used to form a first set of polygons and a second mask is used to form a second set of polygons. Using multiple masks allow the layout designer to form polygons according to stricter design layout rules such as width or spacing rules thus promoting efficiency.

In this way a designer can selective assign color agnostic design rules or color design rules to polygons within the design layout. In an embodiment a first color design rule is assigned to a first polygon and a first color agnostic design rule is assigned to a second polygon. The first color design rule specifies a first design constraint comprising a first limitation value that is less restrictive than a second limitation value of a second design constraint specified by the first color agnostic design rule.

In an embodiment a first color is associated with a first mask such that one or more polygons assigned the first color will be formed by the first mask.
