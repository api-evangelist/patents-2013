The present disclosure relates generally to the field of storage devices and more particularly to control of storage device power states.

Many computing devices such as personal desktop computers include one or more nonvolatile storage devices such as hard disk drives or solid state drives. When the computing device is idle the storage devices continue to consume energy which may drain the battery and otherwise waste electricity. Some existing computing devices may be configured with operating systems that include different power management modes in which these storage devices may be turned off after a predetermined period of idle time. However these existing devices may fail to reduce the power consumption of storage devices when the user is not engaged with the computing device may turn the storage devices off when the user is engaged with the computing device and or may present an excessively long wait between the time that a user first attempts to wake a storage device and the time at which the storage device is ready for use.

Systems and techniques for control of storage device power states are described herein. In some embodiments a control system for a storage device of a computing device may include receiver logic to receive a proximity signal indicative of a distance of a user from a proximity sensor transition logic to determine that the proximity signal satisfies out of proximity criteria and generate an out transition signal based at least in part on the determination that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria and state change logic to cause a change in a power state of the storage device from a first power state to a second power state in response to the out transition signal wherein the storage device consumes less power in the second power state than in the first power state.

In some embodiments the processing device may be configured to control the storage device based at least in part on signals received from the input device . In some embodiments the processing device may be configured to control the storage device by causing changes in power state of the storage device . For example the processing device may generate control signals that may be transmitted to a power control device which may adjust the power state of the storage device in response. In particular in some embodiments the processing device may be configured to receive a signal indicative of a distance of a user of the computing device from the computing device determine that the signal satisfies one or more out of proximity criteria and cause a change in a power state of the storage device to reduce the power consumption of the storage device .

In some embodiments the power state of the storage device may be related to or independent from one or more power management modes of the computing device . Each power management mode of the computing device may specify a power state for different components of the computing device e.g. the storage device one or more displays not shown the input device or any other component of the computing device . For example in an active power management mode volatile memory nonvolatile memory displays and other devices may be fully powered. In a sleep power management mode volatile memory may remain powered while power is cut to any volatile memory e.g. causing spin down of any hard disk drives of the storage device and power is cut or reduced to any displays. In a hibernate power management mode data stored in volatile memory may be transferred to nonvolatile memory e.g. of the storage device in power may be cut to both volatile and nonvolatile memory as well as cut or reduced to any displays. Rules governing when the computing device should enter different power management modes may be implemented by an operating system of the computing device e.g. executed by the processing device . A user may also be able to manually select a power management mode.

In some embodiments each power management mode may specify a power state for the storage device but the specified power state may not be unique to the power management mode. For example in the sleep and hibernate power management modes discussed above hard disk drives included in the storage device may be powered off in each mode consequently the power state of the storage device in each mode may be the same. In some embodiments the storage device power state control techniques and systems discussed herein may be used in conjunction with power management mode techniques or may operate independently of power management mode techniques. For example if an operating system of the computing device is configured to transition to a particular power management mode under a particular set of conditions and that power management mode specifies a power state for the storage device the techniques disclosed herein may be used to override the power state specified by the power management mode may be overridden by the power state specified by the power management mode or may be incorporated into the set of conditions associated with the power management mode. As discussed below the techniques disclosed herein may be applied independently or differently to different storage devices included in the storage device . For example in some embodiments the techniques disclosed herein may be applied to control the power state of one or more hard disk drives included in the storage device while the power state of other storage devices such as the solid state drive discussed below may be controlled using conventional power management mode techniques. The techniques and systems disclosed herein will largely refer to the storage device in the singular but will be understood to be applicable to one or more storage devices included in the storage device . The various components of the computing device are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The input device may include one or more devices configured to provide a signal to the processing device . In some embodiments the input device may include a proximity sensor . The proximity sensor may be configured to generate a proximity signal indicative of a distance of a user from the proximity sensor in a proximity sensor coverage area. Examples of proximity sensor coverage areas are discussed below with reference to . In some embodiments a proximity sensor coverage area may extend up to several meters from the proximity sensor . Various devices may serve as the proximity sensor . In some embodiments the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal based at least in part on the receipt of electromagnetic radiation reflected off or radiated from the user. In some embodiments the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal by sensing a physical presence of the user. In some embodiments the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal without contact between the user and the computing device e.g. without contact between a user and a touchscreen mouse or keyboard included in the input device not shown . In some embodiments the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal without wirelessly communicating with an electronic device in the user s possession e.g. without wireless communication between a radio frequency RF tag and the computing device or wireless communication between a Bluetooth tag and the computing device . In some embodiments the proximity sensor may be an infrared sensor.

The proximity sensor may include one or more proximity sensors. For example the proximity sensor may include one or more infrared sensors. An infrared sensor included in the proximity sensor may be an active infrared sensor or a passive infrared sensor. An active infrared sensor may include an infrared electromagnetic radiation emitter and an infrared electromagnetic radiation detector and may detect the distance between the sensor and the user by measuring reflected infrared radiation from the emitter at the receiver. In some embodiments an active infrared sensor may be an amplitude based sensor and may use the strength of the infrared signal received at the detector to determine the distance. In some embodiments an active infrared sensor may be a time based sensor and may use the travel time of the infrared signal emitted and then received to determine the distance. In some embodiments an active infrared sensor may have a power consumption on the order of 10 milliwatts. The longer the range of the active infrared sensor the greater its power consumption. A passive infrared sensor may measure infrared electromagnetic radiation radiating from objects in the proximity sensor coverage area and use the measured radiation to determine distance. In some embodiments a passive infrared sensor may have a power consumption on the order of 10 microwatts. In some embodiments an infrared sensor included in the proximity sensor may be small enough to be mounted in a display or casing of a tablet or laptop computing device.

In some embodiments the proximity sensor may include two or more infrared proximity sensors arranged at different angles such that each infrared proximity sensor covers a particular coverage area and the combination of the two or more infrared proximity sensors covers a coverage area equal to the union of the particular coverage areas. In some embodiments the proximity sensor may be configured to generate a proximity signal in response to a trigger from the processing device . For example in embodiments in which the proximity sensor includes an electromagnetic radiation source and an electromagnetic radiation detector the processing device may signal to the proximity sensor to activate the source and or detector when a proximity signal is desired for use in controlling the storage device e.g. in accordance with the operation of the control system discussed below with reference to . In some embodiments the proximity sensor may be configured to generate a proximity signal periodically and may not respond to triggers from the processing device or may generate proximity signals in response to triggers as well as periodically.

In some embodiments the input device may include an image capture device . The image capture device may be configured to capture an image of an image capture coverage area proximate to the computing device . In some embodiments the image capture device may include a webcam e.g. a stand alone webcam or a webcam mounted in a laptop screen . The image capture device may include one or more image capture devices. For example the image capture device may include two or more image capture devices arranged at different angles such that each image capture device covers a particular coverage area and the combination of the two or more image capture device covers a coverage area equal to the union of the particular coverage areas. In some embodiments the image capture device may be configured to capture an image in response to a trigger from the processing device e.g. in accordance with the operation of the control system discussed below with reference to .

The processing device may be coupled with the input device and may be configured to receive one or more signals from the input device and analyze those signals to cause changes in the power state of the storage device . In some embodiments the processing device may include a central processing unit CPU and a chipset to manage the flow of data between the CPU and other components of the computing device . In some embodiments the processing device may be a system on a chip SoC . Additional details regarding various embodiments of the processing device are discussed below with reference to .

The processing device may be coupled with a dynamic random access memory DRAM which may store temporary instructions and data needed to complete operations of the processing device for example. In some embodiments when the computing device enters a sleep power management mode data stored in the DRAM may be maintained in the DRAM . When the computing device enters a hibernate power management mode data stored in the DRAM may be transferred to the storage device and the DRAM may be powered down thereby losing any data previously stored in the DRAM .

The processing device may be coupled with a control memory . The processing device may store any desired parameters or instructions for performing any of the storage device control operations described herein in the control memory . For example the control memory may store any out of proximity criteria in proximity criteria out of image criteria and in image criteria used by the control system as discussed below. The control memory may include volatile memory nonvolatile memory removable media or any desired type of memory in any desired memory location. For example in some embodiments the control memory may include a portion of the DRAM . Particular examples of control related data that may be stored in the control memory for access by the processing device are discussed in detail below with reference to . The control memory may include a set of computational logic which may include one or more copies of computer readable media having instructions stored therein which when executed by the processing device cause the computing device to implement any of the techniques disclosed herein or any portion thereof.

The processing device may be coupled with the storage device and may be configured to read and or write data to the storage device . The storage device may include any of a number of different types of storage devices and may include none one or more of each such type. In some embodiments one or more of the different number and types of storage device included in the storage device may be controlled by the processing device . For example each storage device included in the storage device may be controlled by a different embodiment of a control system in accordance with any of the control system embodiments disclosed herein. In some embodiments the storage device may include one or more nonvolatile storage devices.

The storage device may include a hard disk drive HDD . The HDD may use a magnetic head to read and write data encoded in magnetic material on one or more rotating disks. The HDD may include one or more spindle motors for rotating the disks and for moving the magnetic head during data read write. The HDD may include one or more HDDs which may be jointly or independently controlled by a suitably configured processing device in accordance with the techniques disclosed herein. Read and or write operations to the HDD may be executed using a communication protocol such as Serial Advanced Technology Attachment SATA . In some embodiments the HDD may have four possible power states an ACTIVE power state in which power is supplied to the one or more spindle motors to rotate the disks and the HDD is servicing inputs and outputs I O such as reads writes or other commands an IDLE power state in which power is supplied to the one or more spindle motors to rotate the disks but no I O commands are in progress a STANDBY power state in which power is no longer supplied to the one or more spindle motors causing the disks to spin down and an OFF power state in which no power is consumed by the one or more spindle motors or any other components.

The storage device may include a solid state drive SSD . The SSD may include a controller configured to read and write data to a number of integrated circuit IC memory devices without the use of moving parts. The SSD may include one or more SDDs which may be jointly or independently controlled by a suitably configured processing device in accordance with the techniques disclosed herein. Read and or write operations to the SSD may be executed using a communication protocol such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express PCIe . In some embodiments the SSD may have four possible power states an ACTIVE power state in which power is supplied to the SSD and the SSD is servicing I O an IDLE power state in which power consumption is reduced but the SSD is ready to receive commands and service I O with a minimal amount of latency a SLEEP power state in which a controller and or storage components of the SSD are powered off and a minimal amount of interface circuitry remains powered to wake the SSD when needed and an OFF power state in which no power is consumed by the SSD .

The storage device may include other nonvolatile memory NVM . For example the NVM may include an e Multimedia Card eMMC which may include a controller and flash memory in a ball grid array BGA package for embedding in IC devices. The NVM may include one or more NVMs which may be jointly or independently controlled by a suitably configured processing device in accordance with the techniques disclosed herein. Read and or write operations to the NVM may be executed using a communication protocol such as an eMMC serial protocol. In some embodiments the NVM may have four possible power states an ACTIVE power state in which power is supplied to the NVM and the NVM is servicing I O an IDLE power state in which power consumption is reduced but the NVM is ready to receive commands and service I O with a minimal amount of latency a SLEEP power state in which most of the NVM is powered off and minimal logic remains powered to respond to reset or sleep wake commands and an OFF power state in which no power is consumed by the NVM .

The computing device may include the power control device which may be coupled with the processing device and the storage device . In some embodiments the power control device may be configured to receive a command from the processing device to change a power state of the storage device . The storage device may consume less power after the change in power state or more power after the change in power state depending on the command received from the processing device . In some embodiments the power control device may include one or more switches coupled between the storage device and a power supply not shown . The power control device may control the one or more switches to control the power supplied to the storage device in response to command signals from the processing device . For example in some embodiments the power control device may be configured to supply power to the HDD in a first power state and cut power to the HDD in a second power state resulting in lower power consumption in the second power state than in the first power state . In some embodiments the power control device may be a driver for one or more components of the storage device .

The receiver logic may be coupled with the input device and may be configured to receive a proximity signal from the proximity sensor . The proximity signal may be indicative of a distance of the user from the proximity sensor as discussed above.

The transition logic may be coupled with the receiver logic and may be configured to determine that the proximity signal received by the receiver logic satisfies one or more out of proximity criteria. The out of proximity criteria may indicate that a user of the computing device is no longer in the proximity of the computing device and therefore not likely to be using the computing device . As used herein the term proximity may refer to the range of distance around a computing device in which a user may be present to effectively use the computing device. The size and shape of a region proximate to a particular computing device may depend on the type of computing device the environment in which the computing device is situated any peripherals being used with the computing device and or any other suitable factors. In some embodiments the transition logic may determine that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria upon determining that the proximity signal indicates that the user is located at a distance farther than a threshold distance away from the proximity sensor or from any other suitable landmark associated with the computing device . A number of examples of out of proximity criteria are discussed herein.

The transition logic may also be configured to generate an out transition signal based at least in part on the determination of the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria. In some embodiments the transition logic may generate the out transition signal upon determination that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria while in other embodiments the transition logic may require additional conditions before generating the out transition signal.

Some such conditions may be timer based. In some embodiments the transition logic may be coupled with timer logic . The timer logic may be configured to implement one or more timers which may count down or up in order to indicate whether a predetermined amount of time has elapsed from activation of the timer. The timer logic may include one or more oscillators memory devices and any additional timer components known in the art. In some embodiments the transition logic may be configured to trigger the timer logic to activate a proximity timer based at least in part on the determination by the transition logic that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria. In some such embodiments the transition logic may be configured to generate the out transition signal based at least in part on the proximity timer reaching a threshold value. The use of timers and various embodiments disclosed herein may build some amount of hysteresis into the operation of the control system which may avoid undesired changes in state that may be caused by intermittent and unpredictable human or other movements around the computing device as detected by the proximity sensor or others of the input device .

In some embodiments the transition logic may be configured to determine that the proximity signal received by the receiver logic satisfies one or more in proximity criteria. The in proximity criteria may indicate that a user of the computing device in the proximity of the computing device and therefore likely to be using the computing device or intending to use the computing device in the near future. In some embodiments the transition logic may determine that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria upon determining that the proximity signal indicates that the user is located at a distance less than a threshold distance away from the proximity sensor or from any other suitable landmark associated with the computing device .

In some embodiments the in proximity criteria may be complementary to the out of proximity criteria discussed above. For example the transition logic may determine that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria when the user is determined to be greater than 6 feet away from the proximity sensor and may determine that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria when the user is determined to be less than 6 feet away from the proximity sensor . In some embodiments the in proximity criteria are not complementary to the out of proximity criteria and indeed may be overlapping. For example the transition logic may determine that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria when the user is determined to be greater than 6 feet away from the proximity sensor and may determine that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria when the user is determined to be less than 8 feet away from the proximity sensor . Because the transition logic may be evaluating the proximity signal against the out of proximity criteria in the in proximity criteria under different circumstances this overlap may not create a conflict for the transition logic . A number of examples of in proximity criteria are discussed herein.

The transition logic may also be configured to generate an in transition signal based at least in part on the determination of the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria. In some embodiments the transition logic may generate the in transition signal upon determination that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria while in other embodiments the transition logic may require additional conditions before generating the in transition signal e.g. a timer based condition as discussed above .

As noted above the control system may include state change logic . The state change logic may be coupled with the transition logic and may be configured to cause a change in the power state of the storage device based at least in part on an out transition signal or an in transition signal generated by the transition logic . In some embodiments based at least in part on an out transition signal generated by the transition logic the state change logic may cause the power state of the storage device to change from a first power state to a second power state in which the storage device consumes less power than in the first power state. In some embodiments based at least in part on and in transition signal generated by the transition logic the state change logic may cause the power state of the storage device to change from the second power state to the first power state. The terms first power state and second power state are used herein to refer to power states of the storage device having different power consumptions but the storage device may have two or more different power states. The techniques and systems disclosed herein may be used to change between any number of power states and are not limited to two power states. In particular the techniques and systems disclosed herein for changing from a first power state to a second lower consumption power state may be used to change from any power state to a lower consumption power state and may skip a power state in between or may be applied serially to make multiple changes in power state. Similarly the techniques and systems disclosed herein for changing from a second power state to a first higher consumption power state may be used to change from any particular power state to a higher consumption power state and may skip a power state in between or may be applied serially to make multiple changes in power state.

In some embodiments the transition logic may be configured to generate out and in transition signals using signals other than a proximity signal from the proximity sensor instead of or in addition to a proximity signal. For example in some embodiments the receiver logic may be configured to receive an image from the image capture device as discussed above and the transition logic may be configured to determine that the image satisfies out of image criteria or in image criteria. The transition logic may be configured to generate the out transition signal based at least in part on a determination that the image satisfies the out of image criteria e.g. instead of or in addition to the determination that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria . The transition logic may be configured to generate the in transition signal based at least in part on a determination that the image satisfies the in image criteria e.g. instead of or in addition to the determination that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria . In some embodiments the in image criteria may include the detection of a human body shape in the image capture coverage area of the image. In some embodiments the out of image criteria may include the detection of the absence of a color or pattern of garment associated with the user in the image. The image capture coverage area may or may not overlap with the proximity sensor coverage area. For example illustrate side and overhead views respectively of an embodiment of the proximity sensor and an image capture device in the computing device . In particular the computing device of the embodiment is shown as an open laptop computing device positioned on a table . The image capture device is shown as positioned at a top of a display of the computing device while the proximity sensor is shown as positioned at a front edge of a base of the computing device . The base may include a keyboard and or a touchpad . The proximity sensor coverage area is shown as overlapping with the image capture coverage area .

Timer based conditions related to images received by the receiver logic may also be used by the transition logic to generate the in and out transition signals as discussed above with respect to the proximity signal. A number of examples of in image and out of image criteria are discussed herein. For example in some embodiments the transition logic may be configured to activate an image timer implemented by the timer logic based at least in part on a determination by the transition logic that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria. The image capture device may be configured to capture the image in response to the image timer reaching a threshold value.

The image capture device may be capable of capturing images at two or more different resolutions. In some such embodiments when the image capture device captures an image that is to be used for storage device control purposes by the control system the image capture device may capture a low resolution image and provide that image to the receiver logic . This low resolution image may have a resolution that is lower than the maximum achievable resolution of the image capture device and may be lower than any user configurable resolution. For example a user may be able to configure the image capture device to capture images at 320 240 640 480 or 480 720 pixels. In some embodiments images captured by the image capture device may be used by the control system may be captured at the lowest user configurable resolution here e.g. 320 240 or a lower resolution e.g. 160 120 or lower .

The choice of what types of proximity sensor to include in the proximity sensor and whether or not to use additional input devices such as the image capture device for storage device power state control purposes may be based on a desired balance between the accuracy of detecting a user s presence and the power required to operate the input devices and process the data that they generate. For example embodiments of the control system may be configured to receive a frequent stream of high resolution images from the image capture device perform sophisticated pattern recognition on these images to identify and recognize the facial features of a particular user and cause changes in the power state of the storage device based on the results of this recognition e.g. by only changing power state when the user s presence is detected or absent from the processed images . However the amount of power required to capture and process these images may be substantial and may undercut or outweigh the power savings gained in causing the storage device to transition to a lower power state. In some embodiments no image processing may be performed by the control system for controlling power states of the storage device .

In another example as noted above the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal without wirelessly communicating with an electronic device in the user s possession e.g. without wireless communication between an RF tag and the computing device or wireless communication between a Bluetooth tag and the computing device . Performing user presence detection using Bluetooth or similar wireless communications may be significantly more power intensive than using an infrared or other proximity sensor and thus any Bluetooth or similar approaches to waking a computing device may not achieve the power saving purposes described herein. Additionally such approaches require the user to maintain possession of a Bluetooth or other tag and to keep that tag in a position that is readily detectable by the computing device if the tag is lost stolen or otherwise inappropriately positioned the control system that relies on detection of this tag will fail.

Since the proper choice of input devices and analysis techniques must weigh the energy expenditure against the potential energy savings a number of the embodiments disclosed herein may provide a range of possible implementations to tune this balance. For example configuring the computing device to capture and use a lower resolution image captured by the image capture device may require less power than capturing and using a higher resolution image. The frequency of image capture and proximity sensor readings may also be adjusted. As discussed below in some embodiments more power intensive techniques may be used as a final check after lower power techniques have established that it is likely that a user is no longer in the presence of the computing device or has come into the presence of the computing device . Variations of this kind are within the scope of the systems and techniques disclosed herein.

The techniques and systems disclosed herein may have a number of advantageous features. The storage subsystems of computing platforms may be one of the largest consumers of power in the platform and thus techniques for saving power in the subsystems may substantially reduce the burden on batteries and more broadly reduce the environmental footprint of these platforms. In some embodiments a power switch e.g. the power control device of a computing platform may be controlled by hardware configured with software to implement a storage device power control technique e.g. as described above with reference to the control system using signals from sensors included in the computing device e.g. the proximity sensor thereby adjusting the power consumed by one or more storage devices e.g. the storage device .

Existing approaches typically involve hardware or software configured to guess when the user is actively utilizing a computing device based on for example fixed idle timeout values e.g. a fixed time during which no touchscreen activity is detected and thereby initiate low power states. These approaches may fail to transition a storage device to a low power state when the user is not using the device resulting in excess energy consumption and sub optimal battery life . The limited amount of information used by these approaches may also result in undesirably transitioning a device that is in use to a low power state e.g. when the user is reading text or studying an image on a display causing the computing device to seem unresponsive as the storage device returns to a higher power state and thereby frustrating the user. These existing approaches are often further constrained by predefined operating system power policies which are defined by default or by a user e.g. High Power Balanced or Power Saver policies and do not take into consideration the user s behavior beyond conventional fixed idle timeout values. Existing approaches using timer based transitions to low power states may thus be ineffective dissatisfying for the user or both.

The systems and techniques disclosed herein may enable more aggressive and intelligent storage device power management. For example in some embodiments a laptop or tablet computing device may be configured to detect whether a user is within a particular area proximate to the computing device and may transition a storage device of the computing device to a low power state upon determining that the user is not present in the area for a threshold amount of time. In some embodiments the control system may detect a user leaving the proximity of the computing device and returning to the proximity of the computing device and may enable the storage device to be transition to a lower power state in the interim during intervals which would be too short for traditional timer based approaches. Because HDD s may consume up to approximately 80 or more of the power expended by a computing device during idle depending on the specifics of the platform the techniques and systems disclosed herein may be particularly advantageous when applied to the control of HDDs e.g. the HDD . In particular power savings of up to 500 or 400 milliwatts or greater may be achieved when HDDs are transitioned into OFF or STANDBY power states when idle respectively e.g. for 2.5 inch mobile HDDs representing a substantial amount of power saving potential which may translate to 45 minutes of battery life or more for a laptop computing device . Since wake latency discussed below is similar for an HDD from the OFF and STANDBY power states the systems and techniques disclosed herein may allow storage devices to be brought to minimum power states while idle without sacrificing wake time. Although the power savings expected for HDDs may be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the power savings expected for SSDs the benefits of using the systems and techniques disclosed herein to control the power state of an SSD may also be significant.

In embodiments in which the techniques and systems disclosed herein are used to bring the storage device from a second lower power state to a first power state e.g. a fully powered state the use of proximity sensors such as the proximity sensor to initiate the change in state may hide the time it takes to wake the computing device from the user by beginning the wake sequence before the user has made physical contact with the computing device . This wake latency increases as storage devices transition from lower power state to a fully powered state and to bring a magnetic disk of an HDD to 5400 or 7200 rotations per minute may be on the order of 3 to 8 seconds and has typically resulted in increasing frustration for users as devices become more power efficient. By using presence of a user as detected by a proximity sensor to initiate changes in power state the techniques and systems disclosed herein may mitigate the trade off between the efficiency of low power states of storage devices and quick wake time.

The techniques and systems disclosed herein may be advantageously applied in computing devices that include small SSDs operating as caches for HDDs as well as hybrid technologies that combine SSD and HDD features such as solid state hybrid drives SSHDs . In some such embodiments the cache may be used instead of accessing the HDD for a majority of I O operations. The use of the cache may create opportunities for time windows having durations in the multiple minutes where no HDD access may be required and thus an HDD may be transitioned into a lower power state e.g. spun down or powered off . However a single miss of the cache during operation of a computing device may require HDD access which can result in a multi second system stall while the HDD spins up and becomes ready. These lags can negatively impact the user experience. Use of proximity sensors to detect when a user is near his or her computing device and to automatically change the power state of a storage device such as the HDD or the SDD may reduce the occasions on which the user is subject to HDD or SSD power on delay in these embodiments and may allow energy saving when appropriate.

The potential for the use of proximity sensors and other devices to enable more aggressive power management of storage devices has not been previously recognized. At best some smartphone devices may include a proximity sensor that is used to disable touchscreen capability when the user receives a call and brings the smartphone to his or her ear to talk. The purpose of this disabling is to prevent accidental activation of elements of the user interface on the touchscreen and to turn off the touchscreen display when not needed. The configuration of the smartphones has the effect of disabling display components when the user is detected to be so close to the smartphone that the display might be accidentally activated. Proximity sensors have not been utilized or appreciated in devices that include hard disk drives or solid state drives such as desktop or laptop computers.

At the operation the control system may determine whether the storage device is in a first power state. The first power state may be a power state in which more power is consumed than a second possible power state of the storage device . Thus at the operation the control system may determine whether there is a lower power state achievable for the storage device . The operation may be performed by the state change logic for example.

If the control system determines at the operation that the storage device is in the first power state and that therefore the storage device would consume less power if transitioned to the second power state the control system may proceed to the operation and receive a proximity signal. The proximity signal may be generated by the proximity sensor and may be indicative of a distance of a user from the proximity sensor within a proximity sensor coverage area. The operation may be performed by the receiver logic for example. Proximity signals received at the operation may be generated by the proximity sensor at periodic intervals e.g. every 30 seconds . Consequently in some embodiments the operation may only be performed at these periodic intervals.

At the operation the control system may determine whether the proximity signal received at the operation satisfies the out of proximity criteria. Various embodiments of out of proximity criteria are described elsewhere herein and illustrative embodiment of the operation is discussed below with reference to . The operation may be performed by the transition logic for example. If the control system determines at the operation that the proximity signal does not satisfy the out of proximity criteria the control system may return to the operation and determine whether the storage device is in a first power state.

If the control system determines that the operation that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria the control system may determine whether non proximity out transition criteria are satisfied at the operation . Examples of non proximity out transition criteria may include the image based criteria discussed above e.g. the out of image criteria or conventional keyboard touchpad or mouse usage criteria typically used in existing power management mode applications e.g. the absence of user contact with a touchscreen for a predetermined amount of time . The operation may be performed by the transition logic for example. If the control system determines at the operation that the non proximity out transition criteria are not satisfied the control system may return to the operation and determine whether the storage device is in a first power state.

If the control system determines at the operation that the non proximity out transition criteria are satisfied the control system may proceed to the operation and generate an out transition signal.

The operation may be performed by the state change logic for example.

In some embodiments the power state of the storage device may be changed from the first power state to the second power state in response to a power state interrupt as indicated by the block . The power state interrupt of block may be generated by another component of the computing device and may override or complement the process . In some embodiments the power state interrupt of block may be generated in response to a software power off command instruction by the user or by a software or hardware component. In some embodiments the power state interrupt of block may be generated in response to an instruction by the user to turn a screen of the computing device off. In some embodiments the power state interrupt of block may be generated in response to the expiration of an input output I O timer. Any one or more of these interrupt sources or any other suitable interrupt sources may cause the storage device to change to the second power state from the first power state independent of the execution of the process .

Upon causing a change in the power state of the storage device to the second power state at the operation the control system may return to the operation and determine whether the storage device is in the first power state.

If the control system determines at the operation that the storage device is not in the first power state and is instead in the second power state and therefore that the storage device would consume more power if transitioned to the first power state the control system may proceed to the operation and receive a proximity signal e.g. as discussed above with reference to the operation . The operation may be performed by the receiver logic for example. As noted above in some embodiments the operation may only be performed at these periodic intervals. The periodicity of the operation may be different from the periodicity of the operation .

At the operation the control system may determine whether the proximity signal received at the operation satisfies the in proximity criteria. Various embodiments of in proximity criteria are described elsewhere herein and illustrative embodiment of the operation is discussed below with reference to . The operation may be performed by the transition logic for example. If the control system determines at the operation that the proximity signal does not satisfy the in proximity criteria the control system may return to the operation and determine whether the storage device is in a first power state.

If the control system determines that the operation that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria the control system may determine whether non proximity in transition criteria are satisfied at the operation . Examples of non proximity in transition criteria may include the image based criteria discussed above e.g. the in image criteria or conventional keyboard touchpad or mouse usage criteria typically used in existing power management mode applications e.g. the detection of user contact with a touchpad . The operation may be performed by the transition logic for example. If the control system determines at the operation that the non proximity in transition criteria are not satisfied the control system may return to the operation and determine whether the storage device is in a first power state.

If the control system determines at the operation that the non proximity in transition criteria are satisfied the control system may proceed to the operation and generate an in transition signal. The operation may be performed by the transition logic for example. At the operation the control system may cause a change in the power state of the storage device from the second power state to the first power state. The operation may be performed by the state change logic for example.

In some embodiments the power state of the storage device may be changed from the second power state to the first power state in response to a power state interrupt as indicated by the block . The power state interrupt of block may be generated by another component of the computing device and may override or complement the process . In some embodiments the power state interrupt of block may be generated in response to keyboard mouse and or touchscreen activity. In some embodiments the power state interrupt of block may be generated in response to a software power up command. In some embodiments the power state interrupt of block may be generated in response to detection of I O activity. Any one or more of these interrupt sources or any other suitable interrupt sources may cause the storage device to change to the first power state from the second power state independent of the execution of the process . Upon causing a change in the power state of the storage device to the first power state at the operation the control system may return to the operation and determine whether the storage device is in the first power state.

At the operation the control system may initialize a proximity check counter C. The proximity check counter C may be stored in the control memory along with a maximum value CMAX. The proximity check counter C may keep track of the number of times the proximity signal is analyzed prior to generating the out transition signal. In some embodiments only a single check of the proximity signal may be included in the process and therefore the proximity check counter C may not be stored or monitored.

At the operation the control system may determine a distance of the user from the proximity sensor . This determination may be based at least in part on the proximity signal generated by the proximity sensor e.g. as received by the receiver logic at the operation of .

At the operation the control system may determine whether the distance determined at the operation is greater than a threshold value associated with the check C. Different checks may be associated with different threshold distance values. For example a first check of the proximity signal may require that a user be greater than 4 feet away from the computing device while a second check of the proximity signal evaluating a proximity signal received after the first check may require that a user be greater than 8 feet away. Using different threshold values for different checks in some embodiments may allow the control system to evaluate more complex patterns of user movement than a single distance threshold which may allow the control system to perform more intelligent control.

If the control system determines at the operation that the distance determined at the operation is not greater than the threshold value the control system may determine that the proximity signal does not satisfy the out of proximity criteria and return a value of NO.

If the control system determines at the operation that the distance determined at the operation is greater than the threshold value the control system may proceed to the operation and determine whether the value of the check C is equal to the maximum value CMAX. If the value of the check C is equal to the maximum value CMAX then no more checks of the proximity signal need be performed and the control system may return a value of YES indicating that the proximity signal satisfies the out of proximity criteria. If the value of the check C has not reached the maximum value CMAX the control system may increment the proximity check counter C at the operation .

The control system may then activate a proximity timer implemented by the timer logic at the operation . At the operation the control system may determine whether the proximity timer activated at the operation has reached a threshold value associated with the check C. As discussed above with reference to the operation different checks may be associated with different threshold timer values. For example a second check of the proximity signal may take place 3 seconds after a first check while a third check of the proximity signal may take place 10 seconds after the second check. As discussed above with reference to different threshold distance values for different checks using different threshold timer values for different checks may allow the control system to evaluate more complex patterns of user movement. The control system may continue to evaluate the proximity timer at the operation until the threshold is reached.

If the control system determines that the proximity timer has reached the threshold value associated with the check C the control system may proceed to the operation and receive a proximity signal. The proximity signal may be received by the receiver logic for example. In some embodiments the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal in response to a trigger from the receiver logic or the transition logic e.g. issued upon the proximity timer reaching the threshold .

Subsequent to receiving the proximity signal at the operation the control system may proceed to the operation and determine the distance of the user from the proximity sensor based at least in part on the proximity signal received at the operation . The process may continue until the control system determines that a user is not greater than a threshold distance away from the computing device e.g. as determined at the operation or until the maximum number of checks CMAX has been performed and the user has been determined to be greater than the threshold distance away at each check.

At the operation the control system may activate an image timer. The image timer may be implemented by the timer logic .

If the control system determines at the operation that the image does not satisfy the out of image criteria the control system may determine that the non proximity out transition criteria are not satisfied and return a value of NO.

At the operation the control system may initialize a proximity check counter C. The proximity check counter C may be stored in the control memory along with a maximum value CMAX and may be substantially similar to the proximity check counter discussed above with reference to but may be used to keep track of the number of times the proximity signal is analyzed prior to generating the in transition signal.

At the operation the control system may determine a distance of the user from the proximity sensor . This determination may be based at least in part on the proximity signal generated by the proximity sensor e.g. as received by the receiver logic at the operation of .

At the operation the control system may determine whether the distance determined at the operation is less than a threshold value associated with the check C. As discussed above with reference to different checks may be associated with different threshold distance values. For example a first check of the proximity signal may require that a user be less than 6 feet away from the computing device while a second check of the proximity signal evaluating a proximity signal received after the first check may require that a user be greater than 3 feet away.

If the control system determines at the operation that the distance determined at the operation is not less than the threshold value the control system may determine that the proximity signal does not satisfy the in proximity criteria and return a value of NO.

If the control system determines at the operation that the distance determined at the operation is less than the threshold value the control system may proceed to the operation and determine whether the value of the check C is equal to the maximum value CMAX. If the value of the check C is equal to the maximum value CMAX then no more checks of the proximity signal need be performed and the control system may return a value of YES indicating that the proximity signal satisfies the in proximity criteria. If the value of the check C has not reached the maximum value CMAX the control system may increment the proximity check counter C at the operation .

The control system may then activate a proximity timer implemented by the timer logic at the operation . At the operation the control system may determine whether the proximity timer activated at the operation has reached a threshold value associated with the check C. As discussed above with reference to different checks may be associated with different threshold timer values. For example a second check of the proximity signal may take place 3 seconds after a first check while a third check of the proximity signal may take place 1 second after the second check. The control system may continue to evaluate the proximity timer at the operation until the threshold is reached.

If the control system determines that the proximity timer has reached the threshold value associated with the check C the control system may proceed to the operation and receive a proximity signal. The proximity signal may be received by the receiver logic for example. In some embodiments the proximity sensor may generate the proximity signal in response to a trigger from the receiver logic or the transition logic e.g. issued upon the proximity timer reaching the threshold .

Note that in the embodiment illustrated in the computing device may make two possible transitions from a higher power state to a lower power state e.g. the transition from ACTIVE to STANDBY in the transition from STANDBY to OFF . In some embodiments the control system may be configured with only one possible transition from a higher power state to a lower power state e.g. the transition from ACTIVE to OFF .

The set may include out of proximity criteria which may include one proximity check as discussed above with reference to .

The out of image criteria may also specify an image processing technique that is to be used to determine whether or not the image satisfies out of image criteria or not. The technique illustrated for the set of is a color detection technique which determines whether a predominant color associated with the user e.g. the color and or pattern of a user s shirt or hat is present in the image indicating that the user is proximate to and likely using the computing device . Other image processing techniques may be used instead of or in addition to a color detection technique as discussed elsewhere herein. The set may also include other non proximity criteria such as no keyboard activity during a monitoring period as discussed above with reference to the set .

The set may govern the transition of the HDD from a OFF power state which may serve as the second power state discussed above with reference to to an ACTIVE power state which may serve as the first power state discussed above . The set may include in proximity criteria which may include one proximity check as discussed above with reference to .

The set may also include other non proximity criteria such as keyboard mouse or touchscreen activity during a monitoring period as discussed above with reference to the set . The sets and are simply illustrative in any desired criteria or combination of criteria may be implemented in the control system .

In some embodiments the distance thresholds timer thresholds and other criteria used by the control system to determine whether to generate an in or out transition signal may be dynamically adapted based on the history of the user s interactions with the computing device . For example if the computing device is idle every day between 12 00 PM and 1 00 PM a threshold for a proximity timer applied near or during that period may be made smaller than a threshold for proximity timer at other times of day because it is very likely that once the user is first detected to be out of proximity of the computing device he or she will remain out of proximity and therefore the storage device may be transitioned to a lower power state. Thus the threshold for the proximity timer may itself be a function of the absolute system time. In another example if the computing device is idle during time intervals which correspond to a meeting or event for which the user received an electronic calendar invitation with a different location than the location of the computing device the control system may adapt to reduce the proximity timer threshold for proximity timers applied near or during periods corresponding to such calendar invitations. In another example if the computing device is idle for five minutes after each email from a particular individual the control system may adapt to reduce the proximity timer threshold for proximity timers applied soon after the receipt of such emails. In another example the control system may monitor an average idle time for the computing device and may scale the thresholds used for various criteria in accordance with this average idle time e.g. using thresholds equal to a multiple of the average idle time . The control system may be configured with any suitable machine learning technique which may use history data such as that described above which may be stored for example in the control memory to adjust the criteria used in determining whether to generate an in or out transition signal in order to minimize power consumption.
