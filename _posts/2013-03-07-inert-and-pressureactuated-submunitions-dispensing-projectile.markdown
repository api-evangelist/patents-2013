title: Inert and pressure-actuated submunitions dispensing projectile
abstract: An inert axisymmetric projectile is provided for launching from a shipboard gun and dispersing submunitions at a target. The projectile includes a base plug, a sabot housing, a submunitions package, and a retainer ring. The sabot housing includes a plurality of sabot petals angularly arranged and attached to the plug. The housing includes a payload portion and a nose portion, with a passage corridor between these portions. The submunitions package is contained within the payload portion and constrained radially by the housing. The retainer ring constrains the petals for joining together. Upon launch aerodynamic pressure fractures the ring and causes the petals to unfurl, thereby releasing the submunitions package for dispersal.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to gun launched projectiles. In particular this invention relates to submunition dispensing rounds without incorporation of energetic materials.

As the United States Navy transitions from a Blue Water Combat Posture to a Littoral Combat Posture naval warships become more susceptible to attack from non conventional surface weapon platforms from shore launched threats such as coastal boats. The Mk 45 5 54 62 Gun Mount serves as one of the primary surface warfare weapons aboard these vessels. Although there are multiple 5 five inch diameter projectiles available for use against small boat threats their fuzing safe and arm devices preclude their use at close ranges.

Additionally rules of engagement often permit potential small boat threats to enter within the minimum fuzing safe and arm ranges thus eliminating any potential self defense contributions from the Mk 45 5 54 62 caliber Gun Mount. Cruiser CG 47 USS Ticonderoga and destroyer DDG 51 USS Arleigh Burke class ships employ the Mk 45 5 54 62 Gun Mount as a primary surface warfare weapon. The Mk 45 5 54 62 Gun Mount is a fully automated rifled single barrel weapon that stows and fires 5 54 62 caliber ammunition. The weapon is capable of firing 70 lb projectiles at surface craft low altitude aircraft and shore targets.

Conventional gun launched projectiles yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Although there are multiple 5 5 inch diameter projectiles available for use against small boat threats their fuzing safe and arm devices preclude their use at close ranges eliminating any potential self defense contributions from Mk 45 5 54 62 Gun Mount. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide an inert axisymmetric projectile for launching from a shipboard gun and dispersing submunitions at a target.

The projectile features include a base plug a sabot housing a submunitions package a retainer ring and a slip obturator. The sabot housing includes a plurality of sabot petals angularly arranged and attached to the plug. The housing includes a payload portion and a nose portion with a passage corridor between these portions. The submunitions package is contained within the payload portion and constrained radially by the housing. The retainer ring constrains the petals for joining together. Upon launch the ring fractures from aerodynamic pressure and rotational forces. This causes the petals to unfurl thereby releasing the submunitions package for dispersal.

The slip obturator engages the lands and grooves of the barrel rifling and seals the explosive gases behind the projectile preventing them from advancing further up the projectile and potentially causing damage. The projectile slips at the interface between the slip obturator and the base plug reducing the spin on the projectile that would have otherwise been induced by the barrel rifling. As the projectile progresses down the barrel the structure of the sabot petals resist undesired deformations under the gun launch loadings of axial inertial setback and rotational inertia. The forward retaining band is restrained from deformation or failure by the radial restraint of the gun barrel itself.

Once the projectile exits the muzzle of the gun the retaining band is no longer restrained by the barrel and fractures. The band suffers a controlled fracture by means of stress concentrations at geometric cross section reductions along its circumference due to the combined loadings of axial inertial setback rotational inertia and aerodynamic stagnation pressure. Thus absent restraint at their forward ends the sabot petals begin to peal away from the projectile s central axis due to the centrifugal forces caused by rotation as well as pressure resulting from petal contact with the ambient air. The petals then discard from the projectile and expose the interior submunitions package. The submunitions immediately begin to disperse radially due to their rotational inertia and their interaction with the ambient air. The dispersed payload is then disposed to engage the intended target. The remaining non payload projectile components in flight are considered sacrificial materials.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Various exemplary embodiments provide an inert gun launched projectile actuated by gun launch induced pressures or pressure actuated projectile inert PAPI for standoff ship defense against proximate threats. The PAPI dispenses an internal payload of multiple fragments over an extended area without the use of a conventional fuze or energetic material. The PAPI uses the propelling gasses and acceleration induced forces from gun launch to initiate internal mechanisms that release housing petals and dispense an internal payload towards a target.

PAPI is being developed to significantly increase the self defense capabilities of warships against small fast asymmetric watercraft threats. Being inert renders the PAPI more convenient and safer to store manufacture and maintain. In this context the term inert means without energetic material such as an explosive or chemical propellant to disperse submunitions from the projectile upon reaching the target.

The PAPI increases capacity provided to the fleet for proximate ship self defense by providing a near field projectile to be fired from a 5 5 inch e.g. Mk 45 diameter ship board gun. As such the PAPI constitutes an axisymmetric munitions round. The PAPI is unique less due to its objective but because of features related to achieving that objective. There are existing shotgun type rounds in use by the United States Army. However these rounds disperse their payloads by means of projectile bodies that shatter apart at or near muzzle exit from the gun.

The PAPI dispenses its payload using mechanisms actuated by gun launch forces. These mechanisms employ controlled fracture of a retaining ring or the channeling of propellant gasses into the interior of the projectile during gun launch. Current research reveals no existing projectile that dispenses a multiple fragment payload by channeling propellant gas to actuate a mechanical device. The novelty of these embodiments can also be extended by the use of a slip obturator to retard spread of the submunitions by reducing spin when fired out of a rifled gun barrel. Exemplary embodiments use the slip obturator to reduce spin i.e. angular rotation about the PAPI s longitudinal axis to limit the distribution of the payload to a smaller area. Alternatively the PAPI can use a regular obturator thereby achieving full spin and enabling the round to accurately traverse to the target.

Most shotgun type rounds are fired out of a smoothbore barrel. PAPI can be used on ships wielding large caliber rifled barrels to engage close range asymmetric surface threats. The inner spring and pressure actuation mechanism of PAPI can be used for other types and sizes of projectile or as a release mechanism initiated by inertial forces. The principle embodiments described herein include an aerodynamic design and a mechanical design. Each configuration is described in further detail.

Exemplary balls can be composed of a dense metal such as 0.375 inch diameter tungsten spheres. The base plug features an angular groove for receiving bottom edges of the petals. shows an isometric view of the retainer ring PAPI showing the balls in dispersal and revealing a rod connecting the upper and lower plates and and the base plug . The rod can be a 20 piece of all thread shaft. The plates and can be secured by half inch hex nuts and accompanying flat washers near the ends of the rod .

Assembly of the retainer ring PAPI can be described in the following illustrations. shows an inverted isometric view of a pair of petals specifically distal and port combined together. The retainer ring joins the nose segments of the petals. Each petal includes an annular arc . Joining the arcs by assembly of the petals into the sabot housing enables access to the rod and nuts along with accompanying flat washers for assembly. An annular ledge forms an upper boundary to the payload portion .

In order for the PAPI to be used effectively in the fleet the interface with the Mk 45 Gun Mount s loading system should be considered. shows an elevation view of the PAPI with the payload portion and the ring . An axisymmetric outline provides an envelope of the common contact points within the Mk 45 Mod4 projectile auto loader system. An ogive slope line provides reference to an in service Mk 64 projectile body s interfaces with the projectile guides in the Mk 45 Mod4 autoloader system. A vertical line provides reference to the contact point of the upper projectile ram in the Mk 45 Mod4 autoloader system. A vertical line provides a reference to the contact point of a physical depression sensor in the Mk 45 Mod4 autoloader system. A vertical line provides reference to the contact point of the lower projectile frame in the Mk 45 Mod4 autoloader system.

The detail view in shows the base containing a pressure plate suspended from the base by lower helical springs . An upper helical spring separates the plate from the petal collar . Orifices in the bottom of the base enable propellant gasses to enter the PAPI. The pressure from the gasses elevate the plate and thereby engage forked tabs on the pushrod .

Upon muzzle exit the propelling gasses evacuate the pressure chamber at the rear of the projectile and the upper internal spring decompresses drawing the pressure plate back to its original position along with the latched pushrod . The downward motion of the pushrod withdraws it from a series of tabs within the forward portion of petals enabling the petals to separate under the residual forces of gun launch. The petals would then be discarded enabling the payload contained within to spread and disperse on target.

The delayed opening serves to produce a tight spread pattern for the internal payload . Exemplary embodiments facilitate fine tuning into the system. By adjusting the size of the holes enabling pressure into and out of the system or altering the size and spring stiffness of the springs and the time required for the projectile to open can be customized to the optimal opening time.

The modified mechanical pressure PAPI functions in essentially the same manner as the mechanical pressure PAPI shown in . However the rear springs have been replaced with a rigid support threaded interface has been added to improve component assembly and a mid bore rider has been added to increase the stability of the round as it travels down the barrel. The mid bore rider renders the projectile more stable by reducing lateral sidesway or balloting as the projectile traverses the barrel.

In summary the external structure for the general PAPI concept includes detachable envelopes referred to as petals and a base plug . The petals are restrained at the bottom of the projectile by the base plug which is surrounded by a gas sealing obturator and restrained at the top of the projectile by a frangible retainer ring or a mechanical retaining pin as the pushrod .

The PAPI embodiments can employ either the ring or the pushrod . Both PAPI designs share the same mission and are completely inert and without conventional fuzes. However the retaining ring PAPI actuates payload dispersion by creating fractures at areas of stress concentration in the retainer ring due to the resulting forces of gun launch. The mechanical pressure PAPI actuates payload dispersion by enabling gun propelling gases into a rear chamber and using this pressure increase to elevate the plate and engage the pushrod which is then disengaged from the sabot petal structure enabling payload dispersion.

Returning to the view upon launch from the gun the projectile exits the muzzle and becomes subject to various aerodynamic forces. In general the projectile will experience about 110 psi of pressure due to aerodynamic forces at the nose of the projectile and about 288 psi of pressure due to the spin of the PAPI. The pressure on the nose portion of the PAPI acts on the angled nose cone and the angular velocity pulls the petals and of the projectile away from the center of rotation. These forces separate the petals being held together by the ring .

Assembly of the PAPI includes the procedures described as follows. First as in view the petals connect together by the dowel pins with silicone between each petal for environmental sealing purposes. This petal assembly slides into a groove in the retainer ring and is secured in place with standard 4 40 screws. Hose clamps can be used at several locations along the payload portion to keep the petals together until attaching the base plug . The upper plate acts as a forward constraint for the payload and features the groove to fit an o ring to environmentally and pneumatically seal the PAPI from the nose portion .

Second as in view the plate with o ring slides inside the petal assembly until reaching the groove on the petals. The snap ring can then be inserted into the groove in the petals to keep the plate from falling out of the projectile. This snap ring also provides support for the petals to be torqued to the base plug .

Third as in view upon installing the upper plate the tungsten ball payload can be installed. The precise number of balls is determined by the overall weight of the projectile with the intent of keeping the PAPI to the standard 70 1 pounds mass. For the volume considered this configuration has room for just under 50 pounds mass worth of payload which can equate to about 2800 tungsten spheres or balls .

The rod is inserted before the payload is poured into the payload portion . This all thread feature enables use of nuts to torque and compress the payload against the lower plate and enables threading into the base plug . The lower plate is somewhat more robust than the upper plate to support the payload during setback acceleration upon launch. The lower plate also features an o ring groove for environmental and pneumatic sealing.

Fourth as in view the lower plate slides into the payload portion and contacts the payload . The nut e.g. locknut and lockwasher are threaded behind the lower plate to enable torque to be applied. The entire assembly continues a process of vibrating and torquing down the nuts until the payload is sufficiently compacted. This compaction restrains the balls from rattling around but also acts to inhibit the payload from pushing the petals radially outward by hydrostatic pressure setback forces upon firing. This hydrostatic pressure gradates from negligible at the upper plate to a maximum at the lower plate causing premature separation of the petals. By compressing the load these forces can be normalized and enabling the payload to act as a unitary item instead of several individual balls .

Under the pressures and temperatures experienced during shooting aluminum has been shown to melt and burn causing small particles of aluminum to be deposited on rifle grooves of the gun barrel. The proceeding shot rips this aluminum from these grooves. With the aluminum comes the chrome plating intended to protect the inside of the barrel. Upon removal of the chrome plating subsequent shots cause pitting in the rifling of the barrel. This pitting causes blow by reducing the efficiency and accuracy of future rounds. To avoid such deposits the base plug is composed of steel.

Fifth as in view the petals slide into the groove and the rod threads into the hole of the base plug . The two holes enable use of a spanner wrench to thread the base plug onto the rod . A bead of silicone will be applied to the groove in the base plate prior to assembly to provide an environmental seal. The base plug turns into the rod until the sides of the petals mate with the top surface of the inner flange .

Sixth as in view the obturator is prepared by heating in an oven to allow the nylon to expand as is commonly accomplished with nylon bands. After heating the obturator is pressed onto the base plug and permitted to cool and thereby shrink into position. This is a practice carried out on the M in addition to multiple other munitions with similar band designs. After installation of the obturator onto the base plug the PAPI is completed and ready for load and launch in the gun .

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
