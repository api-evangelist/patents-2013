This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 609 048 filed Mar. 9 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The subject matter described herein relates to electronic payment and non payment transactions. More particularly the subject matter described herein relates to systems methods and computer readable media for conducting an electronic transaction via a backend server system.

Payments loyalty transactions and coupon redemptions are typically conducted at point of sale POS environments using paper currency plastic cards and or manual entry of keys via traditional network connections that utilize dial up lines Internet connections and or wireless networks provided by merchants or merchant service providers. However there is a growing trend of conducting these types of transactions using a mobile device e.g. a smart phone . In order to allow consumers to make payments send loyalty information or redeem coupons offers from mobile devices at a merchant point of sale POS a merchant entity may be compelled to install a near field communications NFC reader and or a barcode reader. Specifically the merchant entity may integrate the NFC reader with point of sale system to be able to accept payment loyalty transactions coupons offers and other transactional data. However this solution not only requires a merchant to incur expensive equipment costs related to the installation of an NFC reader at each POS terminal location but the merchant may also have to take expensive disruptive and time consuming measures to enable their existing POS software to fully function with the NEC reader to wirelessly accept electronic payment loyalty coupons offers and the like. Although merchants want to accept transactions initiated from mobile devices the significant investment of time and money required to add an NEC reader is preventing a number of merchant entities from providing better service to mobile device using customers.

Accordingly in light of these disadvantages there exists a need for systems methods and computer readable media for conducting an electronic transaction via a backend server system.

According to one aspect the subject matter described herein relates to systems methods and computer readable media for conducting an electronic transaction via a backend server system. In one embodiment a method includes interfacing a mobile device with a touch point to wirelessly obtain a backend server system address and an identification code wherein the touch point is associated with an electronic transaction terminal device to be utilized by a user of the mobile device to conduct an electronic transaction and the identification code is associated with the electronic transaction terminal device or the touch point. The method also includes establishing communication between the mobile device and the backend server system using the backend server system address receiving at the backend server system from the mobile device the identification code and a mobile device identifier associated with the mobile device and determining at the backend server system whether one or more electronic certificates associated with the mobile device identifier are applicable for use in the electronic transaction. The method further includes using at the backend server system the identification code to provide at least one of the applicable electronic certificates to the electronic transaction terminal device and applying at the electronic transaction terminal device the at least one applicable electronic certificate to the electronic transaction.

The subject matter described herein may be implemented in hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. As such the terms function node or module as used herein refer to hardware which may also include software and or firmware components for implementing the feature being described.

Referring to electronic transaction terminal device may include a point of sale terminal device a point of service terminal device a point of interaction POI terminal device a banking terminal device an automatic teller machine ATM terminal device and the like. In some embodiments electronic transaction terminal device may be located at a store a taxi cab a vending machine a kiosk and the like. Notably electronic transaction terminal device may include a POS interface application and a POS application . In one embodiment each of POS interface application and POS application includes a special software module or application that is executed by a hardware processor included in electronic transaction terminal device . When executed POS interface application may communicate with customer mobile application e.g. mobile device application using a secured channel directly or indirectly via backend server system e.g. over an Internet protocol network . In one embodiment POS interface application may reside in a DOS Windows or Android Linux operating system computer that is configured to communicate with backend server system via an IP network a cellular wireless network or a leased dedicated line using web services XML or a proprietary application programming interface API .

In addition POS interface application may communicate with POS application using a driver e.g. UPOS oPOS or jPOS application software native mode or emulation mode to compel electronic transaction terminal device to communicate with backend server system to identify whether electronic certificates loyalty programs and the like should be applied to an electronic transaction being conducted see details below . In some embodiments mobile device may communicate with electronic transaction terminal device using WiFi cellular wireless communications e.g. 3G 4G long term evolution LTE etc. or other emerging wireless communications.

In one embodiment a customer e.g. mobile device user utilizes mobile device provisioned with a supported customer mobile application e.g. from a retailer from a service provider or from companies supporting cloud based payments like Google Paypal Mastercard etc. at a point of sale register to initiate a purchase transaction of one or more items. Although the following example describes a purchase and or payment transaction other electronic transactions may be conducted without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. For example the electronic transaction being conducted may include at least one of a loyalty transaction a coupon redemption transaction an offer redemption transaction a digital receipt pickup transaction an electronic coupon pickup transaction an electronic coupon pickup transaction a reward pickup transaction a one touch checkout transaction an order transaction and a non payment transaction. Other exemplary electronic transactions includes a combination of payment and non payment transaction an electronic certificate delivery transaction a printing advice transaction an access control transaction a boarding pass transaction and an electronic certificate redemption transaction.

In this example electronic transaction terminal device is not equipped with an NEC reader and is located proximate to touch point within a common area location . The mobile device user may interface or tap mobile device with an NFC smart tag of touch point in order to obtain via NEC an identification code identifying electronic transaction terminal device and an address e.g. a URL or IP address associated with backend server system . Mobile device may then be configured to use the address to wirelessly transmit the identification code and a mobile device identifier or a mobile subscriber identifier which identifies mobile device to backend server system . Specifically the NEC tap informs backend server system that a specific customer has interfaced mobile device with a touch point associated with a specific electronic transaction terminal device or point of sale location area . Backend server system may then utilize the identification code to establish communications with electronic transaction terminal device .

After mobile device has interfaced with touch point a sales clerk may use checkout cash register to register scan the items the customer is attempting to purchase. As an item is scanned POS application via POS interface application may communicate the item information to backend server system . In addition POS application may compel electronic transaction terminal device to identify if there are any applicable electronic certificates e.g. coupons offers promotions etc. available in backend system server e.g. in an online repository or in electronic certificate database which can be applied to the purchase transaction based on a mobile device identifier and the type products the mobile device user has presented for purchase.

Specifically electronic certificates may be stored on the backend in a cloud based manner. For example electronic certificate database may include a plurality of electronic certificates and or a plurality of electronic certificate identifiers. In some embodiments the electronic certificates and identifiers may be mapped to mobile device identifiers or some other identifier e.g. a loyalty program identifier number a membership identifier a customer identifier etc. . The terms tap NFC tap and interface can be used to mean the same actions. As used herein the terms tap and NFC tap in reference to NFC enabled devices and wireless transceivers such as device readers or NFC passive tags means to provide a close or near field interface between an NFC enabled device and a wireless transceiver.

In some embodiments mobile device may be configured to only provide customer identification information e.g. a mobile device identifier to backend server system since payment loyalty coupons offers and other data may be stored in the cloud corresponding to the identification information. Similarly the electronic certificates and identifiers may also be mapped to identifiers that are associated with goods or services that may be scanned registered at a point of sale e.g. cash register . Thus when a customer has an item for purchased scanned at the point of sale electronic transaction terminal device may provide an associated product identifier to backend server system . Backend server system may then query database to determine if any electronic certificates correspond to the product identifier and or an identifier corresponding to the customer e.g. a loyalty membership identifier or a mobile device identifier .

In some embodiments POS application may also compel electronic transaction terminal device to identify if there is a loyalty program that a merchant e.g. a merchant associated with electronic transaction terminal device or a manufacturer of a product being purchased is conducting and or a loyalty program where the customer is currently a registered member. If either is true backend server system may provide the applicable electronic certificates and or loyalty program information to POS interface application . Electronic transaction terminal device may subsequently apply the received electronic certificates and or loyalty program information to the purchase transaction.

In some embodiments POS application may send the resulting payment amount of the purchase transaction to mobile device for display on the customer s mobile device screen. POS application may also subsequently request the customer to select a payment option. If the payment amount exceeds a certain value e.g. a predefined threshold value customer mobile application may prompt the mobile device user to enter a PIN or password. In some embodiments consumer payment information is sent to electronic transaction terminal device based on the payment type selected by the mobile device user. The payment information may be open loop or closed loop payment information e.g. track 1 and 2 data or EMV data or a payment card identifier that is associated with a cloud based payment card that is stored in backend server system .

Once payment is received and accepted POS application may send a payment confirmation and transaction completion message to mobile device e.g. via SMS email a wireless signal and the like . POS application may also be configured to optionally send a digital receipt to mobile device in a similar manner. In one embodiment mobile device may be configured to provide an email address to backend server system upon interfacing with touch point located at or near the electronic transaction terminal device . Backend server system may then communicate the email address to the electronic transaction terminal device being used by the mobile device user conducting the electronic purchase transaction. Upon completion of the purchase transaction electronic transaction terminal device may utilize the email address associated with the mobile device user to deliver a digital receipt to the mobile device user.

In an alternate embodiment a phone number or a digital receipt repository address identifier associated with the mobile device user may be provided to electronic transaction terminal device in lieu of an email address. Similarly an electronic business card or membership card containing at least one of an email address mobile phone number and digital receipt repository address may be provided. In addition instead of providing the email address to backend server system communicating with electronic transaction terminal device the email address may be provided directly to a mobile or stationary electronic transaction terminal device .

In an alternate embodiment POS application may optionally send electronic certificates e.g. electronic coupons and or offers to the customer while sending a copy of the electronic certificates to database or an online repository associated with the customer. POS application may also optionally send an updated loyalty points message and or a thank you message e.g. via SMS email a wireless signal etc. to the mobile device user at the conclusion of the transaction.

In an alternate embodiment the present subject matter may be utilized in cooperation with an NFC reader. In such a scenario customer mobile application on mobile device may send payment information optional loyalty card number information electronic coupons offers data and ordering information e.g. if applicable in a pre order fast food environment to electronic transaction terminal device . Specifically POS application at electronic transaction terminal device may receive this information from NFC enabled mobile device through an NFC reader not shown attached to electronic transaction terminal device . POS application may then complete the purchase transaction and confirm the transaction by sending a message to customer mobile application . In one embodiment POS application may send a digital receipt and electronic certificates e.g. electronic coupons offers loyalty points back to customer mobile application .

In some embodiments POS application may query backend server system to determine if there is any information previously provided by the customer via mobile device . If true then payment loyalty and or coupons offers will be requested by backend server system from a third party service provider not shown that is responsible for maintaining payment loyalty and coupons offers associated with mobile device or the mobile device user. The electronic certificate information will then be forwarded to electronic transaction terminal device to reconcile the customer s shopping basket based on coupons offers in addition to applying loyalty information and accepting payments. To provide additional security to the payment transaction a customer may be asked to enter a PIN on mobile device which is securely transferred to backend server system to assure that NEC enabled mobile device is being used by the rightful owner.

In one embodiment mobile device may conduct a transaction utilizing one or more electronic certificates or electronic certificate identifiers that are stored locally. In such a scenario mobile device may be interfaced with touch point which is associated and co located in area with electronic transaction terminal device . Upon interfacing mobile device may obtain a touch point identification code or an identifier associated with electronic transaction terminal device from tag on touch point . Upon receiving the identification code customer mobile application on mobile device may be selected or triggered to provide e.g. pushes the touch point identification code a mobile device identifier and an electronic certificate identifier e.g. a coupon code to backend server system . Backend server system may query a database that maps touch point identification codes to electronic transaction terminal devices to determine the location of electronic transaction terminal device . Backend server system subsequently provides the electronic certificate or electronic certificate identifier to POS interface application over IP or a wireless network. POS interface application provides the electronic certificate to POS application which applies the electronic certificate e.g. a coupon code to the purchase transaction adjusts the purchase amount and prompts the mobile device user e.g. via mobile device for payment. A customer may provide payment by swiping tapping or inserting a payment card and or mobile device at electronic transaction terminal device . Thus a coupon redemption based transaction may be completed without requiring an NEC reader. A customer can also complete payment and loyalty transactions using the similar approach along with or without a coupon or offer redemption.

In one embodiment instead of interfacing with a touch point mobile device may utilize WiFi Bluetooth GPS cellular triangulation WiFi triangulation or some other vicinity determining wireless technology of mobile device to link its physical presence near a service point e.g. electronic transaction terminal device or the point of sale location . For example a mobile device may enter a specific zone or range designated by a vicinity determining device e.g. a mobile device detection server that is located in area GPS satellites cellular towers etc. . The vicinity determining device detects the proximate mobile device and links the mobile device s presence to the service point e.g. a nearby electronic transaction terminal device . If this occurs the vicinity determining device may read the mobile subscriber identifier from mobile device and provide the information to backend server system . Alternatively mobile device may wirelessly receive from the vicinity determining device an identifier associated with the point of sale location device e.g. electronic transaction terminal device which is provided to backend server system by mobile device . After this detection process is conducted a transaction may be conducted in the same manner described above.

In step a backend server system address and an identification code are obtained. In one embodiment upon establishing an NFC communications link with the smart tag the mobile device may wirelessly obtain a backend server system address and an identification code from the smart tag. In one embodiment the identification code may identify either the touch point or the related electronic transaction terminal device.

In step a communications link is established between the mobile device and the backend server system. In one embodiment the mobile device utilizes the backend server system address obtained from the touch point to establish a channel of communication with the backend server system.

In step an identification code and mobile device identifier is received. In one embodiment the backend server system receives an identification code and a mobile device identifier from the mobile device via the established communications link.

In step the identification code is used to provide an electronic certificate to a terminal device. In one embodiment the backend server system may utilize the identification code to establish communication with the corresponding electronic transaction terminal device as well as to query a database to locate at least one electronic certificate which may be applicable to an electronic transaction being conducted with the mobile device. For example the backend service system may receive a product identifier of a product being purchased from the electronic transaction terminal device. The backend server system may then use the product identifier and or the mobile device identifier to query the electronic certificate database for an applicable electronic certificate or electronic certificate identifier e.g. an electronic certificate that is associated with the product identifier and or the mobile device identifier . After obtaining an appropriate electronic certificate the backend server system may provide the electronic certificate to the identified electronic transaction terminal device that is associated with the identification code.

In step the electronic certificate is applied to the electronic transaction. In one embodiment the electronic certificate may be applied to the purchase transaction being conducted at the point of sale e.g. at a cash register .
