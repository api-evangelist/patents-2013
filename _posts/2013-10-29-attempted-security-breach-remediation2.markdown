Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to electronic device security and more particularly to systems methods apparatuses and computer program products for providing remedial actions in response to attempted security breaches.

Various authentication schemes are used to restrict access to electronic devices and ensure that only authorized users may gain access to sensitive resources. Any authentication scheme however may be susceptible to being breached. For example common authentication schemes such as password or PIN challenges may be defeated by simple brute force attacks i.e. attempting various passwords or PINs until one works.

Regardless of the authorization scheme being used a need exists for detecting attempted security breaches and for responding with appropriate remediation measures.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory only and should not be considered to restrict the disclosure s scope as described and claimed. Further features and or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example embodiments of the disclosure may be directed to various feature combinations and sub combinations described in the detailed description.

The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all embodiments of the inventions are shown. Wherever possible the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar elements. While embodiments of the disclosure may be described modifications adaptations and other implementations are possible. For example substitutions additions subtractions and or modifications may be made to the elements illustrated in the drawings as indicated in some cases via dashed lines and the methods described herein may be modified by substituting reordering or adding stages to the disclosed methods. Indeed the present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Accordingly the following detailed description does not limit the disclosure. Instead the proper scope of the disclosure is defined by the appended claims.

As used herein the terms data content information and similar terms may be used interchangeably to refer to data capable of being transmitted received processed and or stored in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Thus use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.

Additionally as the term will be used herein circuitry may refer to hardware only circuit implementations e.g. implementations in analog circuitry and or digital circuitry combinations of circuits and computer program product s including software and or firmware instructions stored on one or more i.e. at least one computer readable memories that work together to cause an apparatus to perform one or more functions described herein and circuits such as for example one or more microprocessors or portions of one or more microprocessors that require software or firmware for operation even if the software or firmware is not physically present. This definition of circuitry is applicable to all uses of this term including in any claims. As another example the term circuitry also includes implementations comprising one or more processors and or portion s thereof and accompanying software and or firmware. As another example the term circuitry also includes for example an integrated circuit or applications processor integrated circuit for a portable communication device or a similar integrated circuit in a server a network device and or other computing device.

As defined herein a computer readable storage medium refers to a non transitory physical storage medium e.g. volatile or non volatile memory device and can be differentiated from a computer readable transmission medium which refers to an electromagnetic signal. Furthermore at least one and one or more both as used herein refer to any non zero quantity and will be used interchangeably herein.

The present application is generally directed to electronic device security and more particularly to systems methods apparatuses and computer program products for providing remedial actions in response to attempted security breaches. As used herein an attempted security breach refers to any attempt whether successful or not to gain unauthorized access to an electronic device e.g. access to data resources functionality and or the like that are accessible via the electronic device and or access to the electronic device itself such as by an unauthorized user.

Example embodiments of such attempted security breach remediation systems methods apparatuses and computer program products may be configured to cause various remedial actions to be performed in response to determining that a suspected attempted security breach has occurred. For example embodiments may be configured to determine that a suspected attempted security breach has occurred and in response cause a recording to be captured. This recording may for example comprise a photo an audio recording a recording comprising biometric information and or another type of recording. Example embodiments may further cause at least a portion of the recording to be compared against a database. Thus for example some example embodiments might detect that an attempted security breach has occurred because a user has entered a suspicious number of incorrect passwords in a row and having determined that a suspected security breach has occurred might cause a photo to be captured of the user. Example embodiments might further cause this photo to be compared against a database for example of employees or criminals. Based on this comparison an appropriate remedial action may be determined and performed.

For example comparing the photo against the database may reveal that an authorized user was attempting to access the device and has merely forgotten their password. The user may thus be presented with an alternative authorization option and or an option to reset their password. In another instance comparing the photo against the database may reveal that a known criminal or an unauthorized user is responsible for the failed authorization attempts. Accordingly an example embodiment may cause the police or a system administrator to be contacted cause the device to be wiped cause the device to be locked cause the device to engage one or more location services and or cause various other actions to be performed. Many other example embodiments are possible some of which will be described below.

According to another aspect of the present application systems methods apparatuses and computer program products for providing advanced authentication techniques are described. Example embodiments of such advanced authentication techniques may for example combine biometric signatures and sequence based passcodes or the like into composite authentication credentials. For example some embodiments may receive biometric information such as fingerprint data or the like in a particular sequence or order thereby allowing a user whose biometric information has been compromised e.g. copied spoofed or the like to still maintain a degree of control over their authentication credentials. As a specific example an authentication technique involving scanning fingerprints in a particular order e.g. ring ring index thumb may be provided such that the order may be changed at the election of the user. Similar techniques may be provided for use with other biometric signatures such as iris scanning e.g. by blinking and or winking in a particular pattern . Additional layers of authentication may also be added to these example embodiments such as by implementing fingerprint scanning into a PIN entry device such that the PIN itself the sequence of fingers used to enter the PIN and the fingerprints themselves may together form a robust composite authentication credential.

Having thus provided an overview of various features and or functionality that may be provided according to some example embodiments attention will now be turned to the Figures so that certain example embodiments may be described in more detail.

The user device s may comprise any electronic device configured to communicate over one or more networks such as the network depicted in . For example the user device s may comprise one or more electronic devices such as a mobile telephone smartphone tablet computer PDA pager desktop or laptop computer a set top box a music player a game console or any of numerous other fixed or portable communication devices computation devices content generation devices content consumption devices or combinations thereof.

The resource server may for example comprise any type of network accessible electronic device or system that includes storage such as the depicted resource store . The resource server may according to one example embodiment comprise a public server that may be accessible to anyone who connects to it over a network such as the network . According to another example embodiment the resource server may be a private server accessible only over a private network such as the network and or may be located behind a firewall. According to another example embodiment the resource server may additionally or alternatively require user registration and or may require use of an authorized user device to access it. The resource server may store any type of data such as one or more databases some of which will be described in further detail below.

The compliance server may be any type of network accessible electronic device or system that includes storage such as the depicted compliance rule store and may be configured to communicate with the user device s and or the resource server over one or more networks such as the network depicted in to provide device content and or application management capabilities. For example the compliance server may comprise cloud based solutions server computers and or any other system configured to provide device content and or application management capability. The compliance server may according to some example embodiments further be configured to direct the resource server to transmit data e.g. to one or more user devices and or to direct the one or more user device s to transmit data e.g. to the compliance server and or resource server .

The compliance server may comprise a management application and a compliance rule store storing one or more compliance rules e.g. compliance policies that may be applicable to the user device s . While the management application is shown as within the compliance server the management application may additionally or alternately be within the user device s and or remotely located on the resource server and may be remotely updated such as periodically via compliance server according to any number of suitable over the air OTA updating methods.

Attempts by the user device s to perform certain functionality such as viewing modifying transmitting and or receiving various content may require the user device to be in compliance with one or more of the compliance rules. Depending on the sensitivity and or nature of a given functionality different compliance rules may be necessary to ensure that the functionality is adequately restricted. Some functionality may only require ensuring e.g. via one or more authentication procedures that the proper user is requesting the functionality. Other functionality may require compliance with more stringent authorization rules such as determining whether the functionality is restricted during certain time windows or geographic areas. Accordingly the user device s and or the compliance server may be operative to determine whether the user of the user device is authorized to perform requested functionality at the time the user requests to perform such functionality.

Compliance server may for example use the compliance rules to impose hardware restrictions regarding the use of specific devices and or specific device features such as for instance cameras Bluetooth IRDA tethering external storage a mobile access point and or other hardware restrictions. The compliance rules may additionally or alternatively impose software restrictions such as the use of specific wireless device operating systems or applications internet browser restrictions screen capture functionality and or other software restrictions. Mobile device management restrictions may additionally or alternatively be included in the compliance rules and may comprise encryption requirements firmware versions remote lock and wipe functionalities logging and reporting features GPS tracking and or other mobile device management features.

The compliance server may determine whether one or more device characteristics of a requesting device e.g. the user device s satisfy one or more of the restrictions enumerated in the compliance rules. For example the compliance server may determine that a requesting device that has a camera BLUETOOTH capability and is executing a specified version of an operating system is compliant with the compliance rules. As another example the compliance server may determine that a requesting device that is associated with an external storage unit and has screen capture functionality enabled is not compliant with the compliance rules.

In some embodiments an agent application executed on the user device s may make the compliance determination based on a device profile e.g. the device profile depicted in credentials and or user preferences. For instance the agent application may monitor calls by applications such as the web browser email client secure application and or any other application on the user device to an operating system e.g. the operating system depicted in of the user device to determine whether the user device seeks to perform functionality associated with one and or more of the compliance rules described above. Additionally the agent application executed on the user device s may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the agent application may instruct the operating system on the user device s to prevent the device from performing various functionality in response to a determination that a compliance rule e.g. one or more of the compliance rules stored in the data store depicted in specifies that such functionality is not authorized.

In some embodiments the agent application executed on the user device s may rely on the compliance server to determine whether a given functionality of the device is authorized according to the compliance rules. For instance the agent application may transmit information such as a device profile access credentials authentication information information regarding one or more authentication attempts and or information regarding one or more individuals to the compliance server so that compliance server may determine whether the user device seeks to perform functionality that may violate a given compliance rule. Additionally the compliance server may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests.

In some embodiments the compliance rules may comprise device settings and or executable instructions that define which functionality the operating system of the user device s is authorized to perform. Furthermore the compliance rules may comprise a list of functions such as those provided by APIs associated with the operating system and or a platform library such as the platform library depicted in that may be treated as protected functions. Viewing modifying receiving and or transmitting content may for example comprise or otherwise be associated with one or more of these functions. Calls to these functions such as calls to retrieve login credentials or attempts to interact with e.g. view modify transmit or receive content may result in checks by the user device e.g. via the agent application and or the compliance server e.g. via the management application for compliance with the compliance rules.

In some embodiments the agent application may perform a set of ordered operations to accomplish a requested function. These operation sets may be defined on e.g. stored in a memory of the user device s and or the compliance server and may comprise one or more operations to determine whether the user device is in compliance with compliance rules from the compliance rule store . The agent application may control at least one respective computing resource of the user device s . The operations may include configuring at least one respective computing resource of the user device s such as restricting access to at least one resource managed by the agent application such as one or more of the resources depicted in .

For purposes of convenience the resource server and compliance server are each referred to herein in the singular although it will be understood that a plurality of one or both servers may be employed in the arrangements as described herein. For example in some embodiments multiple compliance servers and or resource servers may operate on the same server computer. The components executed on the compliance server and or resource server may for example comprise various applications services processes systems engines or functionality not disclosed in detail herein.

As shown in the user device s compliance server and or resource server may communicate with one another directly and or via the network . The user device s compliance server and or resource server may connect to the network via wired or wireless means such as via one or more intermediate networks. For example the user device s compliance server and or resource server may connect with the network via wired means such as Ethernet USB Universal Serial Bus or the like or via wireless means such as for example WI FI BLUETOOTH or the like or by connecting with a wireless cellular network such as a Long Term Evolution LTE network an LTE Advanced LTE A network a Global Systems for Mobile communications GSM network a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA network e.g. a Wideband CDMA WCDMA network a CDMA2000 network or the like a General Packet Radio Service GPRS network or other type of network.

Basic functionality of the user device may be provided by an operating system contained in the at least one memory and executed via the at least one processor . One or more programmed software applications may be executed by utilizing the computing resources in user device . For example applications stored in the memory may be executed by the processor under the auspices of operating system . For example processor may be configured to execute applications such as web browsing applications email applications instant messaging applications applications configured to view and or manipulate content and or other applications capable of receiving and or providing data.

Data provided as input to and or generated as output from the application s may be stored in the memory and read by the processor from the memory as needed during the course of application program execution. Input data may be data stored in the memory by a secondary application or other source either internal or external to user device or provided during installation of the application.

The user device may include one or more communication ports such as the communication ports A C depicted in . It will be understood that although three communication ports are depicted in the example user device depicted in any number of such ports may be present according to other example configurations of a user device . Such communication ports A C may allow the user device to communicate with other devices such as other user devices the compliance server and or the resource server and may comprise components such as a wireless network connectivity interface an Ethernet network adapter and or a modem. For example the wireless network connectivity interface may comprise one and or more of a wireless radio transceiver PCI Peripheral Component Interconnect card USB Universal Serial Bus interface PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association card SDIO Secure Digital Input Output card NewCard Cardbus a modem and or the like.

The output interface may comprise one or more devices configured to provide information and or stimuli to a user such as one or more display devices speakers force vibration and or haptic feedback generating devices implanted and or physiologically integrated output devices heads up display devices and or the like. It will be understood that although the input and output interfaces are depicted as distinct components in they may according to example embodiments be embodied by one or more components comprising both input and output functionality. For example the input and output interface may comprise a touchscreen device e.g. a display device configured to both display information and receive user input such as via a touch detection interface.

The at least one memory may also comprise a platform library . The platform library may comprise one or more collections of functionality e.g. utilities useful to multiple applications such as may be provided by an application programming interface API to a software development kit SDK . These utilities may be accessed by applications as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities thus allowing for memory consumption savings and a consistent user experience. The platform library may also provide functionality associated with app wrapping defined herein as adding additional functionality referred herein as wrapper provided functionality to applications without affecting or in some cases only minimally affecting the application s preexisting or stock functionality. For example an existing game application may be wrapped to provide support for compliance rules such as those that prohibit the application from executing during work hours the game s functionality would be unaffected during non work hours. Similarly an existing application may be wrapped to require user authentication before the application may be accessed. As will be discussed below some example embodiments may provide security breach remediation functionality to applications via wrapping. The platform library is described in greater detail below with respect to .

Furthermore embodiments of this disclosure may be practiced in conjunction with a graphics library other operating systems or any other application program and is not limited to any particular application or system. The devices described with respect to the Figures may have additional features or functionality. For example user device may also include additional data storage devices removable and or non removable such as for example magnetic disks optical disks or tape not shown .

The user device may store in the memory e.g. in a data store a device profile and user data . The device profile may for example comprise information such as an indication of a current position of user device and or indications of various hardware software and or security attributes pertaining to the user device . For instance the device profile may represent hardware specifications of the user device version and or configuration information of various software program and or hardware components installed on user device data transmission protocols enabled on user device version and usage information of the various resources stored on user device and or any other attributes associated with the state of user device . The device profile may additionally or alternatively comprise operational status information such as information regarding any errors or faults detected in the user device information regarding device temperature information regarding resource levels such as battery levels free storage space and or signal strengths and or the like. The device profile may additionally or alternatively comprise data indicating a date of last virus scan of the user device a date of last access of the user device by an IT representative a date of last service of the user device by an IT representative and or any other data indicating maintenance and or usage of the user device . The device profile may additionally or alternatively comprise indications of past behavior of associated users such as resources accessed charges for resource accesses and or inventory accessed from such resources.

The user data may comprise information regarding one or more users of the user device . For example the user data may comprise one or more user preferences e.g. one or more parameters that may affect the experience of the user. Additionally or alternatively the user data may include indications of a device user s age gender bodily traits preferred resource types preferred venue resources and or any other type of information relating to a user or combinations of such information. Additionally or alternatively the user data may include indications of one or more access levels roles policy groups or the like of a device user e.g. for use in providing varying levels of functionality and or access e.g. to protected content for different users of a given user device.

The user device may also store at least one resource in the data store . The resources may for example include any data or content such as databases applications audio video content electronic records applications and or application files and or the like. More specifically resources may include at least one of the following file types data files audio files video files three dimensional image files raster image files vector image files page layout files text files word processor files spreadsheet files presentation files graphic files audio files photographic files video files database files executable files CAD files web files plug in files font files system files settings files encoded files compressed files disk image files developer files backup files and or any other files.

Wrapped application may comprise a binary executable file whose functionality has been modified by the addition of an application wrapper . The application wrapper may for example comprise a program or application that encapsulates the application serving as an intermediary between the application and the operating system and or platform library . In this way the application wrapper may modify e.g. add to restrict enhance etc. any of the stock functionality provided by the application . For example if application is configured to be accessible without requesting user authentication wrapper may add to the functionality of the application by requiring authentication before a user can access the application . Similarly if application is configured to communicate over an unsecured e.g. unencrypted connection with a given public server the wrapper might modify this functionality by forcing the communication to take place over a secured connection or even by preventing the communication altogether. The modifications provided by the wrapper may for example comprise precompiled functions that may call out to an API such as the API depicted in . Thus app wrapping may allow additional wrapper provided functionality to be added to an existing application such as the application depicted in . In some embodiments app wrapping may be accomplished dynamically upon installation and or execution of an application without requiring recompilation of the application s source code. App wrapping may thus comprise a preferred and or more convenient means of modifying an application and may according to some embodiments even be used in instances in which source code for the application is unavailable.

In some embodiments compliance rules such as those provided by the compliance server may control which functions of the API are enabled and or used in the application and wrapped application . For example users in a sales group may be permitted by the compliance server to download an enterprise s expense submitting application without modification while users in an accounting group may receive a modified version of the same application. The modified version may rely on functionality provided by the platform library to enhance the application s security such as by adding a call to an encryption function for communications from the application that are intended for transmission over the network .

Various functions may be provided by the platform library including authentication authorization and determination functions. Device management functions may comprise for example functions operative to determine whether user device has been compromised e.g. rooted jailbroken or the like and or to identify a location of the device via evoking and or accessing one or more location services of the device such as a GPS service and or a signal e.g. cellular or WIFI triangulation based service. Application management functions may comprise for example functions operative to encrypt data and or communications used by application and wrapped application to distribute configuration information to provide authorization and or credentials and or to provide logging and reporting functionality. Content management functions may comprise for example functions to update shared content data used by application and wrapped application and or to provide branding functionality to alter the appearance of application and wrapped application .

Other management functionality may comprise enforcing compliance rules and or restrictions distributed by compliance server which may be accomplished at the device application and or content level. Such compliance rules may comprise time date and or location based restrictions on accessing user device application wrapped application local assets and or remote assets .

Referring now to various operations of some example embodiments of the present invention are depicted. As discussed below the operations of may be performed by one or more apparatuses such as the apparatus depicted in embodied by or otherwise associated with one or more of the user device s compliance server and or resource server depicted in so as to provide attempted security breach remediation capabilities.

In this regard and turning first to the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the user device may according to some example embodiments include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for receiving information regarding one or more compliance rules. See operation . The compliance rules may as will be discussed in more detail below include various rules that may be used in the determination of whether a suspected attempted security breach has occurred and how to respond in an instance in which one has occurred. For example the compliance rules may specify when the determination should be made e.g. when a user attempts to unlock the user device the user attempts to access one or more particular applications e.g. one or more wrapped applications and or when the user attempts to access one or more resources of the user device . According to another example embodiment the compliance rules may specify how the determination is made e.g. by specifying a threshold number of failed authentication attempts and or other parameters used to determine whether an authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach.

According to some example embodiments the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface the user interface and or the like for receiving information regarding at least one authentication attempt. See operation . The information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may for example comprise authentication credentials e.g. information used to authenticate a user. For example the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may comprise information provided by a user e.g. via the user interface such as a username password PIN unlock pattern or the like. According to another example embodiment the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may comprise authentication credentials provided by a device such as a security fob or token a biometric sensor such as a fingerprint scanner iris scanner BCI or other sensor configured to capture any type of biometric information or any other device that may be used in authenticating a user. According to another example embodiment the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may additionally or alternatively comprise one or more indicia of a user s e.g. the user attempting to authenticate themselves state of mind such as bodily indicia of their level of composure nervousness or the like. For example the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may comprise information regarding a user s pupil dilation perspiration e.g. skin conductance pulse breathing rate brain activity e.g. brain wave profile or any other bodily indicia of a user s state of mind. Such bodily indicia may for example be captured via one or more sensing devices communicatively connected to the apparatus and according to some embodiments housed in the user device . According to yet another example embodiment the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may additionally or alternatively comprise an indication of whether a given authentication attempt was successful or not such as a signal from an external device configured to authenticate a user such as the compliance server or the like. According to some example embodiments the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt may comprise contextual information such as time and or location data e.g. a time and or location at which the authentication attempt occurred.

According to some example embodiments the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for determining whether the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach. See operation . The determination may for example be made based at least in part on the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt. For instance one example embodiment may determine whether a threshold number of failed login attempts has been exceeded such as be determining based on the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt whether the authentication attempt is a failed authentication attempt incrementing a counter in an instance in which it is and comparing this counter against the threshold. The apparatus may thus determine that the authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach if the threshold is exceeded.

According to some example embodiments the apparatus may determine a degree of difference and or similarity between received authentication credentials and expected e.g. correct authentication credentials and additionally or alternatively base the determination of whether the authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach based at least in part on the degree of difference or similarity such as by comparing the degree of difference or similarity to a threshold. For example if a password is being used as the authentication credentials then a high degree of similarity between the received and expected credentials may indicate a typo as opposed to an attempted security breach while a high degree of difference may indicate a user is attempting a security breach e.g. by guessing passwords.

According to further example embodiments the apparatus may additionally or alternatively determine whether the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach based at least in part one or more indicia of a user s state of mind such as any or all of the bodily indicia mentioned above. For example some embodiments may determine one or more values of the bodily indicia and compare the one or more values against one or more thresholds. Thus the apparatus of some example embodiments may determine that a suspected attempted security breach has occurred based on one or more indicia that a user is nervous as they attempt to authenticate themselves such as based on the person having high skin conductivity e.g. they are sweating an elevated pulse and or a brain wave profile indicative of nervousness.

According to other example embodiments the apparatus may additionally or alternatively determine whether the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach based at least in part on contextual information such as a time or location associated with the authentication attempt. For example a failed authentication attempt made at a suspicious hour e.g. within or outside of one or more designated time periods and or in a suspicious location e.g. within or outside of one or more geofenced areas . According to still other example embodiments the apparatus may determine whether the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach by receiving an indication from another device in communication therewith such as from the compliance server that the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach.

It will be understood that as discussed above the information regarding the one or more compliance rules may specify at least in part how the apparatus determines whether a suspected attempted security breach has occurred. Thus for example any of the thresholds conditions or the like discussed in the context of the foregoing example embodiments may be provided as part of or determined based on the information regarding the one or more compliance rules received in operation . For instance the information regarding the one or more compliance rules may provide the threshold number of failed authentication attempts the threshold degrees of similarity and or difference between the received and expected authentication credentials the designated time periods and or geofenced areas and or any other thresholds conditions or the like which may be useful in determining in combination with the information regarding the at least one authentication attempt a whether the at least one authentication attempt is an attempted security breach. It will be further understood that the apparatus may according to some example embodiments be configured to determine a likelihood e.g. a probability that a given authentication attempt comprises an attempted security breach and may for example compare this against a threshold probability to determine whether the authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach. According to some example embodiments such a threshold probability may like the other thresholds discussed above be received as part of or determined based at least in part on the information regarding the one or more compliance rules.

According to some example embodiments the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for causing at least one recording to be captured. See operation . According to some example embodiments the recording may be caused to be captured in an instance in which the apparatus has determined that a suspected attempted security breach has occurred. The apparatus may for example cause at least one recording to be captured by one or more recording and or sensing devices in communication with the apparatus by generating and transmitting a signal to such devices the signal comprising one or more instructions e.g. to begin a capture procedure and or parameters e.g. for performing the capture procedure. The recording and or sensing devices may for example comprise one or more cameras e.g. still video infrared and or 3D such as time of flight TOF cameras and or any other types of cameras and or microphones. The recording and or sensing devices may additionally or alternatively comprise one or more biometric sensors such as fingerprint scanners iris scanners and or any other type of recording and or sensing device configured to capture biometric data. Thus the recording may according to some embodiments comprise one or more of an image a video a sound recording and or various biometric data. The apparatus may further include means such as those listed above for receiving the recording from the one or more recording and or sensing devices in communication therewith.

According to some example embodiments the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the user device may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for causing at least a portion of the at least one recording to be compared against at least one database. See operation . According to some embodiments causing the portion of the at least one recording to be compared against the at least one database may comprise causing the portion of the at least one recording to be transmitted to an external device such as the compliance server or resource server that stores or is in communication with a device that stores the at least one database. According to some other example embodiments the at least one database may be stored locally such as in the memory of the apparatus .

Regardless of where the database resides it may according to some example embodiments include information regarding one or more persons. For example the at least one database may comprise one or more employee databases e.g. databases including information regarding one or more current and or former employees and or criminal databases e.g. databases including information regarding one or more convicted and or accused criminals . Such databases may for example associate various types of personal information such as names contact information or the like to various types of identifying information. The identifying information may for example comprise information that may be used to identify a person in the one or more databases based at least in part on the recording captured during operation . For example the identifying information for any given person in the one or more databases may comprise one or more photos of the person one or more recordings of the person s voice information regarding one or more of the person s fingerprints image data regarding one or more of the person s irises or any other types of identifying information capable of being recorded via or derived from a recording captured via one or more recording and or sensing devices. Such databases may additionally or alternatively associate security information to the various types of identifying information. For example an entry for a given person in the database may include information identifying that person as trusted authorized untrusted unauthorized or the like. The security information may further be associated with one or more particular user devices services locations etc. such that a person may be trusted authorized untrusted unauthorized or the like with respect to one or more devices services and or the like. Such security information may for example be derived from or form the basis of one or more compliance rules policy groups and or the like. Some example embodiments may employ various secure and or privacy preserving mechanisms e.g. to avoid transmitting and or storing raw identifying information. For example the identifying information may be stored in an encrypted and or hashed form in the at least one database and the apparatus may include means such as those mentioned above for determining a hashed and or encrypted version of the portion of the recording such that hashed and or encrypted versions of the portion of the recording may be compared. It will be understood that any or all of the information described above may be spread across a plurality of databases including databases that might reside in different physical locations.

It will be understood that according to some example embodiments the apparatus may perform operation prior to operation . That is some example embodiments may cause the at least one recording to be captured regardless of whether it is determined that the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach. Thus some example embodiments may instead selectively perform operation causing at least a portion of the at least one recording to be compared against at least one database in an instance in which it is determined that the at least one authentication attempt comprises a suspected attempted security breach.

Such information may for example be returned in response to the one or more queries mentioned above. The information may according to some example embodiments include one or more identifiers of one or more matching persons included in the database. According to some other example embodiments the result may additionally or alternatively comprise security information for one or more matching persons such as any of the security information discussed above.

It will be understood that according to some example embodiments multiple databases may be queried. For example multiple databases may be queried at substantially the same time so as to receive multiple results. According to some embodiments multiple databases may additionally or alternatively be queried in a sequence such as by using a result of an initial query to a database being used as the basis of a subsequent query to another or in some cases the same database. That is some example embodiments may receive a first result from a first database generate a query based on that result submit the query to a second database and receive an additional result from the second database. As a more specific example a first database may be queried using at least a portion of the at least one recording and an identity of a person may be returned as a result. This identity may then be used as the basis of an additional query of a second database such as a criminal database or an employee database which may return a result such as in the case of the criminal database information regarding the person s criminal background or in the case of an employee database whether the person is authorized to access the device. This process of chaining results and queries may be repeated any number of times and with any number of databases.

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server and or resource server may include means such as the at least one processor the at least one memory the communication interface and or the like for determining one or more remedial actions. See operation . The determination may for example be made based at least in part on the one or more results received in operation . Remedial actions may for example include actions such as contacting one or more persons such as police an owner of the user device an administrator and or any other person restricting access to at least a portion of the data and or resources of the user device such as by locking the user device and or encrypting or wiping at least a portion of the memory of the user device causing one or more location services of the user device to be engaged such as by turning on one or more GPS receivers of the device transmitting a location of the device such as to the compliance server and or one or more persons such as any of the previously listed persons presenting one or more notifications such as via an output interface of the user device triggering one or more alarms preventing further authentication attempts disabling one or more functions features and or services of the user device activating at least one activity recording service of the user device such as an activity logging service and or any other type of action that may tend to render the device less usable assist in recovery of the user device and or assist in apprehending a person responsible for the suspected attempted security breach. Other remedial actions may provide authentication assistance such as by prompting the user for alternative authentication credentials offering to change or reset existing authentication credentials contacting technical support and or any other type of action that may tend to assist the user in successfully authenticating.

The determination of one or more remedial actions may further be based at least in part on one or more remedial action rules that associate one or more results with one or more remedial actions. For example a rule may provide that in an instance in which a received result indicates a person as being unauthorized e.g. not authorized to access the user device one or more remedial actions are to be performed that may tend to render the device less usable assist in recovery of the user device and or assist in apprehending a person responsible for the suspected attempted security breach. The same or another rule may according to another example provide that in an instance in which a received result indicates a person as being authorized e.g. authorized to access the user device one or more remedial actions are to be performed that may tend to provide authentication assistance. As an additional more specific example a remedial action rule may provide that in an instance in which a received result indicates a criminal background e.g. in an instance in which a person responsible for the suspected attempted security breach the person identified during operations and has a criminal background according to a criminal database the user device should be locked an alarm should be triggered the user device should active a location service and begin transmitting it s current location and police should be notified. These remedial action rules may for example be included in the one or more compliance rules discussed above and thus may according to some example embodiments be transmitted to the user device e.g. during operation .

According to further example embodiments the remedial actions provided in the rules may additionally be associated with one or more conditions. The conditions may for example comprise various types of contextual information such as time location or the like. Additionally rules may employ various logical operators and or control flow operators such as Boolean operators conditional statements e.g. if then else statements and or the like for increased flexibility and complexity. For example a rule may provide that in an instance in which a received result indicates an unauthorized user or a criminal background the user device should be immediately locked and should be wiped in 5 minutes unless a user successfully authenticates. The rule may further provide that if the device is moved more than 50 feet the device should begin transmitting it s location contact the authorities and immediately be wiped. A multitude of other example rules may be provided by other example embodiments.

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server and or resource server may include means such as the at least one processor the at least one memory the communication interface and or the like for causing at least one of the one or more remedial actions to be performed. See operation . Causing at least one of the one or more remedial actions to be performed may for example comprise causing one or more instructions to be transmitted e.g. to the user device such as instructions to perform the one or more remedial actions and or one or more parameters conditions and or the like related to the performance of the one or more remedial actions.

According to some example embodiments instructions to perform the one or more remedial actions may not be sent to the user device. Instead causing the one or more remedial actions to be performed may comprise causing an indication of the one or more results received in operation to be transmitted e.g. to the user device . According to these example embodiments the information regarding the compliance rules discussed above in the context of operations may include information regarding the remedial action rules discussed above. Thus according to these embodiments the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the user device may include means such as those discussed above in the context of for determining based at least in part on the indication of the result and the one or more remedial action rules one or more remedial actions to be performed. The apparatus may thus further include means for causing the one or more remedial actions to be performed.

Thus some example embodiments may provide for server side rule evaluation with instructions being sent to the user device while other example embodiments may provide for user device side rule evaluation. Accordingly an apparatus associated with the compliance server and or resource server may according to some example embodiments evaluate one or more remedial action rules based on one or more database query results and may cause remedial action instructions to be transmitted to a client device. According to other example embodiments an apparatus associated with the compliance server and or resource server may provide remedial action rules and the result s of the query or queries to the user device so that an apparatus associated with the user device may evaluate the rules locally and cause appropriate remedial actions to be performed. According to still further example embodiments a hybrid approach may be used such that for example some portion of the rules are evaluated server side and some evaluated user device side. According to other example embodiments some remedial actions may be caused to be performed by the apparatus associated with the user device while some remedial actions may be caused to be performed by the apparatus associated with the compliance server and or resource server . Responsibility for such remedial actions may for example be determined based on the remedial action rules such as by including a responsible device in the rules or by distributing to the user device only those rules that should be evaluated at least in part by and or those rules including remedial actions that should be performed at least in part by the user device .
