title: Smart power background to validate user
abstract: Technologies are generally described to implement intrusion detection based on smart power background. In some examples, upon detection of an attempt to access a resource, a power line ambiance may be determined at a location of a device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. The power line ambiance may be based on a connection of the device and/or one or more other devices at the location to a power line. The captured/received power profiles may identify device signatures enabling generation of a digest of the location. An intrusion detection system (IDS), may receive the digest of the location and compare the digest to previous digests associated with an authorized client of the resource to evaluate an authenticity of the attempt. If the authenticity of the attempt is suspicious, the IDS may elevate security by employing one or more verification levels and/or one or more authentication techniques.

This application is the U.S. National Stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT Application Ser. No. PCT US2013 057109 filed on Aug. 28 2013 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Within a network environment passwords are a common security technique implemented to authorize a user to gain access to his her accounts. However passwords alone may not be sufficient. Breaches are occurring more frequently exposing a multitude of passwords. Even repositories of encrypted passwords may be exposed relatively quickly by employing brute force algorithms and graphic processing units GPUs . In addition users may be unable to remember a large number of unique passwords. As a result every breach may also have a few passwords shared with other important accounts that may expose sensitive information such as corporate financial and medical data. Personal data is increasingly available and more accounts may be interconnected due to the cloud infrastructure further casing the ability for a hacker to obtain access to information.

In response to the growing password security concerns the cloud management community has implemented intrusion detection systems IDSs . An IDS may use collateral data about a connection to evaluate an appropriate security level. For example if all previous online banking sessions have occurred in Seattle and a session then occurs in Albania in which all money is transferred to Moscow the system may evaluate the action as suspicious and implement further security even if the password is correct. An IDS is based on concepts of different channels of verification where each channel is a separate source of information about a user. One channel may be a password and another channel may be an asserted identity for example. Each channel alone may be insufficient to evaluate a likelihood that a user is unauthorized but together each channel may improve the probability of accurately determining the credibility of the user.

The present disclosure generally describes techniques to implement intrusion detection based on smart power background.

According to some examples a method to implement intrusion detection is provided. An example method may include determining a power line ambiance at a location of a device on which an attempt to access a resource is executed the power line ambiance based on a connection of the device and one or more other devices to a power line. The method may also include generating a digest based on the power line ambiance where the digest may allow for authentication of the attempt to access the resource.

According to other examples a method to implement intrusion detection based on smart power background is provided. An example method may include detecting an attempt to access a resource and receiving a digest associated with a location of a device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. The method may also include comparing the received digest to previous digests associated with an authorized client of the resource and evaluating an authenticity of the attempt based on the comparison of the digest to the previous digests associated with the authorized client of the resource.

According to further examples a system to implement intrusion detection is described. An example system may include a smart meter and a power grid server coupled to the smart meter. The power grid server may be configured to determine a power line ambiance at a location of a device on which an attempt to access a resource is executed the power line ambiance based on a connection of the device and one or more other devices to a power line through the smart meter. The power grid server may also be configured to generate a digest based on the power line ambiance where the digest allows for authentication of the attempt to access the resource.

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof. In the drawings similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. The aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the Figures can be arranged substituted combined separated and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.

This disclosure is generally drawn inter alia to methods apparatus systems devices and or computer program products related to implementation of intrusion detection based on smart power background.

Briefly stated technologies are generally described to implement intrusion detection based on smart power background. In some examples upon detection of an attempt to access a resource a power line ambiance may be determined at a location of a device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. The power line ambiance may be based on a connection of the device and or one or more other devices at the location to a power line. The captured received power profiles may identify device signatures enabling generation of a digest of the location. An intrusion detection system IDS may receive the digest of the location and compare the digest to previous digests associated with an authorized client of the resource to evaluate an authenticity of the attempt. If the authenticity of the attempt is suspicious the IDS may elevate security by employing one or more verification levels and or one or more authentication techniques.

A power line ambiance as described herein may be a power profile of a location of a device on which an attempt to access a resource is executed for example one or more devices connected to the power line at the location. A power profile as described herein may be an identification of a device contributing to a power line ambiance such as a broadcast identification power consumption of the one or more devices connected to the power line at the location a noise associated with a device contributing to a power line ambiance transmission patterns and or other characteristics associated with power line connection of the device contributing to a power line ambiance. A smart device as described herein may be a device that may communicate with one or more other devices servers systems etc. over the power line and may provide information about itself to the one or more other devices servers systems etc. A non smart device as described herein may be a device that may not communicate with other devices servers systems etc. over the power line and may not be able to provide information about itself to the other devices servers systems etc.

As shown in a diagram intrusion detection may be implemented over one or more servers or a single server e.g. web server such as a hosted service. An intrusion detection system IDS implemented on the one or more servers may communicate with computing devices such as a smart phone a laptop computer or a tablet computer through one or more network s and . The network s and may include a telecommunications network and a power grid network for example.

In one embodiment a power line ambiance may be determined upon detection of an attempt to access a resource on a computing device the power line ambiance based on a connection of one or more devices to a power line at a location of the computing device. To determine the power line ambiance identification or power profiles of the devices may be captured at the location of the computing device by a smart meter and or a power grid server coupled to the devices. Power profiles captured at the location may enable identification of smart and or non smart device signatures. The smart and or non smart device signatures may be identified passively using power consumption data or actively using impulse response data. A digest may then be generated based on the device signatures identified from the power line ambiance and provided to the IDS to evaluate an authenticity of the attempt. If the attempt is authentic the digest may be stored in the IDS as a digest associated with an authorized client of the resource. If the attempt is suspicious one or more verification levels and or authentication techniques may be employed to elevate security.

IDS systems for important secure data may track the detailed progression of a user s electrical profile over time for example noting specific appliance IDs and broadcast information to generate detailed expectations that can be used to complement other security detection channels.

The network s and may comprise any topology of servers clients Internet service providers and communication media. A system according to embodiments may have a static or dynamic topology. The network s and may include secure networks such as an enterprise network an unsecure network such as a wireless open network or the Internet. The network s and may also coordinate communication over other networks such as Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or cellular networks. Furthermore the network s and may include short range wireless networks such as Bluetooth or similar ones. The network s and may provide communication between the nodes described herein. By way of example and not limitation the network s and may include wireless media such as acoustic radio frequency RF infrared and other wireless media.

Many other configurations of computing devices applications data sources and data distribution systems may be employed for intrusion detection based on smart power background. Furthermore the networked environments discussed in are for illustration purposes only. Embodiments are not limited to the example applications modules or processes.

As shown in a diagram a telecommunications network may be coupled to a power grid network each network including one or more servers and respectively. The power grid network may supply power to a multitude of devices for example a laptop a computer a smart phone a tablet and other electronic devices at a particular location for each device. The multitude of devices may include a client device such as the laptop. The multitude of devices may also be in communication with the telecommunications network . Power supplied to one device such as the laptop may be distinct from the power supplied to another device such as the smart phone. The difference in power supplied may be due to the type of device how much power the device consumes or usage of the device the difference enabling each device to have a unique device signature.

Upon detection of an attempt to access a resource a smart meter coupled to the one or more servers of the power grid network may allow determination of a power line ambiance at a location of a device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. For example if an attempt to access an online credit card account is executed on the client device the laptop at a home of the client the power line ambiance may be determined for the home. The power line ambiance may be based on a connection of the multitude of devices to a power line through the smart meter at the location such as the home of the client. The power line ambiance may be determined by capturing the power profiles of the multitude of devices at the location to identify smart and or non smart device signatures. The signatures may be identified passively using power consumption data or actively using impulse response data and used to generate a digest associated with the home of the client. The digest may be provided to an IDS system which may determine the attempt to access the resource as authentic the attempt made by an authorized client and store the digest associated with the authorized client of the resource in one or more servers of the IDS.

Modern smart power grid systems and standards may conduct significant amounts of sensing and signaling. Smart meters on each home may identify device types and behaviors to detect a signature passively or actively. The smart meters may further be designed to send Demand Side Management DSM type signals into power lines. For example in some U.S. cities a user may be paid for allowing the power company to employ air conditioner smart managers to turn off the user s air conditioners during times of very high power load.

Smart power grid systems may further implement power line chips which are cost effective at less than a dollar per chip. Current power management chips built into chargers may have smart power messaging built into the chips such that an additional ability to interpret smart power messages may have zero incremental cost for any device or system that does voltage conversion. As a result implementing the smart power messaging into power line chips may allow feasibility for almost any device to collect data on smart and or non smart devices on a local smart power grid downstream of the nearest smart meter.

As shown in a diagram the system according to embodiments may include a device a power source coupling the device to a smart meter and an IDS . The IDS may include one or more servers configured to evaluate an authenticity of an attempt to access a resource. The power source may also couple one or more other devices to the smart meter at a same location of the device .

The IDS may detect the attempt to access the resource on the device . For example a web login page to access a personal account of a client may be activated. Upon request from the IDS the smart meter may determine a power line ambiance at a location of the device by providing data associated with power profiles of the device and one or more other devices connected to a power line through the power source . The other devices may include appliances such as a television a microwave a washer a dryer or other appliance. The power line ambiance may identify smart and or non smart device signatures from the captured profile and the device signatures may be used to generate a digest associated with the location based on the determined power line ambiance. The generated digest may then be received by the IDS provided by the smart meter .

In an alternate embodiment a device may execute an application such as a power line monitoring application to generate a digest based on a power line ambiance the power line ambiance based on a connection of one or more devices to a power line. The power line monitoring application may be delivered and embedded into the device by an IDS. For example the power line monitoring application may be delivered as an embedded application into a user web login session. The power line monitoring application may then deliver the digest to the IDS.

Once the digest is received by the IDS the servers may evaluate the authenticity by comparing the digest to digests associated with an authorized client of the resource previously received by the IDS . The previous digests may have been generated using a same method as described in and stored in the IDS upon evaluating the digests as authentic. For example the digests may be associated with a home an office a neighborhood a city or other similar location in which the authorized client may have accessed the resource previously.

The servers may also refer the digest if unrecognized after comparison to the digests associated with the authorized client of the resource to a search engine database to compare the digest to digests associated with predefined locations . The digests associated with the predefined locations may have additionally been generated using the same method as described in . The predefined locations may include a hotel an airport a meeting place a healthcare facility an educational facility a train station and other predefined locations in which a user may be able to use devices to access a resource. The search engine may be assisted by network effects e.g. more clients and may be a remote shared repository.

The comparisons of the digest to the digests associated with the authorized client of the resource and or the digests associated with predefined locations may be used to generate an evaluation . The IDS may use the evaluation as an additional channel to consider the authorization of a login. If the evaluation on the authenticity of the attempt to access the resource is suspicious the IDS may further evaluate the authenticity by employing one or more verification levels and or one or more authentication techniques to elevate security.

The authentication techniques may include a password an asserted identity a characterization of typing speed and delays a location of Internet Protocol IP address hardware fingerprinting local weather events local power events activation of one or more previously associated devices or appliances of a known power signature and or another similar authentication technique. One verification level may include comparison of digests for users attempting to access the resource from a same location. Another level may include retrieval and evaluation of external information associated with the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. A user attempting to access the resource may additionally be prompted to provide the external information.

In some examples external information may be retrieved to verify the location associated with the digest. The external information may include weather information associated with the location a power event associated with the location and power signatures of known devices from the location. There may be multiple application programming interfaces APIs available to receive local sunset times and weather based on location and power consumption of devices such as lights and air conditioning may correlate to the external information.

For example if retrieved external information indicates current outside temperature in the location is below freezing but a digest associated with the location reveals power consumption by an air conditioner the evaluation may indicate a suspicion of lack of authenticity. A hacker may have obtained power profile data from a client and may be trying a replay attack of data taken on another day. In response to the suspicion another level of verification may be implemented by the IDS to evaluate the authenticity. For example a user attempting to access the resource may be prompted to activate one or more devices associated with a previous digest or with a known power signature connected to the power line. For example a device on which the attempt is executed may request that the user plug in a phone charger electric razor or other device that has been associated with the user s power profile in previous digests associated with an authorized client received by the IDS.

In another example a digest received by the IDS may indicate a user attempting to access a resource on a device at a home location of an authorized client of the resource but other elements may raise security concerns. For example a large number of attempts may be made to login and or a typing characterization may be different from the authorized client. The IDS may elevate security by prompting the user attempting to access the resource to turn on a device with a known power signature in previous digests associated with the home of the authorized client received by the IDS. For example several missed passwords may prompt a request to please turn on your specific brand and or type TV or please start a washing machine to validate your home. 

Hackers may set up a generator a regionally appropriate and fully patched smart meter and rooms full of specific devices or device simulators to overcome the proposed method of intrusion detection. However they may still fail if they don t know which particular type of TV or washing machine an authorized client has. The above implementation may allow the IDS to elevate security by confirming a known client device along with a password or the like fulfilling the standard two factor verification requirement for Payment Card Industry PCI or government security.

In some examples locations such as workplaces or hotels may offer an additional layer of security by broadcasting information on the power lines using wired connection and supplying those random numbers to an IDS server. This may allow a resource manager to establish that access attempts to a resource e.g. logins are likely in a particular building or to establish that a user is likely at a location like a hotel that broadcasts codes e.g. for corporate guests . Broadcasting codes onto the electrical system may also be used for other implementations such as employers providing their employees with small plug in units to make their home an allowed place to log in.

As shown in a diagram one or more devices associated with predefined locations may be in communication with a telecommunication network the telecommunication network including one or more servers of an IDS. The one or more devices may include a laptop a smart phone a tablet or other similar device. The predefined locations may be a company an airport a train station a hotel a healthcare facility an educational facility a meeting place or any other location in which a device may be used to attempt to access a resource.

Power line ambiances associated with the predefined locations may be determined using the methods described in to generate one or more digests associated with the predefined locations . The one or more servers of the IDS may receive the digests associated with the predefined locations . The digests may be stored in a search engine database associated within the IDS. The IDS may receive a digest associated with a location of a device on which an attempt is executed that is unrecognizable after comparison to previous digests associated with an authorized client of the resource. In response the IDS may execute the search engine to compare the unrecognized digest to the digests stored within the search engine database. The search engine may be assisted by network effects e.g. more clients and may be a remote shared repository. If the user login is determined to be authentic location information from a user device may become associated with the digest in a record to aid in identifying the location if a similar digest is received later by the IDS.

For example an attempt to access an online health insurance account may be executed on the laptop at the hotel. A power line ambiance of the hotel may be determined based on the laptop and one or more other devices such as a television a telephone or other appliance at the hotel connected to a power line at the hotel. The captured power profiles of the laptop and the other devices may identify smart and or non smart device signatures used to generate a digest associated with the hotel. The digest associated with the hotel may be received by the IDS and stored in a search engine database.

The IDS may receive a digest associated with a location of a smartphone on which an attempt to access an online bank account is executed. If the digest is not recognizable after comparison to previous digests associated with an authorized client of the bank account the IDS may execute the search engine database and compare the digest to one or more digests associated with predefined locations such as the hotel.

Example embodiments may also include methods to implement intrusion detection based on smart power background. These methods can be implemented in any number of ways including the structures described herein. One such way may be by machine operations of devices of the type described in the present disclosure. Another optional way may be for one or more of the individual operations of the methods to be performed in conjunction with one or more human operators performing some of the operations while other operations may be performed by machines. These human operators need not be collocated with each other but each can be only with a machine that performs a portion of the program. In other embodiments the human interaction can be automated such as by pre selected criteria that may be machine automated.

Example methods may include one or more operations functions or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks and . The operations described in the blocks through may also be stored as computer executable instructions in a computer readable medium such as a computer readable medium of a computing device .

An example process for establishing secure communications to manage components of a control system may begin with block DETECT AN ATTEMPT TO ACCESS A RESOURCE where an IDS for example may detect an activation of a website login. The IDS may reside in a telecommunications network coupled to a power grid server and or smart meter.

Block may be followed by block DETERMINE A POWER LINE AMBIANCE AT A LOCATION OF A DEVICE ON WHICH THE ATTEMPT IS EXECUTED where the power grid server and or smart meter may determine the power line ambiance at the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is being executed. The power line ambiance may be based on a connection of one or more devices including the device on which the attempt to access the resource is being executed to a power line through the smart meter. The power line ambiance may be determined from power profiles captured from the devices enabling passive and or active identification of smart and or non smart device signatures.

Block may be followed by block GENERATE A DIGEST BASED ON THE POWER LINE AMBIANCE where the digest associated with the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is being executed may be generated by the power grid server and or the smart meter using the smart and or non smart device signatures identified from the captured power profiles of the devices connected to the power line. The digest may then be provided to an IDS.

Block may be followed by block COMPARE THE DIGEST TO PREVIOUS DIGESTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN AUTHORIZED CLIENT OF THE RESOURCE where the digest may be compared to previous digests received by the IDS associated with an authorized client of the resource that is attempting to be accessed. The previous digests associated with the authorized client may be from a home a work place a neighborhood or a city. If the digest is unrecognizable following comparison with the previous digests associated with the authorized client the digest may further be compared to previous digests associated with predefined locations stored in a search engine database within the IDS. The previous digests of the predefined locations may be from a company a hotel an airport a train station a meeting place a healthcare facility an educational facility or other location in which an attempt to access a resource may be made.

Block may be followed by block EVALUATE AN AUTHENTICITY OF THE ATTEMPT BASED ON THE COMPARISON OF THE DIGEST TO THE PREVIOUS DIGESTS where the comparison of the digest to the previous digests associated with the authorized client of the resource and or previous digests associated with the predefined locations may be used to generate an evaluation of the authenticity of the attempt to access the resource. If the evaluation concludes the authenticity of the attempt is suspicious the IDS may elevate security by implementing one or more levels of verification and or authentication techniques. For example the IDS may retrieve and evaluate external information associated with the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is being executed where the IDS may prompt a user attempting to access the resource to provide the external information. The IDS may also compare digests for a plurality of users attempting to access the resource from a same location. The IDS may further combine the verification levels with the authentication techniques such as a password a characterization of typing speed and delays a location of Internet Protocol IP address or other authentication technique.

The blocks included in the above described process are for illustration purposes. Intrusion detection based on smart power background may be implemented by similar processes with fewer or additional blocks. In some embodiments the blocks may be performed in a different order. In some other embodiments various blocks may be eliminated. In still other embodiments various blocks may be divided into additional blocks or combined together into fewer blocks.

In some embodiments as shown in the computer program product may include a signal bearing medium that may also include one or more machine readable instructions that when executed by for example a processor may provide the functionality described herein.

In other examples determining the power line ambiance may include capturing power profiles of the one or more other devices and or the device at the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. Determining the power line ambiance may also include identifying smart and or non smart device signatures from the captured power profiles passively by using power consumption data. Determining the power line ambiance may further include identifying smart and or non smart device signatures from the captured power profiles actively by using impulse response data. Digests for a plurality of predefined locations may be generated where the predefined locations may include a hotel an airport a meeting place a healthcare facility an educational facility or a train station.

According to some embodiments a method to implement intrusion detection based on smart power background is provided.

The method may also include comparing the received digest to previous digests associated with an authorized client of the resource and evaluating an authenticity of the attempt based on the comparison of the digest to the previous digests associated with the authorized client of the resource.

In other embodiments detecting the attempt to access the resource may include detecting an activation of a web login session. The previous digests associated with the authorized client of the resource may be a home an office a neighborhood or a city. Previously generated digests for a plurality of predefined locations may be stored in a database where the predefined locations may include a hotel an airport a meeting place a healthcare facility an educational facility or a train station. The digest may be further compared to the previous digests of the predefined locations in response to determination that the digest is unrecognizable after comparison with the previous digests associated with the authorized client of the resource.

In further embodiments evaluating the authenticity of the attempt may further include receiving external information and verifying the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed based on the external information. The external information may include a weather information associated with the location a power event associated with the location and or power signatures of one or more devices known to be at the location. A user attempting to access the resource may be prompted to provide the external information. Prompting the user attempting to access the resource to provide the external information may include prompting the user to activate a device with a known power signature coupled to a power line.

In yet further embodiments digests of a plurality of users attempting to access the resource from a same location may be compared to evaluate the authenticity of the attempt. The authenticity of the attempt may be evaluated in combination with one or more authentication techniques and using one or more verification levels. The verification levels may include comparison of the digest to the previous digests associated with an authorized client of the resource and or previous digests associated with predefined locations retrieval and evaluation of external information associated with the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed prompting of a user attempting to access the resource to provide the external information and comparison of digests for a plurality of users attempting to access the resource from a same location.

According to some examples a system to implement intrusion detection is described. An example system may include a smart meter and a power grid server coupled to the smart meter. The power grid server may be configured to determine a power line ambiance at a location of a device on which an attempt to access a resource is executed the power line ambiance based on a connection of the device and one or more other devices to a power line through the smart meter. The power grid server may also be configured to generate a digest based on the power line ambiance where the digest allows for authentication of the attempt to access the resource.

In other examples power profiles of the device and the one or more other devices may be captured to determine the power line ambiance at the location of the device on which the attempt to access the resource is executed. Smart and or non smart device signatures may be identified from the captured power profiles passively by using power consumption data to determine the power line ambiance. Smart and or non smart device signatures may also be identified from the captured power profiles actively by using impulse response data to determine the power line ambiance. Digests may be generated for a plurality of predefined locations including a hotel an airport a meeting place a healthcare facility an educational facility and or a train station.

It will be understood by those within the art that in general terms used herein and especially in the appended claims e.g. bodies of the appended claims are generally intended as open terms e.g. the term including should be interpreted as including but not limited to the term having should be interpreted as having at least the term includes should be interpreted as includes but is not limited to etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example as an aid to understanding the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations. However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to examples containing only one such recitation even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an e.g. a and or an should be interpreted to mean at least one or one or more the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number e.g. the bare recitation of two recitations without other modifiers means at least two recitations or two or more recitations .

Furthermore in those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B and C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B and C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together.
