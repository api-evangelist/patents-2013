This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 761 202 filed Feb. 5 2013 the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Authorization frameworks and protocols have been developed to enable a third party application to obtain limited access to a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP service either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service or by allowing the third party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

In one such framework known as OAuth 2.0 an authorization service accepts requests from a client to access resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by a resource service. The authorization service issues a set of credentials to the client that is different than that of the resource owner in order to allow the client to access the resources without having access to the resource owner credentials. However OAuth 2.0 is directed to clients that are offered as network services and are as a result able to present extensive user interfaces to the resource owner in response to initiation by the resource owner of an authorization flow.

In one example the disclosure is directed to a method. The method may include receiving by a computing device and using short range wireless communication an authentication request from a client device. The method may also include receiving at an input device operably coupled to the computing device authorization to provide at least one security credential to the client device. The method may further include responsive to receiving the authorization sending by the computing device and to an authentication service an indication of the authorization.

In another example the disclosure is directed to a computer readable storage medium encoded with instructions that when executed by at least one processor of a computing device cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising establishing by the computing device and with a client device radio communication for short range wireless communication. The operations may also comprise receiving by the computing device and using short range wireless communication an authentication request from a client device. The operations may further comprise receiving by the computing device authorization to provide at least one security credential to the client device. The operations may also comprise responsive to receiving the authorization sending by the computing device and to an authentication service an indication of the authorization.

In another example the disclosure is directed to a computing device comprising at least one processor a short range wireless communication module operable by the at least one processor to receive using short range wireless communication an authentication request from a client device and an authorization module operable by the at least one processor to receive authorization to provide at least one security credential to the client device wherein the authorization module is further configured to responsive to receiving the authorization send an indication of the authorization to an authentication service.

In another example the disclosure is directed to a method comprising sending by a client device and using short range wireless communication an authentication request to a computing device. The method may also comprise receiving by the client device and responsive to the authentication request at least one security credential that provides the client device with access to exchange information with a resource service that hosts a protected resource associated with the at least one security credential.

The details of one or more aspects of the disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In general aspects of the disclosure are directed towards techniques for initiating an authorization flow with a user to enable a user interface limited client computing device to obtain access to protected resources hosted by a resource service.

Some client computing devices hereinafter client devices such as printers fax machines telephones video game consoles television set top boxes credit card terminals automatic teller machines vending machines and sales information kiosks have limited user interfaces that do not provide expansive input and output devices such as keyboards whether real or virtual and web browsers. Some client devices may have such expansive input and output devices but users may find the user interfaces unwieldy or otherwise difficult to use outside of a narrow range of activities. In addition many client devices such as those listed above may be shared among multiple users as part of a shared workspace e.g. office printers or may be located in a public area to the public at large which exposes the client devices and any data stored thereon however fleetingly to hacking. For example requiring a user to enter security credentials directly into a shared client device may create security problems such as another person looking over the user s shoulder or even looking at the shared client device display if the shared client device display displays the security credentials as the user enters that information. Likewise entering security credentials directly into the shared client device may also introduce unknowns such as if the security credentials are being stored by the shared client device and if so the security employed by the shared client device to protect the stored security credentials from authorized acquisition.

Techniques of this disclosure may in various aspects enable a client device to initiate an authorization flow with a user and to send an authorization request for the authorization flow to a mobile computing device of the user when the mobile computing device such as a mobile phone is within a defined range of a tag device of the client device. The tag device may be a near field communication NFC tag for example. The user may engage the client device to perform one or more operations that require access to resources owned by the user but provided by a resource service that requires an indication of user authorization before permitting access to the resources. To initiate the authorization flow the client device may prompt the user by a user interface of the client device to locate the mobile computing device within the defined range of the tag device in order to engage the tag device. In some aspects locating the mobile computing device within the defined range of the tag device may include tapping the tag device with the mobile computing device. Once the mobile computing device is located within the defined range of the tag device the client device may send an authorization request for the authorization flow to the mobile computing device using short range wireless communication provided by the device tag and the user may grant authorization to the client device using an input device of the mobile computing device. The authorization flow described herein may conform at least in part to OAuth 2.0 which defines an authorization framework to enable third party applications to obtain limited access to a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP service by orchestrating an approval interaction between a resource owner and the HTTP service. However the techniques are not limited to the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework context.

The mobile computing device may continue the authorization with an authorization service associated with the resource service. The authorization service may generate a security credential such as an access token that provides an indication of authorization for the user. The authorization service may provide the access token directly to the client device by a network connection. Alternatively the mobile computing device may relay the access token from the authorization service to the client device by exchanging the access token with the tag device using short range wireless communication.

The techniques of this disclosure may provide one or more advantages. For example despite user interface limitations of the client device utilizing the mobile computing device to receive and grant an authorization request may enable convenient authorization of the client device to permit access by the client device to user resources provided by a resource service. As another example because the user of the mobile computing device may authenticate directly with the resource service and authenticate indirectly with the client device using an access token the user may avoid sending user credentials to a potentially insecure client device. As another example unless the user revokes access to the client device the mobile computing device need not request authorization each time the user seeks to use services provided by the client device. Instead by again engaging the tag device with the mobile computing device new security credentials may automatically be generated and sent to the client device.

Computing system also includes computing device which may represent a mobile computing device including but not limited to a mobile phone a tablet computer a personal digital assistant a handheld computer a media player and the like including a combination of two or more of these items. Computing device includes display such as a presence sensitive display that may receive input and provide output.

Client device includes a user interface device that presents a prompt to the user in order to initiate the authorization flow. User interface device may represent a liquid crystal display LCD device a presence sensitive display another visual display device a light emitting diode LED or other light a speaker any other type of device that can generate intelligible output to a user. User interface device may provide limited user interface capabilities. For example user interface device may provide neither a physical nor virtual keyboard. In addition user interface device may provide only a limited number of visualizations statically defined within a configuration of client device and may not provide rendering and input capabilities associated with a web browser for instance. In some aspects client device does not provide a web browser.

Prompt may represent words or other glyphs presented by user interface device activation of an LED represented by user interface device or a sound prompt or voice request from a speaker represented by user interface device for instance. Prompt prompts the user of computing device to locate using motion computing device within the defined range of tag device of client device in order to establish radio communication with or engage tag device .

Responsive to prompt the user may if inclined locate computing device within the defined range of tag device which causes computing device to engage tag device using communication pathway . In some aspects communication pathway may include a short range communication pathway such as near field communication NFC between tag device and computing device . Tag device may represent a short range communication device affixed to or otherwise associated with client device to enable client device to communicate using short range communication. For example tag device may represent a near field communication NFC tag a Bluetooth transceiver or a Bluetooth low energy transceiver.

Computing device may include a short range communication module such as a near field communication NFC module not shown capable of short range wireless communication via communication pathway with tag device associated with client device over a short distance. For example this short distance may be less 100 meters less than 10 meters less than 1 meter less than 10 centimeters less than 5 centimeters or even less than 4 centimeters. Although only one tag device is illustrated in the example of tag device may be representative of any number of tag devices configured to communicate with computing device using a short range communication protocol such as an NFC protocol. Since each tag device may be relatively simple and configured to communicate with any number of other NFC devices computing device may be capable of establishing communication with thousands or even millions of different client devices. In some examples communication pathway may include an NFC network.

Client device is further configured to provide authorization request for the authorization flow to computing device using communication pathway . Authorization request represents a request for authorization to exchange information with a service. Authorization request may include an identifier for client device a requested scope for the requested authorization local state and or a redirection Uniform Resource Identifier URI to which authorization service may redirect mobile computing device upon granting access to resource service . In this aspect client device sends authorization request directly to computing device by communication pathway .

Computing device in response to receiving authorization request may display prompt that provides user of computing device with the option to accept or deny authorization request . In the illustrated example prompt includes accept button and reject button which user may press to accept or reject respectfully authorization request . Prompt may represent an input interface of an application executing on computing device that is configured to recognize authorization request as a request for authorization to exchange information with a service. The application may be provided by an entity that manufactures client device or software operating on client device . Alternatively the application may be a utility provided by an entity that manufactures computing device or software operating on computing device .

In some aspects prompt may include an input screen such as a web page presented by a web browser of computing device to request user to provide resource owner credentials such as a username and password. The web page may be identified by a URI associated with authorization service . For example the web page may represent a grant access page or authorization endpoint associated with authorization service.

If user rejects authorization request computing device may terminate the authorization flow. If user accepts authorization request computing device continues the authorization flow by granting authorization request in conjunction with authorization service . Computing device and authorization service communicate using communication pathway which may represent for instance a short range communication pathways such as Bluetooth or radio frequency identification RFID active NFC communication wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs a mobile service provider network e.g. a 3G or Long Term Evolution LTE network and the like. Example authorization flows for granting authorization request are described below with respect to .

Authorization service represents a service role for the authorization flow provided by remote system to authenticate an owner of a protected resource i.e. a resource owner hosted by resource service and to authorize client device to access the protected resource according to a requested scope. Authorization service issues a security credential for use by client device after successfully authenticating user and authorizing client device . The security credential provides client device with access to exchange information with resource service that hosts a protected resource associated with the security credential and with user . The security credential provided by authorization service may include an access token.

An access token includes data defining a specific scope and in some aspects lifetime for an authorized request and may be used by client device to obtain access to protected resources that are hosted by resource service and owned or otherwise associated with user . In other words an access token represents credential to access protected resources and defines a specific scope and in some aspects duration of access that is granted by the resource owner and is enforced by authorization service and resource service .

An access token may include an identifier usable to retrieve authorization information or may include the authorization information in a secure verifiable format e.g. a token string consisting of data and cryptographic signature. Access tokens may in various aspects have different formats structures and methods of utilization according to resource service security requirements. In some aspects additional authentication credentials may be needed in order for client device to use an access token. Consequently an access token may be used in accordance with techniques described herein to replace different authorization credentials e.g. a username and password combination with a single token usable to access resource service which enables issuing an access token that is more restrictive than the authorization grant used to obtain the access token as well as providing a single mechanism for authorization to resource service .

Resource service hosts protected resources owned by user . The protected resources may include any digital information or hosted resources associated with user such as digital images digital videos digital music eBooks email accounts financial information a cloud storage account a video game profile a social network profile and user preferences for instance. Resource service may present an application programming interface API to provide access to protected resources.

As a result of the authorization flow initiated by client device client device receives an access token issued by authorization service that corresponds to authorization request . Client device uses communication pathway to present the access token to resource service to access protected resources in accordance with the scope of the access token. For example client device may access and download photos owned by user access a cloud storage account of user to upload digital files such as scanned documents or otherwise access and use the protected resources associated with user . Communication pathway may represent any of the example communication pathways described above with respect to communication path .

Upon completing a transaction using the access token client device may immediately delete the access token wait for the access token to expire and or communicate with user to provide user with an option to delete the access token if desired.

In some aspects authorization service may issue a refresh token corresponding to authorization request . Client device may use the refresh token as a credential to authorization service to obtain a fresh access token when either a current access token corresponding to authorization request becomes invalid or expires or to obtain one or more additional access tokens with additional or narrower scope e.g. having a shorter lifetime or fewer authorized permissions .

Remote system may include but is not limited to one or more remote servers one or more computing devices and or a cloud computing service. A cloud computing service may include one or more remote servers that may provide one or more services including but not limited to computation software data access and storage services without requiring end user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the systems that deliver the one or more services. Resource service and authorization service may be hosted by the same or different devices e.g. servers of remote system . In some aspects resource service and authorization service may be hosted by different remote systems administered by separate entities.

In some aspects user may opt out of third party authorization features provided by resource service . In some aspects the third party authorization features provided by resource service are disabled by default and user must opt in in order to enable these features.

In this example client device is configured to provide authorization request for the authorization flow to computing device using communication pathway to computing device . Computing device in response to receiving authorization request may display prompt that provides user of computing device with the option to accept or deny authorization request . User accepts authorization request and computing device continues the authorization flow by issuing authorization grant corresponding to authorization request to authorization service . Authorization grant may include a credential representing authorization by the resource owner e.g. user to access protected resources associated with the resource owner. Authorization grant may be usable to obtain an access token. In this sense authorization grant also represents a request for an access token.

In some aspects authorization grant may include resource owner credentials of user such as a username and password of user . Computing device may store the resource owner credentials to persistent storage and present the resource owner credentials to authorization service in authorization grant . In some aspects authorization service and computing device engage in a separate authentication protocol. For instance responsive to receiving authorization grant authorization service may send a request for resource owner credentials to computing device . In response computing device may display using a web browser or other application a login or other authentication screen by which user may enter and submit his or her resource owner credentials to authorization service .

Authorization service authorizes the resource owner credentials and if the resource owner credentials are valid issues access token to computing device . In this way computing device stands in for client device during the authorization grant access token exchange and resource owner credentials of user need not be shared with client device .

Computing device receives access token and sends responsive to authorization request access token to client device . Computing device may associate access token with authorization request in a message to client device . In some aspects computing device may upon receiving token from authorization service prompt user to again locate computing device within a defined range of tag device to send token using communication pathway . In some aspects computing device sends access token to client device by a different communication pathway such as a LAN.

Client device receives access token and presents token to resource service with a request for a protected resource. Resource service validates access token and if valid serves protected resource. In some instances client device refreshes access token with a refresh token provided by authorization service .

In this example client device is configured to provide authorization request for the authorization flow to computing device using communication pathway to computing device . Computing device in response to receiving authorization request may display prompt that provides user of computing device with the option to accept or deny authorization request . User accepts authorization request and computing device continues the authorization flow by issuing authorization grant corresponding to authorization request to authorization service . Authorization grant may include a credential representing authorization by the resource owner e.g. user to access protected resources associated with the resource owner. Authorization grant may be usable to obtain an access token. In this sense authorization grant also represents a request for an access token.

In some aspects as described above with respect to authorization grant may include resource owner credentials of user such as a username and password. Computing device may store the resource owner credentials to persistent storage and present the resource owner credentials to authorization service in authorization grant . In some aspects authorization service and computing device engage in a separate authentication protocol. For instance responsive to receiving authorization grant authorization service may send a request for resource owner credentials to computing device . In response computing device may display using a web browser or other application a login or other authentication screen by which user may enter and submit his or her resource owner credentials to authorization service .

Authorization service authorizes the resource owner credentials and if the resource owner credentials are valid issues access token and optionally a refresh token directly to client device using communication pathway . In this way computing device stands in for client device during the authorization grant step of the authorization flow but authorization service sends access token directly to client device . As a result resource owner credentials of user need not be shared with client device .

In some aspects authorization request may include a redirection URI previously provided to client device by authorization service . In such aspects client device may direct computing device to authorization service using the redirection URI. Using resource owner credentials provided in authorization grant authorization service authorizes the resource owner credentials and if the resource owner credentials are valid issues access token directly to client device using communication pathway . Again computing device stands in for client device during the authorization grant step of the authorization flow but authorization service sends access token directly to client device . As a result resource owner credentials of user need not be shared with client device . In some instances prior to and as a prerequisite to issuing access token directly to client device authorization service issues redirect message which includes an authorization code that is associated with access token . Computing device provides the authorization code to client device which presents the authorization code to authorization service in order to receive access token . Authorization service may additionally authorize client device as a prerequisite to issuing access token and optionally a refresh token directly to client device .

The techniques described in this disclosure may be implemented at least in part in hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. For example various aspects of the described techniques may be implemented within one or more processors including one or more microprocessors digital signal processors DSPs application specific integrated circuits ASICs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry as well as any combinations of such components. The term processor or processing circuitry may generally refer to any of the foregoing logic circuitry alone or in combination with other logic circuitry or any other equivalent circuitry. A control unit including hardware may also perform one or more of the techniques of this disclosure.

Such hardware software and firmware may be implemented within the same device or within separate devices to support the various techniques described in this disclosure. In addition any of the described units modules or components may be implemented together or separately as discrete but interoperable logic devices. Depiction of different features as modules or units is intended to highlight different functional aspects and does not necessarily imply that such modules or units must be realized by separate hardware firmware or software components. Rather functionality associated with one or more modules or units may be performed by separate hardware firmware or software components or integrated within common or separate hardware firmware or software components.

The techniques described in this disclosure may also be embodied or encoded in an article of manufacture including a computer readable storage medium encoded with instructions. Instructions embedded or encoded in an article of manufacture including a computer readable storage medium encoded may cause one or more programmable processors or other processors to implement one or more of the techniques described herein such as when instructions included or encoded in the computer readable storage medium are executed by the one or more processors. Computer readable storage media may include random access memory RAM read only memory ROM programmable read only memory PROM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory a hard disk a compact disc ROM CD ROM a floppy disk a cassette magnetic media optical media or other computer readable storage media.

In some examples a computer readable storage medium may comprise non transitory medium. The term non transitory may indicate that the storage medium is not embodied in a carrier wave or a propagated signal. In certain examples a non transitory storage medium may store data that can over time change e.g. in RAM or cache .
