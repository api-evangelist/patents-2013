This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent App. Ser. No. 61 622 377 filed Apr. 10 2012 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

When a user or consumer wants to find something on the Internet such as for a possible purchase of goods or services or just to find information a search is typically conducted. The user enters one or more desired search terms that relate to the information sought by the user. The more terms and or narrower the terms the more focused the search results may be. When the search terms are submitted a search engine or Internet Service Provider ISP performs the search and returns search results to the user.

Typically search results are presented on a page with links the user can select to take the user to a particular site for more details. Such results may be presented in order of perceived relevance of the search terms as determined by the search engine. For online shopping or purchases specific merchants may have their sites or links listed earlier or featured in the search e.g. as a paid service to the search engine or ISP. Another way to present search results for shopping is to show the user the search results within different categories or ranges to give the user a more manageable or informative result display. For example a search for a product may show the user results within different price ranges. This may help the user identify which results would be relevant to the user.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

According to one embodiment a service provider presents results from a search query with dynamic category ranges with each category range having approximately the same number of items within the category range. In one embodiment approximately the same is within 10 . In other embodiments approximately the same is within 5 . The number may vary depending on the number of results and or merchant specifications.

When a user submits a search query the system or service provider determines the number of results returned for the query. The system then sets a number of ranges so that between ranges in one embodiment all have approximately the same number of results. Number of ranges could be limited by some predefined number. The ranges can be price merchant rating quantitative data merchant sales of the item category of item overall or other quantitative data. The system may determine a rounding factors set for each range. If a range has a large number of items the user can select that range and see a finer set of ranges within that range. This can continue as needed or desired. Stores merchants or other online commerce sites may choose ranges to best suit their needs.

As a result consumers may be able to better and more easily navigate search results because ranges will not have too many results making it harder for the user to navigate through the results or too few results making it inefficient for the user to navigate through the results .

In one embodiment a service provider receives a search query from a user through a user device such as a PC computing tablet smart phone etc. The search query may be for a specific merchant or a group of merchants. The search query may be one or more key words along with any other search limiters such as price etc. For example the user may enter blue shirt. 

The service provider or system accesses a database cloud or memory containing available or offered items services from the merchant s and searches based on the user query. In the above example the system searches for blue shirt and finds 98 items or results matching the search query.

In a typical process the system may return the results within fixed ranges. For example the fixed ranges may be price ranges of 0 to 9.99 10.00 to 19.99 20.00 to 29.99 30.00 to 39.99 40.00 to 49.99 and 50.00 on up. The results may show 0 items in the first four price ranges 10 items in the next price range and 88 items in the last price range. This may not be that useful to the consumer as the consumer would need to select the last price range to see most of the results which may make it difficult for the user to efficiently navigate through those results.

In one embodiment the system determines suitable price ranges such that an approximate same number of items are within each price range. In this example the price ranges may be 40.00 to 49.99 50.00 to 54.99 55.00 to 57.99 58.00 to 59.99 60.00 to 69.99 70.00 to 74.99 75.00 to 82.99 83.00 to 85.49 85.50 to 89.99 and 90.00 to 100.00 with each range having between 8 and 10 items.

The attached flowchart illustrates steps a service provider may perform in determining and or setting ranges according to one embodiment.

If the initial search results yielded a very large number of items the system may still limit the total number of ranges to ten or some other number. In such a case each range may still have a large number of items say approximately 200. The user can select a desired range and have the system automatically create ten or some other number ranges again containing approximately the same number of items. In this example each range may contain approximately 20 items. The system may continue to dynamically set ranges within each preceding range as suitable.

In another embodiment instead of the system determining a suitable range or a number of ranges the merchant may specify the number. This number may be the initial range or number such that subsequent ranges are determined by the system for the approximately equal distribution of search results.

Note that although price ranges are described above other ranges or categories may also be suitable such as merchant rating quantitative data merchant sales of the item category of item overall consumer reviews e.g. stars or other quantitative data.

1 The system receives a search request from a user or consumer such as through a user device like a PC smart phone computing tablet or the like. The search request may be accessed through an app or URL. The user may enter desired term s to describe what the user is searching for. The search may be for items services specific information about a topic a question etc. The system may be a service provider that provides search results to a user. After receiving the search request the system performs the search as is well known in the art of search engines and arranges search results in ascending order at step

3 If there is more than one interval d greater than one the system calculates a percentage of results per range at step using the following equation 

4 The system calculates quantiles at step and calculates confidential intervals around quantiles or quantile confidential intervals at step as follows 

c The system calculates confidential intervals around quantiles within which intervals end points will be searching. Order statistics quantiles are distributed by binominal distributions with parameters n and P. The system uses normal distribution approximation of binominal distribution with parameters N np np 1 P . The system finds confidence intervals with confidence level 1 for k i.e. it finds rand r1 r

5 Next the system calculates a rounding factors set for each results interval at step . For every price interval r r the system finds rounding factor set R. For log results results the system creates rounding factor set 10 10 5 10 2 10 1 10 for K 0. If k 0 use R 10 5 2 1. If k

6 The system searches for intervals end points around quantiles. It starts a search close to the quantile kand monotonically expands to the interval limits around quantile k. Two cases are possible as determined at step a quantile kis a positive integer and b quantile kis not a positive integer e.g. is a positive rational number .

7 The system uses optimization criteria to choose optimal end points for each result interval at step . Let s say valueresult interval end points found in step and indexsuch as

If the prices in the interval around quantile are equal results r results r skip that interval and continue with next quantile using skipped quintile s upper confidential interval s limit as next quantile lower confidential interval s limit. If no endpoints have been found and min results results r and or results r max results search those intervals min results results r and or results r max results for end points.

Results are then displayed or presented to the user such as on the user device within the ranges or intervals.
