title: Single set of credentials for accessing multiple computing resource services
abstract: A user may utilize a set of credentials to access, through a managed directory service, one or more services provided by a computing resource service provider. The managed directory service may be configured to identify one or more policies applicable to the user. These policies may define the level of access to the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Based at least in part on these policies, the managed directory service may transmit a request to an identity management system to obtain a set of temporary credentials that may be used to enable the user to access the one or more services. Accordingly, the managed directory service may be configured to enable the user, based at least in part on the policies and the set of temporary credentials, to access an interface, which can be used to access the one or more services.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 902 790 filed on Nov. 11 2013 entitled MANAGED DIRECTORY SERVICE the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Customers utilize directory services to create and maintain a directory e.g. file systems files users security policies network resources applications system storage etc. for data management and generally access to a variety of resources. The directory service may be configured to create a directory in a data center operated by the customer e.g. on premises or in a remote network e.g. off premises dependent on the customer s business needs. However a customer desiring to maintain a directory on premises and off premises may encounter numerous difficulties. For instance a customer utilizing an on premises directory may be required to create a separate directory off premises and sync data between the two directories to maintain the same set of data. This may require the customer to maintain multiple accounts for each user of the directories. Further maintenance of multiple directories may increase the administrative burden of the customer as maintenance and security of the multiple directories may require additional resources to perform. Exacerbating the problem users may have to perform a complex set of operations to obtain one or more additional sets of credentials to access the directory and one or more other services provided by the computing resource service provider.

In the following description various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Techniques described and suggested herein relate to the centralized policy management of one or more users such that one set of credentials may be used to access a directory and one or more services provided by a computing resource service provider. In an embodiment an entity e.g. an organization responsible for the administration of a directory made available through a managed directory service specifies one or more policies for a user or a plurality of users that utilize the directory. The entity may be a customer of a computing resource service provider that operates various services such as a virtual computer system service object based data storage services database services the aforementioned managed directory service and a plurality of other services.

In some embodiments the customer communicates with a policy management sub system within the managed directory service to define one or more policies that affect a user s access to applications and resources managed by the directory and or a user s access to one or more other services provided by the computing resource service provider. For instance the customer may create a policy that prevents a user or a group of users from executing a particular application e.g. word processing application photo editing application etc. within the directory. In another instance the customer may create a policy that prevents a user or a group of users from accessing a virtual computer system service provided by the computing resource service provider or executing write actions within a database service provided by the computing resource service provider.

In an embodiment once the user policies have been generated the user may utilize a Uniform Resource Identifier URI which may be used by a user or a group of users to access a computing resource service provider interface. This computing resource service provider interface may be configured to enable a user or a group of users to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. For instance a user may use the computing resource service provider interface to access a virtual computer system service and request provisioning of a virtual machine instance. The computing resource service provider interface may additionally be customized according to the defined applicable user policies. For instance if a defined user policy specifies that the user is not permitted to access an object based data storage service the computing resource service provider interface may be configured to not include any authorizations related to this service.

In an embodiment when a user utilizes the URI to access the computing resource service provider interface the policy management sub system within the managed directory service obtains the defined user policies to determine the parameters for access to the various services provided by the computing resource service provider. Once the user policies have been obtained the policy management sub system may communicate with an identity management service such as through one or more appropriately configured application programming interface API calls to the service to request temporary credentials associated with the services the user has been granted access to. Accordingly these temporary credentials may be transmitted to the policy management sub system in order to enable user access to the permissible services and operations. Additionally the policy management sub system may further communicate with the identity management service to provide the user specific policies that are to be enforced. Once the policy management sub system has received the temporary sets of credentials and has transmitted the policies to be enforced to the identity management service the policy management sub system may enable the user to access the customized computing resource service provider interface.

In this manner a user or a group of users of a directory may use the single set of credentials used to access the directory in order to access one or more other services provided by the computing resource service provider without having to manage additional sets of credentials for these one or more other services. In addition the techniques described and suggested herein facilitate additional technical advantages. For example because the customer may utilize a policy management sub system within the managed directory service to specify user policies for any service provided by the computing resource service provider the customer may not be required to access any other services or interfaces to specify service specific user policies. This in turn may reduce the potential administrative burden on the customer.

Accordingly as illustrated in the environment includes a customer . The customer may be an organization that could utilize one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider to operate and manage one or more directories e.g. file systems files users security policies network resources applications system storage etc. to support his or her operations. The customer may through a customer computer system device submit one or more requests to a managed directory service provided by the computing resource service provider to configure a directory which may be used to facilitate data sharing and or availability amongst one or more users . Accordingly the managed directory service may additionally include a policy management sub system which may be configured to allow a customer to generate and modify one or more user profiles to define remote access to one or more applications and resources available within the directory and or one or more other services provided by the computing resource service provider . For instance the customer may access the policy management sub system to allow a user to access a word processing application within the directory and a virtual computer system service provided by the computing resource service provider while prohibiting access to other applications and services.

As will be described in greater detail below a customer may interact with a user profile interface to access a policy generator and accordingly the policy management sub system . In an embodiment the customer can access the policy management sub system through a policy generator button available in each user profile within the managed directory service . The policy generator may enable the customer to specify one or more policies that may be used to define a level of access to various applications and or services for a particular user . Accordingly when the customer defines the applicable policies that are to be applicable to a particular user through the policy generator the policy generator may transmit one or more executable instructions to the policy management sub system to incorporate and enforce the specified policies. Additionally in an embodiment when the customer specifies one or more policies that enable a user to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the policy management sub system transmits a URI to the user that may be used by the user to access a computer resource service provider interface in order to access and utilize the applicable services in accordance with the implemented policies. Alternatively the customer may transmit the URI to the user such as through electronic mail or other delivery system once the one or more policies have been defined for the user .

When the user accesses the directory and uses the URI to access the computing resource service provider interface the policy management sub system may access the user s directory profile to identify the policies specified by the customer that are to be enforced. Based at least in part on these policies the policy management sub system may be configured to transmit one or more executable instructions to an identity management system not shown to obtain temporary credentials for accessing the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider and or define one or more actions the user may undertake within these services. Once the policy management sub system has obtained these credentials the policy management sub system may generate a user specific computing resource service provider interface and enable the user to access the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider according to the policies defined by the customer and applicable to the user .

The computer system client device may request access to services via one or more networks and or entities associated therewith such as other servers connected to the network either directly or indirectly. The computer system client device may include any device that is capable of connecting with a computer system via a network including at least servers laptops mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets other smart devices such as smart watches smart televisions set top boxes video game consoles and other such network enabled smart devices distributed computing systems and components thereof abstracted components such as guest computer systems or virtual machines and or other types of computing devices and or components. The network may include for example a local network an internal network a public network such as the Internet a wide area network a wireless network a mobile network a satellite network a distributed computing system with a plurality of network nodes and or the like. The network may also operate in accordance with various protocols such as those listed below Bluetooth WiFi cellular network protocols satellite network protocols and or others.

In some embodiments the computer system may include one or more local computer system resources which may be located at least in part on the customer premises and which may store files and or other computer system resources thereon including but not limited to directories applications data databases links to other computer system resources system drivers computer operating systems virtual machines and or other such resources. In some embodiments the local computer system resources may be local file system resources and may be stored on a variety of storage devices such as system random access memory RAM disk drives solid state drives removable drives or combinations of these and or other such storage devices. In some embodiments the local computer system resources may be located at least in part in a datacenter a plurality of computer system resources services and or storage devices that may be collocated that may be accessed by the computer system client device via one or more connections such as for example the network connections described herein. The computer system resources and or the datacenter may be located locally or a combination of locally and remotely. For example in some embodiments a file system and or directory may be located on a disk located in a local datacenter and the contents of the file system and or directory may also be replicated to a disk located in a remote datacenter. In some other embodiments a file system and or directory may have at least a part of its contents located in one datacenter that may be local and other parts of its contents located in one or more other datacenters that may be local or remote. The storage devices may include physical devices such as those described herein and or virtual representations of such physical devices. For example a file system and or directory storage device may include some amount of physical memory part of which is dedicated to storage as a virtual disk drive with a file system created on the virtual disk drive. Other such local storage devices may be considered as within the scope of this disclosure.

In some embodiments the service may need access to one or more computer system directory resources such as those described herein. The service may in some embodiments include a variety of other computer system entities including but not limited to users other computer systems processes and or automated processes and or other such computer system entities. Access to the system directory resources may in some embodiments be provided by a service such as a managed directory service which may provide access to one or more system resources. The managed directory service may provide a variety of services to enable computer systems and or computer system client devices to access system resources including but not limited to authentication authorization and directory services.

For example the managed directory service may provide authentication services which may authenticate credentials of a user computer system process automated process or other such entity to at least determine whether that entity is authorized to access the managed directory service and or the system resources associated with the managed directory service. In some embodiments the credentials may be authenticated by the managed directory service itself or they may be authenticated by a process program or service under the control of the managed directory service or they may be authenticated by a process program or service that the managed directory service may communicate with or they may be authenticated by a combination of these and or other such services or entities.

The managed directory service may also provide authorization services which may authorize a user computer system process automated process or other such entity to at least determine which actions of one or more possible actions that entity may perform. For example in the case of a computer system resource such as a file system resource actions that an entity may or may not be authorized to perform include but are not limited to creating file systems on the file system resource destroying file systems on the file system resource attaching to file systems on the file system resource detaching from file systems on the file system resource providing access links to file systems on the file system resource reclaiming access links to file systems on the file system resource allowing reads from file systems on the file system resource allowing writes to file systems on the file system resource and or other such file system resource actions.

Actions on system resources may include but not be limited to actions on directories files applications data databases links to other resources system drivers operating systems virtual machines and or other such system resource objects thereon and may include such actions as the actions mentioned herein. Actions to start stop reclaim destroy and or otherwise manage the system resources as well as other such actions may also be included in the available actions. Authorization to perform actions may be managed by an entity such as a credentialing or policy system such as a system that for example maintains a set of credentials and or policies related to a certain entity and may determine based at least in part on the set of credentials and or policies which actions an entity is authorized to perform. The actions that an entity may be authorized to perform may be static or may vary according to a number of factors including but not limited to time of day type of credentials system policies nature type or location of the object being accessed or a combination of these and or other such authorization factors. For example a computer system entity may be authorized only to read certain files on a file system to read and write certain other files on a file system and to add and delete certain other files on a file system. A different computer system entity may be authorized to perform any actions on the file system but only if those actions are initiated from a certain location and at a certain time. One or more processes may be authorized only to write to a file on a file system such as for example a system log while other processes may only be authorized to read from the file. As may be contemplated these are illustrative examples. Other types of operations may be authorized by the managed directory service authorization system and such other types of operations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

The managed directory service may also provide directory services which may provide an authenticated entity access to computer system resources according to the authorization credentials and or policies. For example in an embodiment where a computer system entity may be authorized to read and write a certain data store on a computer system resource such as a file system resource the ability to do so may be provided by the directory services. Directory services may provide access to the file system resource by providing links to the file system resource locations such as by a URI object or some other such linkage. The URI may be provided by the computer system client device or by a process running at the data center or by a process running on a computer system connected to the datacenter or by the managed directory service or by a combination of these and or other such computer system entities.

In some embodiments the access to the computer system resources may be provided in such a way that the access is invisible to the requesting entity. For example the access may be provided to a requesting entity as a URI or other such link to a location on the local file system . The location on the computer system resource may be translated into a URI by one or more processes running on the computer system. The service or entity that requested the access to the computer system resource may use the received URI to access the computer system resource without requiring configuration that is dependent on the location of the computer system resource and may in some embodiments use the URI to link to the computer system resource to operate as if the service or entity were directly connected to the computer system resource. Operations that for example appear to write a set of data to a file that may appear to the service or entity to be located in a location local to the service or entity may actually package the data into a network packet and may then transfer the packet over the network via the access link to be actually written to a file located on local file system . As may be contemplated these are illustrative examples and other types of operations which may be performed by the managed directory service may also be considered as within the scope of the present disclosure.

The computer system client device may be connected to the computer system using one or more networks and or entities associated therewith such as other servers connected to the network either directly or indirectly. The computer system client device may include any device that is capable of connecting with the computer system via a network including at least servers laptops mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets other smart devices such as smart watches smart televisions set top boxes video game consoles and other such network enabled smart devices distributed computing systems and components thereof abstracted components such as guest computer systems or virtual machines and or other types of computing devices and or components. The network may include for example a local network an internal network a public network such as the Internet a wide area network a wireless network a mobile network a satellite network a distributed computing system with a plurality of network nodes and or the like. The network may also operate in accordance with various protocols such as those listed below Bluetooth WiFi cellular network protocols satellite network protocols and or others.

In some embodiments the computer system client device may access one or more authentication processes running on and or under the control of a managed directory service wherein the authentication processes may be configured to at least respond to requests from external processes and to authenticate the credentials of requesting computer system entities users or processes. For example the authentication processes may validate whether a requesting computer system entity user or process is allowed to access the managed directory service. The authentication process may validate access to the managed directory service by verifying a user name and password combination or by verifying a cryptographic key stored on a hardware software firmware or other such device or by verifying whether the computer system client device is authorized to request access or by verifying whether the network is authorized to request access or by a combination of these and or other such verification methods. The authentication process may perform other such authentication tasks and may in some embodiments perform authentication tasks in combination with other processes running on and or with data stored on the computer system and or on other computer systems.

In some embodiments a computer system entity user or process as described herein may connect to a computer system through a computer system client device as described herein using one or more networks and or entities associated therewith as described herein and may request authorization to perform one or more operations and or processes on one or more computer system resources which may be located for example at least in part in a data center such as the datacenter described herein at least in connection with and in accordance with at least one embodiment. In some embodiments the requested operation authorization may be a requested authorization to directly perform one or more computer system resource operations. In some embodiments the requested operation authorization may be a requested operation to indirectly perform one or more computer system resource operations. For example the requested operation authorization may be a request for authorization for a remote computer system service process or entity under the control of the computer system entity user or process for authorization to perform one or more computer system resource operations. The authorization may be requested from one or more authorization processes running on and or under the control of a managed directory service wherein the authorization processes may be configured to at least respond to requests from external processes and to authorize the performance of one or more operations and or processes by the computer system entity user or process on one or more computer system resources . The computer system resource may be located locally such as in a datacenter on the customer premises or may be located remotely or may be located in multiple remote locations such as on a distributed and or virtual computer system or may be located in a combination of local and or remote locations. For example a file system may be located on a local disk located in a local datacenter and the contents of the file system may also be replicated to a one or more remote disks located in one or more remote datacenters. In some embodiments a file system may have at least a part of its contents located in one datacenter that may be local or remote and other parts of its contents located in one or more other datacenters.

Examples of operations and or processes that may be authorized include but are not limited to creating and or destroying resource objects reading and or writing resource objects and or other such system resource operations. Authorization may vary by entity user or process by time of the day by class of entity by class of user by class of process by one or more system policies by the nature of the request or by a combination of these and or other such considerations. For example a computer system entity may be authorized to create files and or directories but may not be authorized to delete them or a process may be authorized only to delete files and or directories that were created by that process and no others or an entity may be authorized to read certain files in certain directories but not others. As may be contemplated these are illustrative examples. Other types of operations may be authorized by the managed directory service authorization system and such other types of operations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments a computer system entity user or process as described herein may connect to a computer system through a computer system client device as described herein using one or more networks and or entities associated therewith as described herein and may create and or instantiate one or more local and or remote services that may request access to one or more file systems . In some embodiments the computer service process or entity may access one or more directory services processes running on and or under the control of a managed directory service wherein the directory services processes may be configured to at least respond to requests from external processes and to provide access to one or more file systems. Access to one or more file systems may include access to operations such as operations to read write execute delete create instantiate and or other such operations on files and or other file system objects such as directories applications data databases links to other file systems system drivers computer operating systems virtual machines and or other such file system objects. In some embodiments access to operations may be facilitated by communication with one or more authorization processes as described herein providing authorization according to resource authorization policies contained therein.

Through the interface the customer or delegated administrative user may be able to view the directory structure including a listing of all available computers within the directory and the users authorized to access the directory. Accordingly the customer or delegated administrative user may use the interface to access one or more user profiles to view user properties e.g. first name and last name location phone number etc. and define one or more policies that may be used to determine a level of access to one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider as well as a level of access to one or more applications and or other resources managed by the directory. As will be described in greater detail below in connection with each user profile may include a policy generator button that when selected enables a customer or delegated administrative user to access a policy generator to define these one or more policies. For instance through the policy generator a customer or delegated administrative user may specify which services a user may access and the actions that the user may take within these services . Accordingly once the customer or delegated administrative user has defined the applicable user policies through the policy generator the customer or delegated administrative user may be able to view the applied policies within the user profile . In addition the policy generator may transmit one or more executable instructions to a policy management sub system which may cause the policy management sub system to enable the user to utilize a URI to access a computing resource service provider interface. This computing resource service provider interface may enable a user to access the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider from within the directory.

In an embodiment when a user utilizes the URI from within the directory to access the computing resource service provider interface a policy management sub system within the managed directory service will access the user profile to obtain the set of policies applicable to the user. As noted above the policies may include one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider that may be accessible to the user. Accordingly the policy management sub system may transmit one or more executable instructions to an identity management service to obtain temporary credentials which may be used to access the one or more services . The policy management sub system may be configured to generate a custom computing resource service provider interface that includes the one or more services the user has been granted access to. Since the policy management sub system manages the temporary credentials necessary to access the one or more services a user may utilize this custom interface to access the one or more services without need for additional credentials.

In addition to the policies that may be established to control user access to the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the customer or delegated administrative user may utilize the interface to access the policy management sub system to define one or more policies that may affect a user s access to one or more applications within the directory. For instance a customer or delegated administrative user may interact with the policy management sub system through the interface to create a policy that when enforced prohibits a user or group of users from accessing a word processing application within the directory. Thus when a user attempts to utilize the word processing application the user may receive an error message that informs the user that he she does not have access to the application.

As noted above a customer or delegated administrative user may utilize a managed directory service interface to access one or more user profiles to specify a set of policies that when enforced may inhibit or enable a user from accessing one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a user profile interface for generating one or more policies in accordance with at least one embodiment. The user profile interface may include a policies display that is configured to provide illustrative information as to the policies currently applied to the user profile. For instance as illustrated in the policy provided on the policies display may allow the user in this case Joe B to access an object based data storage service to generate and or access one or more data objects. Thus when the user utilizes the URI to access the computing resource service provider interface the policy management sub system described above may obtain this policy and transmit one or more executable instructions to an identity management system provided by the computing resource service provider to obtain temporary credentials for access to the object based data storage service. Additionally the policy management sub system may use this obtained policy to customize the computing resource service provider interface in accordance compliance with the policy.

The user profile interface may include a policy generator button which when selected by a customer or delegated administrative user may transmit one or more executable instructions to a network browsing application that may cause the application to access a policy generator. The policy generator may include an interface that may be used to create one or more policies for the specified user. It should be noted that only the customer or delegated administrative users may utilize the policy generator button to create or modify particular user policies using the policy generator. For instance if a user that has not been identified as a delegated administrative user attempts to use the policy generator button an error message may be transmitted to the user interface which may be configured to inform the user that he she has not been granted access to the policy generator. Alternatively the policy generator button may be hidden or disabled if the user does not have access to the policy generator.

The policy generator may include a plurality of components that may be used for defining different policy parameters. For instance the policy generator may include a policy type selection menu for selecting the type of policy that a customer or delegated administrative user may opt to create and implement. Accordingly the policy type selection menu may include one or more different policy categories which can be selected. In this illustrative example the policy type selection menu has been set to a computing resource service provider policy which may be used to specify whether a user is to have access to one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. While the use of a computing resource service provider policy is used throughout the present disclosure for the purpose of illustration the policy type selection menu may include a notification service policy a queue service policy a logical data container policy and others.

Based at least in part on the type of policy specified using the policy type selection menu the policy generator may generate differing input options for defining the parameters or statements of the particular type of policy chosen. For instance as illustrated in if a customer or delegated administrative user selects a computing resource service provider policy from the policy type selection menu the policy generator may present a variety of options for generating a policy statement applicable to one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider.

The policy generator may allow the customer or delegated administrative user to determine the effect of the policy statement. For instance the policy generator may include an allow radio button and a deny radio button which may enable the customer to select the effect of the policy statement on a user s permissions within a service. For instance if a customer or delegated administrative user selects the allow radio button the policy generated would enable a user to access a specified service and perform one or more actions within the service. Alternatively if a customer or delegated administrative user selects the deny radio button the policy generated may deny a user access to one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider and or deny a user permission to perform one or more actions within a service.

The policy generator may additionally include a service selection menu which may enable a customer or delegated administrative user to specify which service is the target of the policy statement. For instance as illustrated in the customer has selected a database service from the service selection menu . While the use of a database service is used extensively throughout the present disclosure for the purpose of illustration the service selection menu may include a variety of other services such as an object based data storage service a virtual computer system service and others. Accordingly the policy generator may be configured to provide a list of available actions that are associated with the selected service in order for a customer or delegated administrative user to specify which one or more actions are to be included in the policy statement. This list of available actions may be compiled into an action selection menu .

Thus the policy generator may include an action selection menu which may enable a customer or delegated administrative user to specify one or more actions a particular user or group of users may or may not dependent upon the selection of the allow radio button or of the deny radio button take within the selected service. The list of actions included within the action selection menu may include a plurality of API calls or commands relevant to the selected service that when transmitted to the service may cause the service to perform these actions. Each action listed in the action selection menu may include a selection box which a customer or delegated administrative user may use to select the one or more actions that are to be part of the policy statement. Alternatively a customer or delegated administrative user may select all actions in order to encompass all actions without being required to select all selection boxes within the action selection menu .

The customer or delegated administrative user may maintain one or more resources within each service provided by the computing resource service provider that may be subject to differing levels of access and security. Accordingly the policy generator may include a resource name field which a customer or delegated administrative user may use to select a resource within the selected service that will be subject to the policy statement. For instance as illustrated in the customer or delegated administrative user has selected a user specific resource within the database service JoeB Database. Accordingly any actions selected using the action selection menu described above would apply solely to this resource within the selected service. However if the customer or delegated administrative user desires to apply the selected actions to multiple resources within the service the customer or delegated administrative user may be able to use a variety of wildcard character strings to identify multiple resources. For instance if the customer or delegated administrative user opts to apply this policy statement to all resources available within the selected service the customer or delegated administrative user may use within the resource name field to specify all resources.

Once the customer or delegated administrative user has specified all the parameters service actions and resources for the relevant policy statement the customer or delegated administrative user may opt to add additional policy statements which may apply to other services or resources. Thus the policy generator may include an add statement button which may be used to incorporate the current policy statement and allow a customer or delegated administrative user to generate an additional policy statement. Thus for this additional policy statement the customer or delegated administrative user may again select either the allow radio button or the deny radio button to define the effect of the new statement use the service selection menu to select the target service for the policy statement use the action selection menu to identify one or more actions that are to be permitted or denied for the particular user and use the resource name field to identify the target resources within the target service that will be the subject of the additional policy statement. The customer or delegated administrative user may use the add statement button to add as many policy statements are necessary to define a particular user policy.

If the customer or delegated administrative user has completed generating the necessary policy statements to define the particular user policy the customer or delegated administrative user may select the generate policy button . When the customer or delegated administrative user selects the generate policy button the policy generator may proceed to generate the user policy in accordance with the specified policy statements provided by the customer or delegated administrative user. Subsequently the policy generator may transmit one or more executable instructions to the managed directory service that when executed by the managed directory service may cause the generated policy to be applied to the particular user profile and also display the policy within the user profile interface as will be illustrated below. Additionally the policy generator may transmit one or more executable instructions to a policy management sub system within a managed directory service that when executed by the policy management sub system may cause the policy management sub system to enable the user to utilize a URI to access a computing resource service provider interface. This interface may be configured to enable the user to only utilize those services provided by the computing resource service provider that the user has been identified within a policy statement as being permissible for use. Alternatively if the customer or delegated administrative user does not desire to generate the user policy the customer or delegated administrative user may instead select the cancel button and exit the policy generator .

As noted above the generation of a new user policy by utilizing the policy generator may cause the new policy to be displayed in the user profile interface. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a user profile interface with one or more newly introduced user policies in accordance with at least one embodiment. As noted above the user policy interface may include a plurality of components namely a policies display and a policy generator button . The policies display may be configured to display one or more policies that may be applicable to the particular user whose user profile is being reviewed. Accordingly once the customer or delegated administrative user has utilized the policy generator to create and implement one or more new policy statements these new policy statements may appear on the policies display .

For instance if a policy is created utilizing the inputs illustrated in the new policy statement within the policies display may include these inputs. For instance as illustrated in the new policy statement may include the affected service provided by the computing resource service provider e.g. Database Service the applicable resources within the service e.g. JoeB Database the effect of the policy e.g. allow and the actions that the user may take within the cited resources in the service e.g. or all actions .

In addition to these policy statements the policies display may display a service identification value for the affected user. This identification value may be a temporary identification name for the user that may be used to access the service or services displayed in the policies display . For instance in this illustrative example the user may be assigned a temporary identification name for accessing the database service. Thus when the user uses the URI to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the managed directory service through a policy management sub system may access this user profile to obtain the temporary identification name of the user. Subsequently the policy management sub system may transmit this information to an identity management service in order to obtain temporary user credentials. Accordingly when the user submits a request through an interface provided by the managed directory service to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the managed directory service may use these temporary credentials to obtain user access to these services.

If the customer or delegated administrative user desires to generate a new policy statement or make changes to the currently implemented policies the customer or delegated administrative user may again utilize the policy generator button to access the policy generator and make the desired changes. The changes made to the user policies may accordingly appear in the policies display as necessary. It should be noted that in the illustrative example of the policies display includes the new policy statements generated using the policy generator and the policy statements introduced in . While the addition of policy statements through use of the policy generator is used through the present disclosure for the purpose of illustration it should be noted that the policy generator may be used to also overwrite or remove any existing policies applicable to the user.

As noted above a customer may submit one or more requests to a managed directory service to configure a directory which may be used to facilitate data sharing and or availability amongst one or more users. This may include one or more requests for establishing one or more users that may be delegated access to the directory and one or more other services provided by the computing resource service provider. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a process for defining user access to one or more computing resource services in accordance with at least one embodiment. The process may be performed by a customer or other delegated administrative user with authorization to manage the directory in the managed directory service through a policy management sub system.

As noted above a customer may be an organization that may use a directory in support of its business needs. Accordingly the customer may require that one or more other users access the directory in order to access information necessary to support a business task. Thus the customer or other delegated administrative user may receive a request to create a new user profile within the managed directory service such that the user may access the directory. The request may originate from one or more employees of the customer organization desiring to obtain access to the directory in order to perform one or more tasks. The request may also originate from an entity outside of the customer organization that may be a customer of the customer organization.

Since the received request may originate from myriad sources the customer or delegated administrative user may be required to determine whether the received request is valid. For instance the customer or delegated administrative user may evaluate the request to determine whether the request originated from an employee account within the organization and whether said employee should be granted access to the directory. Alternatively if the request originates from an outside entity the customer or delegated administrative user may evaluate whether the entity should be given access to the directory or whether the entity does not have the necessary authorization. Accordingly if the request to create a new user is not valid the customer or delegated administrative user may refuse the request.

If the request to create a new user account within the managed directory service is valid the customer or delegated administrative user may generate a new user account within the service. For instance the customer or delegated administrative user may create a new user profile for the new user and incorporate any user details into the profile to enhance the user s access to the service. Additionally the customer or delegated administrative user may utilize the managed directory service to generate a set of credentials for the user which the user may use to access the managed directory service. As will be described in greater detail below the user may use this set of credentials to additionally access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider obviating the need for additional sets of credentials.

Once the user account within the managed directory service has been created the customer or delegated administrative user may access the user profile to define one or more policies for accessing one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. As noted above in connection with the user profile interface may include a listing of all policies currently implemented and a policy generator button that may be used to access a policy generator. Through the use of the policy generator the customer or delegated administrative user may define one or more policy statements. Each policy statement may be configured to define whether a user is to have access to one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider as well as the actions and resources the user may take advantage of within these services. Alternatively the customer or delegated administrative user may utilize the policy generator to define certain restrictions on a user s access to these one or more services. Once the customer or delegated administrative user has defined the policies that are to be enforced the policies may appear within the user profile interface and may be amended at any time based on the customer s requirements.

As noted above after the customer or delegated administrative user has completed generating the one or more policy statements within the policy generator the policy generator may transmit one or more executable instructions to the policy management sub system that when executed by the policy management sub system causes the policy management sub system to incorporate the newly generated user policies. In addition to the incorporation of these policies the policy management sub system may additionally enable a user to utilize a URI to access a computing resource service provider interface to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Accordingly the customer or delegated administrative user may deliver the URI to the user in order for the user to access the services provided by the computing resource service provider.

Once the user has received the URI from the customer or delegated administrative user the user may now begin to submit one or more requests to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a process for enabling user access to one or more computing resource services in accordance with at least one embodiment. The process may be performed by the policy management sub system of the managed directory service. The policy management sub system may be configured to access one or more other components of the managed directory service namely a user profile of the user submitting the one or more requests and additionally communicate with the computing resource service provider to establish user access to the one or more services.

When the user uses the URI to access a computing resource service provider interface to further access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the policy management sub system may detect that a user has utilized the URI and may begin to verify the user request to ensure that the user has been granted access to these services. Accordingly the policy management sub system may receive a request from the user to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. As noted above the URI may be used to access an interface. Since access to the interface through a URI may be provided to a variety of customers and or delegated administrative users a number of users may have access to the URI. For instance if the URI was provided to a particular user but the user provides the URI to other entities without authorization to access these services these other entities may attempt to access these services regardless of their level of authorization.

Accordingly the policy management sub system may be configured to determine the identity of the user submitting the request to access the one or more services by utilizing the URI to access the interface. For instance in order to utilize the URI each user may be required to provide a set of credentials to access the managed directory service and from within the service utilize the URI to access the interface. Accordingly the policy management sub system may be able to identify the user submitting the request through this set of credentials.

Once the policy management sub system has determined the identity of the user submitting the request the policy management sub system may determine whether this particular user is a valid user and accordingly has been granted access to the one or more services requested. As noted above if a user provided the URI to one or more other users these other users may use the URI to attempt to access these services. However since each user of the managed directory service is required to provide a set of credentials to access the managed directory service and utilize the URI the policy management sub system may be able to determine the identity of the user utilizing the URI. If the user has not been granted access to any services provided by the computing resource service provider then the unauthorized user may not be a valid user and the policy management sub system may refuse access to these one or more services. Additionally if the user has had his her access to these one or more services revoked subsequent to enabling the user to utilize the URI to access the computing resource service provider interface the policy management sub system may evaluate the user s profile and accordingly refuse access to these services.

If the policy management sub system evaluates the user s set of credentials and determines that the user does have proper access to the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the policy management sub system may access the user s profile to identify the one or more policies that are applicable to the user. As noted above the customer or delegated administrative user may access a policy generator through a user s profile to define one or more policy statements applicable to the user. These policy statements may be used to define the parameters of a user s access to the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. After the policy statements have been generated the policies may appear within the user profile. Thus the policy management sub system may access the user s profile and extract the applicable policies for the one or more services the user has requested to access.

Once the policy management sub system has obtained the applicable policies from the user s profile the policy management sub system may transmit these policies to an identity management service provided and managed by the computing resource service provider for processing. The identity management service may be configured to apply the policies included in the user profile such that when the user accesses these one or more services the user may only perform the actions within the services according to the policies established by the customer or delegated administrative user. Additionally the policy management sub system may transmit one or more requests to the identity management service to obtain one or more temporary sets of credentials which may be used to access the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Thus when a user utilizes the interface to access the one or more services the policy management sub system may access these temporary sets of credentials and transmit these to the appropriate service provided by the computing resource service provider to establish user access to the service. It should be noted that these temporary sets of credentials may be temporary in the sense that the sets of credentials may not be accessible to the user after occurrence of a specific event. For example when a user terminates a session with a service provided by the computing resource service provider e.g. by closing a browser application the credentials may consequently become inaccessible to the user even though the credentials have yet to expire. In such instances to initiate a new session the managed directory service may be required to obtain a new temporary set of credentials to enable the user to access the service.

Once the policy management sub system has obtained the temporary sets of credentials necessary to access the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider the policy management sub system may utilize the policies applicable to the user to generate one or more redirect URI for accessing these services according to the applicable user policies. The one or more redirect URI may be used by the user to access interfaces for the one or more services the user has been granted access to as well as any resources and actions available to the user in accordance with the policies provided in the user profile.

The user may use the redirect URI for each service to perform one or more actions permissible under the policies defined for the user within the one or more services. Accordingly the policy management sub system may be configured to transmit the user request along with the temporary sets of credentials to the computing resource service provider management sub system to enable the user access to the one or more services in accordance with the policies set forth for the user. Thus the user may now access the one or more services and perform various tasks in conformity with the customer or delegated administrative user requirements.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. Servers as used herein may be implemented in various ways such as hardware devices or virtual computer systems. In some contexts servers may refer to a programming module being executed on a computer system. As used herein unless otherwise stated or clear from context the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed virtual or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware software and firmware for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling some or all of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server may provide access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content including but not limited to text graphics audio video and or other content usable to be provided to the user which may be served to the user by the web server in the form of HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML JavaScript Cascading Style Sheets CSS or another appropriate client side structured language. Content transferred to a client device may be processed by the client device to provide the content in one or more forms including but not limited to forms that are perceptible to the user audibly visually and or through other senses including touch taste and or smell. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the web server using PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP Python Ruby Perl Java HTML XML or another appropriate server side structured language in this example. It should be understood that the web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein. Further operations described herein as being performed by a single device may unless otherwise clear from context be performed collectively by multiple devices which may form a distributed and or virtual system.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases data documents dynamic data storage schemes and or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect of the present disclosure. For example the data store illustrated may include mechanisms for storing production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing log data which can be used for reporting analysis or other such purposes. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as page image information and access rights information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. The application server may provide static dynamic or a combination of static and dynamic data in response to the received instructions. Dynamic data such as data used in web logs blogs shopping applications news services and other such applications may be generated by server side structured languages as described herein or may be provided by a content management system CMS operating on or under the control of the application server. In one example a user through a device operated by the user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser. It should be noted however that embodiments of the present disclosure are not necessarily limited to the context of web pages but may be more generally applicable to processing requests in general where the requests are not necessarily requests for content.
