The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the embodiments herein may be practiced. These embodiments which are also referred to herein as examples are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments herein and it is to be understood that the embodiments may be combined or that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the embodiments herein.

In accordance with some embodiments the devices are autonomous and may not require human intervention. The devices can directly exchange social content on their own without any human intervention.

However in accordance with an embodiment as shown in the devices may not be fully autonomous and may require human intervention for certain activities. In accordance with this embodiment each device is associated with a non device or human participant . As shown the ecosystem in an exemplary embodiment includes multiple device participants and multiple non device participants each associated with a device participant . For example the device participant is associated with a non device participant device participant is associated with a non device participant the device participant is associated with a non device participant and the device participant is associated with a non device participant

In some embodiments a non device participant such as may be added to the network without it being associated with any of the device participants . For example a physician who is not associated with any specific device as a coordinator may be associated with the social networking platform and may for example function as a consultant or expert. Similarly several other non device participants may also join the network for social activity or social content exchange within the network without any association with a specific device. In embodiment the non device participants are human participants.

In an embodiment the device participants can be automated devices or non automated devices. In an embodiment the devices may not have computational capabilities and may not be able to directly communicate to a network as a mobile phone desktop tablet personal computer cell phone smart phone etc. can do. For example such types of devices can be medical devices in a healthcare environment that may not have or may partially have computation capabilities and may not be directly able to communicate to the network for information exchange. A few examples of such devices without limitations are thermometers blood sugar meters medical robots microchip implants prosthetic devices pacemakers defibrillators magnetic resonance imaging machines ultra sound machines physiologic monitors vital sign monitors electrocardiographs infusion pumps ventilators cardiac output monitors infant incubators blood gas analyzers extracorporeal therapy systems diagnostic systems radiologic and fluoroscopic systems mammography systems intra aortic balloon pumps anesthesia units dialysis units partially intelligent medical devices hubs sensors or other sensor based devices other non intelligent or partially intelligent medical devices and others without limitations.

In an embodiment the devices can be sensors that are capable of sensing an environment. In some embodiments the devices may not independently perform processing and computation tasks and may be able to be networked so as to enable them to perform processing and computations tasks by linking them with processing circuits and computational units. It must be appreciated that though a primary device may not be capable of computation it can invite smart and intelligent devices to join the network so that the secondary devices can then join the network and may function as a social network participant . Therefore the ecosystem facilitates interaction between intelligent as well as non intelligent devices and non device participants however the ecosystem includes at least one device participant that is potentially incapable of computations.

In an embodiment the social networking platform provides a facility for automation in devices networking and interconnection. In an embodiment the devices having no computation capabilities and can also be integrated and interconnected socially through the social aware network by the social networking platform .

In an embodiment the social networking platform allows the devices to voluntarily join the social network disassociate or leave from the social network extend interconnection with other like minded devices send invitations for connections to other devices accept or reject invitations from other devices view profiles of connections or other devices exchange social activity information establish social signatures for social authorization of profiles create devices groups join devices groups leave devices groups voluntarily or involuntarily upon a request by other devices and perform various other tasks meant to be performed in a socially aware cluster of entities.

The server is communicatively coupled to a social profiles manager for creating and managing individual centric profiles of the participants that are social representation of the individual participants within the socially aware network . The participants are identifiable by other participants and the social networking server through their social profiles. The device participants may be associated with device social profiles and the associated non device participants may be associated with human social profiles or non device profiles. The human profiles or non device profiles are associated with one or more device profiles. In some embodiments the social human profiles are represented as subsets of the corresponding device social profiles.

The manufacturing profile associated with a device includes information pertaining to manufacturing design and fabrication parameters of the device . This may include information such as material of the device composition of the device shape size dimensions fabrication process manufacturing limitations manufacturing defects fabrication limitations component names component design components connections design constraints strength factor of safety manufacturing date and other details relevant to the manufacturing aspects of the device

The installation profile may include details such as relevant for installation of the device for example installation location installing warranty installation company installation guidelines device s association with other proximity devices installation configurations installation settings electronic electrical or mechanical connections among the installed components safety precautions regarding installation such as installation requirements and the like.

The operation profile may include details relevant for post installation activities of the device such as its operation functioning coordination with other devices routine activities of the device and so on. The operation profile may include details such as usage guidelines for example one time usable twice usable etc. running time operating parameters operating capabilities operating limitations real time operating details historical usage fault histories operational faults operating status operating costs battery usage battery availability and the like.

The location profile includes details pertaining to location characteristics and coordinates of a device such as for example details such as where the device is located location coordinates with respect to proximate devices and location coordinates of the proximate devices and the like.

The reliability profile includes details pertaining to reliability and safety relationships and characteristics of a device such as device . The reliability relationships may associate reliability standards of the device with a purpose of use of the device . For example the device may be highly reliable or safe for one time use but may not be reliable or safe for another purpose. In an embodiment reliability and safety relationships may associate a device reliability standard with a network type. For example a high reliability highly safe device only may be allowed in one network while even a low or medium reliability device may be allowed in another network. In several embodiments the term reliability and safety relationships may define safety critical or life critical or other such parameters.

The network profile includes details pertaining to network based characteristics or relationships of a device such as the device . The network based relationships may include information such as network type network coverage and the like. The network profile may allow accommodating device relationships but only if the device observes a defined network based communication such as through a wired vs. wireless network which may be indicative of security or reliability . For example a social network of the devices may allow some devices to become a part of the network in cases where traffic is going over a wired network or secure satellite but not Wi Fi or through any other defined network.

The time profile of a device such as the device includes details pertaining to time coordinates of an action or a task performed by the device . For example the time profile may include details such as when a device is in operating state and when is in idle state when in future the device may be idle or functioning.

The security profile includes details pertaining to security characteristics of a device . The security information or details in a security profile may include security standards of the device such as how secured the device is. A device such as the device may for example be categorized as a low security device or a high security device and the like. The security profile may allow security based relationships with other devices by associating security relationships in association with a device purpose or function. For example the security based relationships may accommodate how secure a device is for a given purpose. The security profile defines parameters and relationships such as about protecting device data and about device privacy etc.

The risk social profile of a device may include individual device risk information that is indicative of how risky a device such as is for a defined operation and in a defined setting or environment. For example a recording device in a medical environment may be considered as a low risky device and a corresponding risk social profile may include the low risk details. A diagnostic device may be considered as a low to medium risk device and a corresponding risk social profile may include the low to medium risk details of the device. A therapeutic device to deliver drugs etc. to a patient may be a high risk device and corresponding social risk profile may include the high risk details of the device. In an embodiment the risk profile information may be identified and reviewed by the devices so as to identify nature of association with regards to risk prior to accepting a device invitation as a connection. For example a ventilator associated with a patient may be a high risk device and may not want to connect with a low risk device for patient safety purposes and therefore may analyze social risk profiles of the devices that send connection invitations to the ventilator or to which the ventilator sends connection requests.

In an example the individual risk social profiles that may be predefined by the devices or their coordinator or non device participants may behave differently than an aggregated social risk profile of a group containing the individual social risk profiles. For example in an embodiment the four devices as shown in may be associated with different risks as identified through their social profiles. However the aggregated risk of each device in the group containing the four devices after interconnection is same. This means that the risk of all the four devices is now changed and is same for all the devices. In an example the aggregated risk may be the risk of the highest risky device among the four devices . In an example the aggregated risk may be calculated based on computational techniques mathematical and analytical models and software algorithms etc.

In some embodiments a device such as the device may be associated with a non device participant such as the non device participant such as a human participant who may coordinate or control one or more functions of the device . For example the non device participant may stop or start the device . In an embodiment the non device participant may be an initiator of the device or task or a consumer of the device or an output associated with a task or device . The non device participant may be associated with a human social profile so that the human social profile may be a sub profile of the device social profile. The human social profile may include details pertaining to the coordinator of the device such as age sex qualification expertise credentialing affiliation and other details related to the person or the non device participant associated with the device

Therefore as discussed above in accordance with various embodiments the device profile may include the manufacturing profile installation profile operation profile network profile security profile reliability profile location profile time profile and a human social profile such that a first set of activities are performed by the device and a second set of activities are performed by the associated non device participant wherein the non device participant is identified by the device profile.

In some embodiments a human social profile may control and govern other profiles of the device . For example a person defined as a coordinator of the device may be provided privileges to modify one or more profiles of the device

In some embodiments the social networking server is programmed for a multi level profile based identification that is indicative of a device such as uniquely by other devices in the social networking ecosystem . The multi level profile based unique identification of the devices includes identification of the devices profiles including at least one non device profile that may be allowed to modify other profiles of the devices . The multi level profile based identification of the devices in the network facilitates sequential control and monitoring of a chain of tasks and interconnected devices performing the tasks by allowing the devices to initiate or respond to a social activity for social interaction among the devices and non device participants and based on target network connection identification and directing the social activity based messages accordingly to the uniquely identified target connection participants.

In an embodiment a human participant such as may be allowed to join the social networking platform upon a request by a device such as or a non device participant associated with the device . In accordance with some embodiments therefore the social networking platform may allow the devices associated non devices and other humans such as not associated with a device to join the social networking platform and execute social activities through the socially aware network . However in some embodiments it must be appreciated that the social network includes at least two devices so as to allow devices based interaction either directly among the devices or through an activity initiated by a an associated non device or any third party non device.

Referring back to the social profiles manager facilitates creating and managing individual centric profiles of the participants that are social representation of the individual participants within the socially aware network . In some embodiments the profile manager first allows creation of a base profile so that the base profile further allows creation of secondary profiles. The base profile may be a social human profile for a non device participant such as human participant associated with a device such as device participant . The secondary profiles may be created subsequently based on a set of parameters identified by the social human profile. For example once a human profile is created for the device the device may be constrained to be installed operated and managed by the non device participant in a way that fulfills the requirements identified by the social human profile of the device . The profile manager provides a social interface to facilitate the non device participant such as to interact with the device for creating the base profile and the secondary profiles. The profile manager may link the various sub profiles of the device so that each of the sub profiles such as the operation or installation or any other sub profile may be tied to a respective human social profile so that the device is identifiable by other devices through device specific or human profiles associated with the device profiles. The profile manager is further discussed hereafter.

The server further includes or is further communicatively coupled to a device or participants manager to manage participants relationships and social activity in the socially aware network . The device manager may enable social settings for allowing the devices or associated non device participants to interact over the social network . For example the device manager may allow new devices to join the network by enabling network join settings of the devices . In some embodiments the device manager may manage devices social activation and deactivation that enables or disables the devices from doing social activity or communicating through social content exchange. The device manager may further support device profiles enablement so that the device manager may allow visibility of the various social profiles of the devices based on social context or type of exchange among the devices . In some embodiments the device manager may associate one or more social profiles of a device such as with the device so that the device is identifiable by other devices or non devices. In some embodiments the device manager may be authorized to hide certain device profiles based on other socially active device contexts. For example the device manager may not allow visibility of a human social profile to a connection device and thus may hide the human social profile. In some embodiments the device manager may allow interaction of the devices with the social networking server . The device manager may further allow communicating through various network channels such as a multi level networking channel mechanism as will be discussed later. In some embodiments the device manager may control device social settings. In some embodiments the device manager may control non social settings such as including device operating characteristics so that the device manager may include social platform and an operating platform wherein the operating platform controls non social settings and the social platform controls social settings. In some embodiments the social settings may be dependent on operating characteristics and vice versa. For example the social platform of the device manager may communicate social content when a social activity is triggered with a connection device upon identification of a status change in the device operating characteristics. For example an operating platform of a heart beat monitor may receive operating information pertinent to an abnormal heart rhythm and notify the social platform of the device to execute a social activity initiated by the device with a connection ventilator so as to initiate artificial ventilation by the connection ventilator. The social and the operating platforms may be interdependent and enabled to coordinate with the social networking server such that the device settings may be communicated to the network server .

The server further includes a social networking application that includes a cluster of social applications each for providing a specific social facility to facilitate social activity among the device participants through the socially aware network .

In some embodiments the social networking application may include a web sharing facility for allowing information exchange among the participants through a web based interface. In some embodiments the social networking application may include a social profiles facility for allowing the participants to create respective social profiles. In some embodiments the social application may include a notification facility for facilitating exchange of invitation notifications for extending a participant s social space. In some embodiments the social networking application may include a recommendation facility for sharing recommendations for a device such as based on noticed past behavior of the device by a connection device. In some embodiments the social networking application may include a prediction analytics engine for determining participants future behavior based on historical social data about the participants . The prediction analytics engine generates information about what a device such as can do and how it can behave in future. In some embodiments the social application may include a social groups facility for creating a social group dedicated for the participants and exhibiting a defined behavior or belonging to a defined class. In some embodiments the social application may include a messaging facility for sharing social content from a participant to another connection participant. In various embodiments the messages can be either instant messages or emails or other types of messages. In some embodiments the social networking application may include an information security facility for encrypting and decrypting social content during exchange among the participants .

In an example the device manager may include or may be coupled to a risk manager for computing the aggregated risk based on the individual risks of the individual devices such as the devices . In an example the risk manager may further analyze and predict risk patterns in association with device contexts or environments or device groups. The risk manager is adapted to retrieve the social profile information corresponding to the individual devices to determine a risk profile of the entire group and identify risk patterns of the entire group. The risk profile and risk patterns are indicative of how safe and reliable it is for a device to join the group for social information exchange or social activity or in a particular network or environment for operation. The risk manager may provide safety interlocks risk management capability and risk documentation capability. The risk documentation capability may provide a facility for the devices to update their social risk profiles based on their networking and interconnection with a group of devices having different risks. The risk documentation may be performed in the social profiles so that the updated risk may be indicated and contained within the social profiles of the devices.

In some embodiments each of the social profiles associated with a device such as may define a social relationship so that two or more interacting devices are associated with a layered social relationship including a plurality of social profile dependent relationships with each relationship associated with a priority setting indicative of criticality of nature of relationship over other relationships.

A device such as the device can maintain specific and defined relationships with other devices. The relationships may comprise any type of relationship that may exist between such as two of the devices. For example the device and the device may be like minded for example both may be medical devices or more specifically both may be pacemakers from the same make the devices and may have similar profiles the devices and may be parts of a single operational procedural sequence the devices and may be used by the same person such as a patient as identified by a patient identifier associated with the devices and

In embodiments the relationship manager can track or monitor the relationships among the devices . The relationship manager can maintain the information regarding relationships in the form of a social map in some embodiments. The social map is discussed later in detail.

The information pertaining to the relationships among the devices networked through the social networking server is stored in the relationships information storage module . In an embodiment the social relationships map can be stored in the relationships information storage module . The relationships information storage module stores information pertaining to the social profiles in association with the social relationships and the priority settings associated with each relationship. The relationships information storage module may for example store information pertaining to the manufacturing relationships installation relationships operation relationships security relationships reliability relationships network relationships time relationships location relationships and the like.

The relationships information storage module may include a memory circuit configured to store the information related to the devices relationships as discussed above.

The server may further be coupled to or may include the social profiles manager for creating and managing individual centric profiles of the participants that are social representation of the individual participants within the socially aware network . The participants are identifiable by other participants and the social networking server through their social profiles. The social profiles manager includes a profile generation engine a profile storage module a profile updating module a profile aggregator and a profiles federation engine .

The profiles generation engine facilitates creation of the social profiles of the devices . The profiles generation engine provides an interface for allowing a non device participant such as to join a device with the social networking platform by providing relevant necessary details related to the device and the non device participant so as to initiate a social subscription through the social networking platform for the devices . The profile generation process may require the non device participant to provide at least minimum details necessary for the social profile subscription with the social networking platform . In some embodiments the profile generation engine necessitates the creation of human social profile by the non device participant associated with the device and the remaining device profiles are automatically generated by uploading device manuals and documents with the networking server . In various embodiments the social profiles generation engine may include sub modules for generating specific device profiles associated with the device . For example a manufacturing profile component may provide an interface for creating a manufacturing profile of the device including manufacturing parameters associated with the device .

In an embodiment the devices can associate them with the SNP or server by creating an initial profile as discussed above so that the devices are a part of the SNP . The devices that are interconnected together through the SNP can share the social content by initiating a social activity and are referred to as social connections. For example if a pacemaker P1 connects to another pacemaker P2 and a ventilator V the pacemaker P1 is said to include two connections pacemaker P2 and ventilator V. Once the pacemaker P1 is connected to its two connections it is free to share information with them and also to receive information from them upon initiation of a social activity by them. In an example with reference to illustrates an implantable medical device IMD such as a pacemaker fitted inside a body of a patient . The pacemaker is connected to an external controller which can be configured as the external controller or that can be configured to communicate remotely to the communication channel of the SNP as discussed in conjunction with above. The IMD IMD can be any of the devices can connect and share the information to another device such as that is a member of the SNP . The IMD can include components such as various sensors that can record data and or monitor the performance of the IMD and communicate it to the external controller which can then transmit it to the server and to another connection device such as . In an embodiment the data thus shared can be publicly announced and displayed over the profile of the IMD . In another embodiment the data can be shared only to respective connections of the IMD only.

It should be appreciated that illustrates an example of the IMD as a medical device. In a similar manner several other types of devices can also communicate among themselves through the SNP or server . In an embodiment the devices can include various types of sensors and other monitoring devices. The sensors and the monitoring devices can collect and retrieve relevant information stored initially with the devices or recorded over a period of performance. The retrieved information can be stored within a memory space of a device such as . The devices can manipulate the information that belongs to them such that they can share it to the connections view it as and when they like or need retrieve it as a historical data for analysis display it publicly on the SNP website hide it from viewing by others hide it from viewing by others except connections populate the profile data and so on.

In an embodiment the device can connect with the SNP and announce itself privately or publicly. Once connected the device profile can be publicly or privately viewable by other devices or selected devices that are members of the SNP . In an embodiment a device can connect with another device with whom the device is interested to work with. For example if the IMD wants to work with some other like minded device such as a defibrillator the IMD can send a request for connection and can connect once the request is accepted. In an embodiment the sending and accepting of requests can be manually intervened or controlled by a user such as the patient or his doctor who may or may not be an SNP participant. In another embodiment the sending and accepting of requests can be automatically processed. For this specific programming can be performed within the external programmer of the IMD . For example the external programmer can be programmed to send invitations to a like minded device as it connects over the SNP . The programmer stores relevant data and instructions and issues commands.

In an embodiment the medical device such as the IMD can include a RFID chip not shown that is configured to store information relevant to the IMD . The information can be read by a reader that can be integrated within the external controller or programmer or in any other external device. As and when any information is transmitted from the IMD to the SNP or social networking server the reader decodes the RFID tag within the IMD and associates the data with the relevant information. Therefore the server can automatically identify the IMD and can grant permission to the profile of the IMD . Subsequently the process of information sharing can occur automatically. Similarly several other devices can be associated with their pertinent information data and metadata and can accordingly be updated. In several other embodiments various other communication mechanisms may be employed for exchange of social content and or sharing of social invitations.

In an embodiment the device such as IMD can find like minded devices for extending a social network based on parameters such as profiles of a community of the devices using it for example a web based data processing system that can be directly through wire or wirelessly or remotely connected to the device . The data processing system can be integrated within or communicatively coupled with the external programmer and can interface remotely to the SNP or server . The data processing system can perform functions such as query a database of profiles of the devices such as of a community of the devices . The query can include information pertinent to a device such as device and could include without limitations the name of the device identifier of the device type of the device medical conditions treated by the device therapies delivered by the device patient identifier associated with the device life style factors associated with a patient associated with the device environmental factors contextual factors historical records stored in the device and so on. Upon searching the device can perform various functions such as view the matching profiles connect with them post messages for them like or dislike their posts use their data upon request share information with them and perform further queries or refine the queries or share other social content.

In an embodiment the data processing system as discussed above can work in a completely automated manner along with the devices with the use of various technologies implemented thereon such as RFID bar code identification wireless and wired mode of information sharing sensor based actions and reactions BAN and so on without limitations. This can be achieved without any manual intervention. In another embodiment a limited or complete manual intervention may be involved. For example the devices can be associated with their patients or physicians or other responsible persons and they can operate and control the devices interactivity with the server .

At step the method may include maintaining profiles relationships among the devices within the socially aware network . The relationships may be of several types as already discussed above in conjunction with various figures. The social relationships may be maintained in the form of a social map as will be discussed later.

In an embodiment the methods above are performed in the network of devices that include at least one device with partially incapable computation capabilities. The device with partially incapable computation capabilities is connected with an external controller through the first communication channel so that a communication point of the first channel is adapted to receive social content in real time from the device. The second channel allows information sharing between the external controller and the social networking server .

In some embodiments at least some of the devices interconnected through the social networking server for social content exchange are associated with patients wherein the medical devices associated with the patients monitor vital signs of patients or perform defined functions for health management. Exemplary medical devices without limitations have been discussed above.

The method may comprise facilitating a web based activity among the plurality of devices for sharing the social content. The method may comprise storing information pertaining to an associated relationship of a device with other devices. The method may comprise facilitating the recommendation of a connection device by another device based on noticed past behavior of the connection device by the other device. The method may comprise encrypting and decrypting the social content during exchange of the social content among the devices . The method may comprise federating the profile into a respective installation social profile manufacturing social profile operation social profile schedules social profile network social profile security social profile reliability social profile human social profile time social profile and the location social profile.

At step the method includes creating a device centric social profile for each of the plurality of devices . The profile is a social representation of a respective device such as within the socially aware network and the device such as device is identifiable by other devices and the social networking server through the profile. At step the method includes sending a connection invitation by a first device to a second device through the multi communication channel including the first Near Field Communication NFC channel and the socially aware network . The step of sending of the invitation includes sending of the invitation from the first device to the external controller associated with the first device through the first NFC channel transferring the invitation from the external controller to the network point of the socially aware network and transferring of the invitation from the network point through the socially aware network to the device . At step the method may include accepting or rejecting the connection invitation by the second device upon receipt of the invitation by the second device . At step the method may include maintaining a profiles relationship of the first device and the second device based on acceptance or rejection of the connection invitation by the second device

At step the method includes allowing the exchange of social content through a social activity between the first device and the second device based on the maintained profile relationships. The social activity includes a series of social tasks including one or more of devices to voluntarily join the social network disassociate or leave from the social network extend interconnection with other like minded devices send invitations for connections to other devices accept or reject invitations from other devices view profiles of other devices exchange social activity information establish social signatures for social authorization of profiles create devices social groups join devices groups and leave devices groups voluntarily or upon initiation of an activity by a participant and the like without limitations.

The social networking server provides a social networking service to the plurality of devices so that each of the plurality of devices are connected to the social networking service by associating the respective social profiles with the social networking server . The respective social profiles are social representation of the devices . The social networking server is programmed to allow the devices to coordinate for a synchronous social times based functioning. The server is programmed to associate connection type social device relationships between the devices . The connection type social relationship is established after at least two devices accept one another as trustworthy connections after reviewing the social profiles. The trustworthiness may be defined based on factors such as like mindedness of the devices related functioning completeness of tasks and the like. The server may for example be programmed to provide a facility or an interface to the first device for allowing the first device to send a connection invitation request to the second device . Once the invitation request is accepted by the second device the first device and the second device can form a part of the interactive chain of the devices and tasks through wherein the server may be programmed to provide a facility to the first device and the second device to allow them to coordinate with one another through a social activity processed by the server .

The server is programmed to receive the social content from the first device once the first device has established the connection type relationship with another device such as the second device . The social content may include several instructions for the second device . For example in an embodiment the social content may include an instruction for the second device to cause a synchronous and non conflicting performance between the first device and the second device . The synchronous and non conflicting performance is discussed below in detail with examples of the four devices shown in in a medical environment. However it should be appreciated that several other devices may also be included in the interactive chain from medical environments or other environments such as avionics power automotive and the like. The devices can be located within a single environment or distributed in several environments.

The first second third and fourth tasks through indicate elements of a complete treatment function that a patient is operated with. The first task and the second task are performed simultaneously for the first 10 minutes for a patient with defined characteristics. The first task then stops and the third task begins which continues along with the second task for another 10 minutes after which the second task stops. The third task still continues for another 15 minutes unless the patient body shows undesirable physiological indications. If the physiological parameters sensed are not satisfactory then the fourth task begins along with the third task . In view of the various tasks required to be performed in a defined sequence and for defined time periods based on the patient s physiological characteristics the various devices from those shown are made to function. For example in accordance with the above sequence the first device and the second device operate for the first ten minutes simultaneously. The first device then stops and the third device starts functioning. The second device and the third device operate in parallel for another 10 minutes. The second device then stops and the third device still operates for another 15 minutes unless the patient s body shows undesirable physiological parameters. If the physiological parameters sensed are not satisfactory then the fourth device starts functioning along with the third device

In accordance with the synchronous functioning of the four devices the first device may first need to locate the other three devices within the socially aware network . The server may be programmed to allow the devices to create their social profiles and subscribe with the social networking platform for social activity. The first device with the first social profile may be programmed by a coordinator to function in a defined manner for a defined patient to perform a set of first tasks and a set of second tasks in a defined sequence avoiding certain conflicts. The set of first tasks are primary tasks that are performed by the first device itself. The set of second tasks are required to be performed by other devices. Based on the programmed instructions the first device identifies that the second third and fourth tasks are to be performed by other devices. The first device may be programmed with device characteristics and specifications that can perform the respective second third and fourth tasks . The server is programmed to allow the first device to initiate a search request as soon as the first device is connected with the social networking server for social profiles that indicate similar capabilities of devices as the device programmed instructions include for the devices to perform the second third and fourth tasks . The first device shares the social content that includes a social description of the devices required to link with the first device to perform a set of tasks for coordinated operation. The server is programmed to receive the social content and perform a search within the socially aware network to locate social profiles that are fit to coordinate with the first device . The server may identify several profiles and share the profiles with the first device . Alternatively the server may shortlist the profiles and share the three profiles corresponding to the second third and fourth devices and only with the first device . In the first case a manual intervention may be needed by a device coordinator to shortlist the best profiles. Alternatively the device may also be programmed to shortlist the necessary profiles.

The server is programmed to facilitate the first device to initiate a social activity with the second third and fourth devices and . The social activity begins by sending a social message from the first device to the other three devices and that include a social connection invitation request. The server receives the social content that is indicative of the social connection request with the second third and fourth devices and . In an example the request may be sent separately to the three devices and . In another example a unified social invitation request may be broadcasted in a single social message to the three devices and . The server may be programmed to notify the three devices and of the social message or content from the first device . The social content may also display a social profile of the first device so that the three devices and may identify and decide whether the devices and are capable and available enough to support the first device in performing the patient treatment tasks synchronously and in a non conflicting manner as desired by the first device . The server may further be programmed to allow the three devices and to accept or reject the invitation based on the availability and capability of the three devices and to support the first device in performing the patient treatment tasks as defined by the first device in the invitation request. In an embodiment the invitation request may not include the information pertinent to the social tasks and the patient treatment tasks. In such cases the accepting or rejecting of the invitation may simply depend on whether the devices and want to accept or reject the invitation based on the programmed guidelines of the devices and such as like mindedness historical contextual behavior of the social interaction and the like. In an example a human intervention may be needed to accept or reject the invitation. The server may be programmed to provide a user interface to the three devices and to allow a coordinator to view the information contained in the social invitation request and also allow the coordinator to accept or reject the invitation. The server may be programmed to personalize the user interface contextually based on the nature of device . The server may include a personalization engine which may implement a set of executable specifications to personalize the interface for the type of device using social profiles information of the device . The server may also store a list of graphic tools a set of keywords a medical dictionary a medical database tables charts histograms etc that can be used repeatedly in context of the devices social profiles to execute the specifications for personalizing the interface. For example the interface for a heart beat monitor may be different from an interface for a ventilator or a pacemaker or drug delivery setup and the like.

If one or more of the devices and reject the invitations the first device may reinitiate a search request and send invitations to other devices if available in the network or else will notify an operator about no device being available.

If the devices and accept the notification the three devices and become connections of the first device . The server is programmed to update the social profile of the first device to include the second third and fourth devices and as connections in the updated social profile. An application component enabled by the server similar to the application component discussed above may create a user interface or modify the social profile user interface of the first device as a coordinator of the first device to view a connection screen section on the user interface wherein the connection screen section indicates a list of connections the three devices and of the first device and also list titles of the connection generated based on their social profiles. The server may be programmed to allow the coordinator to personalize the connection screen section of the first device to view from a set of available fields on the user interface such as title field device name device capabilities device state idle busy do not disturb away etc. and the like. For example the away state may indicate that the device is not available and is out for maintenance idle state may be indicative of the device to be available to support a device in a chain of patient treatment tasks busy state may be indicative of the device to be already busy in performing a treatment task for a patient and the like.

The server is programmed to allow the first device to initiate a social activity by sending social content for requesting the other three devices and to interact with the first device to perform the patient treatment task as is discussed above as an example. The first device sends out the social content to each of the three devices and indicative of the details of the respective tasks to be performed by the three devices and . For example the social content for the second device may be indicative of the action or task performed by the first device and an instruction to the second device to perform an action in association with action timelines wherein the action timelines are indicative of time points associated with the action and define time when actual action should occur at the second device . The server is programmed to receive the social content indicative of the social action performed by the first device and the instruction to the second device to perform the action in association with action timelines wherein the action timelines are indicative of time points associated with the action and define time when actual action should occur at the second device . The server is programmed to notify the second device of the social content received from the first device that includes the instruction to the second device to perform the action in association with the action timelines. Similarly the server receives social content to be notified to the third and the fourth devices and . The second third and fourth devices and upon receipt of the instruction sends a confirmation request to the first device to guarantee performance of their respective actions at the defined timelines. In an example prior to sending the social content to the devices the first device or the associated coordinator may view the status of the devices and so that the first device may identify which device is available and idle at a time indicated by the social timelines. This increases the probability of the devices and to be available and confirm for their actions performance at the social timelines.

In an example the devices are associated with respective external controllers similar to that allow interconnection of the devices with the social networking server to allow social activity through the social networking service.

As discussed above in an example the server is further programmed to provide a facility to the first device to allow the first device to initiate a search request for like minded devices based on information contained in the social profile of the first device and current operating characteristics of the first device . The server may be programmed to search for the like minded devices from the plurality of devices and provide a list of the like minded devices including their social profiles and network links for the like minded devices so as to allow the first device to send a connection request to one or more of the searched like minded devices. The one or more devices are shortlisted by an external controller such as in association with information stored in the external controller and the current operating characteristics of the first device or through an intervention of a social human coordinator of the device as identified by the device social profile.

In an example each of the plurality of devices are connected to a sensing and monitoring unit for monitoring and recording device activities for social exchange through the social activity.

In an example the social activities includes posting a connection request for the second third or fourth devices for associating a relationship with the three devices and cause a synchronous and non conflicting performance between the first device and the other three devices . The social activities can include accepting or rejecting a connection invitation by the devices in response to a request sent by the first device for associating a relationship with the three devices toward a synchronous and non conflicting performance between the first device and the other devices 

The social networking server also includes or is coupled to a social map generator . The social map generator generates the social graph among the interactive chain of the tasks and the devices based on connection relationships among the plurality of devices wherein the social map includes a set of nodes that are representative of devices and a set of edges connecting the nodes that are representative of relationships between the connected devices . An edge length may represent proximity between the devices .

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment the social networking server also simply referred to as server interchangeably throughout the document includes or is coupled to a processing unit configured to execute the programmed instructions of the server . The processing unit further processes the social graph for a device to identify proximity of the interconnected devices .

In an embodiment the server may be coupled to the social device manager . The social device manager includes a relationship manager of for associating a relationship of the first device with the other devices after the second third and the fourth devices and accept the connection invitations sent out by the first device . The relationships may indicate association of the one or more devices and with the first device in several forms such as a manufacturing relationship installation relationship operation relationship network relationship security relationship reliability relationship schedules relationship location relationship time relationship and the like. The relationships may be established by the server to avoid conflict during coordinated functioning of the devices . For example if the first device does not support a low reliability device for a patient in a defined physiological state because of age and criticality parameters of the patient the third device that may be a low reliability device may not be used for the defined patient. However the device may still be interconnected with the first device for another patient treatment function for a younger patient where the low reliability is not such an issue. Such types of relationships are established to facilitate the server to allow interconnection for a patient treatment process or function involving a chain of devices and tasks elements.

The established relationships are stored in the relationships information storage module communicatively connected with the server . The storage module may include a memory circuit. The server may be communicatively coupled to the social profiles manager . The social profiles manager has been discussed earlier.

In an example the devices may be programmed to function in accordance with the programmed instructions of the server to facilitate social information or content exchange through social activities facilitated by the server . The first device is associated with a sensing and monitoring unit for monitoring and recording device activities for social exchange through the social activity. Similarly other devices may also be associated with monitoring and sensing units. The sensing unit detects a change in performance state of the device and generates an input signal. The first device further includes a database to store operation and performance parameters of the first device in association with coordination and conflicting data with connection devices of the first device . For example the database of the first device may include the chain of tasks and devices involved in a patient treatment process in association with specific social timelines. The database also stores operation and performance characteristics and parameters of the first device . The external controller associated with the first device processes the generated input signal and correlates the detected signal with information stored in the database and generates a second signal. The second signal includes the social content and is indicative of the action performed by the first device at specific timelines and instructions for the second third and fourth devices and to perform specific functions at defined social timelines to facilitate the coordinated functioning of the devices to complete the patient treatment process.

In an example the devices are associated with a switch matrix that causes the devices to change their operating state based on the social content requesting a change in the operating state at specific social timelines.

In an embodiment each of the devices includes or is coupled to a health monitoring unit that monitors health parameters of the respective devices and compares with threshold health parameters of the devices to ascertain health status of the devices . The health monitoring unit generates a signal indicative of the health status below the threshold limit when the ascertained health status is indicative of a health below a threshold limit. The server allows the devices to initiate social activities that include communicating the health status to a set of connection devices so the connection devices switches to tasks performed by the devices in case of a health failure of the devices . In an example the health parameters of the devices are identified by monitoring a set of patient s physiological parameters that are controlled by the devices wherein a drop in desired physiological state of the patient is indicative of a health failure of the devices that operate on the patient.

In some embodiments the social activities include posting a search request for identification and receiving profile information of an adjacent device in the sequential and synchronous operation in response to the search request by a device wherein upon receipt of the profile information the device sends a connection request to the adjacent device. In an example the adjacent device may be identified by the processing unit with the use of the social map. In some embodiments the social activities include posting a search request for identification and receiving profile information of related devices in response to the search request by a device wherein upon receipt of the profile information the device sends a connection request to one or more of the related devices. In examples each action performed by a device connected through the social networking server is associated with a social action timeline indicative of when particular actions occur at devices wherein the social action timelines are communicated to respective connection devices for integrating devices synchronous actions. In an example the information pertinent to the social action timelines associated with actions to occur at the devices may be stored in the devices social profiles.

In an example the social map may be used for adverse event analysis when devices misbehave exception reporting when devices need to report exceptions utilization analysis to determine which devices have been used so that they can be charged reimbursed for and similar reporting activities without limitations.

The method may further include generating the social map indicative of devices and profile relationships among the devices . The method may further include storing the social map by the social networking server so as to retrieve information from the social map to generate social proximity data social status data and use the social proximity and social status data to define precedence for the chain of tasks associated with the devices for synchronous and coordinated functioning through the social networking platform . For example based on the information extracted from the social map the server may be programmed to identify which devices are proximately located and which devices are remotely located relatively and also associate this information with location of a patient capability of devices such as remotely accessible or not patient requirement such as emergency or delayed service needed by the patient and the like and accordingly decide the order or sequence of various tasks to complete a patient treatment procedure involving the several devices.

The social networking server provides a social networking health service to the plurality of devices so that each of the plurality of devices are connected to the social networking health service by associating the respective social profiles with the social networking server . The respective social profiles are social representation of the devices . The social profiles include various profiles as discussed earlier. In addition the social profile discussed herein also includes a social health profile and a specification profile. The social health profile is indicative of health disciplines and instantaneous health characteristics of a device which are updated in real time. The specification profile is indicative of health standards which are defined for specific devices based on information contained in other profiles such as installation profile operation profile manufacturing profile and the like. The specification profile identifies guidelines manuals and standard operating characteristics of the device . While the specification profile represents standard procedures and characteristics of the device the health profile represents current characteristics of the device which may or may not be similar to the specification profile.

The social networking server provides the social networking based health service to the plurality of devices and allows them to perform the series of social health tasks by exchange of social content in the socially aware network . The social networking server is programmed to create and manage the individual centric profiles of the devices that are social representation of the individual devices within the socially aware network . The devices are identifiable by other devices and the social networking server through their social profiles. The social profiles of each device includes the health profile indicative of health disciplines corresponding to the device and specification profile that includes details corresponding to predefined working parameters of the device . The server is further programmed to associate device social relationships in the socially aware network . Several types of relationships may exist based on various device characteristics and parameters which have been discussed earlier. In some examples for the various embodiments herein the relationships may include connection relationships wherein the connection relationships are indicative of the type of association between two or more devices in the network . The association may identify whether the two or more devices are mutual connections or not. The server is programmed to receive updates pertaining to health profile and specification profile of a device such as through a social activity involving social content exchange between the device and the server . The updates may be received when there is any change in the health or specification parameters of the device . In some examples the device may be provided to be used for a limited number of times or may be required to be disposed after merely a single use. In such cases the specification parameters changes and the specification profile is updated after every use to indicate the current specification of the device . The health parameters may not always remain the same. For example the health parameters may not remain the same for a long time and the performance of the device that is indicative of health status may change over time. This results in a change in the health profile of the device . As long as the health profile conforms to the requirements as defined by the specification profile the device may be considered healthy. On the contrary if the health profile is indicative of health disciplines deviating from the specifications as mentioned in the specification profile the device may be considered as faulty. The server may be programmed to associate a relationship between the specification profile of the device and its health profile wherein a mismatch between one or more parameters of the health profile and the specification profile represents a fault in the device . The server may further be programmed to identify a connection device to alternatively perform a function of the faulty device such that the connection device is in an idle state for a time period during which the connection device is required to alternatively perform the function.

The social networking server further comprises the social networking application including a cluster of social applications each for providing a specific health facility to contribute health related social activity among the devices through the socially aware network . In an example at least one of the plurality of devices is incapable of computation capabilities at least partially. The device may be connected with an external controller such as through the Near Field Communication NFC channel so that the communication point of the NFC channel receives the social content from the device and transfers the social content to the external controller . The socially aware network then allows health information sharing between the external controller and the social networking server in real time.

The device is coupled to an intelligent health monitoring unit for monitoring health profile or specification profile updates. The device is communicatively coupled to the database for storing the health profile and the specification profile and information pertinent to various updates corresponding to the specification profile and the health profile. The health profile and the specification profile and the updates are shared by the health monitoring unit through the social activity involving social content exchange between the health monitoring unit and the social networking server . The monitoring unit is further coupled to a health processing unit for processing the health profile and the specification profile information to identify if the device is faulty or not.

The health monitoring unit is integrally included within each of the plurality of devices so that the devices are capable of detecting a fault by comparing respective health and the specification profiles themselves with the use of the processing unit . The social activity from the devices involves a request to a set of connection devices to alternatively contribute in performing a function healthily when the connection devices are in idle state and when the device is faulty. The social activity can involve sending out a connection invitation to the social networking server for identification and searching of specific devices profiles. The social networking server is coupled to a search interface implementing a search algorithm for identifying and short listing the defined profiles. The shortlisted profiles are submitted to the device so that the device further performs a second social activity to send out connection requests to each of the shortlisted devices for extending the social network . By performing the second social activity the device may for example request its connection device to perform a task on its behalf for a time the device is in faulty state.

In some embodiments the device uses a second device from among the shortlisted profiles as a health monitoring unit based on proximity and similarity in operation of the second device with respect to the device so that in case of a fault with or failure of the device the second device performs functions of the device voluntarily or upon a social activity initiated by the device and directed to the second device . The second device may employ sensing units for monitoring environment of the first device so as to ensure proper functioning of the first device failing which the second device may responsibly begin tasks performed by the first device as a patient treatment procedure.

The devices and and the respective tasks form part of a first chain of tasks and devices sequenced to perform a first treatment procedure for a first patient in a defined structured and sequenced manner. The device and and the respective tasks form part of a second chain of tasks and devices sequenced to perform a second treatment procedure for a second patient in a defined structured and sequenced manner. However based on mutual relationships and connections the devices in the first chain and the second chain may interact through a social activity facilitated by the programmed server .

In some embodiments as shown in with reference to the devices and are mutual connections. As a result the devices and can mutually share social content by initiating a social activity through the server . For example the device may request the device to perform task in case the device is faulty as the device is capable to perform the task which the device is required to perform in the treatment procedure for the first patient. Consequently the chain of tasks and devices alters once the device accepts the request of the device and confirms to perform the task . As shown the treatment procedure now involves different devices bypassing the faulty device . The new chain of task and devices for the treatment procedure for the first patient are device and task device and task device and task and finally device and task . On the other hand the second chain of devices and tasks for the treatment procedure of the second patient involves the devices and task device and task device and task with no involvement of the device . This may be possible only when the device and task are not required in the second chain of devices and tasks at least for the time the first chain bypasses the device or the treatment procedure 1 is more critical than and holds priority over the second treatment procedure. Therefore prior to cross interconnecting between different chains the device determine whether the device is in idle state for the time the device is bypassed or may request a non device coordinator to intervene for deciding a priority chain and priority treatment procedure and accordingly switch the device to the first chain or let it continue to perform the task 2 in the second chain of the devices for delivering the second treatment procedure.

In some examples the method may also include informing the device about the connection device that can perform the function in case of faults with the device wherein the information includes a social profile of the connection device. The method may include sending out a request by the device to the connection device for alternatively performing the faulty function of the device . The method may also include sending out a remote message by the device to the connection device through a social activity initiated by the device wherein the remote message automatically triggers the connection device to perform the alternative function at a specified social event timeline occurrence. The method may include sending out an auto correction message to the device by the health monitoring device or the second device to trigger a fault management operation for rectifying the fault of device.

In practice however all the tasks may not occur at the defined timelines. For example actual time of performance of the task is event occurrence time 1 actual time of performance of task is event occurrence time 2 actual time of performance of task is event occurrence time 3 and actual time of performance of task is actual event occurrence time 4. The actual event occurrence times may or may not match the defined social timelines. In case there is any difference between the actual event occurrence times and defined social timelines beyond a threshold a fault may be identified and accordingly the devices may communicate one another through the social networking server . The devices may also loop in alternative devices for performance of the faulty tasks by requesting the social networking server for identifying social connections who may perform the faulty tasks.

The system includes a processing unit circuit a social event timeline recorder social event timeline monitoring unit fault detector and a communication circuit . The social event timeline recorder stores information pertinent to when an event should occur at the first device wherein the event should occur at the defined social timeline 1. The social event timeline monitoring unit monitors event occurrence time for the social event. The fault detector compares the social event timeline with the event occurrence time for the event. A gap between the social event timeline and the event occurrence time beyond a threshold limit is indicative of a fault. The events at the first device and at the second device are interdependent. The communication circuit allows sharing of a social content indicative of the fault and a predicted modified event occurrence time at the first device to the social networking server through a two way communication channel including the near field communication channel and the socially aware network channel . The social networking server sends the social content to the second device . The first device and the second device are connections and parts of same chain of integrated tasks. The processing unit may process output from the social event timeline recorder social event timeline monitoring unit and fault detector and generate a signal indicative of the predicted modified event occurrence time. The defined social timelines of other devices may accordingly be calculated and updated based on updates in the occurrence times of the event at the device . In an embodiment the processing unit social event timeline recorder social event timeline monitoring unit and the fault detector may be integrated within the health processing unit and health monitoring unit of for purposes of health management of the devices with the use of the social networking server and the social networking platform .

The event at the first device and the event at the second device are interdependent. The method further comprises sharing the social content indicative of the fault and the predicted modified event occurrence time at the first device to the social networking server through the two way communication channel.
