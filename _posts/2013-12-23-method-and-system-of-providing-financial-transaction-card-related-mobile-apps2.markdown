The present disclosure relates to a system and method of making financial transaction card related mobile applications that are stored on a cloud based computing device accessible to a user s computing device.

There presently exists an application store in which users can access a variety of applications and then download the applications on their mobile device. However there does not appear to be any existing appropriate level of services in the market that fully enable a user to access trusted financial transaction card related mobile applications that are stored on a cloud based computing device.

The present disclosure provides a system and method for providing financial transaction card related mobile applications that are stored on a cloud based computing device to a user s device. In some embodiments as the user can access the mobile applications on the cloud based computing device downloading the complete applications to a user s device is not always required but rather a user interface UI and communication protocol module can be downloaded so that significant processing can take place on potentially more powerful and or potentially more secure computing devices in the cloud. The speed at which the applications can be maintained updated and accessed can be increased in these embodiments. Further the thinner UI and communications protocol applications will generally not occupy as much limited storage space on the user s device as would occur if more data processing occurs on the mobile device. In addition because a portion of the functionality of applications is hosted at least in part on the cloud based computing device they can be easily accessible without regard to the format device operating system used by the user.

Also because the application service may be operated by the issuer of a payment card of a user account card information can be used securely e.g. through private or otherwise secure networks without the need for this information to be stored or reside on the user s device or input by the user or be transferred across a network where it might be vulnerable. This allows for services and utilities to be offered to consumers by an issuer where they were not available before and also allows for additional security and convenience to consumers who feel safer dealing with entities they trust with their information e.g. their card issuer rather than third party application developers depending on the specific implementation.
