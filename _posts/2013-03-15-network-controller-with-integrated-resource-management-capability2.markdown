The present disclosure relates generally to cloud computing and more particularly to a network management.

Cloud computing services can provide computational capacity data access networking routing and storage services via a large pool of shared resources operated by a cloud computing provider. Because the computing resources are delivered over a network cloud computing is location independent computing with resources being provided to end users on demand with control of the physical resources separated from control of the computing resources.

Originally the term cloud came from a diagram that contained a cloud like shape to contain the services that afforded computing power that was harnessed to get work done. Much like the electrical power we receive each day cloud computing is a model for enabling access to a shared collection of computing resources networks for transfer servers for storage and applications or services for completing work. More specifically the term cloud computing describes a consumption and delivery model for IT services based on the Internet and it typically involves over the Internet provisioning of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. This frequently takes the form of web based tools or applications that a user can access and use through a web browser as if it were a program installed locally on the user s own computer. Details are abstracted from consumers who no longer have need for expertise in or control over the technology infrastructure in the cloud that supports them. Cloud computing infrastructures may consist of services delivered through common centers and built on servers. Clouds may appear as single points of access for consumers computing needs and may not require end user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the system that delivers the services.

The cloud computing utility model is useful because many of the computers in place in data centers today are underutilized in computing power and networking bandwidth. A user may briefly need a large amount of computing capacity to complete a computation for example but may not need the computing power once the computation is done. The cloud computing utility model provides computing resources on an on demand basis with the flexibility to bring the resources up or down through automation or with little intervention.

It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of the present disclosure. Some embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. Specific examples of components modules and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are of course merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.

Network resources may be assigned to local physical nodes on a network. As networks become more virtualized and as cloud deployments increase network resources may be assigned to remote and virtual machines not only to local physical nodes on the network. It may be advantageous to maintain data associated with network resources.

A cloud operating system may work as a part of a cloud computing architecture designed to allow control and management of pools of resources accessible by various components of the system. Control and utilization of these resources may be abstracted at multiple levels through various components of the system. A network controller may provide a virtual network service in the system. In an example the network controller may a tenant to dynamically request and configure a virtual network.

The network controller may provide a software layer that controls the networking portion of an Infrastructure as a Service IaaS cloud computing platform. In an example the network controller may provide a tenant facing API that exposes logical abstractions for consuming network services as well as backend implementations of those APIs in order to provide the underlying functionality. The network controller may provide tenant control of networking topology and addressing. In an example the network controller provides a plugin mechanism to enable different technologies and implements calls to these technologies via the API. This may enable users and administrators to pick and choose the networking technologies that are right for them.

Tenants of cloud computing systems may desire the ability to create rich enterprise network topologies. The network controller may allow cloud tenants to i create multitier networks e.g. web tier app tier database tier ii control Internet Protocol IP addressing iii insert and configure services such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems and iv implement virtual private networks VPNs and bridges to remote physical hosting solutions or customer premises. Further the network controller may allow tenants and cloud service providers the ability to deploy and manage state of the art network systems through the provisioning of virtual networking resources

The network controller may be operably connected to and configured to work in conjunction with one or more other components of the system including but not limited to one or more storage components one or more computing components one or more administrative components e.g. dashboard components one or more shared service components or any combination thereof. As such the network controller may work in connection with numerous other components to provide an entire IaaS platform.

Further the cloud computing architecture may also include a network information service that provides a centralized mechanism for creating reading updating and deleting network information such as Internet Protocol IP addresses and media access control MAC addresses.

Networks may increasingly be able to span multiple services and multiple locations geographies. Accordingly it may be desirable to allocate and track IP addresses MAC addresses and other types of network information especially network information that needs to be unique across services.

In an embodiment a system for providing network control and resource management includes a database that stores a plurality of network resources and a network controller that receives a request for a network resource. The network controller may include a resource manager that determines based on the request a set of available network resources from the plurality of network resources. The network controller may provide the set of available network resources to the client and update the database accordingly. The network controller may also associate the network resource with a node in the network.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for providing network control and resource management is illustrated. System includes a network controller and a client connected to a network . Each of network controller and client may communicate with each other over network .

Network may include various configurations and use various protocols including the Internet World Wide Web intranets virtual private networks wide area networks local networks private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies cellular and other wireless networks Internet relay chat channels IRC instant messaging simple mail transfer protocols SMTP Ethernet WiFi and HTTP and various combinations of the foregoing.

Network controller may provide network resources to client and associate network resources with client . Network controller includes a network manager and a resource manager . Resource manager may maintain data associated with physical virtual and cloud networks. In resource manager is coupled to a database that stores data associated with one or more network resources. While database is depicted as a component in network controller database may be external to network controller .

Database may store a pool of available and assigned network resources. Database may also store data other than data associated with network resources. In an example resource manager may allocate network resources for a node and associate one or more of the allocated network resources with the node. The node may be a component that can communicate with another component over a network. In an example the node is a virtual machine physical server router or switch.

Examples of a network resource are an IP address block IP address subnet port and media access control MAC address. An IP address space may be organized into IP blocks and IP blocks may be broken into IP ranges. Each IP range may be associated with a network and may be selected from an allocation pool of IP addresses. The IP addresses in the IP ranges may be allocated to devices on the network. An IP address may be for example an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. This is not intended to be limiting and other versions of the IP are within the scope of this disclosure.

In an example the IP addresses in the IP ranges may be allocated to devices on the network. In an example database includes an IP allocation table including IP address assignments to particular instances e.g. virtual machines instance and client identification numbers MAC addresses ports and subnets associated with the assignments. Resource manager may assist in maintaining routing tables that are used to forward packets to their final destination addresses. In an embodiment database includes sufficient data to recreate the routing tables. This may be advantageous if problems with the network occur and wipe out the routing information.

Further network controller may be given a context associated with an IP address e.g. MAC address associated with the IP address the virtual machine VM identifier to which the IP address is assigned etc. . For example based on a given network resource resource manager may determine other information associated with the given network resource. In an example resource manager may determine the MAC address associated with a given IP address or other information. Network controller may also determine which IP addresses and MAC addresses are allowed to receive and transmit traffic on a particular port. In an example network controller may be able to associate IP addresses to particular clients and to network segments. Accordingly this may provide advantages because it may be unnecessary for network controller to query another service for these details.

Network controller may receive a request for a network resource. In an embodiment network manager is an application programming interface API and network controller receives the request for a network resource via network manager . Network manager may be a layer between network controller and resource manager that helps with the communication between network controller and resource manager . In an example to launch a VM client invokes via network manager the API and passes a set of parameters including a desired state of the VM. In another example client may specify in the set of parameters a desired type of network e.g. private or public . Client may also specify a network name to which client would like the VM to connect. Network manager may receive this information and communicate it to resource manager . In another embodiment resource manager may have its own API that client may invoke to launch the VM.

The following is a description of a network resource being an IP address. This description applies as well to other network resources such as subnet port and media access control MAC address. In an example the network resource that network controller provides in response to the request is a set of IP addresses. Resource manager may determine based on the request for the network resource a set of available IP addresses from the plurality of IP addresses stored in database . Database may include a set of available IP addresses and a set of unavailable IP address. An IP address may be unavailable if for example the IP address has already been assigned. Resource manager may search database for available IP addresses and identify the set of available IP addresses.

The request for the network resource may be associated with a node. In an example the node is a VM that the client desires to launch. After resource manager identifies an available IP address e.g. from the identified set of available IP addresses network controller may associate one or more of the available IP address with the node such that the node may be located by the IP address. By incorporating resource manager into network controller it may be unnecessary for client to send two different requests to receive a set of available network resources e.g. IP addresses and associate one or more of the set of available network resources with the node. This may provide an advantage of speed and less power consumption and enable client to obtain the set of available network resources e.g. IP addresses and have the network resources e.g. IP addresses associated with the node based upon a single request. Further this also reduces the traffic sent over the network.

Additionally an embodiment may allow for authentication of network changes closer to network controller and without having to query multiple components over network . Network controller may have the data of interest already in database . This may be advantageous in bursting situations when a high quantity of VMs is requested.

In an example network controller may provide the set of available IP addresses to the client and update the database based on providing the set of available IP addresses to the client. For example network controller may indicate in the database that the set of IP addresses that were provided to the client is no longer available. When the node associated with the IP address is removed from the network the IP address associated with the node may be returned to a pool of available IP addresses. Accordingly the IP address that was associated with the node may be reassigned at a later point in time.

Network controller may transmit to client network resource data based on a request from client for a network resource. In an example network resource includes a set of IP addresses that network controller has assigned to a node launched by client . Network resource data may also include other network resources. may apply as well to other network resources such as subnet port and media access control MAC address.

In an example database stores a plurality of MAC addresses. A MAC address may refer to an identifier assigned to a network interface for communications on the physical network. Hosts on the network may be located by their IP addresses and every host connected to the network may have a MAC address associated with the host s network interface. The MAC address may be mapped to the IP address e.g. via address resolution protocol ARP . It may be undesirable for two nodes on the network to have the same MAC address because collisions of MAC addresses may for example prevent nodes on the network from receiving or transmitting data. Further different MAC addresses may be assigned to nodes in a particular network but conflicting MAC addresses may occur across domains.

In this example the network resource that network controller provides in response to the request for a network resource is a set of MAC addresses. Resource manager may determine based on the request for the network resource a set of available MAC addresses from the plurality of MAC addresses stored in database . Database may include a set of available MAC addresses and a set of unavailable MAC addresses. A MAC address may be unavailable if for example the MAC address has already been assigned. Resource manager may search database for available MAC addresses and identify the set of available MAC addresses.

In an example network controller may provide the set of available MAC addresses to the client and update the database based on providing the set of available MAC addresses to the client. For example network controller may indicate in the database that the set of MAC addresses that were provided to the client is no longer available to be assigned. After resource manager identifies an available MAC address e.g. from the identified set of available MAC addresses network controller may associate one or more of the available MAC address with the node such that the node may be located by the IP address associated with the node. When the node associated with the MAC address is removed from the network the MAC address associated with the node may return to a pool of available MAC addresses. Accordingly the MAC address that was associated with the node may be reassigned at a later point in time.

In an example database stores a plurality of subnets. A subnet may represent an IP address block e.g. IPv4 or IPv6 address block that may be used for assigning IP addresses to VM instances on a given network. Each subnet may be associated with a network and may be selected from an allocation pool of subnets.

In this example the network resource that network controller provides in response to the request for a network resource is a subnet. Resource manager may determine based on the request for the network resource a subnet from the plurality of subnets stored in database . Database may include a set of available subnets and a set of unavailable subnets. A subnet may be unavailable if for example the client associated with the request does not have permission to connect to the subnet. Resource manager may search database for available subnets and identify the available subnet to the client. In an example network controller may provide the available subnet to the client and update the database based on providing the subnet to the client. For example network controller may indicate in the database that the subnet that was provided to the client is no longer available to be assigned.

After resource manager identifies an available subnet e.g. from the identified set of available subnets network controller may associate one or more of the available subnets with the node such that the node may be connected to the subnet and communicate on the subnet. When the node associated with the subnet is removed from the network the subnet associated with the node may return to a pool of available subnets. Accordingly the subnet that was associated with the node may be reassigned at a later point in time.

In an example database stores a plurality of ports. A port may represent a virtual or logical switch port on a given network. In an example a VM instance may attach its interface into one or more ports. In an embodiment the logical port defines the MAC address and the IP address to be assigned to the interfaces plugged into the port. An IP address associated with a port may indicate that the port is associated with a subnet as the IP address was taken from the allocation pool for a specific subnet. In an example network controller associates the port with a quality of service policy.

In this example the network resource that network controller provides in response to the request for a network resource is a set of ports. Resource manager may determine based on the request for the network resource a set of available ports from the plurality of ports stored in database . Database may include a set of available ports and a set of unavailable ports. A port may be unavailable if for example the port has already been assigned. Resource manager may search database for available ports and identify the set of ports to the client. After resource manager identifies an available port e.g. from the identified set of available ports network controller may associate one or more of the available ports with the node such that the node may communicate via the port.

In an example network controller may provide the set of available ports to the client and update the database based on providing the set of available ports to the client. For example network controller may indicate in the database that the set of ports that were provided to the client is no longer available. When the node associated with the port is removed from the network the port may be returned to a pool of available ports. Accordingly the port that was associated with the node may be reassigned at a later point in time.

In another example database stores data associated with a plurality of networks and the request for a network resource includes a virtual machine identifier associated with a virtual machine instance. Network controller may determine based on the virtual machine identifier a set of networks available to the virtual machine instance. Network controller may provide a network interface that binds the virtual machine instance to the set of networks and update the database based on providing the network interface.

As discussed above and further emphasized here is merely an example which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. For example although block diagram is described herein with reference to database that stores the data associated with a network resource other techniques to store this data are also within the scope of the disclosure. For example network controller may also include an audit log that includes information such as the dates on which network resources were created or requested and to whom they were assigned. And advantage of an audit log may enable an administrator to determine which network resources were associated with which tenants or virtual machines instances at a particular moment in time.

Further it should be understood that one or more components e.g. network manager and resource manager may be combined into a single component. It should also be understood that one or more components in may be separated into more than one module. In an example resource manager is split into a first resource manager and a second resource manager.

Method includes steps . In a step a request for a network resource is received via a network controller. In an example network manager receives a request for a network resource. In a step a set of available network resources is determined from a plurality of network resources stored in a database the set of available network resources being determined based on the request. In an example resource manager determines based on the request a set of available network resources from a plurality of network resources stored in a database.

In a step the set of available network resources is provided via the network controller to the client. In an example resource manager provides via the network controller the set of available network resources to the client. In a step the database is updated via the network controller based on providing the set of available network resources. In an example resource manager updates via the network controller the database based on providing the set of available network resources.

It is also understood that additional method steps may be performed before during or after steps discussed above. For example method may include a step of associating the network resource with a node associated with the request. It is also understood that one or more of the steps of method described herein may be omitted combined or performed in a different sequence as desired.
