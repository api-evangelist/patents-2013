A method apparatus and computer program product are provided in accordance with an example embodiment in order to enable a mobile device to map unique identifiers of mobile device to individuals that are known to be nearby.

The need for collecting information about the user s ambient environment is essential to automated algorithms that deduce the user s current context. Determining that context is important for next generation user experiences. For example a restaurant locating app may return a different result if a user is with a spouse versus if a user is with a co worker. A user s ambient environment includes the unique identifiers that can be sensed in use in proximity to the user s device. Uses of those unique identifiers being sent by a transmitter with a static physical location are well known.

A need exists for sensing the unique identifiers of mobile device being carried on the person of individuals in proximity to the user and being able to determine the frequency and time of day that the user is in proximity with the people he she interacts with. This information is very valuable for example in determining a metric called social distance. Social distance may be used to estimate how close your ties are with that individual and whether they are professional and or personal e.g. which coworkers your regularly go to lunch with .

To sense unique identifiers in proximity to a user s mobile device RF based communications methods may be utilized. Mobile devices incorporate a number of RF based digital communications methods. Examples include various cellular voice and data technologies Bluetooth Wi Fi and proprietary standards such as ANT. These standards broadcast the signal in an omni directional pattern since there is no fixed relationship between the transmitter and receiver and therefore any appropriately equipped receiver within range can receive the signal. These RF based digital communication methods incorporate two unique identifiers so that a transmitter can indicate whom the transmission is intended for and where the intended receiver should send the response if any . Collecting the identifiers of RF based devices that have a fixed physical location cell towers Wi Fi access point in buildings and correlating these with additional information about geo location is also well known e.g. skyhook and similar to improve the accuracy of positioning particularly indoors. This may be a database of cell tower locations and triangulation or last know GPS locations for a mobile device. Digital implementations for multi user shared calendars are also well known and understood. Support for this functionality is also commonplace on mobile devices.

Currently a user s mobile device may sense the unique identifiers but does not know what individual s device the transmission is coming from. And therefore the unique identifiers alone are not capable of providing any information that may help determine a user s current context. Furthermore a user s mobile device may know what individuals a person is with if a calendar entry is made but without the calendar entry is unable to determine what individuals are in proximity.

Consequently a need also exists for a method to utilize accessible information regarding who a user is with in conjunction with sensed unique identifiers to map those unique identifiers to specific individuals in order to provide a user s current context.

The present invention relates to sensing unique identifiers in proximity to a user s mobile device and correlating those visible unique identifiers that the user s mobile device can detect against people that are known to be nearby such as attendees of a meeting. Over time multiple meetings by a process of elimination it would be possible to determine which meeting attendee is associated with which unique identifier. Many RF based digital communications methods incorporate human readable identifiers in additions e.g. Paul s phone which may also be factored in as hints to speed up the process. Once the mapping from unique identifiers to people has been identified the mobile device can start tracking frequency and time of day for interactions based on proximity.

Additional alternative embodiment might involve a cloud or network server to help with the matching. For example it is possible to move the majority of the intelligence to the cloud and only use the device to collect the IDs visible via RF. There are some advantages to that since a centralized common database could be kept which would help the process converge more quickly. Hybrid approaches that split the work between the device and cloud are also possible. Other solutions e.g. using indoor positioning techniques and or GPS location information in the cloud are also possible.

As depicted in computing devices and are coupled to a cloud computing system via network . In order to access information accessible from could cloud computing system a browser application may run on computing devices and . Browser may be configured to run within a local operating system of computing device . Non limiting examples of known browser applications include Microsoft Explorer Apple Safari Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browser. Non limiting examples of known operating systems for desktop and or laptop computers may include Microsoft Vista Apple Snow Leopard or Linux. Examples of known operating systems for mobile devices e.g. smartphones netbooks etc. include Microsoft Windows Mobile Apple iOS and Google Android mobile technology platform.

Browser may enable a user to manipulate access to information accessible via network . For example browser may provide a user with an ability to enter one or more uniform resource indicators URIs e.g. www.google.com in order to access a web application such as for example a hypertext markup language HTML document or a privileged web application. A web application and or information used by a web application may be stored on Cloud computing system . Browser may be configured to access web applications and or other information stored on cloud computing system for presentation of visual information to a user of computing device among other uses. A web application or any HTML5 or JavaScript application or app is a computer software application that is coded in a browser supported programming language such as JavaScript combined with a browser rendered markup language like HTML5 reliant on a common web browser to render the application executable . The opening of a web page or app may be performed by a web browser on a user s mobile communications device . An HTML5 or JavaScript app allows web page script to contact a server such as that shown in items or the cloud computing environment for storing and retrieving data without the need to re download an entire web page. A privileged web app is a piece of web content that may have been verified by for example means of an app store or stores or may have obtained or downloaded from a source that is trusted source.

The system includes computing devices and connected to a network such as for example a Transport Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP network e.g. the Internet. The computing devices and are coupled to the cloud computing system . Depending on the type of cloud service provided a computing device may connect to one of three service endpoints each of which give varying amounts of control relative to the provisioning of resources within the cloud computing system . For example PaaS will typically give an abstract Application Programming Interface API that allows developers to declaratively request or command the backend storage computation and scaling resources provided by the cloud without giving exact control to the user. IaaS will typically provide the ability to directly request the provisioning of resources such as computation units typically virtual machines software defined or software controlled network elements like routers switches domain name servers etc. file or object storage facilities authorization services database services queue services and endpoints etc. SaaS will typically only give information and access relative to the application running on the cloud storage system and the scaling and processing aspects of the cloud computing system will be obscured from the user.

Furthermore a cloud computing system may have an internal network not visible to the outside that connect to system components . System components may include a memory system including system memory and user memory processor s routers switches a message passing system one or more service controllers a system controller etc. The internal network may be encrypted or authenticated and in various embodiments one or more parts of the cloud computing system may be disposed on a single host.

Cloud APIs are application programming interfaces APIs used to build applications in the cloud computing market. Cloud APIs allow software to request data and computations from one or more services through a direct or indirect interface. Cloud APIs most commonly expose their features via representational state transfer REST and or Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP . Vendor specific and cross platform interfaces are available for specific functions. Cross platform interfaces have the advantage of allowing applications to access services from multiple providers without rewriting but may have less functionality or other limitations versus vendor specific solutions. Cloud APIs may be segmented into infrastructure service and application clusters. Service APIs provide an interface into a specific capability provided by a service explicitly created to enable that capability. Database messaging web portals mapping e commerce and storage are all examples of service APIs. These services may be referred to as platform as a service PaaS .

Platform as a service PaaS is a category of cloud computing services that provide a computing platform and a solution stack as a service. Along with Application as a Service SaaS and Infrastructure as a Service IaaS it is a service model of cloud computing. In this model the consumer creates the software using tools and or libraries from the provider. The consumer also controls software deployment and configuration settings. The provider provides the networks servers storage and other services. PaaS offerings may also include facilities for application design application development testing and deployment as well as services such as team collaboration web service integration and marshaling database integration security scalability storage persistence state management application versioning application instrumentation and developer community facilitation. These services are generally provisioned as an integrated solution over the web.

See block of . In one embodiment of the present invention computing devices such as mobile phones or tablet computers may incorporate any of a number of RF based digital communications methods. Examples may include various cellular voice and data technologies Bluetooth Wi Fi and proprietary standards such as ANT. These standards may broadcast the signal in an omni directional pattern and because there is no fixed relationship between the transmitter and receiver any appropriately equipped receiver within range can receive the signal. To receive unique identifiers in proximity to a user s mobile device RF based communications methods may be utilized. These RF based digital communication methods may incorporate two unique identifiers so that a transmitter can indicate whom the transmission is intended for and where the intended receiver should send the response if any.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to map the one or more device identifiers with the one or more nearby individuals. Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing the mapping the one or more device identifiers from the first time with the one or more nearby individuals at the first time. See block of . In one embodiment of the present invention one individual may be determined to be nearby and one device identifier may be received. In that instance the device identifier is mapped to the individual. In another embodiment more than one device identifier may be received and one or more individuals may be determined to be nearby. In this instance a more rigorous process may be employed which will be discussed later.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to cause presentation of a mapping of the one or more device identifiers to the one or more individuals. Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing presentation of a mapping of the one or more device identifiers to the one or more individuals. See block of . In one embodiment presentation of the mapping may be made on a map functionality. In another embodiment a calendar functionality may be utilized. In another embodiment a user may be shown which individuals are present or information related to present individuals may be stored based on the mapping.

Referring now to a flow chart is depicted that illustrates operations performed such as by the apparatus of in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. As shown in block of the apparatus embodied by the computing device may therefore be configured to access data. The apparatus embodied by the computing device therefore includes means such as the processor the communication interface or the like for accessing data. By way of example in which the computing device is a mobile telephone operating a version iOS Android or Windows accessing data may include accessing an Outlook calendar a Google calendar or the like. The calendar functionality may be stored on the mobile telephone in the cloud or a remote server. In one embodiment the computing device may access information on a desktop computer when docked.

In this embodiment the apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to determine one or more nearby individuals as shown in block of . Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing determination of one or more nearby individuals. In the context of the above example the mobile telephone may determine that each of the individuals invited or confirmed for a lunch meeting are nearby at the scheduled time. For example a user may have a meeting scheduled with Ann Bob Carol Dylan and Eric at 2 p.m. The mobile telephone may determine that at 2 p.m. that such attendees are nearby.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to receive one or more device identifiers transmitted from other computing devices within a time period associated with the first time. See block of . Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing reception of one or more device identifiers transmitted from other computing devices within a time period associated with the first time. In the context of the above example the mobile telephone may be configured to receive identifiers at 2 p.m.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to determine if all collected identifiers are be matched to nearby person s . See block of .

Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing determination of whether all collected identifiers are able to be matched to nearby person s . In the context of the above example a mobile telephone may receive two device identifiers at a time that two individuals are determined to be nearby. Without any other information the mobile telephone may determine that both identifiers are unable to be matched to nearby individuals. In the context of the above example where a mobile telephone receives device identifiers and and Ann Bob Carol Dylan and Eric are determined to be nearby the mobile telephone may determine that the device identifiers are unable to be mapped to a specific individual. In one embodiment of the present invention the mobile device of the user may not be the only mobile device configured according to the present invention. In one embodiment Ann and Bob may carry mobile devices configured according to the present invention. Ann and Bob s mobile devices may identify themselves to each other by communicating directly. In an alternative embodiment Ann and Bob s mobile devices each enabled according to the present invention may be configured to identify themselves to an intermediary device and or cloud based system.

In another embodiment of the present invention identification may be associated with a level of confidence. In the example above Ann and Bob s mobile devices are configured according to the present invention. Both devices may collect three nearby identifiers and determine that Carol Dylan and Eric are nearby. Ann and bob s devices may then determine that the collected device identifiers may not be mapped. Ann and Bob s devices may determine that there exists equal probability that each of the identifiers maps to one of Carol Dylan and Eric.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to map the one or more device identifiers from the first time with the one or more nearby individuals at the first time. Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing mapping the one or more device identifiers from the first time with the one or more nearby individuals at the first time. See block of . If the determination at step concludes that a device identifier is able to be mapped to an individual information is stored relating the device identifier to the individual. The information may be stored locally or remotely. In an example where Carol is determined to be nearby based on a lunch meeting at noon and the mobile telephone receives one device identifier the mobile telephone may be configured to map Carol to device identifier . Additionally or alternatively Carol may be determined to be nearby based on a lunch meeting and the mobile telephone may receive one device identifier. In this case the mobile telephone may be configured to map Carol to device identifier with a high level of confidence. In an alternative embodiment Dylan may be determined to be nearby based on a scheduled lunch meeting. The mobile telephone may receive a plurality of device identifiers from other mobile devices in a crowded restaurant. In this embodiment the mobile telephone may be configured to determine a mapping based on information regarding proximity for a predetermined period of time proximity for a period of time determined to be the longest or proximity for the longest unbroken period of time or proximity for the most time during a period of time.

In a case where one or more device identifiers are unable to be mapped to an individual information is stored relating the one or more device identifiers one or more individuals determined to be nearby and the specific time the apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to store information relating the one or more device identifiers one or more individuals determined to be nearby and the specific time. See block of . Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing the storing of information relating the one or more device identifiers one or more individuals determined to be nearby and the specific time. In one embodiment information may be stored locally on the mobile telephone. In alternative embodiments the information is stored remotely. In the context of the above example when individuals Dylan and Eric are determined to be nearby at meeting time and one or more device identifies are received the mobile telephone may store information relating individuals Dylan and Eric with the device identifiers received during the period of time those individuals were determined to be nearby.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to access previously stored information. See block of . Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing the accessing of previously stored information. In one embodiment the previously stored information is information relating one or more unmapped device identifiers to one or more unmapped individuals who were determined to be nearby the unmapped device identifiers at a second time or at a time period associated with the second time. In the context of the above examples the mobile device may access previously stored information related to a lunch meeting with Carol and Eric where two device identifiers were collected.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to correlate device identifiers and individuals. See block of . Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing correlation of device identifiers and individuals determined to be nearby at a time that the device identifiers are received. In the context of the above example where Dylan and Eric are determined to be nearby and two device identifiers are received the mobile device may determine that each device identifier may map to Dylan and Eric equally. When information regarding a previous meeting where Carol and Eric were determined to be present and two device identifiers were received and each was determined to map to Carol and Eric equally correlation may be made. Here based on the determination that Carol was present at both times a device identifier that was received both times may be mapped to Carol with increased level of confidence.

The apparatus embodied by the computing device may also be configured to map device identifiers to individuals using previously stored data. See block of . Thus the apparatus may include means such as the processor or the like for causing mapping of device identifiers to individuals using previously stored data. In the context of the above embodiment the mobile device may map the second device identifier received at the meeting with Carol and Dylan to Dylan after the first identifier is mapped to Carol based on the presence of Carol and the first identifier at the meeting with Eric.
