Referring to an auxiliary mesh type starter comprises a motor an electromagnetic switch and relays . In the auxiliary mesh type starter the electromagnetic switch comprises an attracting coil a holding coil the holding coil and the attracting coil are arranged on a coil frame an solenoid body circumferentially surrounds the outer sides of the attracting coil and the holding coil and constitutes a portion of a magnetic circuit a stop seat is arranged at the rear end parts of the attracting coil and the holding coil and constitutes a portion of the magnetic circuit a plunger is arranged on the inner circumferences of the attracting coil and the holding coil and is capable of sliding in an axial direction a return spring applies a return force to the plunger and a movable contact point is mounted at the rear end of the plunger and a pair of stationary contact points and are arranged relative to the movable contact point and are connected to the external wiring. An electromagnetic attraction force in the B direction as shown in is generated in the plunger by energizing the attracting coil and the holding coil of the electromagnetic switch . Owing to the electromagnetic attraction force the upper end of a shift fork in cooperation with the plunger moves towards the right direction indicated by arrow B and the lower end thereof moves towards the left direction indicated by arrow A as shown in . Thus a force is applied to the isolator and the driving gear on the output shaft to cause them to move towards the left direction indicated by arrow A as shown in then the driving gear moves towards such a direction that it is going to mesh with a flywheel gear ring of the engine.

Also referring to the positive terminal of a storage battery is connected to a terminal of the electromagnetic switch and the negative terminal is grounded or connected to a terminal of the motor . The relay which switches on off a terminal of the electromagnetic switch includes a terminal connected to the storage battery a contact point connected to the terminal and a coil for controlling the contact point and a contact point . The terminal located at one end of the coil is connected via a key switch to the positive terminal of the storage battery . The other end of the coil is grounded or connected to the negative terminal .

In if the key switch is closed to start the engine then the coil of the relay is energized to form a closed circuit between the contact point and the contact point and the storage battery energizes the motor via the attracting coil of the electromagnetic switch while energizing the holding coil . The two energized coils generate an attraction force in the plunger so that the plunger compresses the return spring while moving in the B direction and the driving gear moves towards one side of the flywheel gear ring via the shift fork i.e. in the A direction .

At this time if the driving gear smoothly meshes with the flywheel gear ring then the plunger further moves until it contacts the end face of an arresting disc the movable contact point comes into contact with the two stationary contact points and the motor is directly energized by the storage battery to generate a usual rotational torque and the driving gear drives the flywheel gear ring to rotate thereby applying a starting torque to the engine. When the movable and stationary contact points are in contact with each other the potentials of the terminal and the terminal are substantially the same so no electric current flows through the attracting coil and the plunger is kept in the position where it contacts the end face of the arresting disc only with the holding force generated by the holding coil .

After starting if the key switch is disconnected then the coil is not energized a circuit break occurs between the contact point and the contact point and no voltage is applied to the terminal . So the holding force generated by the holding coil disappears the plunger returns to the state as shown in with the aid of the spring force generated by the return spring and partly with the aid of the shift fork cooperating with the plunger the driving gear breaks away from the flywheel gear ring . Meanwhile the movable contact point also returns to the state as shown in thereby stopping energizing the motor.

As can be seen from the coil of the electromagnetic switch consists of the attracting coil and the holding coil . The numbers of turns of the two coils are substantially equal their head ends are connected together and the tail end of the attracting coil is connected to the power supply terminal also the output terminal of the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch of a DC motor and the tail end of the holding coil is kept grounded.

In addition the attracting coil of the electromagnetic switch has low resistance which is typically about 100 milliohms or so. In this way the starter can turn slowly at a low torque before the closure of the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch so that when the driving gear is pushed against the end face of the flywheel gear ring it can rotate slowly so that it is not pushed against the gear and then meshes with the flywheel gear ring only after it meshes with the flywheel gear ring will the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch be closed i.e. will the movable contact point come into contact with the two stationary contact points and will a large current flow through the motor and will a high torque be output from the starter thereby avoiding a gear milling failure in the starter. Therefore such starters are also called flexible mesh starters.

 1 Since the head end of the attracting coil and the head end of the holding coil of the electromagnetic switch in this type of starter are connected together in order to guarantee the reliable power off of the electromagnetic switch the attracting coil and the holding coil of the electromagnetic switch must have substantially the same effective number of turns and in the meanwhile the holding coil must not have too few turns. This means that the attracting coil must also have quite a few turns. Although the starter can be enabled to rotate slowly before the closure of the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch by a method which comprises appropriately increasing the coil diameter of the attracting coil and reducing the number of turns of the attracting coil the number of turns of the attracting coil cannot be reduced sharply otherwise the number of turns of the holding coil has to be reduced drastically with an eye to the reliable power off of the electromagnetic switch. Because of the limited torque for the flexible meshing of this type of starter in some cases the driving gear cannot mesh with the flywheel gear ring and accordingly is pushed against the gear. As a consequence the driving gear cannot mesh with the flywheel gear ring thus the attracting coil is forced to be energized for a long time while a relatively large current flows through the coil so the electromagnetic switch is prone to failure.

 2 Because a relatively large current flows through the attracting coil which has quite a few turns a large electromagnetic force is generated by the electromagnetic switch and accordingly the driving gear applies a too large acting force to the end face of the flywheel gear ring thereby badly damaging the end face of the flywheel gear ring furthermore since the driving gear applies a too large acting force to the end face of the flywheel gear ring the driving gear of the starter is liable to be pushed against the gear and if so the transmission of the driving gear will be impeded by a high drag torque and the fault that the electromagnetic switch is burnt out will easily occur as the driving gear is pushed against the gear for a long time.

 3 In order to ensure that a sufficiently large current flows through the attracting coil the attracting coil has not many turns thus the holding coil has not many turns too the coil has a higher current density and the starter works for a long time keeping elevating the temperatures of the coils too rapidly. Due to heat conduction the attracting coil has a too high temperature the starter has a too small braking torque for flexible meshing when it starts up again then the faults of pushing against the gear and of burning out the electromagnetic switch would easily occur in the starter. If a method comprising increasing the coil diameter of the holding coil and rewinding it is employed for reducing the current density of the holding coil such coil assembly is poor in winding process and the cost of the holding coil is high.

 4 In some abnormal conditions e.g. when the flywheel gear ring and the driving gear do not match properly the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch cannot be closed then the attracting coil is compelled to have a large current flowing through it for a long time so the fault of burning out would occur to the electromagnetic switch easily.

The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an auxiliary mesh type starter to solve the above mentioned problems of the existing auxiliary mesh type starters.

To this end the auxiliary mesh type starter according to the present invention comprises a motor an electromagnetic switch connected to the motor and relays connected to the electromagnetic switch wherein the electromagnetic switch comprises a holding coil an attracting coil a stop seat arranged at the rear end parts of the holding coil and the attracting coil a plunger arranged on the inner circumferences of the holding coil and the attracting coil and capable of sliding in an axial direction a return spring for applying a return force to the plunger and a contact point arranged at the rear end of the plunger and the relays are connected to a key switch wherein the relays comprise a first relay and a second relay with the head end of the attracting coil being connected to the key switch via the first relay and the head end of the holding coil being connected to the key switch via the second relay.

In said auxiliary mesh type starter the number of turns of the attracting coil is less than the number of turns of the holding coil.

In said auxiliary mesh type starter the attracting coil is a means for limiting the magnitude of current.

In said auxiliary mesh type starter the attracting coil is an aluminum enamelled wire copper clad aluminum enamelled wire constantan enamelled wire or iron wire.

 1 The head end of the attracting coil and the head end of the holding coil in the electromagnetic switch are connected separately and are controlled separately by different relays. In this way the number of turns of the attracting coil needs not be the same as that of the holding coil the number of turns of the holding coil may differ greatly from the number of turns of the attracting coil and the attracting coil can be freely adjusted according to the required torque for meshing. Thus the starter can generate a sufficiently large slow turning torque avoid the fault that the driving gear cannot rotate to mesh with the flywheel gear ring when the driving gear contacts the end face of the flywheel gear ring avoid the faults of pushing against the gear effectively decrease the possibility of burning out the electromagnetic switch and prolong the service life of the starter.

 2 The holding coil may have quite a few turns and needs not be rewound. Thus it is ensured that the holding coil has a relatively low current density the temperature rising rate of the holding coil will be significantly reduced and the thermal damage to the holding coil will not occur. Besides the following problem would not occur the longtime work of the starter results in a high temperature of the holding coil and due to heat conduction the starter generates a small slow turning torque in the case of another meshing. Moreover the problem that the temperature of the holding coil rises too rapidly during the dragging of the starter can be effectively prevented thereby effectively preventing the problem of a too high temperature of the attracting coil when the starter starts up again i.e. preventing the problem that due to the high temperature of the attracting coil the current flowing through the holding coil is small the slow turning torque for meshing is too small and the fault of pushing against the gear or meshing too long would occur in the starter.

 3 When power is off the attracting coil and the holding coil of the electromagnetic switch would not form a series circuit the two coils are in the off state and thus the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch can be smoothly disconnected.

 4 When the relay that controls the attracting coil is a time relay after the attracting coil is powered on for a short time e.g. within 2 s it is forced to be powered off that is the attracting coil stops working so that in abnormal conditions e.g. when the flywheel gear ring and the driving gear do not match properly and the latter cannot mesh with the former the attracting coil would not have a large current flowing through it for a long time thereby avoiding the fault of burning out the electromagnetic switch that is caused for particular and abnormal conditions. Similarly a time relay e.g. which is automatically disconnected after 30 s can also be chosen as the relay that controls the holding coil thereby avoiding the longtime power on of the holding coil that is caused for particular and abnormal conditions and thereby preventing the armature electromagnetic switch isolator or the like from breaking down.

 5 The attracting coil may be made of a material having a higher resistivity such as an aluminum enamelled wire copper clad aluminum enamelled wire constantan enamelled wire iron wire etc. thereby not only reducing the acting force that the driving gear of the starter applies to the end face of the flywheel gear ring but also reducing the cost of the electromagnetic switch.

 6 After the acting force that the driving gear applies to the end face of the flywheel gear ring is reduced the extent of damage to the end face of the flywheel gear ring can be significantly reduced thereby significantly prolonging the service time of the flywheel gear ring and fully satisfying the requirement for a starter with an idle start stop system. In addition as a small acting force is transmitted the service lives of other parts e.g. the shift fork the driving gear the isolator and the electromagnetic switch etc. of the meshing system in the starter can be improved accordingly.

Hereinafter the present invention is described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments which however are not to limit the present invention.

Hereinafter the technical solution of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments so as to further make clear the object solution and effect of the present invention rather than limit the protection scopes of the appended claims of the present invention.

The auxiliary mesh type starters according to the present invention differs distinctly from the auxiliary mesh type starters in the prior art in that the head ends of an attracting coil and of a holding coil in an electromagnetic switch are connected separately and are controlled separately by different relays. Next the aforesaid difference will be introduced in detail with reference to embodiments.

Referring to the auxiliary mesh type starter according to the present invention which is substantially similar in structure to the auxiliary mesh type starter as shown in also comprises a motor an electromagnetic switch connected to the motor and relays connected to the electromagnetic switch wherein the relays are connected to a key switch . The electromagnetic switch is essentially the same as a common auxiliary mesh type electromagnetic switch i.e. the electromagnetic switch still controls the power on off of the motor using a pair of contact points except that the head end of the attracting coil and the head end of the holding coil are connected separately and are controlled separately by two relays. To be specific the relays include a first relay and a second relay wherein the first relay includes contact points and a coil with the head end which is connected to the terminal I of the attracting coil being connected to the key switch via the first relay and wherein the second relay includes contact points and a coil with the head end which is connected to the terminal II of the holding coil being connected to the key switch via the second relay.

Other detailed structures of the auxiliary mesh type starter are the same as those in the prior art for example see . Details are not repeated herein.

In this example since the attracting coil and the holding coil of the electromagnetic switch are connected via two pairs of the contact points of relays i.e. the head end of the attracting coil and the head end of the holding coil are not directly connected the number of turns of the attracting coil may differ greatly from the number of turns of the holding coil that is the numbers of turns need not be identical. Preferably the number of turns of the attracting coil can be far less than the number of turns of the holding coil so that the attracting coil has low resistance which ensures that after the contact points of the relays close and before the movable contact point and the stationary contact points of the electromagnetic switch are connected the current in the attracting coil can enable the motor to turn slowly.

In this example the attracting coil may be made of a material having a higher resistivity such as an aluminum enamelled wire copper clad aluminum enamelled wire constantan enamelled wire iron wire etc. The coil diameter and the number of turns of the coil are adjusted according to the required slow turning torque thereby not only reducing the acting force that the driving gear of the starter applies to the end face of the flywheel gear ring but also reducing the cost of the electromagnetic switch .

Referring to and the auxiliary mesh type starter of the above mentioned structure operates as follows when the starter starts to work the key switch is turned on the coil in the first relay and the coil in the second relay are excited respectively and the movable and stationary contact points of the two relays are closed respectively. The terminals and of the electromagnetic switch are energized respectively the attracting coil and the holding coil are powered on simultaneously the electromagnetic force generated by the two coils causes the plunger to move towards the arresting disc and the motor starts to rotate slowly to drive the driving gear rotate. In the meanwhile with the aid of the shift fork the plunger enables the driving gear to move towards the flywheel gear ring and the driving gear flexibly meshes with the flywheel gear ring while turning slowly. After that the movable contact point comes into contact with the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch under the action of the plunger the attracting coil is short circuited a large electrical current flows through the motor and then the motor starts to output a full torque to start the engine. After the completion of starting the key switch is disconnected the coils in the two relays are powered off simultaneously the movable and stationary contact points of the two relays are disconnected respectively under the action of the return spring the storage battery is disconnected no current flows through the attracting coil and the holding coil the electromagnetic force generated by the electromagnetic switch disappears the movable and stationary contact points of the electromagnetic switch are disconnected under the action of the return spring the motor is powered off the starter stops working and the driving gear returns to the initial state.

Referring to the structure in this example is substantially the same as the structure in Example 1. The difference is in this embodiment the number of turns of the attracting coil is zero preferably the attracting coil is a means for limiting the magnitude of current i.e. the attracting coil can be regarded as a current limiting resistor and the slow turning torque of the starter is adjusted by adjusting the current limiting resistor . That is to say in this example the electromagnetic switch only has one coil the holding coil the electromagnetic force generated by the coil plays a role in holding the plunger and also in attracting the plunger . Since the other structures are essentially the same as those described in Example 1 details are not repeated herein.

 1 Since the slow turning torque of the starter is adjusted through the current limiting resistor the magnitude of current limiting resistance can be arbitrarily designed based on the demand of the starter for a slow turning torque and would not be subject to other factors. Therefore the slow turning torque can be increased thus the slow turning of the starter would not disappear with an increase in rotational resistance and it is ensured that the starter can successfully achieve flexible meshing in any case.

 2 The number of turns of the holding coil can be set to a larger number so that the thermal power generated by the electromagnetic switch is small and the fault of burning out the electromagnetic switch is unlikely to occur.

 3 The holding coil and the current limiting resistor are controlled by two relays respectively. The electromagnetic switch is still of a common single contact structure. In this way under the circumstance that a relatively high reliability and reliable meshing of the starter are guaranteed the structures and manufacturing processes of the starter and of the electromagnetic switch are not changed a lot on the whole.

Referring to the structure in this example is substantially the same as the structure in Example 1 i.e. two relays are used to control the attracting coil and the holding coil respectively. The difference is in this embodiment the first relay that controls the attracting coil is a time relay i.e. the attracting coil is controlled by a delay relay so after the attracting coil is powered on for a short time e.g. within 2 s the contact points of the first relay are compelled to be disconnected so that in abnormal conditions e.g. when the flywheel gear ring and the driving gear do not reasonably match and the latter cannot mesh with the former the attracting coil would not have a large current flowing through it for a long time thereby avoiding the fault of burning out the electromagnetic switch that is caused for particular and abnormal conditions.

Similarly the second relay that controls the holding coil can also be a time relay. Thus when a time relay e.g. which is automatically disconnected after 30 s is chosen as the second relay to control the holding coil the fault that the electromagnetic switch is burnt out due to the longtime power on of the holding coil can be avoided.

Since the other structures in this example are essentially the same as those described in Example 1 details are not repeated herein.

In this example since the attracting coil and the holding coil of the electromagnetic switch are connected via the contact points of two pairs of relays i.e. the head end of the attracting coil and the head end of the holding coil are not directly connected the number of turns of the attracting coil may differ greatly from the number of turns of the holding coil that is the numbers of turns need not coincide. Preferably the number of turns of the attracting coil can be far less than the number of turns of the holding coil so that the attracting coil has low resistance which ensures that after the closure of the contact points of the relays and before the movable contact point and the stationary contact points of the electromagnetic switch are turned on the current in the attracting coil can enable the motor to turn slowly.

In this example the attracting coil may also be made of a material having a higher resistivity such as an aluminum enamelled wire copper clad aluminum enamelled wire constantan enamelled wire iron wire etc. The coil diameter and the number of turns of the coil are adjusted according to the required slow turning torque thereby not only reducing the acting force that the driving gear of the starter applies to the end face of the flywheel gear ring but also reducing the cost of the electromagnetic switch.

Referring to in combination with the working process of the auxiliary mesh type starter having the above mentioned structure is described as follows when the starter starts to work the key switch is turned on the coil in the first relay a time relay and the coil in the second relay are excited separately and the movable and stationary contact points of the two relays are closed separately. The terminals I and II of the electromagnetic switch are energized separately the attracting coil and the holding coil are powered on simultaneously the electromagnetic force generated by the two coils causes the plunger to move towards the arresting disc and with the aid of the shift fork the plunger enables the driving gear to move towards the flywheel gear ring in the meanwhile the motor starts to rotate slowly and the driving gear rotates accordingly the driving gear flexibly meshes with the flywheel gear ring while turning slowly then the movable contact point comes into contact with the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch under the action of the plunger the attracting coil is short circuited a large electrical current flows through the motor and then the motor starts to output a full torque to start the engine during the starting the time relay is powered off in advance according to the designed power off time. After the completion of starting the key switch is disconnected the coil in the second relay is powered off the movable and stationary contact points of said relay are disconnected under the action of the return spring the storage battery is disconnected no current flows through the attracting coil and the holding coil the electromagnetic force generated by the electromagnetic switch disappears the movable and stationary contact points of the electromagnetic switch are disconnected under the action of the return spring the motor is powered off the starter stops working and the driving gear returns to the initial state. The working process in this example is substantially the same as that described in Example 1 and they only differ when the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch cannot be closed and the attracting coil is forced to be powered on for a long time.

In abnormal conditions e.g. when the flywheel gear ring and the driving gear do not match properly when the starter is energized the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch cannot be closed and the attracting coil is forced to be powered on for a long time. However a time relay has the function of delaying forced power off for example the attracting coil is energized for 2 s then the time relay stops the process the contact points are disconnected the attracting coil and the storage battery are in an off state and then no current flows through the attracting coil thereby effectively avoiding the occurrence of a fault in the attracting coil of the electromagnetic switch .

Referring to the structure in this example is substantially the same as the structure in Example 3 i.e. the attracting coil and the holding coil are still controlled by two relays respectively the first relay that controls the attracting coil is a time relay and the holding coil can also be controlled by a time relay. The difference is in this embodiment the number of turns of the attracting coil is zero preferably the attracting coil is a means for limiting the magnitude of current i.e. the attracting coil can be regarded as a current limiting resistor and the slow turning torque of the starter is adjusted by adjusting the current limiting resistor . That is to say in this example the electromagnetic switch only has one coil the holding coil the electromagnetic force generated by the coil plays a role in holding the plunger and also in attracting the plunger .

Since the other structures are essentially the same as those described in Example 3 details are not repeated herein.

 1 Since the slow turning torque of the starter is adjusted through the current limiting resistor the magnitude of current limiting resistance can be arbitrarily designed based on the demand of the starter for a slow turning torque and would not be subject to other factors. Therefore the slow turning torque can be increased thus the slow turning of the starter would not disappear with an increase in rotational resistance and it is ensured that the starter can successfully achieve flexible meshing in any case.

 2 A time relay is used to control the attracting coil of the electromagnetic switch thereby effectively avoiding the fault that the electromagnetic switch is burnt out in some exceptional case e.g. when the main contact point of the electromagnetic switch cannot be closed.

 3 The holding coil and the current limiting resistor are controlled by two relays respectively. The electromagnetic switch is still of a common single contact structure. In this way under the circumstance that a relatively high reliability and reliable meshing of the starter are guaranteed the structures and manufacturing processes of the starter and of the electromagnetic switch are not changed a lot on the whole.

 4 The number of turns of the holding coil can be set to a larger number so that the thermal power generated by the electromagnetic switch is small and the fault of burning out the electromagnetic switch is unlikely to occur.

Of course the present invention may have a variety of other embodiments. Those skilled in the art can make all kinds of corresponding changes and modifications according to the present invention without departing from the spirit and essence of the present invention. It is intended that all these changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims of the present invention.
