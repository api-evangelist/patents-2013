This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT JP2012 006624 filed Oct. 17 2012 which claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 239222 filed Oct. 31 2011.

This invention relates to a developer carrying member a process for its production and a developing assembly making use of the developer carrying member.

In recent years in order to meet a demand for making electrophotographic images higher in image quality developers are being made smaller in particle diameter. Such developers having a small particle diameter come large in particle surface area per unit mass. Hence the developers tend to have a large surface electric charge during the step of development. Meanwhile in order to keep developers low consumable in quantity spherical particle developers have come to be used. Such developers have particle surfaces having been made smooth compared with merely pulverized particle developers and tend to be electrostatically charged in excess to tend to result in an unstable charge quantity. As the result they have a tendency to tend to cause faulty images such as sleeve ghost and density non uniformity.

In Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H05 346727 a method is reported in which an iron complex compound is added to a surface layer of a developer carrying member so as to control the charge quantity of a developer.

In Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 2002 040797 a developer carrying member is disclosed which has a surface layer containing a specific quaternary ammonium salt and a specific phenol resin and a method is reported by which developers made spherical particle and developers produced by polymerization are prevented from any excess charging such as charge up.

However Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H05 346727 is what aims to improve developing performance by promoting the triboelectric charging for a developer. Hence it has sometimes come about that a readily chargeable developer is unwantedly made to undergo charge up.

As for the developer carrying member disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 2002 040797 it can keep a developer from undergoing charge up and can have a further stable charge providing performance. However it has come about that especially where the quaternary ammonium salt is added in a large quantity in order to keep a readily chargeable developer from being charged in excess the surface layer increases in volume resistivity to cause sleeve ghost. Also the surface layer may come to have a low wear resistance thus a further improvement has been sought.

Further in recent years there are increasing needs for electrophotographic apparatus to maintain image density in their continuous service to keep sleeve ghost from occurring and to keep blotchy images spotty images or wave pattern images caused by faulty triboelectric charge providing to a developer from occurring. Under such circumstances the performance to further control the electrostatic charging of developers by developer carrying members is sought to be made much more precise.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to providing a developer carrying member the surface layer of which can make a developer stable by controlling its triboelectric charging and which can maintain a high image quality over a long period of time even where a developer tending to have high triboelectric charges stated specifically a developer made highly spherical particle or a small particle developer is used and a process for producing such a developer carrying member. Further the present invention is also directed to providing a developing assembly which contributes to stable formation of high grade electrophotographic images over a long period of time.

According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a developer carrying member having a substrate and a surface layer the surface layer being a cured product of a resin composition containing a binder resin conductive particles a quaternary ammonium salt and an azo metal complex compound the binder resin having in the molecular structure at least one structure selected from the group consisting of an NHgroup an NH group and an NH linkage and the azo metal complex compound being a compound represented by the following formula 1 

In the formula 1 X X Xand Xeach independently represent a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group a substituted or unsubstituted naphthylene group or a substituted or unsubstituted pyrazolene group M represents Fe Cr or Al and Jrepresents a cation. A substituent the phenylene group the naphthylene group and the pyrazolene group may each independently have is at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom s a nitro group a halogen atom an anilide group which may have a substituent and a phenyl group which may have a substituent where a substituent the anilide group and the phenyl group may each independently have is at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom s and a halogen atom.

According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a developing assembly which has at least a negatively chargeable developer a developer container in which the negatively chargeable developer is held a developer carrying member supported rotatably which carries and transports the negatively chargeable developer thereon and a developer layer thickness regulating member for regulating the layer thickness of a negatively chargeable developer layer formed on the developer carrying member the developer carrying member being the developer carrying member described above.

According to the present invention a process for producing a developer carrying member having a substrate and a surface layer is further provided which is a process for producing a developer carrying member the process comprising the steps of forming on the substrate a coat of a coating material containing at least a binder resin having in the molecular structure at least one structure selected from the group consisting of an NHgroup an NH group and an NH linkage conductive particles a quaternary ammonium salt and an azo metal complex compound represented by the above formula 1 and curing the coat to form the surface layer.

According to the present invention a developer carrying member can be obtained the surface layer of which can make a developer stable by controlling its triboelectric charging strongly and which can provide high grade electrophotographic images over a long period of time even where a developer tending to have high triboelectric charges stated specifically a developer made highly spherical particle or a small particle developer is used. According to the present invention a developing assembly can also be obtained which contributes to stable formation of high grade electrophotographic images.

Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.

The present inventors have made many studies in order to remedy a phenomena coming about when the above quaternary ammonium salt is added in a larger quantity. As the result they have discovered that the various problems discussed above can be resolved at a high level when a specific azo metal complex compound a quaternary ammonium salt a resin having a specific structure and conductive particles are used in combination in the surface layer.

More specifically the developer carrying member according to the present invention can stably provide the developer with proper triboelectric charges even in its repeated running service from the initial stage of image reproduction and also even in a variety of environments. Also the phenomenon of charge up the triboelectric charging that may become unstable and an increase in developer carriage level that is attendant thereon which tend to occur when a developer having high triboelectric charge characteristics is used can be controlled and good developing performance can be enjoyed over a long period of time.

The developer carrying member according to the present invention has at least a substrate and a surface layer and in addition thereto may have e.g. an intermediate layer e.g. an elastic layer between the substrate and the surface layer. The developer carrying member of the present invention may be used as a developer carrying member used in electrophotographic apparatus a developer carrying member for electrophotographic apparatus . The surface layer may also be formed on the surface of the substrate. The developer carrying member of the present invention is described below in detail.

As the substrate used in the present invention any substrate known in the field of the developer carrying member may be used and its shape may appropriately be selected from shapes of a hollow cylinder a solid column a belt and the like. As this substrate a substrate may be used which is obtained by shaping a non magnetic metal such as aluminum stainless steel or brass into a hollow cylinder or solid column followed by polishing or grinding.

The surface layer used in the present invention is a cured product of a resin composition containing a binder resin conductive particles a quaternary ammonium salt and an azo metal complex compound represented by the above formula 1 . Here this binder resin has in its molecular structure at least one structure linkage selected from the group consisting of an NHgroup an NH group and an NH linkage. The resin composition may also contain other additive s such as unevenness providing particles described later.

The developer carrying member of the present invention has the surface layer constituted as above and this enables the developer to be stably provided with proper triboelectric charges without being triboelectrically charged in excess when a negatively chargeable developer is used. As the result even where a developer more highly triboelectrically chargeable than conventional ones is used the developer can achieve triboelectric charge quantity having been made proper over a long period of time and hence can enjoy a good developing performance.

Incidentally where the binder resin the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles are used in combination in the surface layer without use of the quaternary ammonium salt the effect of keeping the charge up from occurring has been found to be low. On the other hand where the binder resin the quaternary ammonium salt and the conductive particles are used in combination in the surface layer without use of the azo metal complex compound the effect of keeping the charge up from occurring has been found to be obtained to a certain extent.

However in the case when the binder resin the quaternary ammonium salt the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles are used in combination as in the resin composition used in the present invention the effect of keeping the charge up from occurring has been found to be remarkably great and the triboelectric charge quantity also to be very easily come stable. This effect has been found to be much greater than the effect expected from the above result obtained when either of the quaternary ammonium salt and the azo metal complex compound is used.

The mechanism by which the combination of these materials makes the charge up kept from occurring was examined in the following way.

First a surface layer made up by using the binder resin the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles but without using the quaternary ammonium salt was immersed in an organic solvent such as chloroform in which the azo metal complex compound was soluble to allow the azo metal complex compound to be extracted. As the result the azo metal complex compound dissolved out in a quantity that was very small with respect to the quantity of the azo metal complex compound contained in the surface layer.

This is because the azo metal complex compound came to be incorporated in the binder resin as part of a polymer with the curing of the binder resin as so considered.

Subsequently a surface layer made up by using the binder resin the quaternary ammonium salt and the conductive particles but without using the azo metal complex compound was immersed in an organic solvent in which the azo metal complex compound was soluble to allow the quaternary ammonium salt to be extracted. As the result the quaternary ammonium salt dissolved out in a quantity that was very small with respect to the quantity of the quaternary ammonium salt contained in the surface layer.

This is because the quaternary ammonium salt came to be incorporated in the binder resin as part of a polymer with the curing of the binder resin as so considered.

Next a surface layer made up by using the binder resin the quaternary ammonium salt the azo metal complex compound and the conductive particles was immersed in an organic solvent in which the azo metal complex compound was soluble. As the result the azo metal complex compound came much extracted by tens of times to hundreds of times the above case where the quaternary ammonium salt was not added to the resin composition. This quantity in which the azo metal complex compound dissolved out was very large even when the quantities of the quaternary ammonium salt and azo metal complex compound having been added are taken into account.

This is because though both the quaternary ammonium salt and the azo metal complex compound came to be incorporated in the binder resin as part of a polymer with the curing of the binder resin the quaternary ammonium salt stood incorporated selectively as so considered.

That is it is considered that where the above four kinds of materials are mixed the presence of any of the NHgroup the NH group and the NH linkage in the binder resin structure makes the quaternary ammonium salt react with the binder resin preferentially to the azo metal complex compound. The action and mechanism thereof are not known in detail and it is considered that as the result of preferential incorporation of the quaternary ammonium salt in the binder resin the azo metal complex compound not incorporated in the binder resin and present singly come much present in the surface layer and then that in virtue of the effect of the azo metal complex compound having negative chargeability and having ion conductivity the developer can be kept from being charged in excess and can be improved in conductivity. This enables the developer to be vastly kept from undergoing charge up and enables image difficulties such as sleeve ghost and blotches to be kept from occurring which are attendant on the charge up.

As the binder resin usable in the present invention any known resin may be used as long as it has in the molecular structure at least one structure selected from the group consisting of an NHgroup an NH group and an NH linkage hereinafter also called NHn structure in some cases . Having the NHn structure in the molecular structure enables blotches ghost and the like to be kept from occurring which are considered to be caused by excess triboelectric charging of the developer.

As specific examples of this binder resin it may include the following Polyurethane resins polyamide resins melamine resins guanamine resins epoxy resins making use of polyamide as a curing agent phenol resins having the NHn structure which are produced by using a nitrogen containing compound such as ammonia as a catalyst in their production steps and resins having the NHn structure outside the backbone chain such as urethane modified epoxy resins.

Of these the phenol resins having the NHn structure are particularly preferable in view of advantages that the triboelectric charge quantity of the developer can favorably be controlled that the hardness of the layer having been cured is so high as to be improved in its durability with ease and that when used as a coating material its viscosity is relatively a little low. The nitrogen containing compound that is a catalyst used in such a phenol resin participates directly in polymerization reaction and exists in the phenol resin even after the reaction has been completed. It is commonly ascertained that when e.g. polymerized in the presence of an ammonia catalyst an intermediate called an ammonia resol is formed which exists in the phenol resin even after the reaction has been completed as a structure as represented by the following formula 4 .

The nitrogen containing compound used in producing the phenol resins may be either of an acidic catalyst and a basic catalyst.

The binder resin in the resin composition used to form the surface layer a surface layer forming resin composition may preferably be in a content of 50 by mass or more from the viewpoint of the retention of a pigment to a resin layer and 80 by mass or less from the viewpoint of resistance control of the resin layer. Also in regard to the binder resin its structure may be analyzed by making analysis with an analyzer for IR infrared absorption spectroscopy or NMR nuclear magnetic resonance .

In the present invention the quaternary ammonium salt is contained in combination with the azo metal complex compound in the resin composition i.e. in the surface layer. This is necessary to secure a good triboelectric charge providing performance for the developer. In particular from the viewpoint of keeping the developer from being triboelectrically charged in excess it is preferable that a quaternary ammonium salt positively chargeable to iron powder is contained in the resin layer like that disclosed in e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H10 326040. The iron powder given herein refers to an iron powder carrier having a volume distribution based 50 particle diameter D50 of from 30 m or more to 200 m or less and being not coated with a resin.

As specific examples of this iron powder binder resin it may include EFV200 300 trade name available from Powder Teck Co. and DSP138 trade name available from Dowa Teppun K.K. . Here the volume distribution based 50 particle diameter D50 of the iron powder carrier may be specified by the following measuring method. It is done by fitting to a laser diffraction scattering particle size distribution measuring instrument MICROTRACK MT3300EX trade name manufactured by Nikkiso Co. Ltd. a sample feeder for dry process measurement One shot Drying Sample Conditioner TURBOTRAC trade name manufactured by Nikkiso Co. Ltd. . As feed conditions of TURBOTRAC a dust collector is used as a vacuum source setting air flow at liters second and pressure at 17 kPa. Control and analysis are automatically made by using attached software Version 10.3.3 202D to find the volume distribution based 50 particle diameter D50 .

As a structure of the quaternary ammonium salt used in the present invention it may include e.g. what is represented by the following general formula 3 .

In the general formula 3 Zto Zeach independently represent an alkyl group which may have a substituent or an aryl group which may have a substituent and Qrepresents an anion. It is preferable for this alkyl group to have 1 to 18 carbon atom s except for the substituent from the viewpoint of its affinity for the binder resin. Also the substituent the alkyl group or the aryl group may each independently have may include e.g. a halogen group a nitro group a hydroxyl group and an organic acid group e.g. a sulfonic group or a carboxyl group .

The anion represented by Q in the general formula 3 may specifically include the following ions which may preferably be used Organic sulfate ions organic sulfonate ions organic phosphate ions molybdate ions tungstate ions and heteropolyacid ions containing molybdenum atoms or tungsten atoms. Of these from the viewpoint of keeping the developer from being triboelectrically charged in excess it is particularly preferable for Q to be an organic sulfonate ion.

Specific structures of a compound usable as the quaternary ammonium salt are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.

In general the quaternary ammonium salt is used as a positively charging charge control agent. In the present invention however the quaternary ammonium salt is added together with the azo metal complex compound to the binder resin with specific structure thus a reverse triboelectric charge providing performance is materialized in virtue of their mutual action. This enables the developer to retain its triboelectric charging stability while preventing the developer from undergoing charge up on the developer carrying member and as a result thereof enables achievement of a good developing performance.

The presence of such a quaternary ammonium salt may be identified by e.g. a method in which a sample taken from the surface portion of the developer carrying member by cutting or by extraction with a solvent such as chloroform is measured by GC MS gas chromatography mass spectrometry or LC MS liquid chromatography mass spectrometry .

The surface layer forming resin composition may preferably have the quaternary ammonium salt in an amount of from 1 part by mass or more to 20 parts by mass or less and much preferably from 1 part by mass or more to 10 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin. In the present invention the quaternary ammonium salt acts like a catalyst for the effect of keeping the surface layer from undergoing charge up and hence its addition in an amount of 1 part by mass or more can easily bring the effect of keeping the charge up from occurring. Also its addition in an amount of 20 parts by mass or less enables the charge up to be easily kept from occurring while keeping the surface layer durable.

In the present invention the azo metal complex compound represented by the following formula 1 is contained in the surface layer. This is necessary to provide the developer with proper triboelectric charges.

In the formula 1 X X Xand Xeach independently represent a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group a substituted or unsubstituted naphthylene group or a substituted or unsubstituted pyrazolene group. M represents Fe Cr or Al. Jrepresents a cation. A substituent the phenylene group the naphthylene group and the pyrazolene group may each independently have is at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom s a nitro group a halogen atom an anilide group which may have a substituent and a phenyl group which may have a substituent. A substituent the anilide group and the phenyl group may each independently have is at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom s and a halogen atom.

The counter ion Jin the formula 1 may include e.g. H an alkali metal ion NH an alkyl ammonium ion and a mixed ion of any of these.

Of the above structure it is particularly preferable to contain in the surface layer an azo metal complex compound represented by the following formula 2 in order to make the developing performance of the developer carrying member stable in a high temperature and high humidity environment and in a low temperature and low humidity environment without dependence on environments.

In the formula 2 A Aand Aeach independently represent a hydrogen atom an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom s or a halogen atom. Brepresents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atom s . M represents Fe Cr or Al. Jrepresents a cation.

Any detailed reason is unclear why the use of the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 2 makes the developing performance of the developer carrying member stable without dependence on environments and it is considered that this is because the azo metal complex compound as having pyrazolone rings in the ligands changes in its polarity to come kept from having water absorption properties. As M in the formula 2 it may particularly preferably be Fe or Cr. Setting the coordination metal to be Fe or Cr makes the azo metal complex compound improved in its dispersibility in the binder resin and this can facilitate that the effect of keeping the charge up from occurring is stably obtained over a long period of time.

The counter ion Jin the formula 2 may be like that in the formula 1 H an alkali metal ion NH an alkyl ammonium ion or a mixed ion of any of these and may preferably be H.

The azo metal complex compound used in the present invention may preferably be used after its volume average particle diameter has been controlled to from 0.1 m or more to 20 m or less and much preferably from 0.1 m or more to 10 m or less. Controlling this volume average particle diameter to from 0.1 m or more to 20 m or less enables the azo metal complex compound to be more uniformly dispersed and this makes the surface layer have a uniform triboelectric charge providing performance and can easily keep the image density from coming non uniform as being preferable.

The surface layer forming resin composition may preferably have the azo metal complex compound in an amount of from 1 part by mass or more to 40 parts by mass or less and much preferably from 5 parts by mass or more to 40 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin. Its addition in an amount of 1 part by mass or more can easily bring the effect of keeping the charge up from occurring and its addition in an amount of 40 parts by mass or less enables the charge up to be easily kept from occurring while keeping the surface layer durable.

The presence of such an azo metal complex compound may also be identified by e.g. a method in which a sample taken from the surface portion of the developer carrying member by cutting or by extraction with a solvent such as chloroform is measured by GC MS or LC MS.

About how to produce the azo metal complex compound used in the present invention it may be produced by any known azo metal complex compound production method. A typical production method is described below.

First to an amine component such as 4 chloro 2 aminophenol a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is added where after the liquid temperature has come to 5 C. or less sodium nitrite dissolved in water is dropwise added while maintaining the liquid temperature at 10 C. or less. The mixture obtained is stirred at 10 C. or less for 30 minutes or more to 3 hours or less to carry out reaction to make this amine component into a diazo form to obtain a diazo compound. Then to the reaction solution obtained sulfamic acid is added and potassium iodide starch paper is used to make sure that any nitric acid does not remain in excess in the reaction system.

Next separately a coupling component such as 3 methyl 1 3 4 dichlorophenyl 5 pyrazolone an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution sodium carbonate and an organic solvent such as n butanol are stirred mixed at room temperature. To the solution obtained the above diazo compound is added and these are stirred at room temperature for several hours to carry out coupling reaction. After the stirring resorcinol is added to the reaction solution to make sure that no reaction takes place between the diazo compound and the resorcinol where the reaction is set to be completed. To the reaction solution obtained water is added and thereafter these are thoroughly stirred and then left to stand followed by separation. An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is further added followed by stirring washing and then separation to obtain a monoazo compound.

The amine component and the coupling component may be used under appropriate selection in accordance with the molecular structure of the desired azo metal complex compound. As an organic solvent other than the n butanol any solvent usable in carrying out the coupling is available and monohydric alcohol dihydric alcohol or a ketone type organic solvent is preferred. The monohydric alcohol may include e.g. methanol ethanol n propanol 2 propanol isobutyl alcohol sec butyl alcohol n amyl alcohol isoamyl alcohol and ethylene glycol monoalkyl ethers the alkyl group of which has 1 to 4 carbon atoms . The dihydric alcohol may include e.g. ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. The ketone type one may include e.g. methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone.

Next metal complexing reaction is carried out. To a n butanol solution of the above monoazo compound water salicylic acid n butanol and sodium carbonate are added and these are stirred. Where e.g. iron is used as the coordination metal an aqueous ferric chloride solution and sodium carbonate are added. The liquid temperature is raised to 30 C. or more to 40 C. or less where the reaction is started and then the reaction is followed up by TLC thin layer chromatography . After 5 hours and within 10 hours from the start of the reaction the TLC is used to make sure that raw material spots have disappeared where the reaction is set to be completed. After the stirring has been stopped the reaction system is left to stand to effect separation. Further water n butanol and an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution are added to carry out alkali washing. Filtration is carried out and a solid cake is taken out followed by washing with water.

Where any desired counter ion is to be provided for example sodium hydroxide is added to water and these are stirred while being heated until the mixture obtained has come to have an internal temperature of 85 C. or more to 90 C. or less where a liquid dispersion of the above cake is dropwise added thereto. This is stirred at 97 C. or more to 99 C. or less for 1 hour followed by cooling and filtration and thereafter the cake is washed with water. Then the product obtained may sufficiently be dried by vacuum drying to obtain the azo metal complex compound usable in the present invention.

In order to control the resistivity of the surface layer conductive particles are contained in the resin composition in the surface layer . The conductive particles may be used under appropriate selection of any conductive particles known in the field of the developer carrying member. Examples of such conductive particles are shown below Fine powder of metals such as aluminum copper nickel and silver particles of conductive metal oxides such as antimony oxide indium oxide tin oxide titanium oxide zinc oxide molybdenum oxide and potassium titanate crystalline graphite all kind of carbon fibers and conductive carbon black. of these conductive carbon black and crystalline graphite are particularly preferable because of their superior dispersibility and superior electrical conductivity. The above conductive particles may be used alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more types.

The conductive particles may also preferably be mixed in an amount of from 20 parts by mass or more to 100 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the resin binder resin . Their addition within this range enables the surface layer to have resistivity at the desired level without damaging its strength.

The conductive particles may preferably have a volume average particle diameter of 10 nm or more from the viewpoint of dispersion stability and 20 m or less from the viewpoint of resistance uniformity of the resin composition.

The surface layer forming resin composition or rather the surface layer may preferably contain unevenness providing particles for forming surface unevenness from the viewpoints of providing uniform surface roughness and maintaining proper surface roughness. The unevenness providing particles need not have any conductivity and are added for the purpose of forming an unevenness profile on the surface of the resin composition surface layer. The unevenness providing particles may preferably have a volume average particle diameter of 1 m or more from the viewpoint of providing the unevenness and 30 m or less from the viewpoint of maintaining the durability of the resin composition surface layer. In the surface layer forming resin composition the unevenness providing particles may also preferably be added thereto in an amount of 5 parts by mass or more from the viewpoint of the effect to be brought by their addition and 100 parts by mass or less from the viewpoint of maintaining wear resistance based on 100 parts by mass of the binder resin.

The surface layer may preferably have as its surface roughness an arithmetic mean roughness Ra JIS B 0601 2001 of from 0.3 m or more to 2.5 m or less and particularly preferably from 0.4 m or more to 2.0 m or less. Making the resin layer surface surface layer have an Ra of from 0.3 m or more to 2.5 m or less makes the developer transportable by the developer carrying member in a more stable level. This can also make it easy for the surface layer to have good wear resistance and developer stain resistance.

The surface layer formed in the developer carrying member of the present invention may preferably have a layer thickness of from 4 m or more to 50 m or less and particularly preferably from 6 m or more to 30 m or less. As being 4 m or more the surface layer can easily cover the substrate and hence the effect of forming the surface layer can easily be obtained and as being 50 m or less the roughness of the surface layer can easily be controlled by the materials to be added thereto.

The surface layer in the present invention may preferably have a volume resistivity of from 1 10 cm or more to 1 10 cm or less and particularly preferably from 1 10 cm or more to 1 10 cm or less. As being from 1 10 cm or more to 1 10 cm or less it is easy to make resistance control by the addition of the conductive particles to the surface layer.

In the process for producing the developer carrying member according to the present invention a coat of a coating material containing at least the binder resin conductive particles quaternary ammonium salt and azo metal complex compound described above is formed on the surface of the substrate and the coat formed is cured or may be dried to harden to form the surface layer. Here when the materials for forming the surface layer are mixed it is preferable to disperse and mix these materials in a solvent to make up a coating material which is applied and coated on the surface of the substrate. In making the surface layer it is preferable to use a coating material prepared by mixing the binder resin the conductive particles the quaternary ammonium salt and the azo metal complex compound in a solvent in which the binder resin is soluble as exemplified by methanol or isopropyl alcohol .

To disperse and mix the above materials a known media dispersion system such as a ball mill a sand mill an attritor or a bead mill or a known medialess dispersion system that utilizes impact atomization or thin film spin methodology may preferably be used. Also as a method of coating the coating material obtained it may include known methods such as dipping spraying roll coating electrostatic coating and ring coating. As a curing method it may include e.g. heat curing.

The developing assembly making use of the developer carrying member of the present invention is described next by giving examples of embodiments. Note that the examples are by no means limited to the following embodiments. The developing assembly of the present invention has at least a negatively chargeable developer a developer container a developer carrying member and a developer layer thickness regulating member and as this developer carrying member the developer carrying member of the present invention as described above is used.

Meanwhile the magnetic one component developer is sent into the developer container from a developer supply container not shown via a developer feed member . The developer container is divided into a first chamber and a second chamber where the magnetic one component developer having been sent into the first chamber is sent to the second chamber by the aid of an agitating transport member passing through an opening formed by the developer container and a partition member . The second chamber is provided therein with an agitating transport member for preventing the developer from stagnating.

In this developing assembly first the magnetic one component developer held in the developer container is held on the developer carrying member by the magnetic force of the magnet roller has and a developer layer is formed on the developer carrying member by the aid of a developer layer thickness regulating member . Then by the rotation of the developer carrying member in the direction of an arrow A the developer on the developer carrying member is transported to a developing zone C where the developer carrying member and an electrostatic latent image bearing member photosensitive drum face each other. Then an electrostatic latent image formed on the electrostatic latent image bearing member is developed with the developer to form a developer image thereon. During this course the photosensitive drum is rotated in the direction of an arrow B.

The magnetic one component developer gains triboelectric charges which enable development of the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum as a result of the friction between magnetic developer particles one another and between these and the surface layer at the surface of the developer carrying member. In order to control the thickness of the developer transported to the developing zone C a magnetic blade is fitted which is made of a ferromagnetic metal serving as the developer layer thickness regulating member. The magnetic blade is fitted to the developer container usually in such a way as to face the developer carrying member leaving a gap of from 50 m or more to 500 m or less from the surface of the developer carrying member . The magnetic line of force exerted from the magnetic pole N of the magnet roller is converged to the magnetic blade whereby a thin layer of the magnetic one component developer is formed on the developer carrying member . Incidentally in the present invention a non magnetic developer layer thickness regulating member may also be used in place of the magnetic blade .

From the viewpoint of high image quality the thickness of the magnetic one component developer layer thus formed on the developer carrying member may preferably be smaller than the minimum gap between the developer carrying member and the photosensitive drum in the developing zone C.

It is effective for the developer carrying member of the present invention to be set in a developing assembly of a system in which electrostatic latent images are developed with the magnetic one component developer as above i.e. a non contact developing assembly.

In order to cause to fly the magnetic one component developer held on the developer carrying member a development bias voltage is applied to the developer carrying member by a development bias power source serving as a bias applying means. When a direct current voltage is used as this development bias voltage it is preferable to apply to the developer carrying member a voltage which corresponds to a value intermediate between the potential at image areas of the electrostatic latent image the region rendered visible upon attraction of the developer and the potential at back ground areas.

In order to enhance the density of images to be formed by development and improve the gradation thereof an alternating bias voltage may be applied to the developer carrying member to form in the developing zone C a vibrating electric field whose direction alternately reverses. In such a case an alternating bias voltage formed by superimposing thereon a direct current voltage component having a value intermediate between the potential at developing image areas and the potential at back ground areas as above may preferably be applied to the developer carrying member .

This elastic blade may be composed of e.g. a material having a rubber elasticity such as urethane rubber or silicone rubber or a material having a metal elasticity such as bronze or stainless steel.

Inside a developer container an agitating transport member for agitating and transporting a non magnetic one component developer is provided.

A developer feed stripping member for feeding the developer to the developing sleeve and also stripping off the developer remaining on the surface of the developing sleeve after development is kept in contact with the developing sleeve . As the developer feed stripping member developer feed stripping roller is rotated in the same direction as the developing sleeve the direction of A the surface of the developer feed stripping roller moves in the direction counter to reverse direction of the surface movement of the developing sleeve . Thus the non magnetic one component developer is fed onto the developing sleeve inside the developer container .

The developing sleeve carries the non magnetic one component developer thus fed and is rotated in the direction of an arrow A to transport the non magnetic one component developer to a developing zone C where the developing sleeve and the photosensitive drum face each other. The layer thickness of the non magnetic one component developer held on the developing sleeve is regulated by a developer layer thickness regulating member coming into pressure touch with the surface of the developing sleeve through the developer layer.

The non magnetic one component developer gains triboelectric charges that are enough to develop the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum as a result of its friction with the developing sleeve . In the following description to avoid complicacy of description a non contact developing assembly is taken as an example.

In order to cause to fly the non magnetic one component developer held on the developing sleeve a development bias voltage is applied to the developing sleeve from a development bias power source . When a direct current voltage is used as this development bias voltage a voltage having a value intermediate between the potential at electrostatic latent image areas the region rendered visible upon attraction of the non magnetic developer and the potential at back ground areas may preferably be applied to the developing sleeve . In order to enhance the density of images to be formed by development and improve the gradation thereof an alternating bias voltage may be applied to the developing sleeve to form in the developing zone C a vibrating electric field whose direction alternately reverses. In such a case an alternating bias voltage formed by superimposing a direct current voltage component having a value intermediate between the potential at image areas and the potential at back ground areas may preferably be applied to the developing sleeve .

As the developer feed stripping member it is preferable to use an elastic roller member made of resin rubber or sponge. In place of such an elastic roller a belt member or a brush member may also be used as the developer feed stripping member . Where a developer feed stripping roller formed of such an elastic roller is used as the developer feed stripping member the developer feed stripping roller may be rotated in the same direction as or in the direction counter to the developing sleeve either of which may appropriately be selected. Usually in view of stripping performance and feed performance it is much preferable for it to be rotated in the counter direction.

The developer feed stripping member may have a level of penetration to the developing sleeve of from 0.5 mm or more to 2.5 mm or less. This is preferable in view of the feed performance and stripping performance of the developer. This level of penetration is the value length that is found when the distance between the center of the developer feed stripping member and the center of the developing sleeve after they come into contact is subtracted from the value found by dividing by 2 the sum of the external diameter of the member and the external diameter of the sleeve before they come into contact.

In the developing assembly shown in an elastic blade made of a material having a rubber elasticity such as urethane rubber or silicone rubber or a material having a metal elasticity such as bronze or stainless steel may be used as a developer layer thickness regulating member. This elastic blade is brought into pressure touch with the developing sleeve in such a state that it bends in the direction reverse to the rotational direction of the developing sleeve .

Incidentally besides the developer layer thickness regulating member for regulating the layer thickness of the negatively chargeable developer layer the developing assembly making use of the developer carrying member of the present invention may appropriately be changed in the shape of the developer container the presence of the agitating transport member or the disposition of the magnetic poles the shape of the developer feed member the presence of the developer supply container and so forth.

The developer toner usable in the developing assembly making use of the developer carrying member of the present invention is negatively chargeable. Also this negatively chargeable developer makes use of conventionally known materials e.g. components such as a binder resin a charge control agent a magnetic material a colorant a releasing agent and an inorganic fine powder and may be obtained by a conventionally known production process without any particular limitations.

Particles developer particles constituting the developer used in the present invention may preferably have a weight average particle diameter in the range of from 4.0 m or more to 8.0 m or less. The use of such a developer enables image quality and image density to be well balanced with ease. Stated specifically as being 4.0 m or more in weight average particle diameter the quantity of a magnetic powder to be contained in each particle of the developer can be smaller and this makes it easy to keep fog from occurring while keeping the developer from agglomerating. Also as being 8.0 m or less in weight average particle diameter each dot reproducibility can be kept high grade while keeping the developer from agglomerating and this makes it easy to achieve high image quality.

In order to achieve stable image density and image quality the above developer may also preferably have particles that are more closely spherical namely developer particles having an average circularity close to 1.0. Stated specifically in circularity distribution of magnetic developer particles particles having a circularity relatively as high as 0.93 or more may preferably be contained in the developer in a proportion of 60 by number or more and much preferably 75 by number or more. As being 60 by number or more phenomena such as a lowering of triboelectric charge quantity and a staining of the developer carrying member can not easily come about and the image density can not easily come to lower.

As the binder resin any commonly known resin may be used which may include e.g. vinyl resins polyester resins polyurethane resins epoxy resins and phenol resins. In particular vinyl resins or polyester resins are preferable from the viewpoint of developing performance and fixing performance.

For the purpose of improving triboelectric charge characteristics a charge control agent may be used by incorporating it in developer particles internal addition or blending it with developer particles external addition . Such addition of the charge control agent enables easy control of triboelectric charge quantity in accordance with developing systems.

Where the developer is a magnetic developer a magnetic material therefor may include e.g. iron oxide type metal oxides such as magnetite maghemite and ferrite and magnetic metals such as Fe Co and Ni or alloys of any of these metals with any of metals such as Al Co Cu Pb Mg Ni Sn Zn Sb Be Bi Cd Ca Mn Se Ti W and V and mixtures of any of these any of which may be mixed. Here any of these magnetic materials may be made to serve also as a colorant.

A release agent may preferably be mixed in the developer from the viewpoint of e.g. preventing the developer from sticking to the fixing assembly. As the release agent Fischer Tropsch wax may be used for example.

In order to improve environmental stability charging stability developing performance fluidity and storage stability and to improve cleaning performance it is further preferable to externally add to developer particles an inorganic fine powder such as silica titanium oxide or alumina powder. In particular fine silica powder is much preferred.

Subsequently to the liquid mixture obtained a solution prepared by diluting 0.45 part by mass of a polymerization initiator t butyl peroxy 2 ethylhexanoate with 20 parts by mass of 2 butanone was dropwise added over a period of 30 minutes and the stirring was continued for 5 hours to which a solution prepared by diluting 0.28 part by mass of t butyl peroxy 2 ethylhexanoate with 20 parts by mass of 2 butanone was further dropwise added over a period of 30 minutes followed by stirring for further 5 hours to carry out polymerization. Thereafter the reaction solution obtained was poured into methanol to effect precipitation of a sulfonic acid group containing polymer S. The polymer obtained had a glass transition temperature Tg of 70.2 C. and weight average molecular weight of 22 000.

Next materials shown in Table 8 below were uniformly dispersed and mixed by means of Attritor trade name manufactured by Mitsui Miike Engineering Corporation to obtain a monomer composition.

The monomer composition thus obtained was heated to 60 C. and 7 parts by mass of an ester wax maximum value of endothermic peak in DSC 72 C. was added thereto and mixed to dissolve it therein. To the mixture obtained 3 parts by mass of a polymerization initiator 2 2 azobis 2 4 dimethylvaleronitrile was dissolved to obtain a polymerizable monomer composition A.

Meanwhile in 709 parts by mass of ion exchanged water 451 parts by mass of an aqueous 0.1 M NaPOsolution was introduced followed by heating to 60 C. Thereafter to the resultant mixture 67.7 parts by mass of an aqueous 1.0 M CaClsolution was added to obtain an aqueous medium A containing Ca PO .

Into this aqueous medium A the above polymerizable monomer composition A was introduced followed by stirring for 15 minutes at 60 C. in an atmosphere of N using TK type homomixer manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co. Ltd. at 12 000 rpm to carry out granulation. Thereafter the granulated product obtained was stirred with a paddle stirring blade during which the reaction was carried out at 70 C. for 5 hours. Thereafter this was further continued to be stirred for 4 hours while maintaining the liquid temperature at 80 C. After the reaction was completed distillation was carried out at 80 C. for further 2 hours thereafter the suspension formed was cooled and then hydrochloric acid was added thereto to dissolve the dispersant followed by filtration washing with water and then drying to obtain black particles having a weight average particle diameter of 6.5 m.

100 parts by mass of the black particles thus obtained and 1.2 parts by mass of hydrophobic fine silica powder obtained by treating silica of 12 nm in primary particle diameter with hexamethyldisilazane and thereafter with silicone oil and having a BET specific surface area of 120 m g after the treatment were blended by means of Henschel mixer manufactured by Mitsui Miike Engineering Corporation . As the result it was able to produce a negatively triboelectrically chargeable magnetic developer Z 2 having a weight average particle diameter of 6.3 m and an average circularity of 0.989.

To 900 parts by mass of ion exchanged water heated to 60 C. 3 parts by mass of tricalcium phosphate was added followed by stirring at 10 000 rpm by means of a stirrer trade name TK type homomixer manufactured by PRIMIX Corporation to prepare an aqueous medium B.

Materials shown in Table 9 below were also introduced into a homogenizer and then heated to 60 C. followed by stirring at 8 000 rpm by means of the TK type homomixer to effect dispersion.

In this 5 parts by mass of a polymerization initiator 2 2 azobis 2 4 dimethylvaleronitrile was dissolved to prepare a polymerizable monomer composition B.

The polymerizable monomer composition B was introduced into the above aqueous medium B followed by stirring at 8 000 rpm at a temperature of 60 C. in an atmosphere of nitrogen using the TK type homomixer to granulate the polymerizable monomer composition.

Thereafter the granulated product obtained was moved to a reaction vessel having a propeller stirrer and stirred during which the temperature was raised to 70 C. over a period of 2 hours. Four hours after the temperature was further raised to 80 C. at a rate of heating of 40 C. hr where the reaction was carried out at 80 C. for hours to produce polymer particles. After the polymerization was completed a slurry containing the polymer particles was cooled which was then washed with water used in an amount 10 times that of the slurry followed by filtration drying and thereafter classification to control particle diameter to obtain base particles of a cyan developer.

Subsequently materials shown in Table 10 below were blended by dry processing for 5 minutes by means of Henschel mixer to obtain a negatively triboelectrically chargeable non magnetic one component developer developer Z 3 having a weight average particle diameter of 5.7 m and an average circularity of 0.987.

To a mixture of materials shown in Table 11 below methanol was added to control the mixture to have a solid content of 40 by mass and this was dispersed for 2 hours by means of a sand mill trade name SAND GRINDER LSG 4U 08 manufactured by IMEX Co. Ltd. making use of glass beads of 1 mm in diameter . Subsequently the glass beads were separated by using a sieve and thereafter methanol was so added as to control the product to have a solid matter concentration of 33 by mass to obtain a coating material.

Next as a substrate a cylindrical tube made of aluminum and having been worked by grinding to have an outer diameter of 24.5 mm and an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.2 m was prepared which was masked at its upper and lower end portions both end portions of the substrate in its axial direction . This substrate was kept to stand upright and rotated at a stated speed and was coated thereon with the above coating material while a spray gun was descended at a stated speed. Here as coating conditions the coating was carried out in an environment of temperature 30 C. humidity 35 RH RH and in the state that the temperature of the coating material was controlled to a temperature of 28 C. in a thermostatic chamber. Subsequently the coat layer formed was cured and dried by heating it at a temperature of 150 C. for 30 minutes in a hot air drying furnace to produce a developer carrying member T1.

The surface layer of the developer carrying member T1 was 11 m in layer thickness and 0.85 m in surface roughness Ra. The materials added and physical properties of the surface layer of the developer carrying member T1 are shown in Table 12. Incidentally in Tables 12 15 and 17 pbm refers to parts by mass and pbm of resin refers to parts by mass of resin solid content.

In the evaluation of the developer carrying member an electrophotographic image forming apparatus trade name IR ADVANCE 6075 manufactured by CANON INC. was used the photosensitive drum of which is an amorphous silicon drum photosensitive member. This electrophotographic image forming apparatus is one having the non contact developing assembly making use of a magnetic one component developer shown in . That is this developing assembly has the magnetic one component developer and also has the magnetic blade as a developer layer thickness regulating member. Also in the interior of the developer carrying member T1 according to this Example the magnet was provided as shown in .

The developer carrying member T1 was set in the developing assembly the sleeve to drum distance was set to be 240 m and the developer Z 1 was used. Copying environments were a high temperature and high humidity environment H H of temperature 30 C. and humidity 80 RH a normal temperature and normal humidity environment N N of temperature 23 C. and humidity 50 RH and a normal temperature and low humidity environment N L of temperature 23 C. and humidity 5 RH where using a test chart having a print percentage of 1.5 images were continuously reproduced on 1 000 000 sheets running test in each environment. Here the following evaluations were made when copied on 10th sheet initial stage and when copied on 1 000 000th sheet after running .

Results obtained from the following evaluations 1 to 5 are shown in Table 13. Incidentally a schematic view of this developing assembly is what is shown as .

Copied image densities of solid black circular areas of 5 mm in diameter on the copies obtained by image reproduction of the test chart having a print percentage of 5.5 were measured as reflection densities by using a reflection densitometer trade name RD918 manufactured by Gretag Macbeth Ag. and an average value thereof at arbitrary 10 spots was taken as each image density. Besides the evaluation at the initial stage and after the running in each environment of H H N N and N L an image density measured after the evaluation machine was left to stand for 10 days in the H H environment after the finish of the running continuous copying on 1 000 000 sheets was also evaluated on images reproduced in the same way as the above. On that occasion the percent of a decrease in density between images before and after the running was also noted. Where the density increased as a result of the running it was shown as a negative value.

As images to be reproduced by the image forming apparatus a chart was used in which a zone located at the image sheet leading end and corresponding to one round of the developer carrying member was provided in its white background with hieroglyphic images composed of solid black squares and circles arranged at equal intervals and the other part was provided with halftone images. Based on how a ghost s of the hieroglyphic images appeared on the halftone images the results were ranked according to the following criteria. Here the images were reproduced after an image where no image was formed and no developer was consumed was reproduced on 3 sheets immediately before they were reproduced.

In making image evaluation for each developer carrying member the surface of the developer carrying member surface layer was observed to visually observe whether or not any spotty images or wave pattern images blotches were present which were caused by faulty triboelectric charge providing to the developer. A case in which the blotches were present was marked with NG in the column of evaluation results of the table and a case in which no blotches were present was marked with OK . Where the blotches were present they appeared also on images to make any accurate evaluation unable and hence the other evaluations were stopped. Here the evaluation was made in the normal temperature and low humidity environment N L of temperature 23 C. and humidity 5 RH.

The outer diameter of the developer carrying member was measured and the values before service were subtracted from the values after running. The values found were taken as wear depths of the surface layer and an average value thereof was taken as the wear depth of the whole surface layer. Incidentally in measuring the values after running the surface of the developer carrying member was cleaned with isopropanol. Here in measuring the values after running a developer carrying member having been put to the running in the normal temperature and normal humidity environment N N of temperature 23 C. and humidity 50 RH was used.

The arithmetic mean roughness Ra of the surface of the developer carrying member was measured before and after the running. Here in the measurement after the running a developer carrying member having been put to the running in the normal temperature and normal humidity environment N N of temperature 23 C. and humidity 50 RH was used.

Developer carrying members T2 to T16 and H1 to H6 were produced in the same way as Example 1 except that the constitution of each developer carrying member was changed as shown in Table 12. Note that in Example 6 the solid content of the coating material used to form the surface layer was 15 by mass. For the developer carrying members T2 to T16 and H1 to H6 each the developer Z 1 was used and the images formed were evaluated in the same way as Example 1. Evaluation results obtained are shown in Tables 13 and 14.

How the developer carrying member according to the present invention is remarkably effective can be understood from the results shown in Table 13. That is in each Example the production of the developer carrying member having the surface layer containing the specific azo metal complex compound the quaternary ammonium salt the resin with specific structure and the conductive particles has enabled the developer to maintain a stable triboelectric charge quantity without being triboelectrically charged in excess. Hence this has made good evaluation results obtainable in running service. In particular good evaluation results were obtainable when the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 2 was used.

On the other hand in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 the resin used in the developer carrying member had none of structures with the NHgroup the NH group and the NH linkage and hence the blotches occurred which were considered due to excess triboelectric charging of the developer. The ghost also occurred very much.

Comparative Example 3 is an example in which a complex compound different from the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 1 was used and Comparative Example 4 is an example in which the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 1 and any of the other complex compounds were not used. In the both the specific resin and the quaternary ammonium salt used in the present invention were used and hence the blotches were not seen to have occurred but the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 1 was not used and hence the ghost occurred very much.

In Comparative Example 5 any quaternary ammonium salt was not added and hence the blotches were seen to have occurred and further the ghost occurred very much. In Comparative Example 6 the quaternary ammonium salt was added in an amount larger than that in Comparative Example 4 and hence the level of the ghost was lower than that in Comparative Example 4. However its addition in a larger amount brought a large wear depth and a low Ra during the running resulting in a low running image density.

A coating material composed as shown in Table 15 and having a solid matter concentration of 33 by mass like Example 1 was used and as a substrate a cylindrical tube made of aluminum and having been worked by grinding to have an outer diameter of 14.0 mm and an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.2 m was prepared which was masked at its upper and lower end portions. This substrate was kept to stand upright and rotated at a stated speed and was coated thereon with the coating material while a spray gun was descended at a stated speed. Here as coating conditions the coating was carried out in an environment of temperature 30 C. humidity 35 RH RH and in the state that the temperature of the coating material was controlled to a temperature of 28 C. in a thermostatic chamber. Subsequently the coat layer formed was cured and dried by heating it at a temperature of 150 C. for 30 minutes in a hot air drying furnace to produce a developer carrying member T17.

The surface layer of the developer carrying member T7 was 7 m in layer thickness and 0.99 m in Ra. The materials added and physical properties of the surface layer of the developer carrying member T17 are shown in Table 15.

In the evaluation of the developer carrying member a laser printer trade name LASER JET P2055dn manufactured by Hewlett Packard Co. was used. This laser printer is an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having the magnetic one component non contact developing assembly shown in . That is this developing assembly has the magnetic one component developer and also has the elastic blade as a developer layer thickness regulating member. Also in the interior of the developer carrying member T24 according to this Example the magnet was provided as shown in .

This developer carrying member T17 was set in a process cartridge and also the developer Z 2 was filled therein. This process cartridge was mounted to the above laser printer and image evaluation was made. In the evaluation using a character pattern having a print percentage of 1.0 images were reproduced in an intermittent mode of 2 sheets 7 seconds on 10 000 sheets running test . Images for evaluation were reproduced when printed on 100th sheet initial stage in the course of printing and when printed on 10 000th sheet after running . The same evaluations as Example 1 were made but as evaluation environments in a low temperature and low humidity environment L L of 15 C. and 10 RH a normal temperature and normal humidity environment N N of 23 C. and 50 RH and a high temperature and high humidity environment H H of 32 C. and 85 RH. Here the evaluation on blotches was made in the low temperature and low humidity environment L L of 15 C. and 10 RH. Evaluation results obtained are shown in Table 16. A schematic view of this developing assembly is what is shown as .

Developer carrying members T18 to T22 and H7 and H8 were produced in the same way as Example 17 except that the constitution of each developer carrying member was changed as shown in Table 15. The images formed were evaluated in the same way as Example 17. Evaluation results obtained are shown in Table 16.

As is seen from the results shown in Table 16 in each Example the production of the developer carrying member having the surface layer containing the specific azo metal complex compound the quaternary ammonium salt the resin with specific structure and the conductive particles has enabled the developer to maintain a stable triboelectric charge quantity without being triboelectrically charged in excess. Hence this has made good evaluation results obtainable in running service. In particular good evaluation results were obtainable when the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 2 was used.

On the other hand in Comparative Example 7 the resin used in the developer carrying member had none of structures with the NHgroup the NH group and the NH linkage and hence the blotches occurred which were considered due to excess triboelectric charging of the developer. The ghost also occurred very much. In Comparative Example 8 any quaternary ammonium salt was not added and hence the blotches were seen to have occurred and further the ghost occurred very much.

A coating material composed as shown in Table 17 and having a solid matter concentration of 33 by mass like Example 1 was used and as a substrate a cylindrical tube made of aluminum and having been worked by grinding to have an outer diameter of 12.0 mm and an arithmetic mean roughness Ra of 0.2 m was prepared which was masked at its upper and lower end portions. This substrate was kept to stand upright and rotated at a stated speed and was coated thereon with the coating material while a spray gun was descended at a stated speed. Here as coating conditions the coating was carried out in an environment of temperature 30 C. humidity 35 RH RH and in the state that the temperature of the coating material was controlled to a temperature of 28 C. in a thermostatic chamber. Subsequently the coat layer formed was cured and dried by heating it at a temperature of 150 C. for 30 minutes in a hot air drying furnace to produce a developer carrying member T23 the surface layer of which was 7 m in layer thickness and 0.51 m in Ra. The materials added and physical properties of the surface layer of the developer carrying member T23 are shown in Table 17.

The developer carrying member T23 obtained was set in a cyan cartridge of a laser printer trade name LASER SHOT LBP5000 manufactured by CANON INC. and the developer Z 3 was filled therein. This cyan cartridge was mounted to the laser printer where using a test chart having a print percentage of 1.0 images were reproduced in an intermittent mode of 1 sheet 10 seconds on 5 000 sheets running test . Images for evaluation were reproduced when printed on 10th sheet initial stage in the course of printing and when printed on 5 000th sheet after running . The laser printer is one having the non magnetic one component non contact developing assembly making use of a non magnetic toner shown in . That is it has the non magnetic one component developer and also has the elastic blade as a developer layer thickness regulating member.

Here the images for running and the images for evaluation were reproduced in as running environments a normal temperature and normal humidity environment N N of temperature 23 C. and humidity 50 RH a low temperature and low humidity environment L L of temperature 15 C. and humidity 10 RH and a high temperature and high humidity environment H H of temperature 32 C. and humidity 85 RH. Also as image evaluation the same image density wear resistance and surface roughness Ra as the foregoing and the following halftone uniformity were evaluated. Evaluation results obtained are shown in Table 18. Incidentally a schematic view of this developing assembly is what is shown as .

After solid white images were continuously reproduced on 20 sheets halftone images were reproduced to make visual observation on whether or not any density non uniformity misty tone difference occurred which tended to occur because of excess triboelectric charging of the developer. Here this evaluation was made when printed on 10th sheet initial stage and when printed on 5 000th sheet after running . A case in which such misty images were present was marked with NG in the column of evaluation results of the table and a case in which no misty images were present was marked with OK . Here the evaluation was made in the low temperature and low humidity environment L L of temperature 15 C. and humidity 10 RH.

Developer carrying members T24 to T29 and H9 and H10 were produced in the same way as Example 23 except that the constitution of each developer carrying member was changed as shown in Table 17. Note that in Example 26 the solid content of the surface layer forming coating material was 15 by mass. About the developer carrying members T24 to T29 and H9 and H10 each the images were evaluated in the same way as Example 23. Evaluation results obtained are shown in Table 18.

As is seen from the results shown in Table 18 in each Example the production of the developer carrying member having the surface layer containing the specific azo metal complex compound the quaternary ammonium salt the resin with specific structure and the conductive particles has enabled the developer to maintain a stable triboelectric charge quantity without being triboelectrically charged in excess. Hence this has made good evaluation results obtainable in running service. In particular good evaluation results were obtainable when the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 2 was used.

On the other hand in Comparative Example 9 the resin used in the developer carrying member had none of structures with the NHgroup the NH group and the NH linkage and hence the HT uniformity was seen to have lowered as being considered due to excess triboelectric charging of the developer. Comparative Example 10 is an example in which a complex compound different from the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 1 was added. Since the azo metal complex compound represented by the formula 1 was not used the HT mist was seen.

From the foregoing results it is seen that the developer carrying member that can properly maintain the providing of triboelectric charges from the surface layer to the developer can be obtained by the present invention.
