title: Commerce oriented uniform resource locater (URL) shortener
abstract: A uniform resource locator (URL) shortener relies on client-side support to embed links to websites into, for example, text messages, emails, tweets, or other forms of microblogging, and that provides additional capabilities. A method may include: recognizing a token indicator; recognizing a token in conjunction with the token indicator; selecting a template corresponding to the token indicator; and executing a process enabled according to the token and the template. Executing an enabled process may include one or more of: generating a URL; generating a URL that is itself a server-based URL shortener, in which the token indicator is substituted for the server-based URL shortener hostname to reduce the character count from that of the server-based URL shortener; displaying information from a destination website of the URL generated from the token and the template; or generating a URL according to a distinctive visual characteristic of the token indicator.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to online commerce and server client communication conducted over a network such as the Internet and more particularly to a client assisted mechanism for URL shortening that provides user visible iconography.

A uniform resource locater URL when used to reference a location e.g. a webpage or data file on the Internet often includes lengthy descriptive attributes which may represent for example data hierarchies command structures transaction paths and session information. Such a URL may be long difficult to read and virtually impossible to remember.

With the growing popularity of social networking websites that facilitate various forms of instant communication such as tweets and status updates which may also generally be referred to as microblogging and the concomitant use of microblogging applications for which efficient e.g. brief text communication is at a premium URL shorteners e.g. URL shortening services have emerged as a way to permit the inclusion of often very long URL links into a micro blog message while keeping short the character count of the message in order to fit within the size limitations of microblogging websites. URL shortening services do that by providing a shortened URL for a longer one and redirecting a user to the longer URL corresponding to the shortened one. Conventional URL shortening services may still result however in the use of a dozen characters or more for the shortened URL and are typically opaque to a user in the sense that the user can t tell from looking at the shortened link what clicking on the link will do e.g. show the user a photo or take the user to a product page.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures in which the showings therein are for purposes of illustrating the embodiments and not for purposes of limiting them.

Broadly speaking methods and systems are provided in one or more embodiments for a URL shortening system or service also referred to as URL shortener that may make use of client side support in contrast to a conventional URL shortener implemented on a server to create a shortened link to a web page having a much longer URL providing a new kind of URL shortener that relies on client side support to embed links to websites into for example a text message e.g. SMS text email tweet status update or other form of microblogging. URL shorteners according to one or more embodiments may be especially suited for commerce and payments but embodiments can also be used for many special purposes as well as generic applications. In one or more embodiments the shortened link may provide through the use of special symbols for example additional information to the user about the content of the link or where it points. One or more embodiments may be used e.g. by a user from the client device to produce full links to web pages from either a shortened text link a graphics image or a graphics image that includes some text information. In some embodiments the URL shortener may be implemented entirely on the client side device or for added flexibility of implementation and use may incorporate a server side component.

URL shortening services and provision of a client side URL shortener may be included in services provided by a service provider SP . The SP may for example provide libraries for a client device that can provide different versions or varying applications for embodiments of the client side URL shortener. Service provider services may also include for example an online payment service operating between consumers and merchants and may also be a service provided by a financial service provider FSP such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. in which a user of the service may have an account with the FSP referred to as an FSP account . In commercial applications a URL shortener service according to one or more embodiments could be used by a financial service provider s proprietary websites and mobile apps to generate and display shortened URLs and the URL shortener service techniques could be made available to non proprietary third party websites and applications to allow them to easily link back to the properties of the FSP or to others.

In one or more embodiments methods systems and computer program products are provided for a URL shortener that relies on client side support to embed links to websites into for example a text message e.g. SMS text email tweet status update or other form of microblogging and that provides additional capabilities. For example a computer implemented method may include recognizing a token indicator recognizing a token in conjunction with the token indicator selecting a template corresponding to the token indicator and providing an output or enabling a process according to the token and the template. Providing an output or executing a process enabled according to the token and the template may include one or more of generating a uniform resource locator URL in a computer readable form generating a uniform resource locator URL that is itself a server based URL shortener in which the token indicator is substituted for the server based URL shortener hostname to reduce the character count from that of the server based URL shortener displaying information from a destination website of a uniform resource locator URL generated from the token and the template and generating a uniform resource locator URL according to a distinctive visual characteristic of the token indicator.

User may also communicate via network with a website that may be for example a merchant website that is a seller of retail goods or a social networking website that facilitates communication of various forms such as microblogging between its users or subscribers. Website may operate online and may communicate with user for example by operating a server e.g. a computer processor that presents a website for social networking or selling goods. The server may respond to client devices e.g. client running on device by communicating over network . Website may also maintain a database and provide user accounts for its customers. Database may provide convenience for customers of a merchant website by allowing for example users to keep their shipping information on file with the merchant so as not to have to re enter information with every order or for example the merchant may like to offer promotions for users with an account on merchant website . For a social networking website for example database may provide subscriber or user information such as profiles and individual web pages.

Website may also communicate for example using server with SP through SP server over network . For example website may communicate with SP in the course of various services offered by SP to website such as payment intermediary between customers e.g. consumer user of website and website itself. For example a merchant website may use an application programming interface API that allows it to run apps and offer sale of goods in which customers are allowed to make payment through SP while consumer user may have an account with SP that allows consumer user to use the SP for making payments to sellers that allow use of authentication authorization and payment services also referred to as financial services of SP as a payment intermediary. In addition or alternatively a consumer user may have an account with SP for use of URL shortening services .

Also as shown in SP may provide electronic data storage in the form of database . Database may be used to keep track of user s accounts with SP whether for URL shortening services or financial services merchant s accounts with SP and transactions between customers merchants and stores including payments between the various entities for example. Database also may be used for operation of URL shortening services for example by providing updates and lookups to URL information stored in database . SP server may execute various application programming interfaces APIs that may enable various different types of relationships between SP and the different parties shown in . In addition SP may provide various APIs to its customers such as website e.g. API or user that enable those customers to implement embodiments of authentication authorization and payment services for example or URL shortener or URL shortening services .

Briefly URL shortener system may operate by defining one or more in a class of special characters to indicate the start of a token e.g. lexical symbol representing an entity that represents a URL. In one embodiment special characters may be taken from an extended character set so that special characters can not be confused with normal text. In another embodiment a pre defined graphics image may be recognized as indicating the start of a token. When the client e.g. Twitter app Facebook web page image capture app or image recognizer app executing on mobile device running client encounters one of these pre defined special characters or graphics images also referred to as an indicator or token indicator the client e.g. URL shortener running on mobile device may create a URL using the token that follows the special character or graphics image encountered.

Referring to URL shortener system may include a shortened URL generator for generating shortened URLs from longer URLs a mapping database for maintaining a correspondence between each longer URL and the shortened URL generated from the longer URL and a re director for enabling utilization of the shortened URLs by responding to a request from a client e.g. a browser or client application for a shortened URL by redirecting the client to the corresponding longer URL from which the shortened URL was generated. Thus shortened URL generator may provide for each new shortened URL that is generated from a longer one the longer URL and the shortened URL corresponding to the longer URL e.g. the shortened URL generated from that longer URL to the mapping database . Likewise re director may access database to find the longer URL corresponding to a requested shortened URL e.g. the longer URL from which the requested shorter URL was generated in responding to each new request to be directed to a shortened URL.

Referring to URL shortener system may include an entry point for receiving input e.g. encountering a special character or graphics image and associated text information and one or more templates for providing URL link information. URL shortener system also may include a parser for providing syntactic analysis of the received input and providing specific outputs e.g. shortened URLs or other links or enabling a process that may then be executed based for example on syntactic analysis of the entry point inputs and an associated template . Parser as shown in may be in communication with an SP provided library that may include for example various data files including one or more templates as well as other data and computer readable and executable instructions that may facilitate implementation of URL shortener system e.g. as URL shortener on mobile device . Libraries may for example be downloaded from SP to mobile device .

URL shortener system may be implemented for example as a process executing on a client device such as mobile device and may for example be physically embodied as computer readable and executable instructions stored in a memory of mobile device . In one or more embodiments portions of URL shortener system may be implemented as processes executing on a server device e.g. SP server or website server that is in communication for example over network with mobile device .

URL shortener system may encounter or receive input through or at entry point . Entry point may for example be implemented as a process executing on a device and physically embodied in a memory of the device. Entry point may receive input for example from user from an app e.g. a web browser running on mobile device from imaging device e.g. via image and text recognition software or from communication via network with for example SP or website . Entry point may recognize certain indicators also referred to as identifiers or markers as the start of a token that represents a URL. Token may be used here to mean a group of input symbols that can be recognized e.g. by parser as a grammatical symbol representing some grammatical entity such as a name a number punctuation or a URL for example.

Entry point may as disclosed above recognize certain specified or pre defined special characters taken from an extended character set. For example characters such as and which may be pictographic in nature and may thereby enable a number of novel features in URL shortener system may be recognized as token indicators.

For an example of such novel features if the indicator character were and the client were programmed to recognize as a special character that represented a book which may have an International Standard Book Number ISBN the client side URL shortener system could turn the string 1234567890123 into a URL link to a book with ISBN number 1234567890123 on a commerce site such as half.com bn.com or amazon.com. For another example an indicator character such as in conjunction with a number like 12345 could turn into an email address e.g. mailto URL with the help of a server side lookup that maps the number 12345 into a particular email address.

Also the use of a visually distinctive character to indicate a reference may allow users to visually recognize the content and destination of short URLs by association with each visually distinctive character. For example similar to representing a book or other form of writing and representing an email or other form of message or communication in the examples given previously an could represent links related to weather or a might be used for making a payment. Such visual recognition of by a user and associations made with distinctive graphics or special character symbols may become especially important if the client e.g. mobile device does not yet support the new shortened URLs as the user may still be able to recognize the distinctive symbols as links and could proactively resolve them using for example a website where the user may enter the text and be redirected to the proper website or URL.

Entry point also may recognize certain graphics images e.g. graphics image which may be pre defined so as to be recognizable by URL shortener system as token indicators. One example of such graphics images is a graphics representation of event tickets along with some corresponding text information e.g. graphics image and text information . Some or all of text information may for example serve as a token indicated by graphics image which text information accompanies. The use of graphics images as token indicators in URL shortener system even more so than special characters also may enable a multiplicity and variety of additional features in URL shortener system examples of which are given above for the case of special characters. Graphics images may further provide a means for advertisers or content providers to display token indicators for example in a more attractive visually appealing or a more consumer recognizable form such as the example given above of graphics image displaying a consumer recognizable image of event tickets.

Pre defined indicators both graphics and textual may be periodically updated for example as new graphics images or new identifier characters may be added or other changes made to URL shortener system . For example with the recent addition of emoji characters to the Unicode 6.0 character set the range of possible character symbols that could be used as indicators grows dramatically. For text fonts that support the Unicode 6.0 characters the emoji range may include characters for a variety of useful symbols including convenience stores gas stations restaurants banks and other symbols which could be used to differentiate a variety of commerce sites making them ideally suited for use as token indicators.

URL shortener system also may include one or more templates . Templates may be stored as computer readable data for example on mobile device in libraries as noted above in mapping database on server or server . Each template may be associated with one or more token indicators so that for example when a particular token indicator is recognized e.g. a special character or pre specified graphics image a corresponding particular template associated with the particular token indicator may be found. A template may be an alphanumeric string for example for which one or more optional portions of the string may be chosen according to a strict rule or grammar having slots or spaces into which parameter values may be plugged in or substituted or other various types of features in any combination. For example a URL template for use in finding an item at an online auction website might be http cgi.ebay.com itemId n where n may substituted with the characters following an identifier e.g. token characters following a token indicator .

URL shortener system may include a parser . Parser may for example be implemented as a process executing on a device and physically embodied in a memory of the device. For example parser may be implemented on a mobile device running client as part of a client side URL shortener . Parser may receive inputs e.g. a token indicator such as a special character or pre defined graphics image from entry point as seen in . Parser may access a template as seen in . For example parser may retrieve a template from a library from database or from a memory of a device on which parser is installed. Parser may use the input e.g. token indicator graphics or character and one or more templates to construct for example a URL a shortened link e.g. one that could be looked up by a re director of system or a conventional server based system a link for an email address lookup as given in a foregoing example or other form of useful output or enabled process as illustrated by the foregoing examples.

At step a collection of token indicators which may for example serve for identifying tokens in lexical analysis and may also be referred to as markers or identifiers may be defined or specified to indicate the start of a URL token. Step may include for example and as described above one or more of specifying one or more in a class of special characters specifying characters that may be recognized as being distinct from normal text or specifying a graphics image which may be recognizable by an image capture device or image recognition software of mobile device . The specification of each token indicator may include an association with a particular functionality of the indicator. For example may be associated with an email or other form of text message or communication functionality and may be associated with links to weather related sites as illustrated in the foregoing examples.

An association of a single symbol or graphic to a particular domain or site e.g. in the example of the indicator character recognized as representing a book with the client side URL shortener system turning the string 1234567890123 into a URL link to a book with ISBN number 1234567890123 on a commerce site such as http half.com can be shorter using the special character to encode the URL s hostname than the conventional server based URL shortener which typically uses a minimum of 14 and generally closer to 20 characters to encode the URL s hostname. Also association of a single symbol or graphic to a particular domain or other functionality may allow users to recognize the content and destination of short URLs visually e.g. as described in the foregoing examples concerning books or other particular commercial items emails and weather related sites.

At step method may include specifying a template associated with each pre defined or pre specified token indicator resulting from step . Specifying a template may include for some token indicators specifying a choice of templates depending on the various types of token that may be associated with a particular token indicator. For example for the special character token indicator representing an email or other form of message or communication one e.g. a first template could be specified so that a number like 12345 could turn into an email address e.g. mailto URL with the help of a server side lookup that maps the number 12345 into a particular email address as in the example given above while another e.g. a second template could be specified for the same special character so that a different type of character string like S123 could similarly turn into an SMS phone number with the help of a server side lookup that maps the string S123 into a particular SMS phone number. Thus a number such as 12345 may be defined as being one type of token and a string with an S followed by a number such as S123 may be defined as being another type of token so that each token recognizable by for example method or systems or may have a type or a token type associated with the token. Thus multiple templates may be associated with any token indicator and a template may be associated with a token indicator for each type of token expected to found in conjunction with the token indicator.

At step method may include recognizing a token indicator from an input such as a graphics image or a string of characters in text. When the client e.g. URL shortener in communication with a browser or mobile phone app running on mobile device comes across one of the special characters for example the client may be able to recognize a token that follows the special character or graphics image encountered. For example URL shortener may receive or take input from a browser mobile phone app running on mobile device direct input from a user e.g. via phone keypad or touchscreen or graphics image from imaging device when a user for example takes a picture or scans a display that may include graphics image with text information . The token indicator may be recognized from a string of text or information including the graphics image for example by using a parser to scan and analyze the input.

At step method may include recognizing a token in conjunction with the token indicator including recognizing additional information from the type or token type of the token. In one embodiment for example URL shortener may be implemented through the use of a client side parser. The parser may scan the text or graphics to display searching for an occurrence of the predefined special characters or predefined graphics image. For example a token may be recognized in conjunction with an indicator character as a character string following the indicator character. A token may also be recognized in conjunction with an indicator character as a character string that occurs in some grammatical construct with the indicator character that is parsable by the parser. With a graphics image e.g. graphics image a token may be recognizable as part of the graphics image for example or may be recognized using character recognition for graphics text e.g. text information accompanying a graphics image then parsing the recognized characters of text as a token. In addition the parser may be able to recognize a type for the token by further parsing the token itself and may be able to glean additional information from the token that can be used for providing various specific outputs or enabling specific processes. For example in one of the foregoing examples recognizing a token as an ISBN allows method to provide as output a URL link to a book with ISBN number 1234567890123 on a commerce site such as half.com.

At step method may include selecting a template corresponding to the token indicator or selecting a template according to the token indicator and the token type. For the example just presented the token indicator representing books or writings e.g. may be recognized so that the parser may then know to further parse the token for its type allowing the parser to then recognize the token as an ISBN number and provide as output a URL link to a book with ISBN number 1234567890123 on a commerce site such as half.com. Providing such a URL link may be accomplished for example by searching a multiplicity of templates corresponding to e.g. associated with or specified for in steps the token indicator representing books or writings e.g. and selecting one of those templates whose associated token type matches that of the type of token e.g. an ISBN number recognized in conjunction with the token indicator.

At step method may include providing an output or enabling a process according to the token and the template. After the client e.g. mobile device recognizes a token indicator whether graphic or text character and parses a token encountered in conjunction with the token indicator the client may provide an output for example by constructing a URL by inserting the characters from the token into a template corresponding to e.g. specified for or associated with in steps or the token indicator to generate a URL in a computer readable form.

For example a client device or app executing method upon finding the string 12345 may recognize one of the special identifier characters e.g. as a token indicator then parse the character string e.g. 12345 following the identifier token indicator as a token and then substitute the token into the template selected e.g. step for the token indicator. So for a URL template such as http cgi.ebay.com itemId n where n is to be substituted with a character string the character string to be substituted may be the token found in conjunction with the token indicator in this example 12345 producing the URL http cgi.ebay.com itemId 12345 e.g. URL in a computer readable form .

Because the destination e.g. http cgi.ebay.com of the short URL e.g. 12345 may be known to the client e.g. URL shortener running on mobile device in advance the client e.g. mobile device may present a more attractive experience to the user by displaying information from the destination website of the URL generated from the token and the template for example by displaying the name of the auction in the case of the eBay site in this example. Also the destination URL could itself be a server based shortener similar to conventional server based URL shorteners with the identifier character token indicator taking the place of the URL shortener hostname e.g. http is.gd or http bit.ly to reduce the length of the conventional URL shortener still further.

In addition the specification of templates corresponding to special characters or graphics images as token indicators allows method to provide an output e.g. generate a URL or provide some other function according to a distinctive visual characteristic of the token indicator. This use of a distinctive character or distinctive graphic to indicate a visually distinctive reference for visual association to a corresponding function may enable a user to recognize the distinctive symbols as URL links for example or to recognize the content and destination of short URLs visually by association with each distinctive character.

For example using foregoing examples for illustration method may provide as output a URL or some process or action related to a visually distinctive characteristic of one or more symbols or graphic images. To illustrate consider each of a writing symbol an envelope symbol and an umbrella symbol used in the foregoing examples. One visually distinctive characteristic of the writing symbol may suggest books or other writings and one output could be the process of finding a book with an ISBN number following the writing symbol and providing a URL link to the book on a preferred website as in the foregoing examples. A visually distinctive characteristic of the envelope symbol could suggest messages in various formats and example outputs could be providing an email address or an SMS phone number for text messaging depending on the token type of the token found in conjunction with the envelope symbol as in the foregoing examples. A visually distinctive characteristic of the umbrella symbol could suggest things related to weather and suggest to the user that the client will provide a weather related URL link as output as in the foregoing examples.
