The data objects or content processed and stored by the cache manager may include data in any format such as a markup language or any type of data communicated via any protocol. In some embodiments the cache manager duplicates original data stored elsewhere or data previously computed generated or transmitted in which the original data may require longer access time to fetch compute or otherwise obtain relative to reading a cache memory or storage element. Once the data is stored in the cache future use can be made by accessing the cached copy rather than refetching or recomputing the original data thereby reducing the access time.

In another embodiment the compression engine applies context sensitive compression. In this embodiment the compression engine utilizes knowledge of the data type to select a specific compression algorithm from a suite of suitable algorithms. In some embodiments knowledge of the specific protocol is used to perform context sensitive compression. In one embodiment the appliance or compression engine can use port numbers e.g. well known ports as well as data from the connection itself to determine the appropriate compression algorithm to use. Some protocols use only a single type of data requiring only a single compression algorithm that can be selected when the connection is established.

The compression engine may first use the cache based data to determine one or more data matches for compression and then may check the memory based data to determine one or more data matches for compression. In another case the compression engine may check disk storage for data matches for compression after checking either the cache based and or memory based data history.

In one embodiment multi protocol compression engine compresses bi directionally between clients and servers any TCP IP based protocol including Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI email File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Common Internet File System CIFS protocol file transfer Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol Remote Desktop Protocol RDP Wireless Application Protocol WAP Mobile IP protocol and Voice Over IP VoIP protocol.

The LAN WAN detector includes any logic business rules function or operations for automatically detecting a slow side connection e.g. a wide area network WAN connection such as an Intranet and associated port and a fast side connection e.g. a local area network LAN connection and an associated port . In some embodiments the LAN WAN detector monitors network traffic on the network ports of the appliance to detect a synchronization packet sometimes referred to as a tagged network packet. The synchronization packet identifies a type or speed of the network traffic. In one embodiment the synchronization packet identifies a WAN speed or WAN type connection. The LAN WAN detector also identifies receipt of an acknowledgement packet to a tagged synchronization packet and on which port it is received. The appliance then configures itself to operate the identified port on which the tagged synchronization packet arrived so that the speed on that port is set to be the speed associated with the network connected to that port. The other port is then set to the speed associated with the network connected to that port.

For ease of discussion herein reference to fast side will be made with respect to connection with a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and operating at a network speed of the WAN. Likewise reference to slow side will be made with respect to connection with a local area network LAN and operating at a network speed the LAN. However it is noted that fast and slow sides in a network can change on a per connection basis and are relative terms to the speed of the network connections or to the type of network topology. Such configurations are useful in complex network topologies where a network is fast or slow only when compared to adjacent networks and not in any absolute sense.

In one embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to allow for auto discovery by an appliance of a network to which it connects. In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to detect the existence or presence of a second appliance deployed in the network . For example an auto discovery mechanism in operation in accordance with functions as follows appliance and are placed in line with the connection linking client and server . The appliances and are at the ends of a low speed link e.g. Internet connecting two LANs. In one example embodiment appliances and each include two ports one to connect with the lower speed link and the other to connect with a higher speed link e.g. a LAN. Any packet arriving at one port is copied to the other port. Thus appliance and are each configured to function as a bridge between the two networks .

When an end node such as the client opens a new TCP connection with another end node such as the server the client sends a TCP packet with a synchronization SYN header bit set or a SYN packet to the server . In the present example client opens a transport layer connection to server . When the SYN packet passes through appliance the appliance inserts attaches or otherwise provides a characteristic TCP header option to the packet which announces its presence. If the packet passes through a second appliance in this example appliance the second appliance notes the header option on the SYN packet. The server responds to the SYN packet with a synchronization acknowledgment SYN ACK packet. When the SYN ACK packet passes through appliance a TCP header option is tagged e.g. attached inserted or added to the SYN ACK packet to announce appliance presence to appliance . When appliance receives this packet both appliances are now aware of each other and the connection can be appropriately accelerated.

Further to the operations of the LAN WAN detector a method or process for detecting fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN packet is described. During a transport layer connection establishment between a client and a server the appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configure the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The appliance then tags the SYN packet with an ACK and copies the packet to the other port.

In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector detects fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN ACK packet. The appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN ACK packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet was tagged. If the SYN packet was not tagged the appliance copied the packet to the other port. If the SYN packet was tagged the appliance tags the SYN ACK packet before copying it to the other port.

The appliance may add insert modify attach or otherwise provide any information or data in the TCP option header to provide any information data or characteristics about the network connection network traffic flow or the configuration or operation of the appliance . In this manner not only does an appliance announce its presence to another appliance or tag a higher or lower speed connection the appliance provides additional information and data via the TCP option headers about the appliance or the connection. The TCP option header information may be useful to or used by an appliance in controlling managing optimizing acceleration or improving the network traffic flow traversing the appliance or to otherwise configure itself or operation of a network port.

Although generally described in conjunction with detecting speeds of network connections or the presence of appliances the LAN WAN detector can be used for applying any type of function logic or operation of the appliance to a port connection or flow of network traffic. In particular automated assignment of ports can occur whenever a device performs different functions on different ports where the assignment of a port to a task can be made during the unit s operation and or the nature of the network segment on each port is discoverable by the appliance .

The flow controller includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of transport layer communications of network packets or the delivery of packets at the transport layer. A flow controller also sometimes referred to as a flow control module regulates manages and controls data transfer rates. In some embodiments the flow controller is deployed at or connected at a bandwidth bottleneck in the network . In one embodiment the flow controller effectively regulates manages and controls bandwidth usage or utilization. In other embodiments the flow control modules may also be deployed at points on the network of latency transitions low latency to high latency and on links with media losses such as wireless or satellite links .

In some embodiments a flow controller may include a receiver side flow control module for controlling the rate of receipt of network transmissions and a sender side flow control module for the controlling the rate of transmissions of network packets. In other embodiments a first flow controller includes a receiver side flow control module and a second flow controller includes a sender side flow control module. In some embodiments a first flow controller is deployed on a first appliance and a second flow controller is deployed on a second appliance . As such in some embodiments a first appliance controls the flow of data on the receiver side and a second appliance controls the data flow from the sender side. In yet another embodiment a single appliance includes flow control for both the receiver side and sender side of network communications traversing the appliance .

In one embodiment a flow control module is configured to allow bandwidth at the bottleneck to be more fully utilized and in some embodiments not overutilized. In some embodiments the flow control module transparently buffers or rebuffers data already buffered by for example the sender network sessions that pass between nodes having associated flow control modules . When a session passes through two or more flow control modules one or more of the flow control modules controls a rate of the session s .

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured with predetermined data relating to bottleneck bandwidth. In another embodiment the flow control module may be configured to detect the bottleneck bandwidth or data associated therewith. Unlike conventional network protocols such as TCP a receiver side flow control module controls the data transmission rate. The receiver side flow control module controls the sender side flow control module e.g. data transmission rate by forwarding transmission rate limits to the sender side flow control module . In one embodiment the receiver side flow control module piggybacks these transmission rate limits on acknowledgement ACK packets or signals sent to the sender e.g. client by the receiver e.g. server . The receiver side flow control module does this in response to rate control requests that are sent by the sender side flow control module . The requests from the sender side flow control module may be piggybacked on data packets sent by the sender .

In some embodiments the flow controller manipulates adjusts simulates changes improves or otherwise adapts the behavior of the transport layer protocol to provide improved performance or operations of delivery data rates and or bandwidth utilization of the transport layer. The flow controller may implement a plurality of data flow control techniques at the transport layer including but not limited to 1 pre acknowledgements 2 window virtualization 3 recongestion techniques 3 local retransmission techniques 4 wavefront detection and disambiguation 5 transport control protocol selective acknowledgements 6 transaction boundary detection techniques and 7 repacketization.

Although a sender may be generally described herein as a client and a receiver as a server a sender may be any end point such as a server or any computing device on the network . Likewise a receiver may be a client or any other computing device on the network .

In brief overview of a pre acknowledgement flow control technique the flow controller in some embodiments handles the acknowledgements and retransmits for a sender effectively terminating the sender s connection with the downstream portion of a network connection. In reference to one possible deployment of an appliance into a network architecture to implement this feature is depicted. In this example environment a sending computer or client transmits data on network for example via a switch which determines that the data is destined for VPN appliance . Because of the chosen network topology all data destined for VPN appliance traverses appliance so the appliance can apply any necessary algorithms to this data.

Continuing further with the example the client transmits a packet which is received by the appliance . When the appliance receives the packet which is transmitted from the client to a recipient via the VPN appliance the appliance retains a copy of the packet and forwards the packet downstream to the VPN appliance . The appliance then generates an acknowledgement packet ACK and sends the ACK packet back to the client or sending endpoint. This ACK a pre acknowledgment causes the sender to believe that the packet has been delivered successfully freeing the sender s resources for subsequent processing. The appliance retains the copy of the packet data in the event that a retransmission of the packet is required so that the sender does not have to handle retransmissions of the data. This early generation of acknowledgements may be called preacking. 

If a retransmission of the packet is required the appliance retransmits the packet to the sender. The appliance may determine whether retransmission is required as a sender would in a traditional system for example determining that a packet is lost if an acknowledgement has not been received for the packet after a predetermined amount of time. To this end the appliance monitors acknowledgements generated by the receiving endpoint e.g. server or any other downstream network entity so that it can determine whether the packet has been successfully delivered or needs to be retransmitted. If the appliance determines that the packet has been successfully delivered the appliance is free to discard the saved packet data. The appliance may also inhibit forwarding acknowledgements for packets that have already been received by the sending endpoint.

In the embodiment described above the appliance via the flow controller controls the sender through the delivery of pre acknowledgements also referred to as preacks as though the appliance was a receiving endpoint itself. Since the appliance is not an endpoint and does not actually consume the data the appliance includes a mechanism for providing overflow control to the sending endpoint. Without overflow control the appliance could run out of memory because the appliance stores packets that have been preacked to the sending endpoint but not yet acknowledged as received by the receiving endpoint. Therefore in a situation in which the sender transmits packets to the appliance faster than the appliance can forward the packets downstream the memory available in the appliance to store unacknowledged packet data can quickly fill. A mechanism for overflow control allows the appliance to control transmission of the packets from the sender to avoid this problem.

In one embodiment the appliance or flow controller includes an inherent self clocking overflow control mechanism. This self clocking is due to the order in which the appliance may be designed to transmit packets downstream and send ACKs to the sender or . In some embodiments the appliance does not preack the packet until after it transmits the packet downstream. In this way the sender will receive the ACKs at the rate at which the appliance is able to transmit packets rather than the rate at which the appliance receives packets from the sender . This helps to regulate the transmission of packets from a sender .

Another overflow control mechanism that the appliance may implement is to use the TCP window size parameter which tells a sender how much buffer the receiver is permitting the sender to fill up. A nonzero window size e.g. a size of at least one Maximum Segment Size MSS in a preack permits the sending endpoint to continue to deliver data to the appliance whereas a zero window size inhibits further data transmission. Accordingly the appliance may regulate the flow of packets from the sender for example when the appliance s buffer is becoming full by appropriately setting the TCP window size in each preack.

Another technique to reduce this additional overhead is to apply hysteresis. When the appliance delivers data to the slower side the overflow control mechanism in the appliance can require that a minimum amount of space be available before sending a nonzero window advertisement to the sender. In one embodiment the appliance waits until there is a minimum of a predetermined number of packets such as four packets of space available before sending a nonzero window packet such as a window size of four packet . This reduces the overhead by approximately a factor four since only two ACK packets are sent for each group of four data packets instead of eight ACK packets for four data packets.

Another technique the appliance or flow controller may use for overflow control is the TCP delayed ACK mechanism which skips ACKs to reduce network traffic. The TCP delayed ACKs automatically delay the sending of an ACK either until two packets are received or until a fixed timeout has occurred. This mechanism alone can result in cutting the overhead in half moreover by increasing the numbers of packets above two additional overhead reduction is realized. But merely delaying the ACK itself may be insufficient to control overflow and the appliance may also use the advertised window mechanism on the ACKs to control the sender. When doing this the appliance in one embodiment avoids triggering the timeout mechanism of the sender by delaying the ACK too long.

In one embodiment the flow controller does not preack the last packet of a group of packets. By not preacking the last packet or at least one of the packets in the group the appliance avoids a false acknowledgement for a group of packets. For example if the appliance were to send a preack for a last packet and the packet were subsequently lost the sender would have been tricked into thinking that the packet is delivered when it was not. Thinking that the packet had been delivered the sender could discard that data. If the appliance also lost the packet there would be no way to retransmit the packet to the recipient. By not preacking the last packet of a group of packets the sender will not discard the packet until it has been delivered.

In another embodiment the flow controller may use a window virtualization technique to control the rate of flow or bandwidth utilization of a network connection. Though it may not immediately be apparent from examining conventional literature such as RFC 1323 there is effectively a send window for transport layer protocols such as TCP. The send window is similar to the receive window in that it consumes buffer space though on the sender . The sender s send window consists of all data sent by the application that has not been acknowledged by the receiver. This data must be retained in memory in case retransmission is required. Since memory is a shared resource some TCP stack implementations limit the size of this data. When the send window is full an attempt by an application program to send more data results in blocking the application program until space is available. Subsequent reception of acknowledgements will free send window memory and unblock the application program. In some embodiments this window size is known as the socket buffer size in some TCP implementations.

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured to provide access to increased window or buffer sizes. This configuration may also be referenced to as window virtualization. In the embodiment of TCP as the transport layer protocol the TCP header includes a bit string corresponding to a window scale. In one embodiment window may be referenced in a context of send receive or both.

One embodiment of window virtualization is to insert a preacking appliance into a TCP session. In reference to any of the environments of initiation of a data communication session between a source node e.g. client for ease of discussion now referenced as source node and a destination node e.g. server for ease of discussion now referenced as destination node is established. For TCP communications the source node initially transmits a synchronization signal SYN through its local area network to first flow control module . The first flow control module inserts a configuration identifier into the TCP header options area. The configuration identifier identifies this point in the data path as a flow control module.

The appliances via a flow control module provide window or buffer to allow increasing data buffering capabilities within a session despite having end nodes with small buffer sizes e.g. typically 16 k bytes. However RFC 1323 requires window scaling for any buffer sizes greater than 64 k bytes which must be set at the time of session initialization SYN SYN ACK signals . Moreover the window scaling corresponds to the lowest common denominator in the data path often an end node with small buffer size. This window scale often is a scale of 0 or 1 which corresponds to a buffer size of up to 64 k or 128 k bytes. Note that because the window size is defined as the window field in each packet shifted over by the window scale the window scale establishes an upper limit for the buffer but does not guarantee the buffer is actually that large. Each packet indicates the current available buffer space at the receiver in the window field.

In one embodiment of scaling using the window virtualization technique during connection establishment i.e. initialization of a session when the first flow control module receives from the source node the SYN signal or packet the flow control module stores the windows scale of the source node which is the previous node or stores a 0 for window scale if the scale of the previous node is missing. The first flow control module also modifies the scale e.g. increases the scale to 4 from 0 or 1 in the SYN FCM signal. When the second flow control module receives the SYN signal it stores the increased scale from the first flow control signal and resets the scale in the SYN signal back to the source node scale value for transmission to the destination node . When the second flow controller receives the SYN ACK signal from the destination node it stores the scale from the destination node scale e.g. 0 or 1 and modifies it to an increased scale that is sent with the SYN ACK FCM signal. The first flow control node receives and notes the received window scale and revises the windows scale sent back to the source node back down to the original scale e.g. 0 or 1. Based on the above window shift conversation during connection establishment the window field in every subsequent packet e.g. TCP packet of the session must be shifted according to the window shift conversion.

The window scale as described above expresses buffer sizes of over 64 k and may not be required for window virtualization. Thus shifts for window scale may be used to express increased buffer capacity in each flow control module . This increase in buffer capacity in may be referenced as window or buffer virtualization. The increase in buffer size allows greater packet through put from and to the respective end nodes and . Note that buffer sizes in TCP are typically expressed in terms of bytes but for ease of discussion packets may be used in the description herein as it relates to virtualization.

By way of example a window or buffer virtualization performed by the flow controller is described. In this example the source node and the destination node are configured similar to conventional end nodes having a limited buffer capacity of 16 k bytes which equals approximately 10 packets of data. Typically an end node must wait until the packet is transmitted and confirmation is received before a next group of packets can be transmitted. In one embodiment using increased buffer capacity in the flow control modules when the source node transmits its data packets the first flow control module receives the packets stores it in its larger capacity buffer e.g. 512 packet capacity and immediately sends back an acknowledgement signal indicating receipt of the packets REC ACK back to the source node . The source node can then flush its current buffer load it with 10 new data packets and transmit those onto the first flow control module . Again the first flow control module transmits a REC ACK signal back to the source node and the source node flushes its buffer and loads it with 10 more new packets for transmission.

As the first flow control module receives the data packets from the source nodes it loads up its buffer accordingly. When it is ready the first flow control module can begin transmitting the data packets to the second flow control module which also has an increased buffer size for example to receive 512 packets. The second flow control module receives the data packets and begins to transmit 10 packets at a time to the destination node . Each REC ACK received at the second flow control node from the destination node results in 10 more packets being transmitted to the destination node until all the data packets are transferred. Hence the present invention is able to increase data transmission throughput between the source node sender and the destination node receiver by taking advantage of the larger buffer in the flow control modules between the devices.

It is noted that by preacking the transmission of data as described previously a sender or source node is allowed to transmit more data than is possible without the preacks thus affecting a larger window size. For example in one embodiment this technique is effective when the flow control module is located near a node e.g. source node or destination node that lacks large windows.

Another technique or algorithm of the flow controller is referred to as recongestion. The standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithms are known to perform poorly in the face of certain network conditions including large RTTs round trip times high packet loss rates and others. When the appliance detects a congestion condition such as long round trip times or high packet loss the appliance intervenes substituting an alternate congestion avoidance algorithm that better suits the particular network condition. In one embodiment the recongestion algorithm uses preacks to effectively terminate the connection between the sender and the receiver. The appliance then resends the packets from itself to the receiver using a different congestion avoidance algorithm. Recongestion algorithms may be dependent on the characteristics of the TCP connection. The appliance monitors each TCP connection characterizing it with respect to the different dimensions selecting a recongestion algorithm that is appropriate for the current characterization.

In one embodiment upon detecting a TCP connection that is limited by round trip times RTT a recongestion algorithm is applied which behaves as multiple TCP connections. Each TCP connection operates within its own performance limit but the aggregate bandwidth achieves a higher performance level. One parameter in this mechanism is the number of parallel connections that are applied N . Too large a value of N and the connection bundle achieves more than its fair share of bandwidth. Too small a value of N and the connection bundle achieves less than its fair share of bandwidth. One method of establishing N relies on the appliance monitoring the packet loss rate RTT and packet size of the actual connection. These numbers are plugged into a TCP response curve formula to provide an upper limit on the performance of a single TCP connection in the present configuration. If each connection within the connection bundle is achieving substantially the same performance as that computed to be the upper limit then additional parallel connections are applied. If the current bundle is achieving less performance than the upper limit the number of parallel connections is reduced. In this manner the overall fairness of the system is maintained since individual connection bundles contain no more parallelism than is required to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the protocol itself. Furthermore each individual connection retains TCP compliance.

Another method of establishing N is to utilize a parallel flow control algorithm such as the TCP Vegas algorithm or its improved version Stabilized Vegas. In this method the network information associated with the connections in the connection bundle e.g. RTT loss rate average packet size etc. is aggregated and applied to the alternate flow control algorithm. The results of this algorithm are in turn distributed among the connections of the bundle controlling their number i.e. N . Optionally each connection within the bundle continues using the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.

In another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are virtualized i.e. actual individual TCP connections are not established. Instead the congestion avoidance algorithm is modified to behave as though there were N parallel connections. This method has the advantage of appearing to transiting network nodes as a single connection. Thus the QOS security and other monitoring methods of these nodes are unaffected by the recongestion algorithm. In yet another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are real i.e. a separate. TCP connection is established for each of the parallel connections within a bundle. The congestion avoidance algorithm for each TCP connection need not be modified.

In some embodiments the flow controller may apply a local retransmission technique. One reason for implementing preacks is to prepare to transit a high loss link e.g. wireless . In these embodiments the preacking appliance or flow control module is located most beneficially before the wireless link. This allows retransmissions to be performed closer to the high loss link removing the retransmission burden from the remainder of the network. The appliance may provide local retransmission in which case packets dropped due to failures of the link are retransmitted directly by the appliance . This is advantageous because it eliminates the retransmission burden upon an end node such as server and infrastructure of any of the networks . With appliance providing local retransmissions the dropped packet can be retransmitted across the high loss link without necessitating a retransmit by an end node and a corresponding decrease in the rate of data transmission from the end node.

Another reason for implementing preacks is to avoid a receive time out RTO penalty. In standard TCP there are many situations that result in an RTO even though a large percentage of the packets in flight were successfully received. With standard TCP algorithms dropping more than one packet within an RTT window would likely result in a timeout. Additionally most TCP connections experience a timeout if a retransmitted packet is dropped. In a network with a high bandwidth delay product even a relatively small packet loss rate will cause frequent Retransmission timeouts RTOs . In one embodiment the appliance uses a retransmit and timeout algorithm is avoid premature RTOs. The appliance or flow controller maintains a count of retransmissions is maintained on a per packet basis. Each time that a packet is retransmitted the count is incremented by one and the appliance continues to transmit packets. In some embodiments only if a packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times is an RTO declared.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller uses wavefront detection and disambiguation techniques in managing and controlling flow of network traffic. In this technique the flow controller uses transmit identifiers or numbers to determine whether particular data packets need to be retransmitted. By way of example a sender transmits data packets over a network where each instance of a transmitted data packet is associated with a transmit number. It can be appreciated that the transmit number for a packet is not the same as the packet s sequence number since a sequence number references the data in the packet while the transmit number references an instance of a transmission of that data. The transmit number can be any information usable for this purpose including a timestamp associated with a packet or simply an increasing number similar to a sequence number or a packet number . Because a data segment may be retransmitted different transmit numbers may be associated with a particular sequence number.

As the sender transmits data packets the sender maintains a data structure of acknowledged instances of data packet transmissions. Each instance of a data packet transmission is referenced by its sequence number and transmit number. By maintaining a transmit number for each packet the sender retains the ordering of the transmission of data packets. When the sender receives an ACK or a SACK the sender determines the highest transmit number associated with packets that the receiver indicated has arrived in the received acknowledgement . Any outstanding unacknowledged packets with lower transmit numbers are presumed lost.

In some embodiments the sender is presented with an ambiguous situation when the arriving packet has been retransmitted a standard ACK SACK does not contain enough information to allow the sender to determine which transmission of the arriving packet has triggered the acknowledgement. After receiving an ambiguous acknowledgement therefore the sender disambiguates the acknowledgement to associate it with a transmit number. In various embodiments one or a combination of several techniques may be used to resolve this ambiguity.

In one embodiment the sender includes an identifier with a transmitted data packet and the receiver returns that identifier or a function thereof with the acknowledgement. The identifier may be a timestamp e.g. a TCP timestamp as described in RFC 1323 a sequential number or any other information that can be used to resolve between two or more instances of a packet s transmission. In an embodiment in which the TCP timestamp option is used to disambiguate the acknowledgement each packet is tagged with up to 32 bits of unique information. Upon receipt of the data packet the receiver echoes this unique information back to the sender with the acknowledgement. The sender ensures that the originally sent packet and its retransmitted version or versions contain different values for the timestamp option allowing it to unambiguously eliminate the ACK ambiguity. The sender may maintain this unique information for example in the data structure in which it stores the status of sent data packets. This technique is advantageous because it complies with industry standards and is thus likely to encounter little or no interoperability issues. However this technique may require ten bytes of TCP header space in some implementations reducing the effective throughput rate on the network and reducing space available for other TCP options.

In another embodiment another field in the packet such as the IP ID field is used to disambiguate in a way similar to the TCP timestamp option described above. The sender arranges for the ID field values of the original and the retransmitted version or versions of the packet to have different ID fields in the IP header. Upon reception of the data packet at the receiver or a proxy device thereof the receiver sets the ID field of the ACK packet to a function of the ID field of the packet that triggers the ACK. This method is advantageous as it requires no additional data to be sent preserving the efficiency of the network and TCP header space. The function chosen should provide a high degree of likelihood of providing disambiguation. In a preferred embodiment the sender selects IP ID values with the most significant bit set to 0. When the receiver responds the IP ID value is set to the same IP ID value with the most significant bit set to a one.

In another embodiment the transmit numbers associated with non ambiguous acknowledgements are used to disambiguate an ambiguous acknowledgement. This technique is based on the principle that acknowledgements for two packets will tend to be received closer in time as the packets are transmitted closer in time. Packets that are not retransmitted will not result in ambiguity as the acknowledgements received for such packets can be readily associated with a transmit number. Therefore these known transmit numbers are compared to the possible transmit numbers for an ambiguous acknowledgement received near in time to the known acknowledgement. The sender compares the transmit numbers of the ambiguous acknowledgement against the last known received transmit number selecting the one closest to the known received transmit number. For example if an acknowledgement for data packet is received and the last received acknowledgement was for data packet the sender resolves the ambiguity by assuming that the third instance of data packet caused the acknowledgement.

Another technique of the appliance or flow controller is to implement an embodiment of transport control protocol selective acknowledgements or TCP SACK to determine what packets have or have not been received. This technique allows the sender to determine unambiguously a list of packets that have been received by the receiver as well as an accurate list of packets not received. This functionality may be implemented by modifying the sender and or receiver or by inserting sender and receiver side flow control modules in the network path between the sender and receiver. In reference to or a sender e.g. client is configured to transmit data packets to the receiver e.g. server over the network . In response the receiver returns a TCP Selective Acknowledgment option referred to as SACK packet to the sender. In one embodiment the communication is bi directional although only one direction of communication is discussed here for simplicity. The receiver maintains a list or other suitable data structure that contains a group of ranges of sequence numbers for data packets that the receiver has actually received. In some embodiments the list is sorted by sequence number in an ascending or descending order. The receiver also maintains a left off pointer which comprises a reference into the list and indicates the left off point from the previously generated SACK packet.

Upon reception of a data packet the receiver generates and transmits a SACK packet back to the sender. In some embodiments the SACK packet includes a number of fields each of which can hold a range of sequence numbers to indicate a set of received data packets. The receiver fills this first field of the SACK packet with a range of sequence numbers that includes the landing packet that triggered the SACK packet. The remaining available SACK fields are filled with ranges of sequence numbers from the list of received packets. As there are more ranges in the list than can be loaded into the SACK packet the receiver uses the left off pointer to determine which ranges are loaded into the SACK packet. The receiver inserts the SACK ranges consecutively from the sorted list starting from the range referenced by the pointer and continuing down the list until the available SACK range space in the TCP header of the SACK packet is consumed. The receiver wraps around to the start of the list if it reaches the end. In some embodiments two or three additional SACK ranges can be added to the SACK range information.

Once the receiver generates the SACK packet the receiver sends the acknowledgement back to the sender. The receiver then advances the left off pointer by one or more SACK range entries in the list. If the receiver inserts four SACK ranges for example the left off pointer may be advanced two SACK ranges in the list. When the advanced left off pointer reaches at the end of the list the pointer is reset to the start of the list effectively wrapping around the list of known received ranges. Wrapping around the list enables the system to perform well even in the presence of large losses of SACK packets since the SACK information that is not communicated due to a lost SACK packet will eventually be communicated once the list is wrapped around.

It can be appreciated therefore that a SACK packet may communicate several details about the condition of the receiver. First the SACK packet indicates that upon generation of the SACK packet the receiver had just received a data packet that is within the first field of the SACK information. Secondly the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information indicate that the receiver has received the data packets within those ranges. The SACK information also implies that the receiver had not at the time of the SACK packet s generation received any of the data packets that fall between the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information. In essence the ranges between the second and subsequent ranges in the SACK information are holes in the received data the data therein known not to have been delivered. Using this method therefore when a SACK packet has sufficient space to include more than two SACK ranges the receiver may indicate to the sender a range of data packets that have not yet been received by the receiver.

In another embodiment the sender uses the SACK packet described above in combination with the retransmit technique described above to make assumptions about which data packets have been delivered to the receiver. For example when the retransmit algorithm using the transmit numbers declares a packet lost the sender considers the packet to be only conditionally lost as it is possible that the SACK packet identifying the reception of this packet was lost rather than the data packet itself. The sender thus adds this packet to a list of potentially lost packets called the presumed lost list. Each time a SACK packet arrives the known missing ranges of data from the SACK packet are compared to the packets in the presumed lost list. Packets that contain data known to be missing are declared actually lost and are subsequently retransmitted. In this way the two schemes are combined to give the sender better information about which packets have been lost and need to be retransmitted.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller applies a technique referred to as transaction boundary detection. In one embodiment the technique pertains to ping pong behaved connections. At the TCP layer ping pong behavior is when one communicant a sender sends data and then waits for a response from the other communicant the receiver. Examples of ping pong behavior include remote procedure call HTTP and others. The algorithms described above use retransmission timeout RTO to recover from the dropping of the last packet or packets associated with the transaction. Since the TCP RTO mechanism is extremely coarse in some embodiments for example requiring a minimum one second value in all cases poor application behavior may be seen in these situations.

In one embodiment the sender of data or a flow control module coupled to the sender detects a transaction boundary in the data being sent. Upon detecting a transaction boundary the sender or a flow control module sends additional packets whose reception generates additional ACK or SACK responses from the receiver. Insertion of the additional packets is preferably limited to balance between improved application response time and network capacity utilization. The number of additional packets that is inserted may be selected according to the current loss rate associated with that connection with more packets selected for connections having a higher loss rate.

One method of detecting a transaction boundary is time based. If the sender has been sending data and ceases then after a period of time the sender or flow control module declares a transaction boundary. This may be combined with other techniques. For example the setting of the PSH TCP Push bit by the sender in the TCP header may indicate a transaction boundary. Accordingly combining the time based approach with these additional heuristics can provide for more accurate detection of a transaction boundary. In another technique if the sender or flow control module understands the application protocol it can parse the protocol data stream and directly determine transaction boundaries. In some embodiment this last behavior can be used independent of any time based mechanism.

Responsive to detecting a transaction boundary the sender or flow control module transmits additional data packets to the receiver to cause acknowledgements therefrom. The additional data packets should therefore be such that the receiver will at least generate an ACK or SACK in response to receiving the data packet. In one embodiment the last packet or packets of the transaction are simply retransmitted. This has the added benefit of retransmitting needed data if the last packet or packets had been dropped as compared to merely sending dummy data packets. In another embodiment fractions of the last packet or packets are sent allowing the sender to disambiguate the arrival of these packets from their original packets. This allows the receiver to avoid falsely confusing any reordering adaptation algorithms. In another embodiment any of a number of well known forward error correction techniques can be used to generate additional data for the inserted packets allowing for the reconstruction of dropped or otherwise missing data at the receiver.

In some embodiments the boundary detection technique described herein helps to avoid a timeout when the acknowledgements for the last data packets in a transaction are dropped. When the sender or flow control module receives the acknowledgements for these additional data packets the sender can determine from these additional acknowledgements whether the last data packets have been received or need to be retransmitted thus avoiding a timeout. In one embodiment if the last packets have been received but their acknowledgements were dropped a flow control module generates an acknowledgement for the data packets and sends the acknowledgement to the sender thus communicating to the sender that the data packets have been delivered. In another embodiment if the last packets have not been received a flow control module sends a packet to the sender to cause the sender to retransmit the dropped data packets.

In yet another embodiment the appliance or flow controller applies a repacketization technique for improving the flow of transport layer network traffic. In some embodiments performance of TCP is proportional to packet size. Thus increasing packet sizes improves performance unless it causes substantially increased packet loss rates or other nonlinear effects like IP fragmentation. In general wired media such as copper or fibre optics have extremely low bit error rates low enough that these can be ignored. For these media it is advantageous for the packet size to be the maximum possible before fragmentation occurs the maximum packet size is limited by the protocols of the underlying transmission media . Whereas for transmission media with higher loss rates e.g. wireless technologies such as WiFi etc. or high loss environments such as power line networking etc. increasing the packet size may lead to lower transmission rates as media induced errors cause an entire packet to be dropped i.e. media induced errors beyond the capability of the standard error correcting code for that media increasing the packet loss rate. A sufficiently large increase in the packet loss rate will actually negate any performance benefit of increasing packet size. In some cases it may be difficult for a TCP endpoint to choose an optimal packet size. For example the optimal packet size may vary across the transmission path depending on the nature of each link.

By inserting an appliance or flow control module into the transmission path the flow controller monitors characteristics of the link and repacketizes according to determined link characteristics. In one embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets with sequential data into a smaller number of larger packets. In another embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets by breaking part a sequence of large packets into a larger number of smaller packets. In other embodiments an appliance or flow controller monitors the link characteristics and adjusts the packet sizes through recombination to improve throughput.

Still referring to the flow controller in some embodiments may include a QoS Engine also referred to as a QoS controller.

In one embodiment the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain portion of bandwidth or network capacity for a user application data flow or connection. In some embodiments the QoS engine monitors the achieved level of performance or the quality of service corresponding to a user application data flow or connection for example the data rate and delay. In response to monitoring the QoS engine dynamically controls or adjusts scheduling priorities of network packets to achieve the desired level of performance or quality of service.

In some embodiments the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more classes or levels of services. In some embodiments the class or level service may include 1 best efforts 2 controlled load 3 guaranteed or 4 qualitative. For a best efforts class of service the appliance makes reasonable effort to deliver packets a standard service level .

For a qualitative class of service the appliance or QoS engine the qualitative service class is used for applications users data flows or connection that require or desire prioritized traffic but cannot quantify resource needs or level of service. In these cases the appliance or QoS engine determines the class of service or prioritization based on any logic or configuration of the QoS engine or based on business rules or policies. For example in one embodiment the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more policies as specified by the policy engine .

D. Systems and Methods for Providing Quality of Service of a Plurality of Applications via a Flow Controlled Tunnel

In many systems executing a plurality of applications each application may create or utilize a link to one or more servers and the speed or bandwidth of these links may be independently negotiated between each application and server. Accordingly applying QoS techniques in these systems may require complicated management to avoid inadvertent effects. For example congestion on a high priority link may result in delaying communications on uncongested low priority links. Furthermore QoS policies frequently are required to be individually configured per link. When a client moves to a new location such as a mobile client connecting from a hotel room previously configured QoS policies may be unable to be utilized.

Accordingly by directing traffic from a plurality of applications into a single connection or flow controlled tunnel QoS policies may be applied across the plurality of applications without link speed configuration. In some embodiments this tunnel enables QoS scheduling to dynamically adjust traffic transmission and reception rates to ensure priority management of applications regardless of a final endpoint of the application communications. Accordingly traffic of different types including VPN HTTP Voice over IP VoIP remote desktop protocol traffic or other traffic may be easily balanced and prioritized. Additionally by utilizing a flow controlled tunnel the QoS provider may not need to know the rate of the connection between the client and server. Thus QoS prioritization and scheduling can be maintained even if the connection rate changes dynamically for example due to interference or station hand off on a cellular or wireless WAN connection congestion on a LAN or WAN bandwidth allotment being divided among a plurality of users on a network as they connect and disconnect such as bandwidth availability to a hotel room changing depending on the number of guests using the network or any other reason. For example in a Wireless WAN connection such as 35 bandwidth can go from megabits per second to zero and back in a matter of seconds. Due to slow start algorithms used in TCP that drop throughput exponentially on congestion but increase linearly brief drops in bandwidth cause large efficiency losses and wastes bandwidth when the link recovers. However by using a tunnel for flow control this waste can be avoided. Furthermore in many embodiments the tunnel may be transparent to applications such that without any application configuration application traffic may still be prioritized by QoS requirements.

Many embodiments of systems applying QoS prioritization have system or application specific options. For example the Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol may use TCP options for setting or applying QoS prioritization but some intermediary devices between a client and server may not support these options. By passing traffic of these sorts through a tunnel connection the options may be preserved and processed by the end destination regardless of the capabilities of any intermediaries.

Referring now to shown is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system for providing quality of service of a plurality of applications via a flow controlled tunnel. In brief overview in some embodiments a client communicates via a tunnel protocol over network to an intermediary appliance . Although illustrated as an intermediary device such as an appliance in many embodiments client may communicate via the tunnel protocol to another client a server or any other device acting as a tunnel endpoint. Similarly although illustrated as a client in may embodiments the first endpoint of the tunnel may be another client a server an appliance or any other device. Endpoints of the tunnel such as client and appliance may include a queue tunneler client or host referred to generally as a queue tunneler . Although referred to as client and host in many embodiments a queue tunneler includes both a client and server process allowing two way tunneled communications.

In some embodiments a client or device at one end of the tunnel may execute or communicate with other clients executing one or more applications. Traffic from these applications may be prioritized or processed using any of the other techniques discussed herein including compression acceleration and encryption. The queue tunneler client may encapsulate this traffic with the tunnel protocol and direct the traffic into the tunnel to the other endpoint. At the opposite tunnel endpoint appliance in the embodiment shown in the traffic may be de encapsulated by queue tunneler and forwarded to sockets corresponding to connections to one or more application servers appliances or clients via one or more networks. Thus in some embodiments the appliance or other endpoint may provide both QoS prioritization functions and rerouting of received traffic to various service providers.

Return traffic from application servers appliances or other clients may be similarly compressed accelerated encrypted or otherwise processed and prioritized in QoS order by the tunnel endpoint appliance in . This traffic may then be encapsulated and forwarded to client via the tunnel connection. Upon receipt the queue tunneler on client may de encapsulate the traffic perform other processing including decryption and decompression and pass application specific responses to each of the one or more applications in QoS priority.

Referring now to illustrated is a block diagram of an embodiment of a computing device for providing quality of service of a plurality of applications via a flow controlled tunnel. In brief overview the computing device may comprise a client appliance server or other computing device and may include a QoS and redirection module queue tunnel proxy module and tunnel protocol collectively referred to in some embodiments as queue tunneler . As shown the computing device may also include a plurality of applications or servers a transport and network protocol and a client agent .

Referring to and in more detail in some embodiments one or more applications send traffic via a transport and network protocol . In many embodiments transport and network protocol may comprise a transport protocol such as TCP UDP stream control transmission protocol SCTP FAST TCP reliable datagram sockets RDS protocol Generic Routing Encapsulation GRE or any other transport protocol and a network protocol such as IPv4 IPv6 or IPSec. In some embodiments transport and network protocol may comprise a combined protocol such as AppleTalk or IPX.

Application traffic passed through or encapsulated by transport and network protocol may be intercepted or otherwise received by QoS and redirection module . QoS and redirection module may comprise hardware software or a combination of hardware and software and may comprise an application server process service daemon or other executable logic for intercepting or receiving communications prioritizing traffic according to QoS and redirecting traffic to a tunnel proxy module. In one embodiment in which the tunnel operates transparently to applications traffic from transport and network protocol may include destination addresses and ports that are external to the computing device. In other embodiments traffic from transport and network protocol may be directed to a local address hosted by QoS and redirection module serving as a proxy server. In these embodiments QoS and redirection module may perform address translation or lookup or parse application traffic to determine destination addresses and or ports.

In some embodiments QoS and redirection module may comprise one or more filters and redirectors. Filters may be used to parse outgoing vs. incoming traffic for example or for redirecting traffic to or from another application. For example as shown in with applications and in many embodiments some application traffic may be redirected to a client agent discussed in detail above. This may be done for purposes such as acceleration compression encryption or other features provided by the client agent . Other traffic such as that associated with application shown in may be redirected to queue tunnel proxy module without passing through the client agent. This may be done for example to separate VoIP traffic from ICA RDP or other traffic for processing using lower latency techniques. Similarly traffic from the client agent or directed to the client agent from an external device may also be filtered and redirected via the queue tunnel proxy module . This avoids traffic from the client agent being redirected back to the client agent endlessly.

QoS and redirection module may also comprise one or more buffers or queues for performing QoS prioritization. In some embodiments QoS and redirection module may include a single queue or buffer and move data packets within the buffer according to priority. In other embodiments QoS and redirection module may include multiple buffers or queues each corresponding to a priority class such as background very low low medium high or very high. Similarly queues may be associated with a priority class by value such as 10 20 30 40 50 60 or 70 or any other value. In other embodiments QoS and redirection module may include a buffer queue or other similar structure for priority processing of traffic. For example some traffic may be designated for immediate transmission and QoS and redirection module may transmit this traffic immediately regardless of waiting items in even a high priority queue. QoS and redirection module may comprise one or more counters or timers for processing packets from buffers or queues in order of priority.

In some embodiments QoS and redirection module may direct packets and other network traffic into a tunnel provided by queue tunnel proxy module in order of QoS priority. Similarly packets and network traffic received over the tunnel provided by the queue tunnel proxy module may be redirected by QoS and redirection module back to client agent or one or more applications via the transport and network protocol. Because packets may be provided over the tunnel from the remote side in order of priority in some embodiments QoS and redirection module may not need to perform buffering or queuing on packets received from queue tunnel proxy module . In other embodiments QoS and redirection module may buffer packets until requested by an application or until the application otherwise prepared to receive them. This may allow for multi threaded operation.

In some embodiments QoS and redirection module may further include one or more classifiers to parse and classify application traffic. For example traffic may be classified as corresponding to an application such as Microsoft Outlook a group of applications such as email or games a destination a source a protocol such as HTTP or TCP an application or service provided by another application such as Google web applications or a Flash based media player or any other classifier. Classifying traffic may allow QoS and redirection module to apply QoS prioritization at different levels or according to different policies based on any identified characteristics.

Queue tunnel proxy module may comprise hardware software or a combination of hardware and software for processing packets for transmission and receipt via a tunnel protocol . Queue tunnel proxy module may comprise an application server process service daemon or other executable logic for encapsulating and de encapsulating traffic with a tunnel protocol. Various tunnel protocols may be utilized including generic routing encapsulation GRE layer 2 tunneling protocol L2TP UDP based Data Transport sometimes referred to as UDP based Data Transfer Protocol UDT SCTP TCP or any other protocol. Additionally the tunnel protocol may use SSL or a similar security protocol for encryption. In some embodiments packets encapsulated by the transport and network protocol may be further encapsulated as a payload to the tunnel protocol which may comprise a UDP or TCP based tunnel. In some embodiments queue tunnel proxy module may include functionality for establishing various tunnels. For example if the infrastructure does not support a UDP based tunneling protocol in these embodiments the queue tunnel proxy module may establish a different tunnel such as a TCP based tunnel. UDP based tunnels may be more efficient in some embodiments due to the reduction in the number of acknowledgements. Flow control may be provided by the queue tunnel proxy module for example using a real time control protocol RTCP or similar feedback mechanisms.

In some embodiments incoming traffic via tunnel protocol may be processed and de encapsulated by tunnel proxy module and passed to QoS and redirection module . In one embodiment as shown in QoS and redirection module may then route the incoming traffic via transport and network protocol to the corresponding application or client agent . Applications external to the computing device may also be targets of incoming traffic communication. For example as shown in an intermediary device receiving tunnel traffic may de encapsulate and route traffic to one or more destinations external to the device. In some embodiments the traffic may include a destination IP address and or port which the computing device may use for redirection. In other embodiments the traffic may correspond to a predetermined application such as VoIP and the intermediary may have a table or other information indicating a destination for traffic corresponding to the predetermined application such as a VoIP server. In still other embodiments the intermediary device may parse the traffic for identifiers indicating a destination for re direction such as a URL MAC address VLAN or other indicator.

Redirection of tunneled traffic by an intermediary may be easier in client initiated connections than in server initiated connections because the initiation request may implicitly or explicitly identify a destination. However in one embodiment the client agent may communicate with the intermediary during establishment of the tunnel or at some other point to identify the client an application of the client a capability of the client or other identifying information including IP addresses virtual IP addresses ports virtual ports VLANs MAC addresses or other identifiers. When a server attempts to initiate a connection to the client via the intermediary in this embodiment the intermediary may use this information provided by the client agent to achieve proper routing and identify destinations on the client.

In some embodiments the queue tunnel proxy module may transmit data provided by sockets from QoS and redirection module in an order of priority using a weighted fair queuing WFQ fair queuing round robin or other algorithm. For example in one embodiment queue tunnel proxy module may process data from one or more sockets corresponding to a first traffic class then one or more sockets corresponding to the next traffic class then one or more sockets corresponding to a following traffic class etc. In other embodiments prioritization may be handled by the QoS and redirection module with traffic provided in an order of priority to the queue tunnel proxy module .

In one embodiment queue tunnel proxy module may use a variant of weighted fair queuing WFQ2 by Zhang et al. which includes capabilities for rate control and regulation in addition to queuing and scheduling capabilities of WFQ. In one embodiment applying WFQ the algorithm assumes a sender that transmits at the rate of the link and use the link speed to cause downward pressure on a WFQ tree the tree comprising multiple traffic classes per link and multiple sockets per class as discussed above. In another embodiment however the algorithm may be rate agnostic. Instead the algorithm may use the presence of congestion or rate and number of congestion notifications on the link to provide back pressure to the tree.

In some embodiments a tunnel that includes congestion control and flow control for QoS will appear to be a single link to the WFQ algorithm. Thus QoS scheduling can be applied from tunnel end to tunnel end regardless of the number or type of intermediary links. This may result in better performance and efficiency over other non tunneled QoS implementations where each intermediary router or node only has capability of scheduling outgoing packets for the next link or hop providing only local QoS. As more traffic is merged along the route packet order may change from the order in which they were transmitted by the first node. However a tunnel implementation can provide full end to end QoS without knowing individual link speeds or types and regardless of a dynamically changing end to end data path. In a further embodiment a client and server may establish a plurality of tunnel connections and may balance traffic loads across the tunnels consolidating flow and congestion control at the endpoints. This may provide enhanced scalability and enable use of additional acceleration techniques and processing on a per tunnel basis and optimal route balancing for the plurality of tunnels.

Referring now to illustrated is a block diagram of an embodiment of a queue tunnel proxy on a client appliance or server showing distribution of components between kernel mode and user mode . In the embodiment shown QoS and redirection module may execute in kernel mode while queue tunnel proxy module may execute in user mode . In some embodiments queue tunnel proxy module may include a socket interface a tunnel interface a connection manager and a data manager . Queue tunnel proxy module may also communicate with a configuration manager . In some embodiments one of either QoS and redirection module or queue tunnel proxy module may be responsible for encapsulating packets for the tunnel or rewriting destination IP addresses and ports to control redirection.

Still referring to and in more detail in some embodiments queue tunnel proxy module may include a socket interface . Socket Interface may include any type and form of socket based programming interface or API such as TCP or UDP socket API. Socket interface may comprise an API or other interface for communicating packets to and from QoS and redirection module . In some embodiments socket interface or QoS and redirection module may also include functions or commands for controlling congestion such as commands to cause socket interface or QoS and redirection module to pause or resume transmitting data via the communications channel. In other embodiments socket interface or QoS and redirection module may include functions or commands for getting connection information about a new connection including information relating to a destination of a connection to be established discussed above.

In some embodiments the socket interface may listen on one or more local addresses and ports for communications from a QoS and redirection module or other application communicating directly to the tunnel proxy module. The socket interface may in some embodiments include functions or methods for opening a TCP or UDP connection sending data from one or more buffers to the tunnel interface via the data manager returning received data from the tunnel interface to QoS and redirection module or another application and notifying QoS and redirection module or other application of an established open or closed connection. The socket interface may also include functions or methods for requesting resending of data when a previously attempted transmission of data has failed.

In some embodiments queue tunnel proxy module may include a tunnel interface . Tunnel interface may comprise an API or other interface for communicating packets to and from a network interface . In some embodiments tunnel interface may also comprise functionality for establishing and closing tunnel connections to a tunnel peer such as an intermediary appliance server or client as discussed above. In some embodiments tunnel interface may provide support for encapsulation and communication of packets via several tunnel protocols including UDT SCTP and TCP or any other protocol. In some embodiments a protocol such as UDT may provide maximum response time with minimal latency but in an environment where a network firewall prevents a UDT connection then other protocols such as TCP Reno may be used. In some embodiments tunnel interface may select a protocol for optimal performance responsive to security requirements error rate and latency. Accordingly tunnel interface may also include functionality for determining error rate latency bandwidth jitter round trip time and other features of a connection for benchmarking purposes.

In some embodiments tunnel interface may also provide encryption and decryption features such as SSL or TLS encryption protocols. Tunnel interface may also provide one or more callbacks to network interface connection manager or data manager including messages to indicate the state of a peer such as connected disconnected stalled paused ready or any other state messages to indicate a send buffer is available messages to indicate one or more data packets have been received messages to indicate to create a new buffer or other management or setup functions. Although shown in as a single tunnel in many embodiments tunnel interface may include functionality for establishing a plurality of tunnels to a corresponding plurality of remote devices and or a plurality of network interfaces on a single remote device.

In some embodiments tunnel interface may include API functions or methods for establishing or connecting a tunnel responding to a remote request to establish a tunnel disconnect a tunnel open or close a TCP UDP or other protocol connection to an destination address and port and including an initiator connection handle transmit a receiver connection handle responsive to a request to open a connection pause or resume a connection and send data of a specified length via a connection. In one embodiment to avoid delays of TCP slow start and similar techniques open opening a connection a tunnel client may immediately begin sending data. If the device on the opposite side of the tunnel fails to open a connection a close message may send back and all data in transit discarded. In some embodiments upon receipt of a request to open a connection including an initiator connection handle the receiver may send an acknowledgement with a receiver connection handle. In some embodiments these handles may be unique may be incremented with each established connection may be determined randomly or may be a function of each other. For example in one embodiment a receiver connection handle may be an inverse of an initiator connection handle or may include the initiator handle with a predetermined bit flipped. Commands to pause resume or close a connection and commands to send data via a connection may include the initiator or receiver connection handle. The tunnel interface may also include local API functions or methods for connecting or disconnecting a tunnel connection open or close a TCP or UDP connection via the tunnel or send a pause or resume command to a remote computing device via the tunnel to control congestion. These commands may include a local handle to identify the tunnel. The tunnel interface may also include commands for sending data from one or more buffers via a tunnel identified by a local handle and may include an identification of the one or more send buffers. The tunnel interface may also include one or more callbacks for passing received messages to the data manager requesting resending of data in case of connection or communication failure sending notification of a peer status change to the connection manager notifying a connection manager of a newly requested or established connection or indicating a pause or resume command has been received from a remote computing device.

In some embodiments queue tunnel proxy module may include a connection manager . Connection manager may comprise a service daemon application routine or subroutine or other executable code or logic for managing connections via both the socket interface and tunnel interface . Connection manager may include functionality for creating and deleting connections and maintaining a connection table. In some embodiments connection manager may include one or more timers for maintaining the connection table by marking dormant connections as having timed out. When congestion is detected or when a pause command is received via the socket or tunnel interface the connection manager may mark a connection as halted and may send a pause command to the corresponding other interface. The connection manager may manage a list of peers a list of connections a list of non paused connections which may be used to service local sockets a list of paused connections which may be paused when the tunnel interface detects congestion or due to back pressure from the local socket s buffer a list of connections with data received from the tunnel that needs to be delivered locally which may be buffered until the local connection can accept the data a list of new local connections that need to be established to the peer and a list a new peer connections that need to be established locally. In some embodiments these lists may be combined into one or more lists. For example in one such embodiment a connection list may include a flag to indicate a paused or non paused connection. Similar flags may be used to denote other connection statuses.

The connection manager may include functionality for creating a new connection responsive to a request received via the socket interface. In some embodiments the connection manager may determine a peer unit using a list of peers and may include load balancing or other functions for selecting a peer from the list of peers. The connection manager may send to the peer via the tunnel interface a request to establish a new connection. Similarly in some embodiments the connection manager may receive a request to open a connection via the tunnel interface from a peer and may initialize the connection and route incoming packets to the proper destination. In some embodiments this may comprise directing packets to QoS and redirection module for forwarding to client agent or an application. In other embodiments this may comprise directing packets to a network interface for transmission to a remote server intermediary or client. In some embodiments the connection manager may redirect a tunneled packet to the original destination IP address of the payload packet.

Connection manager may also include functionality for closing a connection. The connection manager may close a connection responsive to receiving a request to close the connection a failure of transmission in the tunnel a timeout or other reasons. Closing a connection may comprise cleaning up resources allocated to the connection resetting buffers or performing other maintenance tasks. In some embodiments connection manager may also include functionality for pausing or resuming connections responsive to congestion. For example if a local socket cannot accept all of the data provided to the socket the connection manager may pause the connection and send a pause command to the peer unit. Similarly if the connection manager receives a pause command from the peer unit the connection manager may pause the connection and direct the QoS and redirection module to pause. Connection manager may also include functionality for explicit congestion notifications. In some embodiments the connection manager may also perform periodic housekeeping functions including maintaining connection timeouts and a list of closed connections.

In some embodiments queue tunnel proxy module may also include a data manager . Data manager may comprise an application service daemon routine or subroutine or other executable code or logic for managing and moving data between the socket interface and tunnel interface. As shown in some embodiments receive and send paths may be separate and may be controlled in parallel.

In one embodiment when the socket interface receives data from the QoS and redirection module or other application it may call a data receive function provided by data manager . Responsive to this function the data manager may attempt to pass the data to a peer unit via the tunnel interface. If the tunnel interfaces refuses the data for example due to congestion or a paused connection data manager may store the data in a per connection queue or buffer. This queue or buffer may then be added to a pending send list. When the amount of pending data to be send passes a predetermined threshold in some embodiments the data manager may send a request to pause the connection to the QoS and redirection module or other application via the socket interface. Upon receipt of a connection resume message from the tunnel interface data manager will attempt to send data from the queues or buffers in the pending send list. In some embodiments the data manager may attempt to send as much data as possible avoiding delays caused by slow start techniques.

Similarly in one embodiment when the tunnel interface receives data from the peer via the network interface it may send a callback function to the data manager. Responsive to this callback the data manager may attempt to pass the data to QoS and redirection module or another application via the socket interface. If the socket interface refuses the data for example due to congestion or execution delays the data manager may store the data in a local buffer or queue. When the amount of data to send to local buffers or queues passes a predetermined threshold in some embodiments the data manager may send a request to pause the connection to the remote peer via the tunnel interface. Data manager may similarly send a resume command when local sockets are again able to accept data.

Referring now to illustrated are block diagrams of embodiments of communications flow within a system providing quality of service of a plurality of applications via a flow controlled tunnel. In brief overview shows an embodiment providing direct QoS and redirection while shows an embodiment providing redirection via an encryption gateway. In the embodiment shown in traffic flow from an application travels to QoS module of QoS and redirection module which intercepts classifies and prioritizes the traffic using any of the techniques described above. The traffic is then passed to the traffic redirector of QoS and redirection module which passes the traffic to the queue tunnel proxy module via a socket interface discussed above. When receiving traffic this is performed in reverse data is received through the tunnel and split back into individual streams and delivered to the application.

In the embodiment shown in however a client agent is placed in the flow of traffic to perform additional functions such as encryption compression or other acceleration techniques. In this embodiment traffic from the application is intercepted and prioritized by the QoS module and then sent to a client agent redirector . Similar to the traffic redirector the client agent redirector sends traffic to a socket of client agent for further processing using any of the encryption compression acceleration or other techniques described above. For example the client agent may encapsulate the stream in an SSL stream for sending to a remote decryption module. The client agent may then transmit the processed traffic back through the network stack where it may be intercepted again by QoS and redirection module . Having already been prioritized the traffic may be redirected by traffic redirector to the queue tunnel proxy module for transmission via the tunnel. When receiving encrypted compressed or otherwise accelerated traffic the traffic redirector may direct the traffic back to the client agent for processing. After processing in some embodiments the traffic may be passed to client agent redirector and then returned to QoS and redirection module for sending to its original destination. In other embodiments received traffic processed by the client agent may be sent to the network stack by the client agent and intercepted by QoS and redirection module for sending to its original destination.

Referring briefly back to in connection with both embodiments of communications flow may be utilized simultaneously. For example as shown in some traffic corresponding to applications and may be redirected through client agent while other traffic corresponding to application and processed traffic from client agent may be redirected to the queue tunnel proxy module . This may be done for example when the additional processing performed by client agent is unnecessary or undesirable for an application such as a low latency VoIP connection.

In many embodiments the agent may execute in a kernel space or kernel mode of the client and the first tunneling application may execute in a user space or user mode of the client. In some embodiments the agent may receive an indication from one or more of the plurality of proxied transport layer connections that data is available to be read. In a further embodiment the agent may propagate the indication to the first tunneling application and responsive to the indication the first tunneling application may accept the predetermined amount of data from each of the one or more proxied transport layer connections in the order of priority.
