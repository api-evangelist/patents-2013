This application claims benefit to U.S. provisional application 61 606 950 filed on Mar. 5 2012 entitled Social Networking Game with Integrated Social Graph which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present general inventive concept is directed to a method apparatus and computer readable storage medium directed to a game that can be played on social networking sites whether accessed via the internet or through mobile devices channels that provides players opportunities to see characters inside the game that are taken from the player s social graph.

 City building games e.g. SIM CITY allow players to construct virtual cities. Players can place virtual buildings and set virtual parameters e.g. virtual wages etc. in order to rule the virtual city. The virtual city can have virtual inhabitants which can walk around the virtual city. The virtual inhabitants in SIM CITY appear to be generated randomly with random attributes.

What is needed is a city building game that integrates a player s real world friends into the virtual city.

It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a game that integrates a player s real world friends into the game.

The above aspect can be obtained by a method that includes a enabling a player to sign into a game associated with a social networking site b retrieving from the social networking site a friend of the player and the friend s respective friend information and c displaying a game area depicted in two or three dimensions which comprises a virtual friend walking around the game area the virtual friend having characteristics based on the friend information.

These together with other aspects and advantages which will be subsequently apparent reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.

Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the invention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.

The present inventive concept relates to a game that can be played on a social networking site such as FACEBOOK including what is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 669 123 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety MYSPACE or any other site which maintains a database of users and provides an interface for interaction.

The inventive concept enables a player to play a graphical game that can be played on a social networking site which allows a player to construct structures and interact in a virtual world and the virtual world includes the player s friends from the social networking site. Friends commonly known in the art on sites such as FACEBOOK are pairs of users who mutually agree to associate with each other. The virtual world also referred to herein as playing world playing area virtual city etc. is automatically populated with virtual friends the virtual friends corresponding the player s friends on the social networking site. The virtual friends can take on the appearance and characteristics of their real world counterparts. The player can also initiate a communication inside the game with the virtual friends which can be delivered or have some type of effect outside of the game.

The game described herein can be played on an electronic gaming machine that can found in brick and mortar casinos or other venues such as internet cafes etc. Cash or cashless vouchers can be inserted into the machine using a bill acceptor which credits the machine with a respective amount of credits which can then be used to play the game and winnings are paid out in the form of credits which can then be cashed out for cash or a cashless voucher that can be redeemed for cash. The game described herein can exist on a software module pre installed on the slot machine or can be downloaded to the electronic gaming machine from a central remote server.

The game described herein can also be played on a computer such as a personal computer laptop etc. The game can be downloaded to the computer and stored locally on the computer . Alternatively the computer can have an internet connection not illustrated so that the game can be served from a remote location and player and displayed on the computer . For example the game can be played on an online casino wherein the player can wager for real money using a credit card or other deposit method where legal in which the results are determined on a remote server and transmitted to the computer so that the computer displays the results. The game can also be played on the computer for casual play on a social networking site e.g. FACEBOOK MYSPACE etc. wherein the game software can be launched from within the social network site itself Casual play is where the game can be played not for real money but for credits which typically have no cash value but can have other benefits to the player.

The game described herein can also be played on a cell phone or any other type of portable device such as a tablet computer etc. The portable device can implement any of the paradigms described above with respect to the computer e.g. online casino social networking site etc. 

Shown is the playing area playing area playing world virtual city etc. which depicts buildings and virtual friends . There is no limit to the number of virtual friends that would appear walking around in the playing world. The buildings can be placed by the player as the game progresses. The virtual friends are depicted walking around the playing area entering and leaving buildings etc. The virtual friends live in the playing area and have an effect on the gameplay. For example if the player owns a casino in the paying area the virtual friends can enter the casino play and lose money of which the player s game credits would reflect winning this money from the virtual friends . Virtual friends also referred to as icons friend icons avatars friend avatars etc. can also buy items in the playing area e.g. food etc. and contribute to the economy of the playing area. This can be accomplished in a like or similar fashion to the well known game entitled SIM CITY. Each of the individual virtual friends carries on their business in the playing area independent of the other virtual friends . Thus one or more of the virtual friends may enter a particular casino and lose money while others may indulge in different activities e.g. enter a cab dine at a restaurant shop at a store etc. 

Each virtual friend of the virtual friends has their own identity. Each virtual friend s identity can be based on each virtual friend s respective friend information taken from the real world counterpart which can comprise information such as their picture name occupation money they have money they have spent in the playing area etc. Some or all of each virtual friend s identity can be displayed in an individual window when the player clicks a virtual friend or mouse over the virtual friend etc. Also displayed in each individual window are action buttons that when clicked take particular actions for that individual in these action buttons are labeled as invite gift chat collect postcard although of course many other actions can be listed as well .

The invite button when clicked invites the real world friend that is represented by the virtual friend . For example displayed in the individual window is the virtual friend s name Andy which can correspond to a real person by that name in the social networking site that is a friend of the player. Thus when the player clicks invite in the individual window this would send out an invitation on the social networking site e.g. a message on FACEBOOK to the real Andy with a message inviting him to join the game and providing a link wherein when Andy clicks the link he can enroll in the game.

Other action buttons can comprise a gift button which when pressed brings up a further window allowing the player to gift a real world gift to the real world Andy e.g. a gift certificate for a free coffee some FACEBOOK credits etc. Other gifts that the player can give a friend can be virtual goods such as credits free spins virtual items e.g. a virtual outfit that can be worn by the player s avatar in the game etc. A chat button can bring up a chat window which allows the player to chat text chat or voice with the real Andy if the real Andy is available . A postcard button can take a picture of the current virtual city e.g. from where the player is standing such as in front of a landmark and send a postcard of the picture with text attached such as the player s name to a friend either inside the game or outside the game such as via an email message with an image of the postcard attached . A collect button can be used by a player to collect gifts given to the player by the player s friends.

Thus in this manner the player s friends some or all on the social networking site e.g. FACEBOOK or other can all be found walking around the playing area as virtual friends. Virtual friends can take on the identity and characteristics of the real world friends of the player the information of which can be gleaned from any data available on their profiles and other information accessible on the social network web site . If the player has 100 friends on the social networking site all 100 friends can be imported into the playing area as described herein using their real world data and can be found walking around virtual friends as described herein. This playing area may have more than 100 virtual friends e.g. 1 000 virtual friends in which the additional 900 virtual friends can have random or pre stored characteristics and are not actually friends of the player.

The method begins with operation wherein a player signs into a game. The player would typically first sign into the social networking site e.g. FACEBOOK which serves as the platform for the game. Once signed into the social networking site the player would then initiate the game itself e.g. by clicking an icon or typing in the game name .

From operation the method proceeds to operation which retrieves the player s friends and also respective friend information. Social networking sites make available application programming interfaces so that application developers can program applications to retrieve particular data about the player friend information such as profile data about the player e.g. their occupation place of work education sex hobbies marital status and any other information that a user of a social networking site can enter about themselves the player s friend list names of players the player is friends with profile data bout the player s friends photos uploaded by the player and any other information that is accessible about the player on the social networking site. Each real world friend of the player has their own profile and other information stored on the social networking site which is used to generate the respective friend information for that friend. The retrieval of the player s friends and friend information would actually retrieve data about the player s friends using a protocol compatible with the social networking site and the application programming interface.

In another embodiment a player s friends as used are not retrieved from the player s own social networking sites e.g. FACEBOOK but instead can be populated using a number of other mechanisms. For example the friends can be retrieved from the player s email or phone address back which can be retrieved by the system . Or the system can use its own generic database of friends or augment the player s own database with the generic database of friends . The generic database of friends can be chosen in real time to include a selected set of friends who appear in the game such as famous movie stars politicians cartoon characters etc.

From operation the method proceeds to operation which converts the friend information retrieved in operation to friend game data. Friend game data is data that is used in the actual game itself in other words the virtual counterpart to the real world information . If the friend information comprises a particular occupation e.g. policeman then the game data for that friend could include a two or three dimensional model of a policeman that can be used to display the virtual friend. While operation retrieves data friend information about the player s friends using the application programming interface on the social networking site the friend information is converted into a different form that is then used by the game. For example if the friend information is a sex of the player then this would be used to identify an avatar to display the player of a compatible sex e.g. if the friend is male then the virtual friend would be depicted using a male avatar as opposed to a female avatar . Thus the friend information sex is converted to a game data an identification of an avatar used to depict the friend . There can be many avatars some male some female and the friends depicted in the game would each typically be assigned to an avatar which should match the actual sex of that player . The sex of a friend is one type of friend information but friend information can comprise any other characteristic about the friend that can be gleaned from the social networking site. Thus many types of friend information are converted into game data which can then be used by the game.

Another example of game data is an occupation of a friend. If a friend is a doctor then the virtual friend can be displayed in the game area as a doctor e.g. wearing a doctor s uniform . The uniform an avatar is wearing would be the game data based on converted from the occupation of the friend the friend information .

A further example of game data is a car or other vehicle of the friend. If the friend has a blue Mercedes then the virtual friend can be displayed in the playing area driving a blue Mercedes.

Table I illustrates an example of friend information and the respective game data it can be converted into for that friend. For example if a friend of the player has on his her profile information that they own or have a hobby of a motorcycle then that friend s avatar virtual friend in the playing world can be shown on a motorcycle. If the friend has a picture e.g. their profile picture or other picture of the friend this picture can be used to depict the virtual friend of the friend in the game. This can be done in two ways either by digitally manipulating the picture typically just a face shot to appear on the face of the virtual friend displayed in two or three dimensions or when the virtual friend is selected by the player then more detailed information about the virtual friend can be displayed which can include the virtual friend s two dimensional picture which can be taken from the virtual friends real world counterpart profile or other picture . Of course the list in Table I is merely an example and many other types of information gleaned from the player s friend s data available on the social networking site e.g. their profile can be used to translate that information into game data which can be used to show how that friend is visually depicted in the playing world the virtual friend and also other uses .

From operation the method proceeds to operation which displays the playing area playing world with the player s friends virtual friends integrated into the playing area with the display of each virtual friend visually depicted using its respective game data e.g. the player s real world friend Andy is a male and the virtual friend counterpart to the real world Andy is displayed using a male avatar .

Note that it is not required for a player s friends to be signed into the game for their respective virtual friend to be displayed in the player s playing world e.g. walking around etc. For example if Jack is currently playing the game and has a friend Jill on a social networking site e.g. FACEBOOK that is used to find friends to populate Jack s playing world Jack can view Jill a virtual friend icon avatar etc. walking around Jack s playing world. This is so even though Jill is not currently signed onto the game. Jill may or not may be currently signed into the game her status of being signed in or not does not affect the ability for Jill s virtual avatar to appear in Jack s playing world or any other player s playing world. If Jill is currently signed into the game then Jack and Jill are able to perform a live chat with each other in the player world. If Jill is currently not signed into the game then Jack can send Jill a message but Jill would not be able to respond until Jill signs back into the game. Thus a player s virtual friends are displayed in the two or three dimensional playing world even though they are not currently signed into the game. Each player would have their own corresponding virtual friend also referred to as icon avatar etc. that walks around in other players typically their friends games their playing world .

Some players are determined to be high value valuable players. For example a valuable player can be determined to be a player that has met some type of criteria such as spent at least a predetermined amount of cash in the game monetized reached a certain level in the game completed a particular task in the game e.g. constructed all or at least a certain number of buildings invited a certain number of friends to the game etc. When valuable players have a corresponding avatar icon walking around in the playing world either in their game or another player s game such as a friend s playing world the valuable player s avatar will be highlighted as compared to displayed icons of non valuable players. Highlighted players can be brighter larger sparkle glow have nice or colorful outfits etc. in order to highlight them. For example Jack Jill and John are all players. Of the three only Jill is a valuable player. When Jack plays and sees icons representing Jack Jill and John in the playing world only Jill will be highlighted. When Jill plays and views the playing world and sees icons representing Jack and John they both will not be highlighted but if Jill s own icon is displayed it will be highlighted . Thus players would strive to become valuable players so their corresponding icons that populate other peoples games can stand out in the virtual playing world. Any number of virtual icons can be displayed in the playing world e.g. 1 to 50 or more .

As described above it is possible for a player of the social networking game to communicate with a friend on the social networking site via the friend s corresponding virtual friend in the social networking game. Such communications can be an invitation to the friend to join the game a gift or message to the friend or any other type of communication. Players can also chat with each other in two or three dimensions. For example the playing can also be used as a large chat room wherein players can type or speak messages to a recipient identified by the speaker or sent to all players visible on in the playing world.

As illustrated in when a player highlights a virtual friend buttons can appear which when pressed enable communication with the friend corresponding to the virtual friend. For example if Andy is a real friend of the player on the social networking site and Andy has a corresponding virtual friend in the social networking game then the player can highlight the virtual Andy and click a button that says message which allows the player to type in a message inside the social networking game which then sends the message to the real world Andy on the social networking site outside of the game . The message can be transmitted to the real Andy via a private message wall posting status update email etc.

In a further embodiment players can be given virtual tasks in the virtual playing world. For example a player s own avatar can be given a task in the virtual world e.g. build a structure etc. When the player completes the task the player may be given some reward e.g. more credits loyalty points a virtual gift etc. Players can be given a series of missions to complete in the virtual playing world.

The method can begin with operation which receives a request inside the game from the player to communicate with a virtual friend. This can be done as described herein for example selecting the virtual friend in the game and clicking a respective button link or other part of the interface.

From operation the method proceeds to operation which looks up the contact information for the friend who corresponds to the virtual friend. Note that internal game communications are different from external game communications. An internal game communication is a communication from one player to another player which takes place inside the game and is processed by the server hosting the game . In other words the communication does not have to leave the game. An example of this type of communication is when one types a message to another player in the game which is only displayed in the game the recipient has to be logged into the game to receive the message . An external game communication is a communication which is initiated inside the game but is delivered outside of the game or vice versa . For example when a player wants to invite the real world counterpart of a virtual friend the message invite can be initiated inside the game but would be delivered outside of the game because the friend is not signed up to the game yet thus is considered an external message .

So in order to process an external message the friend of the player that corresponds to the virtual friend needs to be identified which can be stored in a table or other data structure and the friend s contact information is retrieved which can be identified from the social networking site . For example to send a message on the social networking site to Andy a user of the social networking site the message would require contact information such as a unique identifier on the social networking site to uniquely identify Andy so a message can be transmitted to Andy. It is noted that users of social networking sites commonly have the same name and so the name of a user is typically not enough to address a message to.

One the contact information is identified to communicate with the friend outside the game then a request is sent to the social networking site to deliver a message to the friend using the friend s contact information. The social networking site should deliver the message to the friend outside of the game in other words the friend would not have to be logged into the social networking site in order to receive the message. The message can be delivered as a private message status update wall post etc.

Thus messages can be transmitted to a virtual friend in the game which can be delivered to the real world friend who corresponds to the virtual friend outside of the game an external message . In additional to an invitation to play the game such a message can be a gift of virtual or real goods a text message a photograph of an image of what is taking place in the game e.g. a screen shot or any other type of message.

The game described herein can be hosted on one or more servers which are running in coordination with a separate set of servers hosting the social networking site.

A processing unit can be a microprocessor and associated structure e.g. bus cache clock etc. which can be connected to an input device e.g. touch screen keyboard mouse buttons etc. and an output device e.g. touch screen CRT monitor etc. The processing unit can also be connected to a network connection which can connect to a computer communications network such as the Internet Wi Fi LAN WAN etc. The processing unit can also be connected to a ROM and a RAM as used in the art. The processing unit can also be connected to a storage device which can be nonvolatile storage device e.g. BLU RAY drive CD ROM drive hard drive EPROM etc. A computer readable medium e.g. BLU RAY disc CD ROM hard disc etc. can be read by the storage device and can store programs and assets that can cause the processing unit to perform any of the methods described herein. The ROM and RAM can also be loaded with instructions that can cause the processing unit to perform any of the methods described herein.

A computer communications network such as the Internet can be used to connect a host server which can host and serve a social networking site. Note that while shows only one server as the host server the host server can encompass numerous servers all cooperating with each other whether in the same physical location or not . The host server communicates with players through the Internet or other computer communication network and can implement any of the methods herein by executing computer code programmed accordingly. Game server can also implement all games and methods described herein on the site by executing computer code programmed accordingly. The game server is connected to the Internet and can communicate with all of the players directly or indirectly through the social networking site hosted by the host server . The game server can cooperate with the host server so that the games run on the game server can be integrated into the social networking site hosted by the host server . The game server can also be optional and all of the games can be also hosted on the host server whereby the integration of the games served hosted by the game server will appear embedded in the social networking site hosted by the host server such that players would typically not realize or care that multiple servers are cooperating in order to play games on the social networking site. All of the communications described herein can be effectuated using such a network configuration. Typically the communications are effectuated on the social networking site itself thus the players should be logged into the social networking site in order to participate herein although logging in is not required e.g. communications can be transmitted using other methods such as email IRC chat instant message etc. The host server can communicate with any of the devices illustrated in .

All components herein can be distributed across different such components as needed. For example a single server as mentioned herein can be distributed across numerous different servers and locations. A processor or processing unit can also be distributed across multiple processors in a same or different computer at a same or different location . The electronic components described herein represent an abstraction but it can be appreciated that the computer systems implementing the methods herein can be more numerous and interconnected than illustrated herein.

If a player is playing the game described herein on a social networking site or other type of hosted environment then the player s computer would cooperate with the social networking server in order to present the game to the player. The player s computer would perform the instructions necessary to display the game while the remote server can determine the results e.g. the final arrangement and communicate this result via the Internet to the player s computer so that the player s computer can accurately display the result. The remote server may track and account for all credits wagered and won lost while the player s computer can display the amount of credits owned or won at the direction of the remote server so the player cannot tamper with these amounts. All games described herein are considered to be played on the site described herein.

Any description of a component or embodiment herein also includes hardware software and configurations which already exist in the prior art and may be necessary to the operation of such component s or embodiment s .

Further the operations described herein can be performed in any sensible order. Any operations not required for proper operation can be optional. Further all methods described herein can also be stored on a computer readable storage to control a computer. All features described herein including all documents incorporated by reference can be combined with one another without limitation. While the credits are used herein to refer to awards provided to players typically refers to non cash value credits this can also refer to cash credits as well that are directly redeemable for cash .

The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification and thus it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Further since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to falling within the scope of the invention.
