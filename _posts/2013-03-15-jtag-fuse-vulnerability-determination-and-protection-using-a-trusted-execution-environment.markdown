Network capable electronic devices are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives. Additionally more and more electronic devices that did not have network capabilities are getting network capable. With the rapid development and popularization of network capable electronic devices a wide variety of increasingly sophisticated techniques are being deployed by attackers to take control of electronic devices and obtain confidential information for example personal and payment data. The development of online application stores also helps cause rapid development distribution and proliferation of malware applications across the network. The behavior of uncontrollable electronic device or leak of confidential user information and their impact on the user experience may have implications for user satisfaction with the electronic device and or the network service provider.

In an embodiment a method of configuring a trusted security zone into a portable electronic device is disclosed. The method comprises executing instructions on a processor of the portable electronic device that determine the state of a JTAG JTAG port of the portable electronic device if the JTAG port is determined to be enabled executing instructions on the processor preventing configuration of the trusted security zone into the portable electronic device and if the JTAG port is determined to be disabled configuring the trusted security zone into the portable electronic device wherein the trusted security zone provides hardware assisted trust whereby a vulnerability to hacking the trusted security zone via an enabled JTAG port is reduced.

In an embodiment a method of protecting an electronic device from a hacking attack that exploits a JTAG JTAG port of the electronic device that has not been disabled is disclosed. The method comprises executing instructions on a processor of the electronic device that determine the state of a JTAG port of the electronic device if the JTAG port is determined to be enabled executing instructions on the processor of the electronic device to detect a physical connection to the JTAG port if a physical connection to the JTAG port is detected executing instructions on the processor preventing execution of trusted applications and if the JTAG port is determined to be enabled executing instructions on the processor preventing execution of software that reads from the JTAG port whereby a vulnerability of the electronic device to a hacking attack that exploits an enabled JTAG port is reduced.

In an embodiment a method of thwarting a hacking attack on a mobile phone via an enabled JTAG JTAG port of the mobile phone is disclosed. The method comprises executing instructions on a processor of the mobile phone that detect the state of the JTAG port as one of enabled or disabled and when the JTAG port is determined to be enabled taking a first action to reduce vulnerability to hacking attacks via the enabled JTAG port.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Problems may be caused by electronic devices that interfere with the proper operation of electronic devices or the coupled networks for example the ability of electronic devices to transmit or receive confidential information. The problems may result from malware that infected the electronic devices through the coupled network. For example malware that infect an electronic device via Internet may try to control the electronic device or steal personal or payment information from the electronic device. Backdoor malware that infected an electronic device may give attackers full access via joint test action group JTAG ports to users devices. Because device manufacturers may leave JTAG ports enabled intentionally or accidentally there is little the service provider or user can do to assure the reliability of the electronic devices with enabled JTAG ports. The present disclosure teaches a method for proactively examining the status of a JTAG port of an electronic device and taking further action to assure the reliability of the electronic device under different circumstances.

For example instructions may be executed by the processor of an electronic device to determine the status of a JTAG port of the electronic device and take corresponding proactive action. When the JTAG port is determined to be disabled a trusted security zone is also configured into the electronic device. A JTAG port inspected certificate is also generated for the electronic device with the disabled JTAG port. Furthermore the JTAG port inspected certificate is stored into secure memory in the trusted security zone of the electronic device. When the JTAG port is determined to be enabled a trusted security zone is prevented from configuring into the electronic device. Software that reads from the JTAG port is prevented from executing on the electronic device with an enabled JTAG port. If a physical connection is detected to the JTAG port after the JTAG port is determined to be enabled execution of trusted applications on the electronic device will be prevented. In an embodiment one or more untrusted applications may be prevented from executing on the electronic device after the JTAG port is determined to be enabled.

A trusted security zone provides chipsets with a hardware root of trust a secure execution environment for applications and secure access to peripherals. A hardware root of trust means the chipset should only execute programs intended by the device manufacturer or vendor and resists software and physical attacks and therefore remains trusted to provide the intended level of security. The chipset architecture is designed to promote a programmable environment that allows the confidentiality and integrity of assets to be protected from specific attacks. Trusted security zone capabilities are becoming features in both wireless and fixed hardware architecture designs. Providing the trusted security zone in the main mobile device chipset and protecting the hardware root of trust removes the need for separate secure hardware to authenticate the device or user. To ensure the integrity of the applications requiring trusted data such as a mobile financial services application the trusted security zone also provides the secure execution environment where only trusted applications can operate safe from attacks. Security is further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while a trusted application is running in the secure execution environment. In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be conceptualized as hardware assisted security.

A complete trusted execution environment TEE may be implemented through the use of the trusted security zone hardware and software architecture. The trusted execution environment is an execution environment that is parallel to the execution environment of the main mobile device operating system. The trusted execution environment and or the trusted security zone may provide a base layer of functionality and or utilities for use of applications that may execute in the trusted security zone. For example in an embodiment trust tokens may be generated by the base layer of functionality and or utilities of the trusted execution environment and or trusted security zone for use in trusted end to end communication links to document a continuity of trust of the communications. Through standardization of application programming interfaces APIs the trusted execution environment becomes a place to which scalable deployment of secure services can be targeted. A device which has a chipset that has a trusted execution environment on it may exist in a trusted services environment where devices in the trusted services environment are trusted and protected against attacks. The trusted execution environment can be implemented on mobile phones and tablets as well as extending to other trusted devices such as personal computers servers sensors medical devices point of sale terminals industrial automation handheld terminals automotive etc.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning all of the hardware and software resources of the mobile device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. The secure partition may be implemented by a first physical processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second physical processor. Alternatively the secure partition may be implemented by a first virtual processor and the normal partition may be implemented by a second virtual processor. Placing sensitive resources in the secure partition can protect against possible attacks on those resources. For example resources such as trusted software applications may run in the secure partition and have access to hardware peripherals such as a touchscreen or a secure location in memory. Less secure peripherals such as wireless radios may be disabled completely while the secure partition is being accessed while other peripherals may only be accessed from the secure partition. While the secure partition is being accessed through the trusted execution environment the main mobile operating system in the normal partition is suspended and applications in the normal partition are prevented from accessing the secure peripherals and data. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from breaking the trust of the device.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning the hardware and software resources to exist in a secure subsystem which is not accessible to components outside the secure subsystem. The trusted security zone is built into the processor architecture at the time of manufacture through hardware logic present in the trusted security zone which enables a perimeter boundary between the secure partition and the normal partition. The trusted security zone may only be manipulated by those with the proper credential and in an embodiment may not be added to the chip after it is manufactured. Software architecture to support the secure partition may be provided through a dedicated secure kernel running trusted applications. Trusted applications are independent secure applications which can be accessed by normal applications through an application programming interface in the Trusted Execution Environment on a chipset that utilizes the trusted security zone.

In an embodiment the normal partition applications run on a first virtual processor and the secure partition applications run on a second virtual processor. Both virtual processors may run on a single physical processor executing in a time sliced fashion removing the need for a dedicated physical security processor. Time sliced execution comprises switching contexts between the two virtual processors to share processor resources based on tightly controlled mechanisms such as secure software instructions or hardware exceptions. The context of the currently running virtual processor is saved the context of the virtual processor being switched to is restored and processing is restarted in the restored virtual processor. Time sliced execution protects the trusted security zone by stopping the execution of the normal partition while the secure partition is executing.

The two virtual processors context switch via a processor mode called monitor mode when changing the currently running virtual processor. The mechanisms by which the processor can enter monitor mode from the normal partition are tightly controlled. The entry to monitor mode can be triggered by software executing a dedicated instruction the Secure Monitor Call SMC instruction or by a subset of the hardware exception mechanisms such as hardware interrupts which can be configured to cause the processor to switch into monitor mode. The software that executes within monitor mode then saves the context of the running virtual processor and switches to the secure virtual processor.

The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system that is not accessible to the device users. For security purposes the trusted security zone is not open to users for installing applications which means users do not have access to install applications in the trusted security zone. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from executing powerful instructions reserved to the trusted security zone and thus preserves the trust of the device. The security of the system is achieved at least in part by partitioning the hardware and software resources of the mobile phone so they exist in one of two partitions the secure partition for the security subsystem and the normal partition for everything else. Placing the trusted security zone in the secure partition and restricting access from the normal partition protects against software and basic hardware attacks. Hardware logic ensures that no secure partition resources can be accessed by the normal partition components or applications. A dedicated secure partition operating system runs in a virtual processor separate from the normal partition operating system that likewise executes in its own virtual processor. Users may install applications on the mobile device which may execute in the normal partition operating system described above. The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system for the secure partition that is installed by the mobile device manufacturer or vendor and users are not able to install new applications in or alter the contents of the trusted security zone.

Turning now to a communication system is described. In an embodiment the system comprises a plurality of electronic devices . The electronic device may comprise one or more processors one or more JTAG JTAG ports an operating system and a memory . In an embodiment the device may have access to a network . A server computer is coupled to the network for example a server operated by a network service provider. The network may also be accessible to an attacker computer . The network may comprise any combination of private and public networks.

It is understood that the system may comprise any number of servers and any number of attackers . The electronic device and attacker may be any of a computer a tablet computer a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a media player a game console an Internet digital media streaming device or another network communications capable device. Computers are discussed in more detail hereinafter. The electronic device and the attacker may access the network through wired or wireless access network. The wired access network may be abstracted in different ways and may comprise cable modems and Ethernet routers switches or hubs. The wireless access network may also be abstracted in different ways and may comprise wireless access points cable modems Ethernet or wireless routers switches or hubs servers and data storages such as home location registers HLRs or servers that implement the functionality of home location registers visitor location registers VLRs or servers that implement the functionality of visitor location registers base transceiver stations base station controllers BSCs mobile switching centers MSCs and other network nodes that are specifically associated with providing wireless access and connectivity to the electronic devices.

Non trusted applications are normal applications in the electronic device . When trusted applications are executed in the trusted security zone of the electronic device peripherals and data of the electronic device may not be accessible to the non trusted applications . The non trusted applications are stored in a permissive sector in the memory . The permissive sector of the memory is the normal partition in the memory . Normal applications the non trusted applications may be stored in the permissive sector in the memory . Additionally non secure resources may be stored in the permissive sector in the memory .

Trusted applications are authorized secure applications that may store transmit or receive confidential data. The trusted applications may execute using higher level of security than the non trusted applications that are executed in the operating system . For example the trusted applications may be applications used to perform payments online banking and enterprise authentication. The trusted applications may also be applications that entail content protection such as email and corporate VPN. The trusted applications may be applications that handle confidential health records or personal health metrics. Additionally the trusted applications may be entertainment content streaming services that entail content protection of the data in the form of music and video as well as authentication of the device or the user or another application that stores transmits or receives confidential data. The trusted applications may be stored at least in part in the secure partition of the memory the trusted security zone . The trusted applications may be built in by device makers original equipment manufacturer OEM or installed as users demand them. The trusted applications can originate from different application providers. The trusted applications running in a trusted execution environment may have access to the full power of a device s main processor and memory when the trusted applications are executed with hardware isolation that protects the trusted applications from user installed applications in the main operating system. Software and cryptographic isolation inside the trusted execution environment protect the trusted applications from each other. Hence an unauthorized trusted application may not have the access to the security resources of another trusted application .

In an embodiment the trusted security zone is more than just a segment of memory. The trusted security zone may also have a dimension of processing. The trusted security zone may provide the secure execution environment for trusted applications where only trusted applications may operate safe from attacks. The trusted security zone may be implemented by partitioning both hardware and software resources of the electronic device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. The secure partition may be implemented by a distinct separate or dedicated physical processor usually the first processor from the processor by which the normal partition may be implemented usually the second processor. Alternatively the secure partition may be implemented by a distinct separate or dedicated virtual processor from the virtual processor by which the normal partition may be implemented.

JTAG ports may be used for software debugging for an embedded system firmware storing updating for an embedded system boundary scan testing for printed circuit boards or other relevant purposes at the manufacturer of a device. When a JTAG port is not disabled after manufacturing the fundamental cycle chip level processing state of a device may still be accessed. For example with a single Chinese character as a password the fundamental cycle chip level processing state of a device may be accessed. Additionally the device may be reprogrammed at the chip level via the JTAG port. Hence the enabled JTAG port may be utilized as backdoor access that can give attackers full access to a device to harm a device collect confidential data from the device or for another unauthorized use. The JTAG ports may be disabled at the manufacturer when the manufacturing and testing process is finished to prevent them from being utilized by attackers for unauthorized uses. However the device vender original equipment manufacturer may leave the JTAG ports enabled by oversight or deliberately. If the device vender original equipment manufacturer fails to disable a JTAG port there may still be physical digital or logical connection to the JTAG port and the JTAG port is still alive. The test port test wire test connection or test voltage of the JTAG port may still be utilized to go to the base of the processor chip.

In an embodiment the trusted security zone functions as a test monitor and decides whether an electronic device may be trusted. Usually actual pins are applied to check poles functionality or voltages of the JTAG ports to determine whether the JTAG ports are disabled. However applying actual pins to test the voltages of the JTAG ports after the chip is assembled integrated into a circuit board an electronic device and shipped to the service provider may not be feasible and the process may be emulated with an application in the trusted execution environment or the trusted security zone installer program that tries to enable trust. The trusted security zone installer may go to the right channels ports pins of the hardware to check the voltage of the JTAG port channel or pin for example whether the voltage is zero or one. For example when the JTAG fuse is enabled the input impedance of the corresponding channel port pin may be lowered which may affect the voltage reference measurement.

For example the application in the trusted execution environment or the trusted security zone installer may examine the status of the JTAG ports and take action to reduce the risk that the electronic device may be attacked by unauthorized parties. In an embodiment when the JTAG ports are determined to be disabled the trusted security zone installer configures the trusted security zone into the electronic device . When the JTAG ports are determined to be disabled the trusted security zone installer may also generate a JTAG port inspected certificate for the electronic device . Note that the existence of the JTAG port inspected certificate indicates or implies a specific sequence of actions the JTAG port was checked and determined to be disabled first after the JTAG port was checked and found to be disabled then the trusted security zone was installed second and only after the trusted security zone was installed was the JTAG port inspected certificate built.

When the JTAG ports are determined to be enabled the trusted security zone installer may send a message to a server computer identifying the electronic device as one with the enabled JTAG ports . When the JTAG ports are determined to be enabled the trusted security zone installer may prevent configuration of the trusted security zone into the electronic device . The trusted security zone installer may also prevent trusted applications from executing or other applications that attempts to access resources of a higher security level.

At the time of verifying and building up trust before installing the trusted security zone for example at the service provider side the trusted security zone installer may be executed behind the trusted execution environment by the processor to test the status of the JTAG JTAG ports . For example the determination of the status of the JTAG JTAG ports is helpful before installation of software that requires higher security level than non trusted applications in the main operating system . In an embodiment it is determined whether the JTAG port is disabled or enabled after testing the status of the JTAG port . The JTAG ports may be tested by testing whether the fuses of JTAG ports are blown. The determination of the state of the JTAG ports may be carried by reading from the JTAG port addresses.

If the JTAG port on the electronic device is determined to be disabled the trusted security zone installer may take certain further action. For example a trusted security zone may be configured into the electronic device . In an embodiment the trusted security zone provides hardware assisted trust security. Additionally a JTAG port inspected certificate may be generated for the device . The trusted execution environment may be included integrated within an application processor on the electronic device . In an embodiment the execution environment comprises the trusted security zone . In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be configured or not be configured at all at the service provider after the electronic device is shipped from the device maker assembler. When the trusted security zone is configured after the JTAG ports are determined to be disabled the trusted security zone may be installed in a secure portion of the memory in the electronic device . The JTAG port inspected certificate or existence of the trusted security zone may be taken as an indicator for the fact that the device is stable reliable or trustworthy for example by potential trusted applications . The JTAG port inspected certificate may be stored into a trusted memory area of the trusted security zone . Additionally alternatively a parameter value may be stored abstractly indicating that the JTAG port is disabled. The parameter may be stored in a trusted memory area of the secure partition of the memory the trusted security zone .

On the other hand if the JTAG port is determined to be enabled the trusted security zone installer executed on the processor may take precautionary or remediating action. A message may be sent to the server computer identifying the electronic device and indicating that the JTAG ports of the electronic device were determined to be enabled. The message sent to the server computer may be an electronic message via the network . Downloading of confidential information to the electronic device may be prevented by instructions executed on the processor of the electronic device . For example downloading of a credit card number or a credit card payment application may be prevented. Additionally downloading of financial applications to the electronic device may be prevented.

Traditionally JTAG fuses need to be blown to be disabled and so attackers or others would not have access to the memory via the JTAG ports or to the very fundamental core of the processor via the JTAG ports . In an embodiment the trusted security zone installer may provide hardware assisted trust security without blowing the JTAG fuses. For example the trusted security zone installer may be executed on the processor to stop initializing trusted security zone configuration and prevent any future action that tries to start the trusted security zone configuration again. The trusted security zone installer may be executed on the processor preventing configuration of the trusted security zone into the electronic device if the initialization of the trusted security zone has not begun.

A hardware portion of the electronic device intended for installation of a trusted security zone may be marked as invalid or untrusted. For example the hardware portion of the electronic device intended for installation of a trusted security zone may not be used for any purpose or only for non trusted applications or information that does not entail higher security level. Additionally instructions may be executed on the processor preventing execution of software that reads from the JTAG port . For example throughout the lifetime of the electronic device the trusted security zone installer may monitor and or discipline the executables programs that are loaded on the JTAG ports and may inhibit pause and or shut down the executables programs that read from the JTAG ports .

The trusted security zone installer may also detect when a program is trying to modify any JTAG port in an over the air fashion and may inhibit pause and or shut down the corresponding program. In an embodiment an untrusted logo may be displayed on a display of the electronic device when the JTAG port is determined to be enabled. For example an untrusted logo may be displayed when the electronic device is turned on.

The trusted security zone installer may be executed on the processor to detect a physical connection to the JTAG port . If a physical connection to the JTAG port is detected the trusted security zone installer may be executed on the processor preventing execution of trusted applications .

Turning now to a method is described. At block instructions are executed on a processor of the portable electronic device that determines the state of a JTAG port of the portable electronic device . For example instructions are executed on the processor to determine whether the JTAG port is disabled. For example the determination process of the status of the JTAG port may comprise the determination of whether the fuses of the JTAG ports are blown. The determination process of the status of the JTAG port may further comprise reading from the JTAG port addresses.

If the JTAG port is not disabled the method proceeds to block . If the JTAG port is disabled the method proceeds to block . At block instructions are executed on the processor preventing configuration of the trusted security zone into the portable electronic device . When the JTAG port is enabled the electronic device is considered as unstable unreliable or untrustworthy and so the trusted security zone may not be configured into the electronic device . At block the trusted security zone is configured into the portable electronic device wherein the trusted security zone provides hardware assisted trust or root of trust. At block after the trusted security zone is configured into the portable electronic device instructions are executed on the processor creating a JTAG port inspected certificate . The existence of the JTAG port inspected certificate indicates or implies that the JTAG port was checked determined to be disabled and the trusted security zone was installed. With the JTAG port inspected certificate the electronic device may be taken as stable reliable or trustworthy for example by potential trusted applications . With the JTAG port inspected certificate the electronic device may be taken as stable reliable or trustworthy by confidential information that requires higher security level than normal information processed in the operating system or stored in the permissive sector of the memory . Additionally the JTAG inspected certificate may be stored off device for future use in demonstrating integrity of device trust as when a claim for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or hacking the device is advanced. At block the JTAG port inspected certificate is stored into a trusted memory area of the trusted security zone . The JTAG port inspected certificate may not be accessible with unauthorized attempts by the non trusted applications which may assure the JTAG port inspected certificate as a trustworthy indicator for the credibility of the electronic device.

Turning now to a method is described. At block instructions are executed on a processor of the electronic device that determine the state of a JTAG port of the electronic device . At block it is determined whether the JTAG port is enabled. If the result of block is false which means the JTAG port is disabled end the program. If the result of block is true which means the JTAG port is enabled block is executed and instructions are executed on the processor preventing execution of software that reads from the JTAG port . When the JTAG port is enabled the electronic device is considered to be unreliable and the electronic device may be vulnerable to attackers via the JTAG port . The JTAG port may be exploited by attackers to access the memory and reprogram the electronic device . Thus block is helpful when the JTAG port has been left enabled. At block instructions are executed on the processor of the electronic device to detect a physical connection to the JTAG port . The possible ways that the JTAG port is enabled comprise digital physical or logical connection to the JTAG port . Here instructions are executed to detect specifically physical connection. At block it is determined whether a physical connection to the JTAG port is detected. If the result of block is false which means no physical connection to the JTAG port is detected end the program. If the result of block is true which means a physical connection to the JTAG port is detected block is executed. At block instructions are executed on the processor preventing execution of trusted applications . Trusted applications entail higher security level but the electronic device may not be reliable when the JTAG port is enabled. Hence the trusted applications may not be allowed to be executed on the electronic device .

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the mobile device in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself. In addition to the embedded software or firmware the DSP may execute other applications stored in the memory or made available via information carrier media such as portable data storage media like the removable memory card or via wired or wireless network communications. The application software may comprise a compiled set of machine readable instructions that configure the DSP to provide the desired functionality or the application software may be high level software instructions to be processed by an interpreter or compiler to indirectly configure the DSP .

The DSP may communicate with a wireless network via the analog baseband processing unit . In some embodiments the communication may provide Internet connectivity enabling a user to gain access to content on the Internet and to send and receive e mail or text messages. The input output interface interconnects the DSP and various memories and interfaces. The memory and the removable memory card may provide software and data to configure the operation of the DSP . Among the interfaces may be the USB port and the infrared port . The USB port may enable the mobile device to function as a peripheral device to exchange information with a personal computer or other computer system. The infrared port and other optional ports such as a Bluetooth interface or an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless interface may enable the mobile device to communicate wirelessly with other nearby handsets and or wireless base stations.

The keypad couples to the DSP via the interface to provide one mechanism for the user to make selections enter information and otherwise provide input to the mobile device . Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

I O devices may include printers video monitors liquid crystal displays LCDs touch screen displays keyboards keypads switches dials mice track balls voice recognizers card readers paper tape readers or other well known input devices.

The network connectivity devices may take the form of modems modem banks Ethernet cards universal serial bus USB interface cards serial interfaces token ring cards fiber distributed data interface FDDI cards wireless local area network WLAN cards radio transceiver cards such as code division multiple access CDMA global system for mobile communications GSM long term evolution LTE worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX and or other air interface protocol radio transceiver cards and other well known network devices. These network connectivity devices may enable the processor to communicate with the Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection it is contemplated that the processor might receive information from the network or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above described method steps. Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.

In an embodiment the computer system may comprise two or more computers in communication with each other that collaborate to perform a task. For example but not by way of limitation an application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of the instructions of the application. Alternatively the data processed by the application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of different portions of a data set by the two or more computers. In an embodiment virtualization software may be employed by the computer system to provide the functionality of a number of servers that is not directly bound to the number of computers in the computer system . For example virtualization software may provide twenty virtual servers on four physical computers. In an embodiment the functionality disclosed above may be provided by executing the application and or applications in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing may comprise providing computing services via a network connection using dynamically scalable computing resources. Cloud computing may be supported at least in part by virtualization software. A cloud computing environment may be established by an enterprise and or may be hired on an as needed basis from a third party provider. Some cloud computing environments may comprise cloud computing resources owned and operated by the enterprise as well as cloud computing resources hired and or leased from a third party provider.
