This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802 09 C 0001 awarded by the Department of the Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to network coding and more particularly to a physical layer network coding architecture that provides downlink DL and forward link FL capacity increases for satellite network architectures.

Satellite network communications capacity is a valuable commodity that should be maximized in all systems. The overall satellite capacity is limited by a downlink DL and forward link FL depending on the overall system architecture due to frequency and power limitations. There are various ways to improve the DL and FL performance by using a higher gain antenna dynamic resource allocation DRA statistical multiplexing and other approaches. However due to cost complexity size and power considerations the aforementioned approaches may not be practical to improve the DL and FL capacity. Therefore the limited DL and FL satellite capacity remains a significant problem. Accordingly an improved way to increase DL and FL satellite capacity may be beneficial.

Certain embodiments of the present invention may provide solutions to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully identified appreciated or solved by current satellite communications architectures. For instance some embodiments may be directed to physical layer network coding that provides DL capacity increases for satellite network architectures such as a hub spoke satellite transponder a hub spoke satellite dehop rehop and for partially processed and fully processed systems.

The use of physical network coding permits the replacement of these DL transmission channels by a single broadcast downlink channel to both user terminals. If the DL data transmission rates to each user terminal are identical then the broadcast channel data rate is also the same thereby potentially yielding a fifty percent reduction in required DL satellite capacity for this duplex communication session. In certain embodiments the physical layer network coding architecture is used in conjunction with forward error correction FEC to provide error protection against channel degradations. Media access control MAC layer based network coding can also be designed to improve the overall system capacity as well.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention an apparatus is provided. The apparatus includes a first receiver configured to receive an uplink message from a first terminal and a second receiver configured to receive an uplink message from a second terminal. The apparatus also includes a controller configured to XOR network code the uplink message from the first terminal and the uplink message from the second terminal to produce a XOR network coded message. The XOR network coded message includes the uplink message from the first terminal and the uplink message from the second terminal. The XOR network coded message also includes a frame sequence number of the first terminal and a frame sequence number of the second terminal. The apparatus further includes a transmitter configured to broadcast the XOR network coded message to the first terminal and the second terminal.

In another embodiment an apparatus is provided. The apparatus includes a controller that is configured to XOR network code a message from a first terminal and a message from a second terminal to generate a XOR network coded message broadcasted to the first terminal and the second terminal. The XOR network coded message includes a frame sequence number of the first terminal and a frame sequence number of the second terminal.

In yet another embodiment a system is provided. The system includes a network coding controller configured to perform a XOR network coding operation on the information received from a first terminal and second terminal. The network coding controller is further configured to broadcast a single downlink message containing the XOR network coded information to the first and second terminals. The XOR network coded information includes a DL control message intended for the first terminal and a DL control message intended for the second terminal a first terminal frame sequence number a second terminal frame sequence number the information intended for the first terminal and the information intended for the second terminal.

Generally data delivery between a first terminal or node Tand a second terminal or node Tmay be carried out using a fully processed payload architecture or a virtual payload architecture. For example in system of a satellite is configured to process the payload while in system of satellite is configured to act as a relay mechanism and a gateway i.e. a virtual payload is configured to process the payload. In either case when first terminal Tcommunicates with second terminal T first terminal Ttransmits information to a payload of satellite . The information includes data Dand an uplink UL control packet C. Satellite may process the information using the UL control packet C or relay information to gateway for processing of the information. Once the payload is processed the processed information is transmitted to second terminal T. The processed information includes the data Dand a downlink control packet C. A similar process is carried out when second terminal Tsends a communication to first terminal T.

However it should be noted that satellite power and bandwidth are limited. Thus when processing the information using the conventional approach as shown in the limited satellite power and bandwidth result in limited downlink DL capacity.

Embodiments of the present invention overcome capacity issues by increasing capacity using a physical layer network coding architecture. It should be appreciated that either terminal Tor Tmay initiate a physical layer network coding session and or the network coding controller within gateway may initiate the network coding session. Similarly either terminal Tor Tor network coding controller may terminate the network coding session. It should further be appreciated that network coding operation may be initiated at any time during communication.

Satellite or the network coding controller shown in located within satellite may process the information received from terminal Tand terminal T i.e. perform a XOR network coding operation on the information received from terminal Tand terminal T. Satellite may then broadcast the processed information to terminal Tand terminal T i.e. broadcast a single downlink message containing the XOR network coded information. Terminal Tand terminal Tmay process the received broadcast downlink message to retrieve the desired information at each terminal T T. This process is more fully described below with respect to .

In these applications the XORed data sequence i i will generally have to be encoded with a physical layer FEC of code rate R

It should be appreciated that the DL transmission channels from network hub to each terminal T Tmay have different reliability levels due to different received signal to noise ratios SNRs . In the conventional XOR network coding approach as shown in the FEC code rate R should be chosen to accommodate the worst DL channel that is the channel with the lowest received SNR. Since the DL channel with the higher received SNR can accommodate a higher code rate for the same prescribed bit error rate BER performance this can result in a substantial decrease in the achievable information transmission rate that can be delivered to the terminal with the higher received SNR downlink channel. Consequently this asymmetry in the downlink channel reliabilities from network hub to terminals T Treduces the potential capacity gain that can be achieved by using the conventional network coding scheme.

Embodiments of the present invention identify a physical layer network coding approach that removes this limitation. are flowcharts and illustrating a physical layer network coding approach according to an embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that the process shown in may be executed by a processor of a terminal and the process shown in may be executed by a processor at the network coding controller.

In this embodiment in order for terminal Tto communicate with terminal T the processor at terminal Tmay assign frame sequence numbers to the data packets and control packets also known as a transmission message at and send a UL transmission message to the network coding controller at . A similar process is executed by the processor at terminal Twhen terminal Tcommunicates with terminal T.

Moving to the network coding controller may receive the UL transmission message from terminal Tat A and receive the UL transmission message from terminal Tat B. The network coding controller may then remove and replace the UL control packets in each of the UL transmission messages with high level data link control HDLC fill characters at A B and separately DL FEC encode at A B the data packets and HDLC fill characters in each transmission message to generate DL FEC encoded bits. For example the transmission message from terminal Tis DL FEC 1 encoded while the transmission message from terminal Tis DL FEC 2 encoded.

At the network coding controller may perform a network XOR encoding operation to the DL FEC 1 encoded bits and the DL FEC 2 encoded bits and generate at a DL XOR network coded sequence containing the data packets from the transmission message from terminal Tand the data packets from the transmission message from terminal Talong with the frame sequence numbers previously assigned by terminal Tand terminal T respectively. At the network coding controller may insert into the transmission message DL control signals for terminal Tand DL control signals for terminal T. Finally at the network coding controller may broadcast the DL transmission message containing encoded transmission messages to both terminal Tand terminal T.

Returning to terminal T for example may receive the DL transmission message from the network coding controller at and remove the DL control signals inserted by the network coding controller at . As noted above terminal Tpreviously transmitted the UL transmission message intended for terminal T. This UL transmission message is network XOR decoded with the received DL XOR network coded transmission message at and then FEC 2 decoded to obtain the intended transmission message from terminal Tat . Because the intended transmission message included HDLC fill characters previously inserted by network coding controller NCC at step A and step B as shown in terminal Tmay remove the HDLC fill characters at to recover the data packets transmitted by terminal Tat . It should be appreciated that terminal Tmay undergo a similar process to recover the data packets sent by terminal T.

The steps shown in may be performed in part by a computer program encoding instructions for a nonlinear adaptive processor to cause at least the processes described in to be performed by the apparatuses discussed herein. The computer program may be embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may be but is not limited to a hard disk drive a flash device a random access memory a tape or any other such medium used to store data. The computer program may include encoded instructions for controlling the nonlinear adaptive processor to implement the processes described in which may also be stored on the computer readable medium.

The computer program can be implemented in hardware software or a hybrid implementation. The computer program can be composed of modules that are in operative communication with one another and which are designed to pass information or instructions to display. The computer program can be configured to operate on a general purpose computer digital signal processor or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

In this embodiment a dedicated duplex communications session between terminals T Tis employed using a physical layer XOR network coding architecture. This allows for a single DL broadcast channel rather than two separate downlink transmission channels to both terminals T T.

It should be appreciated that in military satellite communication networks a universal timing architecture can be employed for the entire system i.e. between the controller NCC and terminals T T to achieve network coding synchronization. In commercial regenerative satellite payload networks a framing structure may be utilized to achieve network coding synchronization. The following description will discuss both architectures.

At terminal T prior to transmission of an UL information stream to controller NCC at least one UL control packet may be encapsulated into at least one Ethernet control packet. The encapsulated UL control packets are then inserted into the UL information stream. The UL information stream may include the Ethernet data packets intended for transmission to the second terminal T as well as the UL control packets intended for controller NCC. An FEC encoder may FEC 1 encode the UL information stream at terminal Tinto FEC 1 coded bits. See for example . A similar process may be executed by terminal T. See also .

Stated differently shows an UL information stream at terminal Tcontaining both data packets and UL control packets and an UL information stream at terminal Tcontaining both data packets and UL control packets. The data packets and the control packets are FEC encoded generating FEC coded bits. The UL information stream at terminal Tcontaining the FEC 1 coded bits may then be transmitted by UL transmitter . Similarly the UL information stream at terminal Tcontaining the FEC 2 coded bits may then be transmitted by UL transmitter .

UL transmitter may then transmit the UL information stream from Tto an UL receiver A at controller NCC and an UL transmitter may also transmit UL information stream from Tto an UL receiver B at controller NCC. FEC 1 Decoder A may decode the FEC 1 coded bits to recover the data packets and the UL control packets in the UL information stream from terminal Tand similarly FEC 2 decoder B may decode the FEC 2 coded bits to recover the data packets and the UL control packets in the UL information stream from terminal T. Because the objective is to incorporate physical layer network coding on the DL transmission broadcasted from controller NCC to both terminals T T the UL control packets are removed and replaced with HDLC fill characters. See for example .

Next FEC 1 encoder A FEC 1 encodes the data packets and the HDLC fill characters in the UL information stream to produce FEC 1 coded bits and separately FEC 2 encoder B FEC 2 encodes the data packets and the HDLC fill characters in the UL information stream from terminal Tto produce FEC 2 coded bits. Stated differently the information streams from both terminals T Tnow comprise of FEC coded bits. See for example .

This allows for FEC 1 encoder A and FEC 2 encoder B to generate code sequence c and code sequence c for the Ethernet data packets and HDLC fill characters in the UL information stream from each terminal T T. It should be appreciated that the FEC 1 code rate in this embodiment is r k n wherein kis the number of information bits and nis the number of code bits in each code word of FEC 1. Similarly FEC 2 code rate in this embodiment is r k n.

XOR network encoder or XOR encoder receives the FEC 1 coded bits i.e. code sequence c from FEC encoder A and FEC 2 coded bits i.e. code sequence c from FEC 2 encoder B and performs a DL XOR physical network coding to generate XOR coded bits i.e. coded sequence c c . Stated differently a DL information stream includes XOR coded bits of the information streams from terminals Tand T. See for example .

Because Ethernet packets encapsulating the DL control packets for each terminal T Tcannot be network encoded the DL control packets are separated from the XOR coding stream. That is the DL control packets are encoded using another FEC encoder and interleaver prior to insertion into predetermined slots of the DL information stream. See for example . The XOR coded stream is also interleaved and inserted in the DL information stream as shown in . It should be appreciated that the other FEC encoder and interleaver may reside in network encoder or may reside as separate devices in controller NCC. The DL information stream may then be modulated and frequency hopped as is employed in military satellite communications prior to transmission or broadcast to terminals T T. Finally downlink transmitter may broadcast the DL information stream to terminals T T.

Receivers and may receive the broadcasted DL information stream. As previously discussed the FEC 1 and FEC 2 encoded UL information streams that were previously transmitted from terminals T Tinclude data packets intended for transmission as well as UL control packets intended for controller NCC. In order for terminals T Tto decipher their respective intended messages from the received broadcasted DL information stream each terminal T Tfirst removes the UL control packets from its UL information stream and replaces the UL control packets with HDLC fill characters to create a modified information stream. This process may be executed by FEC 1 encoder and FEC 2 encoder and or decoders respectively. Next terminal TFEC 1 encodes the data packets and the HDLC fill characters in its modified UL information stream to generate FEC 1 coded bits and similarly terminal TFEC 2 encodes the data packets and the HDLC fill characters in its modified UL information stream to generate FEC 2 coded bits. This process may also be executed by FEC 1 encoder and FEC 2 encoder and or decoders respectively. show for example the process of replacing the control packet with HDLC fill characters as well as generating the FEC coded bits in the modified UL information stream at terminals Tand Trespectively.

The FEC coded bits may then be used to recover the intended FEC coded bits from the received broadcast DL information stream. For example decoder may XOR the FEC 1 coded bits with the XOR coded bits in the received broadcast DL information stream to recover the FEC 2 coded bits generated by FEC 2 encoder B. Similarly decoder may XOR the FEC 2 coded bits with the XOR coded bits in the received broadcast DL information stream to recover the FEC 1 coded bits generated by FEC 1 encoder A. Subsequently FEC 2 decoder located within decoder may decode the recovered FEC 2 coded bits and remove the HDLC fill characters to recover the data packets transmitted from terminal T. An FEC 1 decoder located within decoder may also perform a similar function to recover the data packets transmitted from terminal T. See for example which show the process of recovering the intended data packets at terminals T T respectively.

Although most of the networking coding architecture described above is employed in this embodiment frequency hopping and slot universal timing reference may not be utilized. Instead a different architecture for achieving code synchronization with respect to physical layer XOR network coding is described below. For instance some embodiments utilize a fixed length framing structure for each UL information stream transmitted by terminals T Tto achieve code synchronization. See for example .

These frames can be uniquely identified by including a source terminal identifier and corresponding frame sequence numbers in the frame headers. See for example . Since the received UL transmissions from terminals T Tcan be demodulated and FEC decoded at controller NCC and re FEC encoded for DL transmissions back to terminals T T the DL encoded FEC codewords can be XOR network coded prior to being broadcast to terminals T T. The network coding frames can then use the corresponding source identifiers and UL information stream frame sequence numbers to allow the receiving terminals T Tto synchronize and determine precisely which portion of its UL information stream is used in the network coding frame and thus allow the destination receiving terminals T Tto decode its received data.

Below is a detailed description of the code synchronization process for commercial regenerative satellite payload networks.

In at terminal T a network coding UL framer generates a frame sequence number and inserts the frame sequence number in the UL information such that the UL information stream includes the data packets the control packets the terminal identifier for terminal T and the frame sequence number. Similarly in at terminal T a network coding framer generates a frame sequence number and inserts the frame sequence number in the UL information such that the UL information stream includes the data packets the control packets the terminal identifier for terminal T and the frame sequence number. As will be discussed below the frame sequence number will be used later to recover the intended message at the destination terminal.

At terminal T FEC 1 encoder may FEC 1 encode the frame sequence number the terminal identifier the data packets and the control packets to generate FEC 1 coded bits. See for example which shows the UL information stream containing the FEC 1 coded bits of the frame sequence number the terminal identifier the data packets and the control packets. Similarly as shown in FEC 2 Encoder may perform a similar function to generate FEC 2 coded bits.

It should be appreciated that UL FEC codes are FEC 1 and FEC 2 from Terminals Tand T respectively with respective code rates r k n and r k n . It is possible that r r r r. Prior to transmission by transmitter at terminal T for example the FEC 1 coded bits are UL modulated. A similar process is performed by transmitter at terminal T.

Once receivers A B receive the modulated FEC 1 coded bits from terminals Tand FEC 2 coded bits from terminal T the FEC 1 coded bits and FEC 2 coded bits are demodulated. FEC 1 Decoder A may then decode the FEC 1 coded bits and similarly FEC 2 Decoder B may also decode the FEC 2 coded bits. The control packet may then be removed from the decoded information stream and also be replaced with HDLC fill characters. This is shown in for example .

FEC 1 Encoder A may then FEC 1 encode data packets and HDLC fill characters in the information stream intended for terminal Tto generate DL FEC 1 coded bits and separately FEC 2 Encoder B may FEC 2 encode the data packets and HDLC fill characters in the information stream intended for terminal Tto generate DL FEC 2 coded bits. This process is shown in respectively. However it should be noted that the terminal identifiers and terminal frame sequence numbers that were assigned by the respective terminals T Tare not FEC 1 or FEC 2 encoded.

Network encoder may then XOR network code the DL FEC 1 coded bits and DL FEC 2 coded bits to result in a DL information stream that includes XOR coded bits. The XOR coded bits may now include the information streams from terminal Tand terminal T as well as the HDLC fill characters. Further the XOR network coded information with K n bit codewords may include the source terminal identifiers and corresponding UL information stream frame sequence numbers in its header. See for example .

Because the DL control packets for terminal Tand the DL control packets for terminal Tcannot be network coded DL control packets for terminal T Tare encoded using a different FEC encoder and inserted into a predetermined slot of a DL frame that also contains XOR coded bits. This is shown in .

Finally the processing required in terminals T Tfor recovering the individual code sequences from the received XOR physical network coded sequence are shown in . As noted above prior to transmission from terminal T for example the UL information stream included data packets and control packets. This UL information stream may also contain terminal Tframe sequence numbers inserted by the UL framer. These control packets are replaced with HDLC fill characters at network coding controller NCC prior to DL transmission to terminal T T. See for example . Next the same frame sequence numbers assigned by terminal Tin its uplink transmission are assigned to the information stream and the DL FEC 1 encoder A at network coding controller NCC encodes the data packets and the HDLC fill characters in the UL information stream to generate DL FEC 1 coded bits. This process may be repeated at terminal Tto generate the same DL FEC 1 coded bits of terminal Tdata and HDLC fill characters of its UL control packets. This may be performed by FEC 1 encoder or by FEC 2 decoder as shown in . The assigned terminal Tframe sequence number identifies these DL FEC 1 coded bits. The DL FEC 1 coded bits generated at terminal Tare then XORed with corresponding broadcasted DL XOR coded bits that were received from controller NCC to recover the FEC 2 coded bits. It should be noted that the frame sequence number identifying these DL FEC 1 coded bits should match the terminal Tframe sequence number that identifies the received DL XOR coded bits for this process.

FEC 2 decoder in terminal T may decode the recovered FEC 2 coded bits and remove the HDLC fill to recover the data packets that were transmitted from terminal T. A similar process is shown in for terminal T.
