One or more embodiments of the invention are related to the image processing. More particularly but not by way of limitation one or more embodiments of the invention enable a tilt based look around effect image enhancement method that enables two dimensional images to be depth enhanced and displayed for example from a different point of view based on the tilt or orientation and or movement of the viewing device itself. Embodiments may further alter or otherwise utilize different parallax maps to apply depth to the image based on the display type e.g. two dimensional or stereoscopic display. In addition embodiments may display information foreign to the image when portions of the image are exposed during the look around effect including advertisements game information hyperlinks or any other data not originally in the image.

Depth capable image displays present different image information to be viewed based on the angle at which a viewer is situated with respect to the display. A look around effect occurs as the viewer moves to a different position wherein the display provides different image information based on the point of view of the observer.

One format for viewing images is a two dimensional format for example that may be viewed on a standard computer monitor. When moving about a two dimensional display an observer views the image as a flat for example an image that is displayed in a plane and otherwise without depth although shading and lighting may give the observer a sense of depth for portions of the image. This is not considered a three dimensional view of an image but rather only a two dimensional display. Two dimensional medical imaging systems are the most common and lowest cost system.

Another format for viewing images is a three dimensional format however most three dimensional imagery is displayed in an encoded format and projected onto a two dimensional display. This enables three dimensional viewing for example with anaglyph glasses or polarized glasses. Other displays may provide different information based on the orientation with respect to the display e.g. autostereoscopic displays that do not require special glasses for viewing. An example of such as display is a lenticular display. Alternatively two images that are shown alternately to the left and right eyes that may be viewed with shutter glasses. Any display type may be utilized for the look around effect as long as objects or portions thereof appear when viewed from one orientation that are not visible from another orientation. Many types of three dimensional systems are more expensive than existing two dimensional imaging systems. All known types of displays capable of observing the look around effect require the observer to move around the display to observe the effect.

What is unknown in the art is a tilt based look around effect image enhancement method that enables two dimensional images to be depth enhanced and viewed for example from a different point of view based on the tilt of the viewing device itself. This would enable tablet computers and mobile devices to display the effect with standard two dimensional display technology. For at least the limitations described above there is a need for a tilt based look around effect image enhancement method.

One or more embodiments described in the specification are related to a tilt based look around effect image enhancement method. Thus embodiments of the invention enable display of a look around effect applied to two dimensional images to provide a sense of depth and inner image relative movement of near and distant portions of the image based on tilt or orientation or for example movement in the plane parallel to the display or away from the plane parallel to the display. Although embodiments of the invention may utilize two dimensional displays embodiments may also display images on stereoscopic displays for example for viewing with or without three dimensional viewing glasses.

One or more embodiments of the method include a tilt based look around effect image enhancement method that includes obtaining an orientation of a display with respect to a reference frame from an orientation element physically associated with the display. This enables tilting a two dimensional or stereoscopic display for example on a tablet or mobile computer to show motion of foreground objects and in effect show the image from a different point of view. Embodiments of the method further include obtaining a parallax map associated with an image wherein the parallax map includes at least two different depth values associated with at least two different pixels of the image respectively. The parallax map in at least one embodiment may contain maximum pixel motion values for maximum tilt or orientation or movement for example based on normalized parallax values. Embodiments of the method also include moving at least one of the at least two pixels in the image to at least one new pixel location based on the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame and or based on movement of the display and based on the parallax map. This enables the nearest pixels to move the most in general on the display when the display is tilted or moved for example. In one or more embodiments the display type e.g. two dimensional or stereoscopic display may be utilized to enhance the parallax map in multiple ways depending on how the display is configured currently to display the image. In one or more embodiments certain types of displays may be configured to display two dimensional data or pairs of images or encoded images for viewing with the left and right eye for example with or without special viewing glasses. Embodiments of the method include displaying the image on the display including the at least one pixel in the image in the at least one new pixel location. The image may thus be viewed from a different point of view.

In one or more embodiments the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame includes obtaining an orientation vector from the orientation element. Some electronic devices include an orientation element that for example may provide a three dimensional vector which indicates the direction relative to the display plane e.g. normal to the plane in which the displays is situated. In this scenario embodiments of the invention may determine the reference plane from which movement is related to so as to calculate the amount of tilt about the horizontal axis the tilt about the vertical axis or the X and Y axes respectively. Alternatively or in combination embodiments of the invention may also be configured such that the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame includes obtaining at least one acceleration value or angular value or both from the orientation element. This for example may be the case if the electronic device having the display includes an accelerometer or gyroscope which are commonly provided in MEMS or Micro Electro Mechanical Systems packaging. Some types of electronic devices may utilize an accelerometer to provide an orientation vector as part of an Application Programming Interface. In at least one embodiment the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame includes obtaining the orientation with respect to a vector associated with gravity. In this scenario the initial frame of reference from which to apply the look around effect is the vertical display orientation or an angular offset thereof for example. In other embodiments the user may assert an input that is obtained by the electronic device to signify the desired initial frame of reference. This enables the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame to include obtaining the orientation with respect to an initial reference frame of the display at a particular point in time. One or more embodiments may include modifying the frame of reference over time for example with a time averaged or time weighted function applied to orientation vector samples. This allows for a new orientation that has been applied to the display to be the starting point for further look around effect movements. This may also be utilized to apply a momentum type effect to the movement so that the image continues to move for a defined amount of time after an orientation change.

One or more embodiments may include normalizing a depth map having depth values for the at least two different pixels of the image to create the parallax map. The parallax map associated with an image for example may be encoded for the amount of pixel movement to apply to a 90 degree or full tilt for example of the display in the X or Y axes or both for example. Although a depth map for example 10 to 5 may be utilized and calculations may be undertaken to determine a viewpoint and amount of pixel movement the parallax map encodes on a pixel by pixel basis the amount of movement to minimize the processing required on the electronic device. This also lowers processing power requirements and battery requirements as well.

In addition embodiments of the invention may also include altering values of the parallax map to exaggerate depth values. This may be performed in multiple manners or for example using a strategy pattern to apply different exaggeration amounts based on the type of the display e.g. two dimensional which enjoys advantages for look around effect with higher exaggerations or stereoscopic which in general provides enough three dimensional effect by an of itself to warrant more limited movement nearer objects e.g. less movement of foreground pixels. For example one or more embodiments may include altering values of the parallax map to provide to a two dimensional display to exaggerate depth values for example based on a squared or cubed or higher power for example to accentuate the effect. One or more embodiments may include altering values of the parallax map to provide to a stereoscopic display to exaggerate depth values for example as a linear or smaller relative power compared to the two dimensional exaggerated values since the stereoscopic effect provides an easier to view look around effect for some viewers. Any other functions may be utilized to display images on different display types and the functions may be dynamically switched when the display type is switched from two dimensional to three dimensional viewing or visa versa for example.

Embodiments may include altering values of the parallax map based on a display based on two different functions respectively based on a display output type associated with the display depending on whether the display is currently configured to display two dimensional images or stereoscopic images. This enables the same image to be viewed with look around effect in different ways and dynamically switching between types with the display type is switched on the device as well.

Embodiments may include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector with respect to the reference frame and multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image. The multiply function may be linear or non linear in that any function or ramp of any shape may also be utilized in the multiply operation to may slight movements more or less visible to a viewer of the display. One or more embodiments may include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector with respect to the reference frame over time and multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image over time. This enables the tilt vector to have a momentum like effect of continuing to move in a smoother manner for example between two orientations.

Embodiments of the invention may also include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector with respect to the reference frame in at least two dimensions orthogonal from each other and parallel to a plane defined by the display. Embodiments may include calculating a movement direction based on the percentage in each of two the directions and also include multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map in the movement direction to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image. Alternatively embodiments may include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector or movement with respect to the reference frame in two dimensions orthogonal from each other and parallel to a plane defined by the display and based on movement in a third dimension not parallel to the plane defined by the display. Embodiments in this translation scenario may include calculating a movement direction based on the percentage in each of two the directions multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map in the movement direction to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image and either translating the image based on the movement with respect to the reference frame in two dimensions or translating the image based on the movement in the third dimension or both translating in the two dimensions and in the third dimension as well.

Embodiments of the invention may also include revealing information foreign to the image and hidden by foreground objects wherein the information includes an advertisement gaming information such as a game clue or prize or a hyperlink or any other information that is hidden in the image until the image is viewed from a different point of view based on the tilt or translation for example.

Embodiments may also include compositing at least two images to form the image. This enables multiple cards or images to be combined into a final output image and other wise enables multiple separate images to be independently generated and depth augmented and later combined for example with optional depth normalization between the multiple images.

Embodiments of the invention include displaying the image on a two dimensional display and or generating a left eye viewpoint image and a right eye viewpoint image and displaying the left eye viewpoint image and the right eye viewpoint image on a stereoscopic display and or generating an encoded three dimensional image and displaying the encoded image for three dimensional viewing with or without three dimensional viewing glasses.

A tilt based look around effect image enhancement method will now be described. In the following exemplary description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. It will be apparent however to an artisan of ordinary skill that the present invention may be practiced without incorporating all aspects of the specific details described herein. In other instances specific features quantities or measurements well known to those of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention. Readers should note that although examples of the invention are set forth herein the claims and the full scope of any equivalents are what define the metes and bounds of the invention.

In addition embodiments of the invention may also include altering values of the parallax map to exaggerate depth values. This may be performed in multiple manners or for example using a strategy pattern to apply different exaggeration amounts based on the type of the display e.g. two dimensional which enjoys advantages for look around effect with higher exaggerations or stereoscopic which in general provides enough three dimensional effect by an of itself to warrant more limited movement nearer objects e.g. less movement of foreground pixels. For example one or more embodiments may include altering values of the parallax map to provide parallax map for use with a two dimensional display to exaggerate depth values using an equation such as 1 power 1 1 1 0.3 

One or more embodiments may include altering values of the parallax map to provide parallax map for use with a stereoscopic display to exaggerate depth values using an equation such as 

These exemplary equations may be utilized but are not intended to be limiting as other functions with more or less exaggeration may be utilized to provide the amount of look around effect desired for the particular display type or application as one skilled in the art will recognize.

Embodiments may include altering values of the parallax map based on a display based on two different functions respectively based on a display output type associated with the display depending on whether the display is currently configured to display two dimensional images or stereoscopic images. This enables the same image to be viewed with look around effect in different ways and dynamically switching between types with the display type is switched on the device as well.

In one or more embodiments the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame includes obtaining an orientation vector from the orientation element for example via processor . Some electronic devices include an orientation element that for example may provide a three dimensional vector which indicates the direction relative to the display plane e.g. normal to the plane in which the displays is situated. In this scenario embodiments of the invention may determine the reference plane from which movement is related to so as to calculate the amount of tilt about the horizontal axis the tilt about the vertical axis or the X and Y axes respectively. Alternatively or in combination embodiments of the invention may also be configured such that the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame includes obtaining at least one acceleration value or angular value or both from the orientation element . This for example may be the case if the electronic device having the display includes an accelerometer or gyroscope which are commonly provided in MEMS or Micro Electro Mechanical Systems packaging. Some types of electronic devices may utilize an accelerometer to provide an orientation vector as part of an Application Programming Interface. In at least one embodiment the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame includes obtaining the orientation with respect to a vector associated with gravity for example vertically down or orthogonal to the plane of the horizon. In this scenario the initial frame of reference from which to apply the look around effect is the vertical display orientation or an angular offset thereof for example 15 degrees tilted back at a normal viewing angle. In other embodiments the user may assert an input that is obtained by the electronic device to signify the desired initial frame of reference. This enables the obtaining of the orientation of the display with respect to the reference frame to include obtaining the orientation with respect to an initial reference frame of the display at a particular point in time for example after touching the screen or on application startup etc. One or more embodiments may include modifying the frame of reference over time for example with a time averaged or time weighted function applied to orientation vector samples. This allows for a new orientation that has been applied to the display to be the starting point for further look around effect movements. This may also be utilized to apply a momentum type effect to the movement so that the image continues to move for a defined amount of time after an orientation change. In one or more embodiments the average may be utilized such as the sum of orientation vectors divided by the number of orientation vectors to determine the averaged orientation vector. Any other function may be utilized to weight the more recent vectors more or less heavily for example to provide different effects including overshoot.

Embodiments may include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector with respect to the reference frame and multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image. The multiply function may be linear or non linear in that any function or ramp of any shape may also be utilized in the multiply operation to may slight movements more or less visible to a viewer of the display. One or more embodiments may include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector with respect to the reference frame over time and multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image over time. This enables the tilt vector to have a momentum like effect of continuing to move in a smoother manner for example between two orientations. For example as shown in the top portion of if the display is tilted 10 degrees back then in one or more embodiments the parallax map values are multiplied by 10 90 and moved by that amount in the positive Y direction.

Embodiments of the invention may also include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector with respect to the reference frame in at least two dimensions orthogonal from each other and parallel to a plane defined by the display. Embodiments may include calculating a movement direction based on the percentage in each of two the directions and also include multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map in the movement direction to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image. Alternatively embodiments may include obtaining a percentage of full tilt based on the orientation vector or movement with respect to the reference frame in two dimensions orthogonal from each other and parallel to a plane defined by the display and based on movement in a third dimension not parallel to the plane defined by the display. Embodiments in this translation scenario may include calculating a movement direction based on the percentage in each of two the directions multiplying the percentage of full tilt by the parallax map in the movement direction to obtain a pixel by pixel amount of movement to utilize in moving the at least one pixel in the image and either translating the image based on the movement with respect to the reference frame in two dimensions or translating the image based on the movement in the third dimension or both translating the image in two dimensions and also the third dimension. For example if the display is moved 1 foot closer to the user and the translation factor is normalized to 2 feet then the image may be translated by the maximum factor multiplied by . The entire image is then scaled by this amount and displayed for example as shown in . Translation to the left right or up down may also be scaled to a range of normalized movement by moving pixels left right or up down based on the amount of movement detected along the X and Y axes. In one or more embodiments the apparatus may include accepting an input on the display wherein the display is a touch display and wherein the input translates the image in a third dimension not parallel to the plane defined by the display when two finger inputs are pinched toward one another or separated from one another.

Embodiments of the invention may also include revealing information foreign to the image such as foreign information and hidden by foreground objects wherein the information includes an advertisement gaming information such as a game clue or prize or a hyperlink or any other information that is hidden in the image until the image is viewed from a different point of view based on the tilt or translation for example. This enables enhanced advertisement gaming and reading for example and provides opportunities for businesses to capitalize on enhanced look around features for but not limited to marketing gaming and publication related businesses.

Embodiments may also include compositing at least two images to form the image. This enables multiple cards or sub images to be combined into a final output image and other wise enables multiple separate images to be independently generated and depth augmented and later combined for example with optional depth normalization between the multiple images. As shown in the sub images may be provided and displayed on any type of display with the look around effect.

Embodiments of the invention include displaying the image on a two dimensional display see bottom right and or generating a left eye viewpoint image and a right eye viewpoint image and displaying the left eye viewpoint image and the right eye viewpoint image on a stereoscopic display see bottom left and or generating an encoded three dimensional image and displaying the encoded image for three dimensional viewing with or without three dimensional viewing glasses.

While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the claims.
