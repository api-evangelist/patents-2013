Due to their excellent activity the compounds of the present invention may be used for controlling invertebrate pests.

The animal pest also referred to as invertebrate pest i.e. the insects arachnids and nematodes the plant soil or water in which the plant is growing can be contacted with the present compounds of formula I or composition s comprising them by any application method known in the art. As such contacting includes both direct contact applying the compounds compositions directly on the animal pest or plant typically to the foliage stem or roots of the plant and indirect contact applying the compounds compositions to the locus of the animal pest or plant .

The compounds of formula I or the pesticidal compositions comprising them may be used to protect growing plants and crops from attack or infestation by animal pests especially insects acaridae or arachnids by contacting the plant crop with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula I. The term crop refers both to growing and harvested crops.

The compounds of the present invention and the compositions comprising them are particularly important in the control of a multitude of insects on various cultivated plants such as cereal root crops oil crops vegetables spices ornamentals for example seed of durum and other wheat barley oats rye maize fodder maize and sugar maize sweet and field corn soybeans oil crops crucifers cotton sunflowers bananas rice oilseed rape turnip rape sugarbeet fodder beet eggplants potatoes grass lawn turf fodder grass tomatoes leeks pumpkin squash cabbage iceberg lettuce pepper cucumbers melons species melons beans peas garlic onions carrots tuberous plants such as potatoes sugar cane tobacco grapes petunias geranium pelargoniums pansies and

The compounds of the present invention are employed as such or in form of compositions by treating the insects or the plants plant propagation materials such as seeds soil surfaces materials or rooms to be protected from insecticidal attack with an insecticidally effective amount of the active compounds. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of the plants plant propagation materials such as seeds soil surfaces materials or rooms by the insects.

The present invention also includes a method of combating animal pests which comprises contacting the animal pests their habitat breeding ground food supply cultivated plants seed soil area material or environment in which the animal pests are growing or may grow or the materials plants seeds soils surfaces or spaces to be protected from animal attack or infestation with a pesticidally effective amount of a mixture of at least one active compound I. Moreover animal pests may be controlled by contacting the target pest its food supply habitat breeding ground or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula I. As such the application may be carried out before or after the infection of the locus growing crops or harvested crops by the pest.

The compounds of the invention can also be applied preventively to places at which occurrence of the pests is expected.

The compounds of formula I may be also used to protect growing plants from attack or infestation by pests by contacting the plant with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula I. As such contacting includes both direct contact applying the compounds compositions directly on the pest and or plant typically to the foliage stem or roots of the plant and indirect contact applying the compounds compositions to the locus of the pest and or plant .

 Locus means a habitat breeding ground plant seed soil area material or environment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow.

The term plant propagation material is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers e.g. potatoes which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds roots fruits tubers bulbs rhizomes shoots sprouts and other parts of plants. Seedlings and young plants which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil may also be included. These plant propagation materials may be treated prophylactically with a plant protection compound either at or before planting or transplanting.

The term cultivated plants is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering. Genetically modified plants are plants the genetic material of which has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding mutations or natural recombination. Typically one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post transitional modification of protein s oligo or polypeptides for example by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties e.g. as disclosed in Biotechnol Prog. 2001 July August 17 4 720 8. Protein Eng Des Sel. 2004 January 17 1 57 66 Nat Protoc. 2007 2 5 1225 35. Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2006 October 10 5 487 91. Epub 2006 Aug. 28. Biomaterials. 2001 March 22 5 405 17 Bioconjug Chem. 2005 January February 16 1 113 21 .

The term cultivated plants is to be understood also including plants that have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides such as hydroxy phenylpyruvate dioxygenase HPPD inhibitors acetolactate synthase ALS inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 222 100 WO 01 82685 WO 00 26390 WO 97 41218 WO 98 02526 WO 98 02527 WO 04 106529 WO 05 20673 WO 03 14357 WO 03 13225 WO 03 14356 WO 04 16073 or imidazolinones see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 222 100 WO 01 82685 WO 00 26390 WO 97 41218 WO 98 02526 WO 98 02527 WO 04 106529 WO 05 20673 WO 03 14357 WO 03 13225 WO 03 14356 WO 04 16073 enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase EPSPS inhibitors such as glyphosate see e.g. WO 92 00377 glutamine synthetase GS inhibitors such as glufosinate see e.g. EP A 0242236 EP A 242246 or oxynil herbicides see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 559 024 as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding mutagenesis for example Clearfield summer rape Canola being tolerant to imidazolinones e.g. imazamox. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean cotton corn beets and rape tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady glyphosate and LibertyLink glufosinate .

The term cultivated plants is to be understood also including plants that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins especially those known from the bacterial genus particularly from such as endotoxins e.g. CryIA b CryIA c CryIF CryIF a2 CryIIA b CryIIIA CryIIIB b1 or Cry9c vegetative insecticidal proteins VIP e.g. VIP1 VIP2 VIP3 or VIP3A insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes for example spp. or spp. toxins produced by animals such as scorpion toxins arachnid toxins wasp toxins or other insect specific neurotoxins toxins produced by fungi such Streptomycetes toxins plant lectins such as pea or barley lectins agglutinins proteinase inhibitors such as trypsin inhibitors serine protease inhibitors patatin cystatin or papain inhibitors ribosome inactivating proteins RIP such as ricin maize RIP abrin luffin saporin or bryodin steroid metabolism enzymes such as 3 hydroxysteroid oxidase ecdysteroid IDP glycosyl transferase cholesterol oxidases ecdysone inhibitors or HMG CoA reductase ion channel blockers such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels juvenile hormone esterase diuretic hormone receptors helicokinin receptors stilben synthase bibenzyl synthase chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre toxins hybrid proteins truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains see for example WO 02 015701 . Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed for example in EP A 374 753 WO 93 007278 WO 95 34656 EP A 427 529 EP A 451 878 WO 03 018810 und WO 03 052073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described for example in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins protection from harmful pests from certain taxonomic groups of arthropods particularly to beetles Coleoptera flies Diptera and butterflies and moths Lepidoptera and to plant parasitic nematodes Nematoda .
