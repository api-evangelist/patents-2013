The technical field is relating documents on computer networks and storing indexing and presenting those relationships to network users.

Networks connecting many computers offer users access to a wide variety of information. Computers are exceptional devices for storing sorting and relating large amounts of information. Information is stored on computers and networked computing and storage devices as documents or objects together referred to as document objects. Such document objects may contain any form of information from text documents and articles financial data statistical information electronic mail images and photos music animation and even motion pictures.

The term computer or computing device although generally thought of to mean a general purpose digital computing device may include any one of several different information processing and communications devices including mainframe computers server computers minicomputers personal computers laptop portable computers handheld computers personal digital assistants intelligent wireless phones and any other device with a microprocessor and an operating system enabling the device to be connected to a network of other information processing and communications devices.

The Internet as a network of interconnected networks offers users access to an even broader collection of information the Worldwide Web the Web . On the Web publishers offer information for educational recreational commercial and other purposes. The Internet and its predominant Web form is organized and accessed by assigning document objects an address or Uniform Resource Locator URL . These URLs define the transfer protocol for and location of each individual document object on the Internet or other network including the Internetworking Protocol IP address of the host computer system of the document object.

A URL may also represent an address including instructions for accessing a document object that is generated on request by retrieving and rendering for presentation organized information in response to information supplied by the requestor. When the URL contains enough information to recreate the document object generated in such a manner that document object can be recreated for others using the URL. A URL may also include information sometimes called a bookmark with information allowing the rendering tool to present or highlight a location in the document upon opening the document.

Users accessing computer networks and the Internet are generally required to perform their own searches across the networks for the information stored as document objects that they desire or need. As the amount of information available on computer networks and on the Internet in particular grows exponentially existing search and information location techniques become increasingly less effective. Existing Internet search techniques often yield too many seemingly related references that are not in fact truly useful to the user. The usefulness of traditional Internet search and indexing systems is actually decreasing as the number of documents on the Internet explodes.

Existing search categorization and retrieval techniques for document objects stored on computer networks while generally executed at the high speeds of modern computer systems are increasingly imprecise and often much too broad as well as time and labor intensive owing to the explosion of information being added to those networks.

A need exists to enhance the network user s information search and browsing experience. A need exists to provide network users with information relevant to the individual document object they are accessing and provide that information in a context of value to them by relating the document object they are accessing to link references to other document objects within a specific context. Such other document objects may or may not be offered by the publisher of the document object currently accessed. A need exists to provide network users with information relevant to the specific information the user may be searching for and relevant to the user s immediate personal professional geographic and other interests.

A need exists to access information available on the network by accessing relationships between document objects that are relevant to one another. A need further exists to allow alternate techniques for viewing and navigating relationships between document objects that are relevant to one another. A need further exists to provide users with access to these multiple frameworks for management of and access to document objects.

A need further exists to facilitate educated selection of the kinds of relationships that the user is interested in and the document objects in those relationships by presenting the relationships with managing information while viewing document objects on the network.

A need exists for entities or groups to be able to communicate information to their employees or members as those employees or members access document objects on a network and to enable those employees or members to view content deemed important to the entities or groups. A need further exists for publishers of content on the Internet to be able to personalize content presented to Internet users without requiring the establishment of a personal relationship between the user and the content publisher. A need exists to enable the collection of the search experiences of a group of users and share that experience with other users of networked information devices.

These needs reflect a broader need to reduce the time and effort involved and to provide increased user satisfaction in user searches for relevant document objects on a network.

Furthermore a need exists to present a user accessing document objects on the network with a view of a document object the user is accessing and document objects related to that document object within a framework for management and presentation developed by the user and by other users of the network.

Wireless communication and information processing devices present unique challenges to the user in finding document objects offered on the network to which the device is wirelessly connected. Some of the challenges include one or more of the following.

On some wireless networks the speed of the data transfer is limited by the communications network the devices the proximity of the device to a network interface and the activity load on that network. The upload of a request for information and the download of a response can be perceived as being very long. A need exists to assist the user with navigation and selection of document objects to minimize the number of times they click through document objects that are presented to the user without enough context to ascertain the document objects value before the user selects the document object for download.

Distribution of document objects to users of wireless devices aside from being technically challenging because of the format and the competing and evolving protocol challenges of the wireless networks and devices can be limited based on the portal and application service relationships of the communication services provider or the service provider s network. Those organizations that are developing applications and infrastructure that provide services endeavor to structure and protect their channel to these users and to develop payment for placement distribution. A need exists to provide improved method for distribution of content to users of handheld devices.

In addition the display screens on handheld devices currently remain very small in order to reduce weight and size of the devices. The screens are much smaller than stationary information processing devices thus permitting very limited viewing areas. Therefore a limited amount of information can be presented to a user of such a device at any one time without scrolling through multiple screens of data. The context of the information displayed can be lost without the whole picture offered in the large screen typical of a stationary information processing device. Users of such devices prefer presentation of shorter lists and shorter document objects. A need exists to provide access to a greater breadth of alternative selections while viewing content condensed for smaller presentation of handheld devices.

Wireless device users may use their devices to perform indirect search functions. These indirect search functions include search experiences where the user is looking for information based on their current instance. For example a user may be viewing in their wireless device a document object containing news about a disaster in a region of the world. The user s interest in the news may be related to an investment in a company in that part of the world. The user s indirect search of the impact of the disaster on their investment requires the initial context of the disaster. A successful indirect search allows the user to find the impact on their investment related to the context of the disaster. A need exists to allow users to navigate and access document objects using complex relationships between document objects based on the context of their current search instance. A need further exists to narrow a search for document objects without excluding related document objects based on methods of narrowing a search.

Data entry may be limited depending on the type of device. Handheld information processing and communications devices may use handwriting recognition miniaturized or portable QWERTY keyboards or numeric keypads with extra function buttons. Entry of text using these devices can be difficult. A need exists to improve navigation of distributed information by facilitating selection and reducing entry of search query attributes.

The systems apparatus and methods of the present invention hereinafter Linkspace incorporate and provide many improvements on existing methods for distributing relating and searching document objects on computer networks including the Internet.

Linkspace operates to provide many beneficial improvements in searching and identifying information over computer networks.

Linkspace permits a user of a network or the Internet to establish relationships between document objects located on the network or the Internet. Those relationships may comprise link relationships and link references and are maintained by Linkspace in one or more link directories. The contents of link directories may be organized categorized sorted and filtered in groupings based on various criteria relating to among other things user interests and attributes the types of document objects and the nature of the content of those document objects. Linkspace allows a network user to be presented with a selection of links to document objects related to the document object the user is currently accessing based upon the URL of the current document object and link relationships created by the user and other users of the network stored in the link directories.

When a network user equipped with Linkspace identifies and locates a first document object on the network that is of interest to her she may initiate one method of the present invention to mark the location through its URL as a start point of a link relationship. When she accesses a second document object on the network that she considers relevant to the first document object she initiates another step of one method of the invention to mark the second document object as an end point of the link relationship. Upon marking the second document object as the end point the link relationship is created and stored on a link directory selected to store similar link relationships. When a second network user equipped with Linkspace and with access to the link directory accesses the first document object he is then presented with a link to the second document object as a relevant document object that may be of interest to him. Likewise if the second network user accesses the second document object he may then be presented with a link to the first document object as a relevant document object that may be of interest to him.

Linkspace consists of a system and method for creating and publishing link relationships a system and method for storing and managing link relationships in link directories and a system and method for presenting a network user with links related by link relationships to the document object the user is currently accessing.

In one respect what is described is a method for searching document object relationships. The method may include the step of selecting one or more initial search items from a group consisting of a document objects b link references to document objects c link reference attributes and d link relationship attributes. The method may also include steps for identifying one or more link relationships using the selected initial search items and for presenting one or more link relationships attributes describing the identified link relationships.

In another respect what is described is a user interface for presenting and searching relationships between document objects located on a network. The user interface may include a first portion of a screen display for displaying one or more link relationship attributes and a second portion of the screen display for displaying one or more entries from a group consisting of a link references that represent the document objects b link relationship attributes describing the link relationships c link reference attributes describing the link references and d document objects. The displayed entries in the second portion of the user interface are related to the displayed one or more link relationship attributes in the first portion.

In yet another respect what is described is a computer readable medium on which is embedded a program. The embedded program comprises modules that execute the above method.

The methods and computer readable medium may be used in conjunction with handheld and wireless devices.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate these and other advantages and benefits of various embodiments of the invention upon reading the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment with reference to the below listed drawings.

The link reference comprises a pointer to one document object on the network and attributes associated with that document object . The link relationship comprises two pointers one each to the first document object and to the second document object and attributes describing characteristics of the relationship between the two document objects related by the link relationship . The pointers included in a link relationship may be comprised of pointers to a link reference . The link relationship establishes a meaningful relationship between two document objects whereas the locations of the document objects may be maintained within the Linkspace system by means of the link references .

The system shown in operates to create and store link relationships . The system creates and stores link relationships between a first document object and a second document object preferably on one or more servers in one or more link directories in the manner described as follows. The client device is enabled by means of software or other devices to request access and display document objects on the network . When the user of a client device identifies one first document object of interest to her that she wishes to associate with a second document object she utilizes the software running on the Linkspace enabled client device to create a link relationship between the first document object and the second document object . This link relationship is then stored on the server in a link directory .

In an alternate embodiment the system may operate to perform the functions described above including the creation of link relationships and link references the storing of link relationships and link references and providing access to and retrieval of link relationships and link references by means of automated procedures requiring little or no user interaction.

When a client device later requests and accesses a first document object for which the server has stored an associated link relationship in one or more link directories the server delivers to the client device the link references and the link relationships along with contextual information or attributes associated with the link references and the link relationships . The client device then displays to the user of the client device the existence of a link relationship between the first document object being accessed by the client device and the second document object . This enables the user of the client device to be made aware of the second document object the context of the second document object and the context of the relationship between the second document object and the first document object as that relationship may be of interest to the user of the client device while viewing the first document object .

Each link relationship may also operate in the reverse direction. In this manner when a user of the client device is accessing the second document object for which an associated link relationship is stored in the one or more link directories on the server the server then transmits the link references and the link relationships with contextual information to the client device . This enables display of the availability of the related first document object to the user of the client device with the context of the first document object and within the context of its relationship to the displayed second document object .

While the system is generally described as having enabling software resident on the client device and on the server various other software configurations are possible including having all of the software resident at either the server making the client device essentially a dumb terminal or at the client device making the client device essentially perform server functions or various software sharing arrangements. For example the client device may include the one or more link directories a communications module described later in reference to and a user data store that may maintain information regarding authorized users of the client device described later in reference to and .

The rendering tool may store a document object URL address for referring to the document object currently being accessed and rendered by the rendering tool . The rendering tool may also include a Graphic User Interface GUI display or other type of display for displaying the document objects accessed and rendered by the rendering tool . In alternate embodiments of the invention the client device may include more than one rendering tool enabling the user of the client device to access multiple document objects.

The client tool may include a client GUI display or other display software and hardware for displaying link references and link relationships to the user of the client device . Typically the displayed link references and link relationships would be those link references and link relationships relevant to the document object currently being rendered and displayed by the rendering tool as determined by the document object URL address in the rendering tool . The client tool may also include Linkspace user profile data for storing information about the user of the client device the link directories the user may have access to and the attributes of link references and attributes of link relationships that the user may be interested in. The Linkspace user profile data may also or alternatively be stored on the one or more servers along with the Linkspace user profile data of all other users of the system .

An example of how the client device operates to create and present link relationships to users of the client device follows. While the network access tool is active and placing the client device in communication with the network the user enables the rendering tool and the client tool . The user may then request and access document objects stored on the network by means of the rendering tool . Through the GUI display the users enters or otherwise selects a document object URL address associated with the first document object of interest to the user. The client tool connects to and uses the rendering tool and accesses the document object URL address associated with the first document object . The client tool then establishes contact with the server and passes to the server the stored document object URL address associated with the first document object along with any relevant information that may come from the Linkspace user profile data . The connection to the server may be initiated through the network access tool or by other means not utilizing the network access tool .

The Linkspace enabled server searches the link directories for any URLs in the link references matching or similar to the document object URL address . After searching the server retrieves the one or more link relationships that include the document object URL address . Prior to searching the URLs may be stripped of any information not relevant to the location of the document object on the network . Such information not relevant to the location of the document object may include query strings or other data attached to URLs for tracking or other purposes.

The server then determines the link references which may be of interest to the user of the client device by filtering the retrieved link references using the Linkspace user profile data and the attributes assigned to the link references and to the link relationships . The filtering of link references and link relationships may be accomplished by one of several methods of filtering data including matching character and Boolean comparing and other data comparison and filtering methods. The server then transmits to the client tool the filtered link references included in the one or more link relationships . The client tool presents the transmitted link references within the context established by the link relationships by means of the client GUI display .

To create a new link relationship the user of the client device must select a first document object to begin the link relationship a second document object to complete the link relationship and assign attributes to the link references and the link relationship between the two document objects . To select a first document object to begin the new link relationship the user interacts with the client GUI display to activate a function of the client tool to capture the document object URL address associated with the first document object . To select a second document object to complete the new link relationship the user may interact with the GUI display of the rendering tool to request access and display the second document object . The user may then interact with the client GUI display again to activate a further function of the client tool to capture the document object URL address associated with the second document object completing the selection of document objects participating in the new link relationship . Once the two document objects are established attributes of the link references and the new link relationship may be assigned.

The user may select or otherwise specify attributes associated with the link references and link relationship . These attributes aid in categorizing sorting or filtering the link references and the link relationship in the link directories for delivery to other client devices . The attributes may be for example descriptive temporal spatial or quantitative in nature i.e. describe the link reference in terms of who or what when where or how much. One such attribute not shown may be a plain language name for the link reference determined and entered by the user to describe the link reference in terms more useful to users of the system than the document object URL address . Other examples of attributes may include description of the content of either of the document objects related by the link relationship wherein that content may be described to include a product review news article product information page competitor s product information or product order forms among other types of content.

Normally upon completion of the endpoint capturing and attribute assignment functions the client tool connects to the server to store the link references and the new link relationship in the appropriate link directory . Generally the new link relationship is then made available to other users. Typically other client devices who have access to the server and are assigned access privileges on the link directory in which the new link relationship has been stored are given access to the new link relationship .

Furthermore if the user of the client device determines that there is a relationship that is not already described by the transmitted link relationships between the currently accessed document object and a second document object the user may proceed to create and publish a new link relationship between the first document object currently accessed and displayed by the rendering tool and the second document object . This may be accomplished without displaying the second document object .

Each of the several link directories or may be associated with and store link references and link relationships . These link references and link relationships may have attributes matching categories defined by an authorized user designated to manage such link directories or . In this manner each link directory or may be considered to be a community of interest. The authorized user designated to manage such link directories or may also establish attributes by which to organize sort and filter the link references and link relationships . Attributes may describe the types and properties of the document objects and the link relationships . Any authorized user of the link directories or may then create and place link references and link relationships in the link directories or and assign attributes to the link references and link relationships .

The user directory includes one or more user data records typically one or more each for every authorized user of the servers . The user data records may include personal identifying data for an associated authorized user and data indicating the link directories to which each user has access.

The user profile store includes one or more user profile records typically one or more each for every authorized user of the servers . The user profile records for each authorized user may further include one or more user profiles .

Each user profile may contain data regarding specific differing configurations of the user s personal professional geographic and other interests and the servers link directories and attributes associated with those interests as entered by the user or collected by the client tool . The data in the user profile may be used to determine what link directories that the user may have engaged. The data in the user profile may further determine what attributes of link references and of link relationships will be considered by the server in returning the link references and the link relationships from the link directories to the user s client device .

The user account store includes one or more user account records usually one each for every authorized user of the servers . The user account records hold information regarding usage of the Linkspace system by each authorized user. The information in the user account records may include data on instances of the publication of link relationships and the transmissions of link relationships and link references based upon the document object displayed by the client tool of each user. In alternate embodiments of the invention data regarding the document objects requested and accessed by users of the system is not recorded in the user account records against the individual authorized user in order to maintain user privacy with regard to what document objects each individual user may request or access.

When an authorized user of a client device creates a link relationship that is stored in one or more of the link directories the server manager records in the user account record associated with the authorized user creating the link relationship the activity of creating and storing a link relationship . Each of the authorized users of the link directories may be allowed to create link relationships to be stored in one or more of the link directories or to which that authorized user is permitted publication access. Each of the authorized users of each specific link directory may also be allowed access for display those link relationships stored in the specific link directory that relate to the first document object or second document object that the user is currently viewing on the user s client device .

The interaction of each of the elements of the server alternate server the client devices and the first second and third document objects and along with the creation and presentation of the link relationships and may be illustrated by the application of the methods and described below with reference to and .

The link relationship table comprises a list of link relationships . These link relationships correspond to the link relationships created by users of the client device as they are stored in the link directory . The link relationship comprises a field containing a link reference L including the URL address of the first document object related by the link relationship a field containing a link reference L including the URL address of the second document object related by the link relationship a set of link relationship attributes and a directional indicator showing the nature of the link relationship between the two document objects either unidirectional or bi directional. The link relationship is shown with the directional indicator specifying that the link relationship is a unidirectional link relationship.

Some or all of the lists of link relationships comprising the link relationship table may in one embodiment of the invention be stored on the server in the form of relational database records. The relational database record corresponding to the link relationship may be comprised of one or more relational database fields corresponding to the field L field L link relationship attributes and directional indicator . Each of the one or more relational database fields may be formatted and designated to store various forms of relational database data types. In one embodiment of the invention the relational database field corresponding to the field as well as the relational database field corresponding to the field may contain data specifying the appropriate URL as text or other format appropriate for the network upon which the invention may be implemented. In one embodiment of the invention the relational database field corresponding to the directional indicator may be formatted as a simple flag i.e. Boolean data type such as True False Yes No or On Off. Alternatively the relational database field corresponding to the directional indicator may be formatted as a type to allow entry of a value indicating whether the link relationship attribute applies forward backward or in both directions across the link relationship . In one embodiment of the invention the link relationship attributes may be represented by one or more relational database fields. In this embodiment the relational database fields comprising the link relationship attributes may include a field of text data listing the assigned titles of the one or more specific link relationship attributes assigned to the link relationship . The relational database fields comprising the link relationship attributes may then also include one or more attribute value fields containing data formatted appropriately for the corresponding link relationship attribute listed in the above described field of text data. For example the plain language name link relationship attribute may have its corresponding value stored in a field formatted as text whereas a zip code attribute may have its corresponding value stored in a field formatted as a 5 or 9 digit integer and a date attribute may have its corresponding value stored in a field formatted in a date format. In an alternative embodiment the relational database fields comprising the link relationship attributes may utilize relational database key fields which point to additional database tables containing the records specifying each available type of link relationship attribute for the link relationship and key fields which point to additional tables containing the values associated with each of link relationship attribute identified by a key.

As with the link relationship the link relationship comprises a field containing a link reference L including the URL address of the first document object related by the link relationship a field containing a third link reference L including the URL address of the third document object related by the link relationship a set of link relationship attributes and a directional indicator showing the nature of the link relationship between the two document objects either unidirectional or bi directional. The link relationship is shown with the directional indicator specifying that the link relationship is a bi directional link relationship. The link relationship comprises a field containing a link reference L including the URL address of the second document object related by the link relationship a field containing the third link reference L including the URL address of the third document object related by the link relationship a set of link relationship attributes and a directional indicator showing the nature of the link relationship between the two document objects either unidirectional or bi directional. The link relationship is shown with the directional indicator specifying that the link relationship is a bi directional link relationship.

The link relationship comprises a field containing a link reference L including the URL address of the second document object related by the link relationship a field containing a link reference L including the URL address of the first document object related by the link relationship a set of link relationship attributes and a directional indicator showing the nature of the link relationship between the two document objects either unidirectional or bi directional. The link relationship is shown with the directional indicator specifying that the link relationship is a unidirectional link relationship.

The link relationship attributes may include a plain language name not shown associated with each of the link references participating in the respective link relationship as determined and entered by the user of the client tool . The plain language name serves to describe the link reference in terms better understood by the users of the system than the URL associated with the link reference . The link relationship attributes serve to describe the link references in terms useful to users of the system and to place the link references in a context that may attract users to select the link references . Other examples of link relationship attributes may include descriptions of the content of either of the document objects related by the link relationship wherein that content may be described to include a product review news article product information page competitor s product information or product order forms among other types of content.

The link relationship may have a value assigned to the directional indicator specifying that the link relationship is a bi directional link relationship. This indicates that the link relationship attributes apply to either of the two document objects and equally in the context of the link relationship .

The link relationship may on the other hand have a value assigned to the direction indicator specifying that the link relationship is a unidirectional link relationship. This signifies that the link relationship attributes apply in only one direction between the two document objects and represented in the fields and through the link references and respectively. In this instance a link relationship will not be transmitted and presented to the user of the client device when requested in the direction opposite to that specified by the direction indicator . In the case of the link relationship shown in the attributes apply only as the link relationship is traversed from the first link reference to the second link reference and not in the reverse direction. In a similar manner the link relationship may have a value assigned to the direction indicator specifying that the link relationship is a unidirectional link relationship. This signifies that the link relationship attributes apply in only one direction between the two document objects and represented in the fields and through the link references and respectively. In the case of the link relationship shown in the attributes apply only as the link relationship is traversed from the second link reference to the first link reference and not in the reverse direction. In this instance a link relationship will not be transmitted and presented to the user of the client device when requested in the direction opposite to that specified by the direction indicator .

In an alternate embodiment the direction indicator of the link relationship may comprise a plurality of directional indicator fields not shown . Each directional indicator field may then correspond to one of the one or more link relationship attributes and indicate whether the corresponding link relationship attribute may apply in one direction or in both directions between the two document objects and represented in the fields and through the link references and respectively. Likewise the direction indicator of the link relationship may comprise a plurality of directional indicator fields not shown . Each directional indicator field may then correspond to one of the one or more link relationship attributes and indicate whether the corresponding link relationship attribute may apply in one direction or in both directions between the two document objects and represented in the fields and through the link references and respectively. In the alternate embodiment a similar arrangement may then be implemented for the remaining direction indicators of the link relationships .

The document object table comprises a set of link references to document objects located on the network to which the link directory is connected. Each link reference further comprises the URL or of the respective document object of interest a set of document object attributes associated with the URL and a list of pointers to any of the link relationships by which the link references may be connected to each other with context. In the case of a link relationship having the direction indicator set to indicate that the link relationship is unidirectional the link relationship will be listed only in the list of pointers for the link reference that begins the unidirectional link relationship . The link references and in correspond to the link references and the third link reference not shown as described in above and which point to the URL addresses of the document objects and respectively.

The document object attributes serve to describe the link references in terms useful to users of the system and to place the link references in a context that may attract users to select the link references . The document object attributes may include a plain language name that serves to describe the document object in terms better understood by the users of the system than the URLs associated with the link references descriptions of the content of the document object associated with link references wherein that content may be described to include a product review news article product information page competitor s product information or product order forms among other types of content and other descriptive characteristics associated with the document object .

The link references and may be created and placed in the document object table when a user of the client device creates a link relationship between a first document object and a second document object or a third document object .

The link relationship table shown in comprises the same list of link relationships detailed above in . In the link relationship comprises a field containing a pointer to the link reference for the first document object related by the link relationship a field containing a pointer to the link reference for the second document object related by the link relationship the link relationship attributes and the directional indicator .

The public network or Internet may have components connected to it that implement the present invention including one or more Linkspace enabled client users one or more link directories one or more Linkspace hosted content units and one or more networked content units . The link directories described here are functionally equivalent to the link directories and described above in connection with and . The Linkspace hosted content units comprise information storage devices connected to the network that provide additional document object storage facilities to users of the Linkspace system separate from the publicly or privately operated networked content units . The networked content units may include networked data servers or web servers.

The Linkspace hosted content units are provided to accommodate the streamlined publication and or distribution of content by users of the Linkspace system . The client tool may allow a user of the Linkspace system to store document objects of his or her own creation through a simplified procedure i.e. a publish document function enabled through the client GUI display . The user of the client device may select a document object that she wishes to publish through the Linkspace hosted content units or she may create a document object not shown using the rendering tool or other document object creation tool. The user of the client device then selects the publish document function through the client GUI display and selects the link directories in which she wishes to create and publish new link relationships referencing the user created or selected document object. The user of the client device may then create and publish link relationships referencing the user created or selected document object. The client tool may automatically upload the user created or selected document object from the user s client device or from another location on the network in this case the Internet and save it on the Linkspace hosted content unit . The client tool may then publish the new link relationships referencing the user created or selected document object to the appropriate link directory and then make the user created or selected document object available to other users of the Linkspace system through the new link relationships . The activity of publishing a user created or selected document object in this manner is also recorded in the appropriate user account record for the user creating or selecting the document object to be published.

Similarly the private network may have connected to it components that implement the present invention including one or more Linkspace enabled client users one or more link directories one or more Linkspace hosted content units and one or more networked content units .

Additionally the closed network may have connected to it components that implement the present invention including one or more Linkspace enabled client users one or more link directories one or more Linkspace hosted content units and one or more networked content units .

In the private network is shown connected to the public network or Internet . This may allow Linkspace enabled client users connected to the private network to also be permitted access to any of the one or more link directories Linkspace hosted content units and networked content units that are connected to the public network or Internet . However Linkspace enabled client users connected to the public network or Internet that are not also among the group of authorized Linkspace enabled client users of the private network may not be permitted to access the one or more link directories Linkspace hosted content units and networked content units that are connected to the private network .

A Linkspace client user connected to the closed network and therefore not connected to either the public network or Internet nor to the private network may only be permitted access to the one or more link directories Linkspace hosted content units and networked content units that are connected to the closed network .

The method may include a step for providing authorized users of client devices access to the link relationships stored in link directories based upon the document object currently accessed by the users on the users client device step .

With the user profile selected and the document object displayed the user then selects a client tool function step . The first function that the user may select is to enter a document object URL into the rendering tool whereupon that document object URL is captured by the client tool and transmitted to the servers step . The activity of transmitting the document object URL to the servers by the client tool may be recorded and stored in an appropriate location within the user data store .

The server then processes the transmitted document object URL across the various link directories to which the user is authorized access. One method of processing by the server is according to the following steps. The server performs a search of the document object tables of all link directories to find all instances of the document object URL step . The server then searches the Link relationship tables in the link directories where the URL was found. This search by the server locates all link relationships referencing the URL as one of the pointers to link references or or or or included in those link relationship step . The server then accumulates all the URLs related through the link relationships identified in step to the URL . The server also accumulates the document object attributes associated with the identified URLs and the link relationship attributes associated with the link relationships identified in step step .

The accumulated URLs are then filtered by link relationship attributes step and then filtered again by document object attributes step . In alternate embodiments of the method the accumulated URLs may be filtered first by document object attributes step and then by link relationship attributes step . The user profile is applied to determine what link relationship attributes and document object attributes to use in filtering the accumulated URLs . The filtered URLs are then sent back to the client device that transmitted the URL along with the associated document object attributes and associated link relationship attributes step . The activity of transmitting the filtered URLs along with the associated document object attributes and associated link relationship attributes to the client device may be recorded and stored in an appropriate location within the user data store . Alternatively the first filtering steps may be performed by the client device .

The client tool upon receiving the filtered URLs from the server may further filter and sort the returned URLs according to data stored in the selected user profile step . In this manner the data in the user profile may be applied to the filtered and sorted URLs on either the server or the client tool .

The filtered and sorted URLs are then displayed to the user of the client device by the client GUI display and the client tool alerts the user of the client device to the availability of related links in the form of the returned URLs by means of an indicator in the client GUI display step . The method then returns to step to await further action by the user of the client device .

If at step the user of the client device selects one of the URL links displayed by the Linkspace GUI display as being related by link relationships to the presently accessed document object with the URL step the rendering tool then accesses the new document object associated with the selected URL and displays that document object in the GUI display of the rendering tool step . The new document object URL address of the selected document object is then passed on to the servers step and the method continues with step as above using the URL of the new document object as the URL to search for.

The user of the client device may then navigate using the rendering tool to the first document object of the new link relationship that the user of the client device wishes to create and publish. The user may then select a declare first link function of the client tool step . The user of the client device may then navigate again using the rendering tool to the second document object that the user of the client device wishes to associate by means of a link relationship with the first document object . The user can then select the declare second link function of the client tool step . The user of the client device has now selected both ends of a link relationship .

The user now may select which of the link directories in which the user wishes to publish the new link relationship step . The user of the client device may then further assign link relationship attributes such as those shown in to the link relationship along with assigning any document object attributes such as those shown in to the first document object and second document object of the link relationship step . The user may then interact with a Linkspace GUI button or element to complete the link relationship publish function step . Upon completion of the link relationship publish function on the client device the URLs and document object attributes of the document objects and associated by the new link relationship are stored in the document object table in the selected link directory step . Additionally the new link relationship along with the URL references to the first document object and second document object and the link relationship attributes such as those shown in are stored in the link relationship table in the selected link directory step . The method for creating and publishing link relationships completes by recording the publishing activity to the user account record associated with the user of the client device for later tracking and billing purposes step .

The relate links dialog box further includes a link from section a link to section a link relationship attributes display box a submit link relationship button and a cancel button . The submit link relationship button is selected by the user when the user has selected and or entered all information associated with the link references and the link relationship that the user wishes to publish. Upon selection of the submit link relationship button the client tool closes the relate links dialog box and transmits the information associated with the created link relationship to one of the one or more servers . The cancel button may be selected by the user to abort the creation and publication of the link relationship that the user initiated and to close the relate links dialog box .

In the embodiment shown in the link from section may include a first document object URL associated with the first document object included in the link relationship being created where the first document object URL was captured when the publish link relationship function was engaged a first plain language name field and a listing of first document object attributes and the attribute values associated with those first document object attributes . In the example illustrated by the first document object URL is the address of a first document object that is a web page for a coffee and dessert shop. The first plain language name field may be captured when the publish link relationship function was engaged and or may be edited by the user creating the link relationship . An exemplary first document object attribute for food and the value of specialty foods assigned to the first document object attribute by the user creating the link relationship are also shown.

The link to section similarly may include a second document object URL associated with the second document object included in the link relationship being created where the second document object URL was captured when the publish link relationship function was engaged a second plain language name field and a listing of second document object attributes and the attribute values associated with those second document object attributes . In the example illustrated by the second document object URL is the address of a second document object that is a web page for a LinkSpace Restaurant located in McLean Va. a suburb of Washington . The second plain language name field may be captured when the publish link relationship function was engaged and or may be edited by the user creating the link relationship . An exemplary second document object attribute for location and the value of address assigned to the second document object attribute by the user creating the link relationship are also shown. In addition in the example illustrated by a subordinate attribute for city subordinate under the attribute for location and a value of address along with the assigned value of McLean for the subordinate attribute for city are also shown in the link to section . Further subordinate attributes may include a street with a value of 12345 Main Street.

The link relationship attributes display box as shown for the embodiment illustrated by includes a list of link relationship attributes and a delete link relationship attribute button . The link relationships are formed by pairs of first document object attributes and second document object attributes that the user creating the link relationship has selected to describe the nature of the link relationship . These link relationship attributes may form the link relationship attributes described in . The delete link relationship attribute button may be used to delete a selected link relationship attribute displayed in the link relationship attributes display box .

The exemplary link relationship attribute shown in indicates that the user creating the link relationship has declared that the city subordinate attribute one selected second document object attribute of the Linkspace Restaurant associated with the second document object having a value of McLean is related to the food attribute one selected first document object attribute having a value of specialty foods of the coffee shop associated with the first document object . As a result once the exemplary link relationship shown in is created and published other users of Linkspace enabled client devices that request and or access the Linkspace Restaurant web page may be presented with a link reference pointing to the web page for the coffee and dessert shop as illustrated in the link reference display window shown in .

In one embodiment of the invention the link relationship attribute may be declared by the user performing a drag and drop operation wherein the document object attribute is dragged and dropped onto the document object attribute creating the link relationship attribute which relates the two document objects by the association of the city subordinate attribute to the food attribute . In an alternate embodiment the creation and selection of link relationship attributes may be performed in a manner similar to that used in the link to section and link from section described above utilizing a set of link relationship attribute types along with data input fields for entering or otherwise selecting values for those attributes.

The client toolbar includes a number of GUI buttons that initiate various functions of the client tool . A client logon button initiates a connection between the client tool and one or more servers . A client logoff button ends a user session for the client tool and disconnects the client tool from the one or more servers . A mark starting page button may be engaged to initiate the publish link relationship function of the client tool by setting the currently displayed document object shown in the browser window and referenced by the document object URL address displayed in the address bar field as the first document object in the link relationship . After the user navigates to a second document object a mark ending page button may be engaged to complete the selection of participating document objects for the publish link relationship function of the client tool . Engaging the mark ending page button sets the newly displayed document object shown in the browser window and referenced by the document object URL address displayed in the address bar field as the second document object in the link relationship and opens a relate links dialogue box shown and described in above to allow the user of the client tool to assign attributes to the link relationship .

The client toolbar also may include three icons that indicate the availability and type of link references related to the document object open in the browser window . These icons may include a publisher links indicator a private links indicator and a community links indicator .

The link reference display window presents the user with a hierarchical listing of any link references delivered by the server that may be related to the document object that is currently displayed in the browser window and has the document object URL address shown in the address bar field . The link reference display window may be presented in a tabbed format wherein each tab may contain a different set of link references depending on the type of link reference and link relationship involved. In one embodiment of the invention there may be three different tabs at the top of the link reference display window each corresponding to one of the indicator icons in the client toolbar . The first tab may be a private links tab corresponding to the private links indicator . The second tab may be a publisher links tab corresponding to the publisher links indicator . The third tab may be a community links tab corresponding to the community links indicator .

The publisher links tab displays an embodiment of the link reference display window presenting link references created by an entity responsible for the document object displayed in the browser window . The private links tab displays an embodiment of the link reference display window presenting link references created by the user of the client tool . The community links tab displays an embodiment of the link reference display window presenting link references created by the other users of the system .

The document object displayed in the browser window in is a representative web page in this case for a restaurant named Linkspace. When this page is displayed and the client tool is engaged as indicated by the recessed display of the client logon button in the client toolbar one or more of the indicator icons in the client toolbar will become highlighted if there are any link references available of the corresponding type.

For example as illustrated in the community links indicator is highlighted while the publisher links indicator and the private links indicator are grayed out. This indicates that the server has returned one or more link references that are categorized as community links and has not returned any link references categorized as publisher or private links. The returned link references are displayed in the link reference display window under the community links tab . In this case the link references are displayed in a hierarchical listing under affinity directory headings . The affinity directory heading shown represents one community of interest corresponding to one link directory on a server maintaining one set of link relationships and link references that may include the document object displayed in the browser window . In addition under each affinity directory heading there may be displayed one or more attribute folders . Each attribute folder may contain a grouping of listed hyperlinks drawn from the respective affinity directory heading and related to the document object displayed in the browser window by a particular link relationship attribute .

In the example shown in affinity directory heading indicates a link directory focusing on wireless devices in the Washington D.C. area. Also shown in the example in the attribute folder groups listed hyperlinks by the link relationship attribute further relating document objects to specialty food document objects . The listed hyperlink listed under the attribute folder comprises the text of the plain language name attribute of a document object concerning coffee and dessert after dinner. In this manner the listed hyperlink displayed under the affinity directory heading and the attribute folder represents a link reference to a document object that is related as a document object of interest to wireless device users in the Washington area and as a specialty food document object to the document object the restaurant web page displayed in the browser window .

The attribute folder shown in the example in groups listed hyperlinks by the link relationship attribute further relating documents objects to document objects concerning the downtown area of the Washington D.C. suburb of McLean. The listed hyperlink is to a LinkNexus document object for the city of McLean. A LinkNexus document object may comprise a listing of further link references to document objects relating to a particular subject. In the case illustrated in the LinkNexus document object indicated by the listed hyperlink may contain link references concerning the suburban city of McLean. In this manner the listed hyperlink displayed under the affinity directory heading and the attribute folder represents a link reference to a document object that is related as a document object of interest to wireless device users in the Washington area and as a link to content relevant to downtown McLean to the document object the restaurant web page displayed in the browser window .

The affinity directory heading shown in the example in indicates a community related to Your Company the user s company. This affinity directory heading may contain link references to document objects maintained on the user s company s private network accessible to users within the company but not to the general public as shown and described in .

The example of a screen view for one embodiment of the client GUI display in may further include a publish document object button a submit link relationship annotation button a find link directories button and a user controls button . The publish document object button activates a publish document object function of the client tool . The submit link relationship annotation button activates a submit link relationship annotation function of the client tool . The find link directories button activates a function of the client tool and the server which identifies link directories which include link references pointing to the currently accessed document object and opens a find link directories dialog box not shown within the client user interface .

The user controls button activates a user controls selection function of the client tool and the server and opens a user controls dialog interface not shown which permits the user of the client tool to select from a plurality of user controlled document object management interfaces including but not limited to a link reference attribute management interface a link relationship attribute management interface and a user profile configuration interface .

When the find link directories button is selected the client tool captures the URL of the currently accessed document object and transmits that current URL to the server with a request to search all link directories accessible to the user for link references and link relationships that include the current URL. If one or more link directories are found that include a link reference or link relationship containing the current URL the user of the client tool is informed of the existence of the one or more directories and instructed by the server through the client tool about how to learn more about the one or more link directories containing the current URL and how to gain access to those link directories .

The systems and methods described above provide a framework for organizing managing and presenting document objects stored on a network . The link directories link relationships and link references enable users of the network to organize the document objects on the network without altering the document objects or changing the location of the document objects on the network . Link relationship attributes describing link relationships and document object attributes describing document objects referred to by link references provide the mechanism to organize and describe document objects . User profiles provide a mechanism by which users of the network may further manage document objects by determining which link references to document objects may be presented to the user as potentially of interest to the user.

In an alternate embodiment of the invention the user of the client tool may search link directories for link relationships or link references that have been assigned selected attributes of interest to the user. In this embodiment the user may engage a function of the client tool to present a search GUI not shown where the user may select one or more link directories the user wishes to search and select one or more attributes of link relationships and link references the user wishes to locate. The search GUI may also allow the user to constrain the search to selected values or ranges of values of the selected attributes of the link relationships and link references . Upon execution of the search function the server retrieves from the one or more selected link directories one or more link relationships and one or more link references that have been assigned the attributes selected by the user for the search and the server further filters the retrieved link references and link relationships based on the constraints applied by the user to the one or more selected link relationship attributes or link reference attributes.

The allowing step may include further steps for defining link relationship attributes describing the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories step and for defining document object attributes describing link references to the document objects related by the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories step . The creating step and the defining steps and may be performed by a user of the network authorized to create and manage link directories . Such a user may be considered a link directory administrator not shown . By defining link relationship attributes describing the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories step and defining document object attributes describing link references to the document objects related by the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories step the link directory administrator determines the type and qualities of the link relationships and link references contained in the link directory the link directory administrator manages. This enables the link directory administrator to set up a framework of management and presentation for the link relationships and link references contained in the link directory and to establish the link directory as a community of interest tailored to interests and topics as defined by the link directory administrator.

The allowing step may also include steps for assigning one or more relevant document object attributes describing a specific link reference to a document object located on the network included in a link relationship being created and stored in the one or more link directories by a user of the network step and assigning one or more relevant link relationship attributes describing a specific link relationship being created and stored in the one or more link directories by a user of the network step . The assigning steps and may be performed by any user of the network authorized to create link relationships and link references to be stored in the one or more link directories .

The step of assigning one or more relevant link relationship attributes may include selecting one or more defined and assigned document object attributes associated with each of the two document objects that define the link relationship to create a link relationship attribute describing the link relationship .

The selecting steps and of the method may be performed by any user of the network authorized to create link relationships and link references by interaction with the client tool through the relate links dialog box illustrated in and described for .

The allowing step of the method may also include a step for storing the link relationships with the defined and assigned discrete attributes in the one or more link directories located on the network separate from the document objects step .

The method also includes a step for managing presentation of link relationships to users of the network using the discrete attributes assigned by users of the network to determine which link relationships to present to users and the manner in which those link relationships will be presented to users step . The managing step may include steps for permitting users of the network to access the one or more link directories step for creating one or more user profiles by specifying one or more link directories and one or more attributes describing the link relationships and or attributes of the document objects that may be relevant to the interests of the user creating the user profiles step for retrieving from the one or more link directories one or more link relationships between the document object the user is currently accessing and other document objects located on the network step for applying the user profiles as filters against the one or more retrieved link relationships to determine which link relationships to present to the user step for ordering the retrieved link relationships by link directories and by attributes describing the link relationships and or attributes of the document objects step and for presenting the retrieved and filtered link relationships to the user while the user is accessing a first document object step . By application of this method a user or an administrator is provided the capability necessary to manage the presentation to the user of link relationships between document objects on the network and thereby improve the user s awareness of access to and navigation through those document objects located on the network .

In one embodiment of the invention the link directory administrator opens the link reference attribute management interface by starting a management session with a server that contains the link directory the link directory administrator wishes to manage. In one embodiment of the invention the link reference attribute management interface is opened inside the rendering tool which may comprise a web page browser. The link reference management interface includes a link directory name label with an associated value indicating the name of the link directory that will be managed by the link reference management interface . An add attribute button is included beneath the link directory name label in the embodiment of the link reference attribute management interface shown in . The add attribute button allows the user to assign a new document object attribute to the link directory and presents the new attribute in the link reference attribute management interface . Each new document attribute includes fields for specifying unique values having assigned meanings associated with the created document object attribute which may be edited and expanded upon to provide additional information.

Each new document object attribute created within the link reference attribute management interface includes an attribute name an attribute data type a required attribute checkbox and a use lookup checkbox . The attribute name allows the link directory administrator to create and modify a descriptive text name associated with the new document object attribute . For the document object attribute the link directory administrator has entered an attribute name of Activities and Events. The attribute data type allows the link directory administrator to specify the form of data that the document object attribute may contain. The link directory administrator selects the data type from several allowable data types including but not limited to Boolean yes no integer text and others permitted by the system using a data type selection list box . The attribute data type selected using the data type selection list box allows the system to ensure that valid document object attribute data is entered for each document object attribute selected by a user of the network accessing and creating link relationships and link references . For the document object attribute the link directory administrator has selected a data type of Text from the data type selection list box .

The required attribute checkbox allows the link directory administrator to specify whether the system requires that a document object attribute defined by the link directory administrator for the link directory may be required to be selected and a value entered by users creating link relationships and link references in the link directory . This ensures that link references and link relationships associated with document objects entered in the link directory have managed document object attributes as assigned by the users that are required by the link directory administrator to effectively manage the link relationships and link references associated with the document objects on the network .

If the checkbox for the second document object attribute listed in the link reference management interface were to be checked then that document object attribute would be required to have values selected by users of the link directory . The use lookup checkbox allows the link directory administrator to specify a managed set of possible values for each document object attribute. The use of the use lookup checkbox is illustrated for the second document object attribute shown in where a use lookup checkbox corresponding to the second document object attribute has been checked. Under this document object attribute a list of values is displayed including the value of Exhibits and Tours. This allows the link directory administrator to limit the possible values of document object attributes to the selected list of values . This aspect of document object attribute management prevents uncontrolled variation of possible values in fields with attribute data types that require few or no constraints.

The first document object attribute listed in the link reference attribute management interface with an attribute name of Accessible to Handicapped is an example of a document object attribute that may be important to a user interested in a document object which may describe a restaurant. The indication that a restaurant is or is not accessible to the handicapped may be a determining factor in selection of document objects for viewing by a user. Using the invention users wishing to promote a document object describing a restaurant may assign a document object attribute of Accessible to Handicapped to a link reference pointing to the document object . A user of the invention seeking information regarding restaurants may only be interested in document objects about restaurants that are handicapped accessible and may filter out any document objects that are not handicapped accessible through the selection of the document object attribute in one or more user profiles . In the example of document object attribute the link directory administrator has specified that the data type is a simple yes no value and has not checked the required field and therefore specified that the document object attribute is not required to be assigned by users. The use lookup field for the document object attribute is unchecked. In this example the yes no data type does not require specification of possible values. By defining the document object attribute of Accessible to Handicapped and permitting users to select that document object attribute the link directory administrator is provided with the capability to manage document objects that may describe a facility or event that is handicapped accessible.

The invention through the use of the link reference attribute management interface shown in enables the link directory administrator to manage document objects by relating document object attributes to other document object attributes based on hierarchical dependencies and common dependencies. In a hierarchical dependency a selected document object attribute may have subordinate document object attributes which further described document objects with the selected document object attribute. For example the selected document object attribute may be restaurant and a subordinate document object attribute may be cuisine. 

In a common dependency a selected document object attribute may have a common document object attribute that is dependent on but not unique to the selected document object attribute. For example the selected document object attribute may be address which is a common document object attribute that should not be a unique subordinate document object attribute of the restaurant document object attribute. These two forms of document object attribute dependencies allow more detailed description of document objects with each selected document object attribute. Such a more detailed description of the document objects referenced by the link directory enables the users to more readily determine the relevance of the document objects to the users needs and interests.

A representative document object attribute for location may have the associated use lookup field checked indicating that there will be a list of values associated with the document object attribute for location . In the example shown in the link directory administrator has entered two possible values in the list of values below the document object attribute for location . Each of these values are alternative ways to further describe the document object attribute for location . The document object attribute for location may be a document object attribute of particular importance to a user s selection of a document object where the user is seeking document objects describing a restaurant. The document object attribute for location may also be a document object attribute of particular importance to a user creating a link relationship between document objects . Depending on the parameters of the user s search for document objects the common document object attribute for address the common document object attribute for geolocation or both may be important discriminators in a user s search for a restaurant document object .

The link reference attribute management interface allows the link directory administrator to further assign document object attributes that may be dependent upon the location document object attributes in the list of values . These document object attributes are illustrated by the document object attributes listed below the document object attribute of address including the common document object attribute with the name zip . The common dependency of the zip document object attribute to the location document object attribute and address document object attribute clarify that the zip document object attribute is a value of the zip code further describing the address of a location associated with the document object for which a user may be creating link references .

By creating subordinate and common dependent document object attributes the link directory administrator facilitates management of document objects by assigning document object attributes that further define a specific document object attribute. If the document object attribute to which the common or subordinate document object attribute is subordinate is selected only then are the subordinate or common document object attributes relevant. In addition common document object attributes distinguish these document object attributes from other uses of similar or even identical document object attribute names . For instance the document object attribute with the name zip might also be used to specify a delivery service area of a restaurant described in a document object . The delivery area may include zip codes including but not limited to the zip code of the restaurant.

The action word dependencies also allows the link directory administrator to manage document objects by identifying common or subordinate document object attributes associated with the document object attribute adjacent to the action word . These common or subordinate dependent document object attributes allow the directory administrator to manage the attributes of document objects by reducing redundant subordinate document object attributes. For example by making the location document object attribute dependent on the activities and events document object attribute and fast food document object attribute the system permits definition and assignment of just one location document object attribute rather than a location document object attribute subordinate to each of the activities and events document object attribute and the fast food document object attribute .

Three additional action buttons may be associated with each document object attribute including subordinate document object attributes. These additional action buttons include an update button a delete button and an add subordinate document object attribute button . The update button allows the link directory administrator to refresh the data in the link directory regarding the document object attributes defined for that link directory . The delete button deletes the associated document object attribute its values and its subordinate and common document object attributes. The add subordinate document object attribute button adds a subordinate document object attribute that is subordinate to the document object attribute adjacent to the button .

When no document object attribute has been defined in the link reference attribute management interface an add document object attribute button allows the link directory administrator to enter a new top level document object attribute . The add document object attribute button may also allow the link directory administrator to add another top level document object attribute when one or more top level document object attributes have already been assigned.

By using the example link relationship management interface illustrated in the link directory administrator may define link relationship attributes to describe link relationships maintained in the link directory . The link relationship attributes may be defined by associating pairs of defined document object attributes. The link relationship attributes may also be defined without regard to document object attributes.

In one embodiment of the invention the link directory administrator opens the link relationship attribute management interface by starting a management session with a server that contains the link directory the link directory administrator wishes to manage. In one embodiment of the invention the link relationship attribute management interface may be opened inside the rendering tool which may comprise a web page browser. The link relationship management interface includes a link directory name label with an associated value indicating the name of the link directory that will be managed by the link relationship management interface . An add pair attribute button and an add attribute button are included beneath the link directory name label in the embodiment of the link relationship attribute management interface shown in . The add pair attribute button allows the link directory administrator to create a new link relationship attribute in the link directory and presents the new link relationship attribute for editing in the paired link relationship attribute section of the link relationship attribute management interface . The add attribute button allows the link directory administrator to create a new link relationship attribute in the link directory and presents the new link relationship attribute for editing in the stand alone link relationship attribute section of the link relationship attribute management interface .

The paired link relationship attribute section of the link relationship management interface shows an example interface for defining paired link relationship attributes formed by relating two document object attributes defined for the link directory by the link directory administrator in the link reference management interface . Each new link relationship attribute defined within the link relationship attribute management interface includes an attribute name an attribute data type a required attribute checkbox and a use lookup checkbox . The attribute name allows the link directory administrator to create and modify a descriptive text name associated with the new link relationship attribute . For the link relationship attribute the link directory administrator has entered an attribute name of Rating. The attribute data type required attribute checkbox and use lookup checkbox perform substantially similar functions in relation to the link relationship attribute as the document object attribute data type required attribute checkbox and use lookup checkbox performed for document object attributes in .

The action word dependencies allows the link directory administrator to add subordinate link relationship attributes not shown below the link relationship attribute associated with the action word . Three additional action buttons may be associated with each link relationship attribute including subordinate link relationship attributes. These additional action buttons include an update button a delete button and an add subordinate link relationship attribute button . The update button allows the link directory administrator to refresh the data in the link directory regarding the link relationship attributes defined for that link directory . The delete button deletes the associated link relationship attribute. The add subordinate link relationship attribute button adds a subordinate link relationship attribute that is subordinate to the link relationship attribute associated with the button .

In the embodiment of the link relationship management interface illustrated in the paired link relationship attribute section further includes a link reference attribute pairs selection section . The link reference attribute pairs selection section includes two link reference attribute selection list boxes which enable the link directory administrator to select two document object attributes from among the document object attributes defined for the link references stored in the link directory through the link reference attribute management interface in one embodiment of the invention . By selecting the two document object attributes using the link reference attribute selection list boxes the link directory administrator specifies that the paired link relationship attribute may describe the link relationships stored in the link directory as relationships between two document objects considered by the users creating the link relationships to be significant as document objects having the respective document object attributes selected in the link reference attribute selection list boxes .

Each paired link relationship attribute assigned through the link relationship management interface shown in may also have a values section associated with it. The values section may include one or more link relationship attribute value entries which may be defined by the link directory administrator to enable the users creating the link relationships to select from specific values for the paired the link relationship attributes . In the example shown in the selection list boxes and have selected values of review and restaurant respectively. This paired link relationship attribute may be assigned by users of the link directory to describe link relationships created where one of the document objects may be described as a review of a restaurant and the other of the document objects may be described as a restaurant document object. In the example for the link relationship management interface shown in the link relationship attribute value entries for the paired link relationship attribute qualify the review and the restaurant as either good or bad. Many other qualifications or quantifications are possible.

In one embodiment of the link relationship management interface as shown in a stand alone link relationship attribute section follows the paired link relationship attribute section . The stand alone link relationship attribute section enables the link directory administrator to define stand alone link relationship attributes in much the same manner as document object attributes may be defined using the link reference attribute management interface shown in . The example stand alone link relationship attribute includes an assigned attribute name of competitors an attribute data type of text a required attribute checkbox that is left unchecked and a use lookup checkbox also left unchecked. The example stand alone link relationship attribute includes an defined attribute name of nearby an attribute data type of decimal a required attribute checkbox that is left unchecked and a use lookup checkbox that has been checked to indicate that the link directory administrator may define a set of managed attribute values for users to select from for the stand alone link relationship attribute .

The user profile configuration interface includes a profile name field an available link directories section a selected link directories section an add selected link directory button a delete selected link directory button a selected attributes section and a selected attribute values section . The profile name field permits the user to assign a name to the user profile the user is creating with the user profile configuration interface . The available link directories section lists the names of link directories that the user has been authorized to access but has not already selected as being of interest to the user in the user profile being created with the user profile configuration interface . The selected link directories section lists the names of link directories that the user has selected to be of interest to the user for the user profile being created with the user profile configuration interface . An available link directory may be selected and moved to the selected link directories section by highlighting the available link directory and activating the add selected link directory button . A selected link directory may be deleted from the selected link directories list section by highlighting the selected link directory and activating the delete selected link directory button .

With one or more selected link directories added to the selected link directories section the user may then select one or more link relationship attributes or link reference attributes that have been defined for the selected link directories and add them to the selected attributes section . The selected attributes section includes one ore more selected attributes . Each selected attribute is selected by the use of a dropdown selection list box allowing the user to pick from among the link relationship attributes and link relationship attributes defined for the selected link directories listed in the selected link directories section . For each selected attribute a corresponding attribute value field is available in the selected attribute values section . The user may enter a value in the attribute value field that further describes the selected attribute of interest to the user.

In the example shown in the selected link directories section includes one selected link directory named Wireless Washington. In this example the user has selected one selected attribute named Food and assigned it the selected attribute value of Fast Food. This enables the user profile given the name Fast Dining in the profile name field to permit filtering of link relationships and link references and to permit presentation to the user through the client GUI display of only those link relationships and link references pertaining to Fast Food in the Wireless Washington link directory .

The user profile configuration interface also includes an add attributes button a save changes to profile button a reset changes button and a return to user controls button . The add attributes button inserts an additional selected attribute into the selected attributes section enabling the user to assign multiple selected attributes . The save changes to profile button saves all the information selected and edited in the user profile configuration interface for the user profile indicated in the profile name field to that user profile . The reset changes button clears any changes made to any of the fields in the user profile configuration interface for the user profile indicated in the profile name field . The return to user controls button exits the user profile configuration interface and opens a user control panel interface not shown enabling the user to add delete and modify other user parameters including but not limited to the link directories the user may be permitted access to identifying personal information for the user and other data regarding the user s access to and presentation of the link relationships stored in the one or more link directories .

The document objects managed by the method may be presented to the user accessing a document object through the link reference display window shown in the example of a screen view for one embodiment of the client GUI display in . Link relationships between document objects referenced by link references may be presented to the user in a hierarchical listing under affinity directory headings in the link reference display window . Each affinity directory heading corresponds to one of the one or more link directories on a server . In addition under each affinity directory heading there may be displayed one or more attribute folders . Each attribute folder under each affinity directory heading corresponds to one of the one or more link relationship attributes or document object attributes that the link directory administrator has defined for the corresponding link directory and that the user has determined through one or more user profiles to be of interest to the user while viewing a document object in the browser display window .

Furthermore each attribute folder may contain one or more listed hyperlinks drawn from the respective affinity directory headings . The listed hyperlinks represent link references to second document objects on the network related to the first document object in the browser display window . The link references enable the user to navigate to the second document objects by selecting the listed hyperlinks . A link reference includes a pointer to the network address or URL of the second document . The URL of a document object may also permit the rendering tool to present or highlight a particular location e.g. a bookmark in the second document object upon opening the document object when the user selects a listed hyperlink . Alternatively the document object accessed when the user selects a listed hyperlink may be generated on the network at the time of selection of the listed hyperlink .

However a benefit of the found engine function and the methods and is that while users of client devices may be navigating i.e. viewing and selecting document objects using attributes of the link references the client tool in communication with the one or more servers may simultaneously retrieve from the one or more link directories one or more link relationships related to the narrowing list of link references that may not be constrained by the selected link reference attributes of the link reference . In addition the found engine function through the methods and may also return corresponding lists of one or more link references to document objects to which other users have found and assigned link relationship attributes describing why the document objects are related to the document object being viewed by a user.

In a search according to methods and the user may desire that the selected user profile apply different filters to the returned list of link reference attributes than to the returned list of link relationship attributes. In one embodiment of user profile selection interface selection of a user profile may include customizing a user profile template by selection of one or more link reference attributes or link relationship attributes or values of the link reference attributes and link relationship attributes that will cause the template to enable search of one or more appropriate link directories and provide for filtering the link reference attributes and link relationship attributes. For example entering a zip code and range into a dining user profile may configure a template to only engage link directories that contain link references to document objects relevant to dining in the geographical area defined by the entered zip code and therefore instruct the system to present to the user only link references for document objects that pertain to locations within the specified range of the entered zip code as determined by attributes of the link references . When the user of the handheld device has selected one or more user profile entries from the listed user profile entries and the handheld device in communication with the one or more link directories and one or more servers performs the methods and to search the link directories and displays a user interface as shown in and

The user interface illustrated in includes a highlight feature and includes a select feature for highlighting or selecting one or more entries on the user interface screen .

The plus and minus symbols in front of each link reference attribute type indicate whether there may be a plurality of selectable values or selectable subordinate link reference attributes for the listed link reference attributes . A check mark appearing in front of the link reference attribute types and indicates that the link reference attributes and have been selected by the user. In the example user interface screen the bold font check mark in front of the link reference attribute type indicates that the link reference attribute of accessible to handicapped has been selected. In the example user interface screen the plain font check mark in front of the link reference attribute type indicates that a subordinate link reference attribute or value of the link reference attribute of food has been selected.

In the example user interface screen the user may select a symbol or depress a button below the symbol at the bottom of the example user interface screen to expand the highlighted link reference attribute to display any subordinate link reference attributes or available values of the highlighted link attribute for further highlighting and selection. The user may also select a check mark icon or depress a button below the check mark icon at the bottom of the example user interface screen to create a check mark beside the highlighted link reference attribute and thereby indicate the user s desire to include all possible link reference attribute values and subordinate link reference attribute values in subsequent presentations of link references .

In the example user interface screen shown in a check mark displayed with an underline or other highlighting mark in front of the Accessible to the handicapped link reference attribute entry indicates to the user that the Accessible to the handicapped link reference attribute entry and all its subordinate link reference attributes and values have been selected for further search and display. In one embodiment of the user interface screen if there is only a subordinate link reference attribute or its value selected the check mark is not highlighted to the user and the user must use the symbol to expand that view of link reference attribute entries to determine what subordinate link reference attribute or its value is selected.

In the embodiment shown in the list of icons representing available link relationship attribute types corresponding to the selected and highlighted link reference attributes and are presented in the first line of the user interface screen . Selecting one or more of the listed link reference attribute types causes the system to retrieve link references having the selected link reference attributes and filter the retrieved link references according to the selected user profile and return the retrieved link references for presentation as shown in the example user interface screen of .
