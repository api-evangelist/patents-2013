The present application further provides a folding chair with an adjustable backrest including the above described supporting frame and a chair cushion arranged on the supporting frame.

Embodiments of the present application provide a supporting frame of a folding chair for realizing as an objective that the user may easily adjust the angle of the backrest without leaving the folding chair.

The technical solutions in the embodiments of the present application will be described clearly and completely hereinafter in conjunction with the drawings in the embodiments of the present application. The described embodiments are only a part of the embodiments of the present application rather than all embodiments. Based on the embodiments in the present application all of the other embodiments made by the person skilled in the art without any creative efforts fall within the protective scope of the present application.

Referring to the supporting frame according to embodiments of the present application includes a frame body and a backrest supporting rod .

It can be appreciated that the frame body is formed by four pairs of chair rods the chair rods in each pair are articulated to form an X shape two chair rods of each pair are connected via an articulating shaft located at centers of both rod bodies and two adjacent pairs of chair rods are hinged via a top connecting member or a bottom connecting member arranged at the ends of the chair rods. Each pair of the chair rods located at two sides of the frame body includes a forward tilting chair rod and a backward tilting chair rod .

The backrest supporting rod includes a first supporting rod and a second supporting rod which are sleeved to one another. At least one of the first supporting rod and the second supporting rod is a hollow rod wherein the first supporting rod may have a larger diameter and the second supporting rod is sleeved in the first supporting rod or the second supporting rod may have a larger diameter and the first supporting rod is sleeved in the second supporting rod . The first supporting rod is hingedly connected to the frame body.

The backrest supporting rod further includes a sliding sleeve and a return member . The sliding sleeve is sleeved on the forward tilting chair rod and is located between a central articulating shaft and a lower end of the forward tilting chair rod . Meanwhile an end of the second supporting rod which is not connected to the first supporting rod is hingedly connected to the sliding sleeve . The return member is arranged between the first supporting rod and the second supporting rod . It can be appreciated that the return member is arranged inside one of the first supporting rod and the second supporting rod which has a larger diameter and the return member abuts against the first supporting rod and the second supporting rod so as to fix the position.

After the supporting frame according to the present embodiment is used in a folding chair when a user leans backward with his back the first supporting rod swings backward and drives the second supporting rod to swing synchronously the sliding sleeve slides along the forward tilting chair rod and meanwhile the return member is compressed. When the user leans forward with his body the return member drives the first supporting rod the second supporting rod and the sliding sleeve back to their original positions such that the backrest of the folding chair is restored to the original state.

From the above description by using the supporting frame according to the present application on the folding chair the user may easily adjust the angle of the backrest when sitting on the folding chair.

Referring to in order to ensure that the first supporting rod and second supporting rod which are sleeved to one another have a more stable structure when they are sliding telescopically on the basis of the above embodiment the supporting frame according to the present embodiment is further provided with a guiding groove and a guiding rod . The guiding groove and the guiding rod are respectively arranged on the first supporting rod and the second supporting rod and the guiding groove and the guiding rod can cooperate with each other i.e. the guiding rod has a diameter equal to or proximately equal to a width of the guiding groove such that the guiding rod is slidably arranged in the guiding groove .

The guiding groove and the guiding rod may serve a guiding function when the first supporting rod and the second supporting rod are sliding with respect to each other such that the supporting rod may have a more stable structure.

Specifically in the supporting frame according to the above embodiments the return member may be an elastic member which can restore to the original state after being compressed such as a compression spring or a pneumatic rod.

After adjusting the backrest of the folding chair at a relatively comfortable angle the user may naturally hope the folding chair can be maintained in this state automatically. In order to achieve this object based on the above embodiments another supporting frame according to the present embodiment is further provided with a fixing hole and a bolt.

A surface of the forward tilting chair rod is provided with multiple fixing holes distributed in a length direction of the forward tilting chair rod . Meanwhile the sliding sleeve is provided with a bolt which can cooperate with the fixing holes. After properly adjusting the angle of the supporting rod the user may fix the supporting rod by inserting the bolt into the nearest fixing hole to fix the sliding sleeve thereby realizing the object of fixing the backrest angle of the folding chair.

In the supporting frame according to the above embodiments if the supporting rod is tilted backward excessively the backrest of the folding chair may be tilted backward excessively which may be undesirable. In order to solve the problem the supporting frame according to another embodiment of the present application further includes a position limiting pin for limiting the angle of the supporting rod . Referring to the position limiting pin is arranged on the forward tilting chair rod and specifically is located at one side closer to a bottom end of chair rod of the middle articulating shaft. When moving to the above position the sliding sleeve will be stopped by the position limiting pin and cannot slide forward anymore which prevents the supporting rod from continuing to swing backward thereby limiting the backward tilting angle of the backrest of the folding chair.

Preferably in the supporting frame according to the above embodiments a top end of the first supporting rod bends towards an outside of the supporting frame. It can be seen that by configuring the top end of the first supporting rod bending backward after the chair cushion is mounted a top end of the chair cushion also bends backward such that the chair cushion may more closely fit the curve of the user s back and provides a more comfortable feeling for the user.

The embodiments of the present application further provide a folding chair with an adjustable backrest including the above described supporting frame and a chair cushion arranged on the supporting frame.

By using the above supporting frame the folding chair according to the present embodiment allows the user to easily adjust the angle of the backrest without leaving the folding chair.
