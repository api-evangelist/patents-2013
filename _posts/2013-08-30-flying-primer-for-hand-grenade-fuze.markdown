title: Flying primer for hand grenade fuze
abstract: A more IM compliant grenade fuze assembly includes a fuze body, an energetics train disposed in the fuze body, and a striker lever rotatably attached to the fuze body. A spring-loaded rotor assembly is rotatably fixed to the fuze body. The rotor assembly includes a primer. A firing pin is disposed in one of the rotor assembly and the fuze body. Placing the primer in the rotor assembly decreases the area of the fuze assembly that is vulnerable to initiation by impact from a bullet, fragment, or shape charge.

A major concern in the field of munition fuzes is the ability of the fuzes to comply with Insensitive Munitions IM standards. Stimuli such as impacts from bullets fragments and shape charges are difficult IM challenges for fuzes such as grenade fuzes. Known hand grenade fuzes have the fuze primer located in the fuze body and the firing pin located in the rotor assembly.

Even if striker lever and rotor assembly are secured in the unarmed state of using a pull pin not shown primer may ignite if impacted by a bullet fragment or shape charge thus creating a shock induced catastrophic initiation. The initiation is catastrophic because in grenade fuze assembly primer is in line with energetics train .

A need exists for a grenade fuze assembly that is less sensitive to impacts from for example bullets fragments or shape charges.

One aspect of the invention is a grenade fuze assembly including a fuze body and an energetics train disposed in the fuze body. A striker lever is rotatably attached to the fuze body. A spring loaded rotor assembly is rotatably fixed to the fuze body. The rotor assembly includes a primer.

In one embodiment the rotor assembly includes a firing pin aligned with the primer and the grenade fuze assembly includes an anvil disposed in the fuze body. The anvil has a through hole aligned with the energetics train. Upon rotation of the rotor assembly the primer contacts the anvil impacts the firing pin and initiates.

In another embodiment the firing pin is disposed in the fuze body in alignment with the energetics train. Upon rotation of the rotor assembly the primer impacts the firing pin and initiates.

Another aspect of the invention is a method. The method includes providing a grenade fuze assembly having a fuze body and a spring loaded rotor assembly rotatably fixed to the fuze body. The rotor assembly includes a primer. The method includes rotating the rotor assembly.

In one embodiment of the method a firing pin is disposed in the rotor assembly and an anvil is disposed in the fuze body. The rotating step includes includes impacting the anvil with the primer.

In another embodiment of the method a firing pin is disposed in the fuze body and the rotating step includes impacting the primer with the firing pin to initiate the primer.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In a novel grenade fuze assembly the primer is located away from the energetics train to improve the IM characteristics of the fuze assembly. In one embodiment of the novel fuze assembly the primer is placed in the rotor assembly with the firing pin. When the grenade fuze is activated by pulling the grenade pull ring the rotor assembly rotates and the primer in the rotor assembly strikes an anvil in the fuze body causing the primer to impact the firing pin in the rotor assembly. The potential for initiation of the energetics train by unintended initiation of the primer is eliminated because the primer cannot engage the energetics train until the rotor assembly has rotated the primer in line with the energetics train. The impact of a bullet shape charge or fragment on the primer cannot initiate the remaining energetics train.

When the grenade pull pin not shown is pulled from fuze body torsion spring rotates rotor assembly counterclockwise as seen in . Upon rotation of rotor assembly primer strikes anvil which causes primer to impact firing pin . shows fuze assembly just prior to primer striking anvil . Primer is ignited by impact with firing pin thereby initiating energetics train .

Anvil includes a through hole in alignment with energetics train . Anvil may include a raised rim . Primer may be disposed in a primer cup closed by a thin environmental seal . Referring to as cup is rotated towards rim rim will force cup to translate upward breaking seal and impacting primer against firing pin .

Compared to grenade fuze assembly grenade fuze assembly has a reduced critical impact area that is the same as the reduced critical impact area for grenade fuze assembly .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
