This application is a 35 USC 371 national phase filing of PCT US2013 049196 filed Jul. 3 2013 which claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 61 670 802 filed Jul. 12 2012.

This invention was made under a NFE 10 02991 between The Dow Chemical Company and UT Batelle LLC operating and management Contractor for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory operated for the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The world production of carbon fiber in 2010 was 40 kilo metric tons KMT and is expected to grow to 150 KMT in 2020. Industrial grade carbon fiber is forecasted to contribute greatly to this growth wherein low cost is critical to applications. The traditional method for producing carbon fibers relies on polyacrylonitrile PAN which is solution spun into fiber form oxidized and carbonized. Approximately 50 of the cost is associated with the cost of the polymer itself and solution spinning.

In an effort to produce low cost industrial grade carbon fibers various groups studied alternative precursor polymers and methods of making the carbon fibers. Many of these efforts were directed towards the sulfonation of polyethylene and the conversion of the sulfonated polyethylene to carbon fiber. But the methods and resulting carbon fibers are inadequate for at least two reasons. First the resulting carbon fibers suffer from inter fiber bonding. Second the resulting carbon fibers have physical properties that are inadequate.

For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 070 446 described a process of sulfonating high density polyethylene using chlorosulfonic acid Examples 1 and 2 sulfuric acid Examples 3 and 4 or fuming sulfuric acid Example 5 . Example 5 in this patent used 25 fuming sulfuric acid at 60 C. for two hours to sulfonate high density polyethylene HDPE which was then carbonized. When the inventors used this method to sulfonate linear low density polyethylene LLDPE the resulting fibers suffered from inter fiber bonding and poor physical properties. Consequently this method was judged inadequate.

In Materials and Manufacturing Processes Vol. 9 No. 2 221 235 1994 and in Processing and Fabrication of Advanced Materials for High Temperature Applications II Proceedings of a Symposium 475 485 1993 Zhang and Bhat reported a process for the sulfonation of ultra high molecular weight UHMW polyethylene fibers using only sulfuric acid. Both papers report the same starting Spectra fibers and the same sulfonation process. The fibers were wrapped on a frame and immersed in 130 140 C. sulfuric acid and the temperature was slowly raised up to 200 C. Successful sulfonation times were between 1.5 and 2 hours. The fibers were removed at discrete intervals and washed with tap water dried in an oven at 60 C. and carbonized in an inert atmosphere at 1150 C. Although good mechanical properties of the carbon fibers were obtained in this method an expensive gel spun polymer fiber was utilized and prolonged reaction times were used. As a result we judge this method to be inadequate.

In Polymer Bulletin 25 405 412 1991 and Journal of Materials Science 25 4216 4222 1990 A. J. Pennings et al. converted a linear low density polyethylene to carbon fiber by immersing fibers into room temperature chlorosulfonic acid for 5 20 hours. This process would be prohibitively expensive from an industrial prospective due to the high cost of chlorosulfonic acid as well as the long reaction times.

In 2002 Leon y Leon International SAMPE Technical Conference Series 2002 Vol. 34 pages 506 519 described a process of sulfonating LLDPE fibers d 0.94 g mL with warmed concentrated HSO. A two stage sulfonated system was also described wherein relative to the first stage the second sulfonation stage involves a longer residence time at a similar temperature or a larger single stage reactor at a single temperature or b a slightly higher acid concentration at a higher temperature. See page 514. Specific times and temperatures were not disclosed. In this reference tensile properties of the resulting carbon fibers were determined differently than is convention. Cross sectional areas used for tensile testing were calculated from density by pycnometry and weight per unit length measurements pg 516 Table 3 pg 517 . However ASTM method D4018 describes that diameters should be measured directly by microscopy. After adjusting the reported tensile properties using the microscopy measured diameters Table 2 pg 517 new values were determined as follows 

The methods disclosed in this reference produce carbon fibers having inadequate tensile strength and modulus.

In spite of these efforts adequate methods of converting polyethylene based polymer fibers to carbonized polymers are still needed. Thus disclosed herein are methods of making carbonized polymers preferably carbon fibers from a polymer the methods comprising the sulfonation of the polymer to form a sulfonated polymer subsequent hot solvent treatment of the sulfonated fibers followed by carbonization of the polymer. These methods result in industrial grade carbonized polymers preferably carbon fibers having superior properties when compared to those that were not treated with a hot solvent. These new methods work with all sulfonation methods.

In one aspect disclosed herein are processes for preparing carbonized polymers the processes comprising 

The compounds and processes disclosed herein utilize polymeric starting materials. The polymeric starting materials may be in the form of fabrics sheets fibers or combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment the polymeric starting material is in the form of a fiber and the resulting carbonized polymer is a carbon fiber.

As mentioned above the sulfonating agent comprises SOdissolved in a halogenated solvent. Typically SOgas is bubbled into or above or otherwise dissolved from liquid SOor solid or polymer SOinto a halogenated solvent. But if desired SOgas in combination with one or more other gases may be used. The exact method of combining the SOgas and the solvent is well within the abilities of a person having ordinary skill in the art.

Suitable halogenated solvents contain at least one halogen selected from the group consisting of F Cl Br and I and have one to 30 carbons. If desired a combination of two or more halogenated solvents may be used. Examples include fluorocarbons chlorocarbons bromocarbons chlorofluorocarbons bromofluorocarbons or combinations thereof. Perfluoro and perchloro solvents and solvents wherein all hydrogens are replaced with a combination of bromo chloro and or fluoro groups are also suitable. In one embodiment the solvent is a fluorocarbon a bromocarbon. a chlorocarbon a chlorofluorocarbon or combinations thereof. Specific examples of suitable solvents include BrClFC BrFC BrClFC 1 bromo 1 1 dichlorotrifluoroethane 1 2 dibromotetrafluoroethane pentachlorofluoroethane 1 2 difluorotetrachloroethane 1 1 1 trichlorofluoromethane methylene chloride 1 2 dibromomethane 1 2 dichloroethane 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane and or mixtures thereof. Chlorine containing solvents are particularly preferred and of these 1 2 dichloroethane is a preferred solvent. And while it is possible non halogenated solvents can be used or combined with halogenated solvents halogenated or otherwise inert solvents are preferred.

The concentration of the SOin the halogenated solvent may be from 0.01 to 24 moles per liter. More preferably the concentration is 0.1 14 moles per liter. Still more preferably the concentration is less than 10 moles per liter. More preferably the concentration is 0.15 to 5 moles liter. Still more preferably the concentration is 0.5 to 4 moles liter.

The SOin the halogenated solvent may be added to the reaction mixture dropwise portionwise or all at once.

The SOin the halogenated solvent may be added to the polymer or the polymer may be added to the SOin the halogenated solvent.

The SOadded to the halogenated solvent to make the desired solution may come from a variety of sources liquid SO gaseous SO or even SO lewis base adducts such as DMSO SO DMF SO Ether SO. If desired the halogenated solvent may include one or more additional solvents such as hydrocarbons ethers sulfoxides or amides. More specifically C Chydrocarbons C Calkyl O C Calkyl DMF or DMSO may be used.

The sulfonation reaction is typically carried out a temperature of about 0 140 C. More preferably the temperature is 0 90 C. More preferably the reaction temperature is 10 80 C. Still more preferably the reaction temperature is 15 60 C. Even more preferably the reaction temperature is 20 35 C.

Sulfonation reaction times are from 5 seconds to 16 hours. More preferably the reaction times are from 1 minute to 8 hours. Still more preferably the reaction time is less than 6 hours. Even more preferably the reaction time is 2 minutes to 4 hours or 5 minutes to 1 hour. Of course it is known in the art that the sulfonation reaction time is affected by the fiber diameter if a fiber is being used crystallinity of the polymer r identity and concentration of the co monomer s if present the density of the polymer the concentration of double bonds in the polymer porosity of the polymer the sulfonation temperature and the concentration of the sulfonating reagent. The optimization of sulfonation temperature sulfonating reagent concentration and addition rate and reaction time are within the ability of one having skill in the art.

The sulfonation reaction is normally run at ambient atmospheric pressure. But if desired pressures greater or lesser than ambient pressure may be used.

One method of decreasing sulfonation reaction time is to swell the polymer with suitable solvent before or during the sulfonation reaction. In one embodiment a polymer could be treated with a suitable swelling solvent prior to treatment with an SOsolution of halogenated solvent. Alternatively the polymer could be swelled with suitable solvent during the sulfonation step with an emulsion solution or otherwise combination of swelling agent and sulfonating agent. An additional benefit of performing a swelling step or steps before or during sulfonation is a more uniform sulfur distribution across the polymer and consequently enhanced processing conditions and properties.

After the polymer is sulfonated it is treated with a heated solvent. Acceptable temperatures are at least 95 C. More preferably at least 100 C. Still more preferably at least 105 C. or 110 C. Even more preferably at least 115 C. Most preferred is at least 120 C. The maximum temperature is the boiling point of the solvent or 180 C. In one embodiment the temperature of the solvent is 100 180 C. Alternatively the temperature of the solvent is 120 180 C. While temperatures below 120 C. can be used the reaction rate is slower and thus less economical as the throughput of the reaction decreases.

In one embodiment the preferred solvents are polar and or protic. Examples of protic solvents include mineral acids water and steam. HSOis a preferred protic solvent. In one embodiment the heated solvent is HSOat a temperature of 100 180 C. Still more preferably the heated solvent is HSOat a temperature of 120 160 C.

Alternatively the heated solvent may be a polar solvent. Examples of suitable polar solvents include DMSO DMF NMP halogenated solvents of suitable boiling point or combinations thereof. Preferably the heated solvent is a polar solvent at a temperature of 120 160 C.

It should be understood that when polymer fibers are being used the nature of the polymer fibers their diameter tow size crystallinity of the fibers the identity and concentration of the co monomer s if present and the density of the polymer fiber will impact the reaction conditions that are used. Likewise the temperature of the heated solvent used in the heated solvent treatment and the concentration of the HSO if HSOis used also depends on the nature of the polymer fibers their diameter tow size and the crystallinity of the fibers.

Once the sulfonation reaction is completed which means 1 100 of the polymer was sulfonated as determined using thermogravimetric analysis TGA the polymer may be degassed and optionally washed with one or more solvents. If the polymer is degassed any method known in the art may be used. For example the polymer may be subjected to a vacuum or sprayed with a pressurized gas.

If the polymer is washed the washing encompasses rinsing spraying or otherwise contacting the polymer with a solvent or combination of solvents wherein the solvent or combination of solvents is at a temperature of from 100 C. up to 200 C. Preferred solvents include water C Calcohols acetone dilute acid such as sulfuric acid halogenated solvents and combinations thereof. In one embodiment the polymer s is washed with water and then acetone. In another embodiment the polymer is washed with a mixture of water and acetone. Once the polymer is washed it may be blotted dry air dried heated using a heat source such as a conventional oven a microwave oven or by blowing heated gas or gases onto the polymer or combinations thereof.

The polymer used herein consist of homopolymers made from polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and polybutadiene or comprise a copolymer of ethylene propylene styrene and or butadiene. Preferred copolymers include ethylene octene copolymers ethylene hexene copolymers ethylene butene copolymers ethylene propylene copolymers ethylene styrene copolymers ethylene butadiene copolymers propylene octene copolymers propylene hexene copolymers propylene butene copolymers propylene styrene copolymers propylene butadiene copolymers styrene octene copolymers styrene hexene copolymers styrene butene copolymers styrene propylene copolymers styrene butadiene copolymers butadiene octene copolymers butadiene hexene copolymers butadiene butene copolymers butadiene propylene copolymers butadiene styrene copolymers or a combination of two or more thereof. Homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers comprising ethylene are preferred. The polymers used herein can contain any arrangement of monomer units. Examples include linear or branched polymers alternating copolymers block copolymers such as diblock triblock or multi block terpolymers graft copolymers brush copolymers comb copolymers star copolymers or any combination of two or more thereof.

The polymer fibers used herein when fibers are used can be of any cross sectional shape such as circular star shaped hollow fibers triangular ribbon etc. Preferred polymer fibers are circular in shape. Additionally the polymer fibers can be produced by any means known in the art such as melt spinning single component bi component or multi component solution spinning electro spinning film casting and slitting spun bond flash spinning and gel spinning. Melt spinning is the preferred method of fiber production.

It must be emphasized that the treatment with a heated solvent is vital to the inventions disclosed herein. As shown below the heated solvent treatment significantly improves the physical properties of the resulting carbon fiber when compared to carbon fibers that were not treated with a heated solvent. Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory it is believed that the heated solvent treatment allows the fibers to undergo crosslinking which improves their physical properties while inhibiting the ability of the fibers to fuse or undergo inter fiber bonding.

And as previously mentioned in some embodiments the sulfonation reaction is not run to completion. Rather after the reaction is 1 99 complete or more preferably 40 99 complete the sulfonation reaction is stopped and then the sulfonation is completed in the hot solvent treatment step when the hot solvent is a mineral acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid. If desired the sulfonation the treatment with a heated solvent and or the carbonization may be performed when the polymer fiber also called tow is under tension. It is known in the carbon fiber art that maintaining tension helps to control the shrinkage of the fiber. It has also been suggested that minimizing shrinkage during the sulfonation reaction increases the tensile properties of the resulting carbon fiber.

Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory it is believed that the sulfonic acid groups within sulfonated polyethylene fibers undergo a thermal reaction at ca. 145 C. onset occurring around 120 130 C. evolving SOand HO as products while generating new carbon carbon bonds within the polymer. This was verified using Near Edge X Ray Absorption Fine Structure NEXAFS spectroscopy which showed that heating sulfonated polyethylene fibers results in a decrease in C C bonds and an increase in C C single bonds. This result is consistent with the formation of new bonds between previously unbonded C atoms at the expense of C C double bonds. The addition of solvent separates the individual filaments and prevents filament fusion. See the scheme below which illustrates the generic chemical transformation occurring during the entire process. It should be understood by one skilled in the art that the variety and complexity of other functional groups present at all steps and have been omitted here for the sake of clarity.

It must be emphasized that simply heating sulfonated fibers in an oven resulted in a high degree of fiber fusion wherein different fibers fuse or otherwise aggregate such fused fibers tend to be very brittle and to have poor mechanical properties. In contrast the treatment of sulfonated polymer fibers with a heated solvent results in fibers having significantly less fiber fusion. Such fibers have improved tensile strength and higher elongation to break strain values. It is believed that the role of the solvent is to minimize the inter fiber hydrogen bonding interactions between the surface sulfonic acid groups which thereby prevents inter fiber cross linking and fiber fusion during the hot solvent treatment step. An alternative hypothesis employs the heated solvent to remove low molecular weight sulfonated polymer from the polymer fibers. Without removing this inter fiber byproduct i.e. the low molecular weight sulfonated polymer heat treatment imparts similar cross linking and ultimately creates the fusion of fibers.

It is possible that the sulfonation reaction will not go to completion which as is known in the art results in hollow fibers when fibers are used as the starting material. In such cases using hot sulfuric acid in the hot solvent treatment will continue the sulfonation reaction and drive it towards completion while the thermal reaction is also occurring. In one embodiment of this invention one could produce hollow carbon fibers from this process by reducing the amount of time in the sulfonation chamber the hot sulfuric acid bath or both while still retaining the advantage of producing non fused fibers. If desired adjusting the relative amounts of sulfonation performed in the sulfonation reaction and the hot solvent treatment can be used to alter the physical properties of the resulting carbon fibers.

If desired the sulfonation the treatment with a heated solvent and or the carbonization may be performed when the polymer is under tension. The following discussion is based on the use of a polymer fiber also called tow . It is known in the carbon fiber art that maintaining tension helps to control the shrinkage of the fiber. It has also been suggested that minimizing shrinkage during the sulfonation reaction increases the modulus of the resulting carbon fiber.

When using SOin a halogenated solvent to perform the sulfonation reaction it was discovered that the polymer fiber could be kept under a tension of up to 22 MPa with tensions of up to 16.8 MPa being preferred the treatment with a heated solvent could be conducted while the polymer fiber was under a tension of up to 25 MPa and carbonization could be conducted while the polymer fiber was under a tension of up to 14 MPa with tensions of up to 5.3 MPa being preferred . In one embodiment the process was conducted wherein at least one of the three aforementioned steps was conducted under tension. In a more preferred embodiment the sulfonation the treatment with a heated solvent and the carbonization are performed while the polymer fiber is under a tension greater than 1 MPa. As will be readily appreciated it is possible to run the different steps at different tensions. Thus in one embodiment the tension during the carbonization step differs from that in the sulfonation step. It should also be understood that the tensions for each step also depend on the nature of the polymer the size and tenacity of the polymer fiber. Thus the above tensions are guidelines that may change as the nature and size of the fibers change.

The carbonization step is performed by heating the sulfonated and heat treated fibers. Typically the fiber is passed through a tube oven at temperatures of from 500 3000 C. More preferably the carbonization temperature is at least 600 C. In one embodiment the carbonization reaction is performed at temperature in the range of 700 1 500 C. The carbonization step may be performed in a tube oven in an atmosphere of inert gas or in a vacuum. One of skill in the art will appreciate that if desired activated carbon fibers may be prepared using the methods disclosed herein.

wherein at least one of steps a b and c is performed while the polymer is under a tension of up to 14 MPa.

In this preferred embodiment the heated solvent is DMSO DMF or a mineral acid and or the polyethylene containing polymer is a polyethylene homopolymers or polyethylene copolymers that comprise ethylene octene copolymers ethylene hexene copolymers ethylene butene copolymers ethylene propylene copolymers ethylene styrene copolymers ethylene butadiene copolymers or a combination of two or more thereof and or halogenated solvent is a chlorocarbon and or steps a b and c are performed while the polymer is under a tension greater than 1 MPa.

Even more preferably in this preferred embodiment the protic solvent is a mineral acid that is concentrated sulfuric acid at a temperature of 115 160 C.
