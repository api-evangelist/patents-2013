This is a U.S. National Stage under 35 U.S.C 371 of the International Application PCT CN2013 090626 filed Dec. 27 2013 which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 a d to CN 201310162335.9 filed May 6 2013.

The present invention belongs to the field of sealing testing technology and more particularly relates to a device for testing mechanical seal performance which has no additional axial force and is capable of accurately testing the torque. The device is adapted for testing mechanical seal performance of the rotating machinery with large diameter including large compressors and centrifugal pumps for conveying high pressure media or stirred tank reactors for mixing high pressure media.

It is required of mechanical seals with stable performance to meet the demand of large scale integration and long term operation of the production device. Therefore device for testing mechanical seal performance with broad operating parameters and convenient test are needed to be designed to adapted for the development and testing of new mechanical seals.

It can be seen from the widely known technology the support structure of the main shaft of the device for testing mechanical seal performance is in forms of single cantilever shaft double cantilever shafts and double support shafts. The main shaft inserts into the end cover at the single side or into the end covers at two sides and out of the working chamber. For the single cantilever shaft type device for testing mechanical seal performance the main shaft inserts into one end cover of the working chamber the mechanical seal to be tested is used as a sealing member of the working chamber such as Patent ZL 00220907.1. However the shaft ends of the main shaft situates in the medium of the working chamber generating a larger axial force and simultaneously the areas of the rotating rings and the stationary rings of the mechanical seal to be tested bear the action from the medium are different which also generates the axial force. Large axial force is harmful to the service life of the bearing. Different axial forces lead to different bearing resistance torque finally the measurement accuracy of the end face friction torque is affected. For the device with the single cantilever and main shaft passing into and outside end covers at two sides of the working chamber for testing mechanical seal performance the axial force of the medium in the working chamber at the shaft ends is avoided two groups of mechanical seals to be tested with a same regulation and size are symmetrically distributed within the working chamber the shaft sleeve has two segments of thread at one end the two segments of thread have the same screw pitch and opposite rotation directions the shaft sleeve is rotated to drive the left and right nuts which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to move left and right equidistantly so as to drive the left and right rotating ring seats to tightly press two rotating rings via the springs for achieving equally loading the end face specific pressure such as Patent CN201210037262.6. However it is very difficult for the two groups of mechanical seals to be symmetrical with the center cross section of the working chamber at the initial position. For double cantilever type device for testing mechanical seal performance such as Patent ZL88214684.X the axial force caused by the medium pressure at the single shaft end and the axial force due to different areas of the rotating and stationary rings of the mechanical seal to be tested bear the medium force are balanced via the symmetrically whole structure. However the main shaft and the driving connecting structure are still complex. For double support shafts type device for testing mechanical seal performance such as Patent CN201210126379.1 the main shaft inserts into and out of the end covers at two ends of the working chamber two groups of mechanical seal to be tested with a same regulation and size are symmetrically arranged within the working chamber to resolve the balance problem of the axial force and the effect of the winding degree of the cantilever shaft. However it is very inconvenient for installing the mechanical seal to be tested and especially it is very difficult to meet the requirements of quick assembly and disassembly during type experiments.

The above existing technologies while experimenting the torque sensor tests the total torque on the main shaft in the experimenting device the total torque includes the friction torque of the sealing end face to be tested and the friction torque of the bearing of the main shaft. The friction torque of the sealing end face to be tested equals to the total torque minus the friction torque of the bearing of the main shaft measured before experiment. Therefore not only the experimental process is complex but also the accuracy of the test is reduced.

Furthermore in the above existing technologies the torque tests the total torque on the main shaft of the experimental device. However while starting the staring torque is 5 7 times that of normal operation. Therefore the diameter of the stress shaft of the torque sensor is larger. The torque sensor is used to test the smaller end face friction torque of mechanical seal at the normal operation state the generated axial stress is smaller the measurement accuracy is lower. To improve the measurement accuracy the diameter of the stress shaft of the torque sensor should be reduced. However it is easy for the stress shaft with smaller diameter to generate plastic deformation even fracture. Therefore two aspects are mutually exclusive.

An object of the present invention is to provide a device for testing mechanical seal performance which is capable of achieving automatic symmetric positioning of two groups of mechanical seals to be tested with respect to the center cross section of the working chamber and an equal regulation of the end face specific pressure avoiding an additionally axial force caused by the medium while experimenting simultaneously improving on site installation workability and measurement accuracy of the end face friction torque which is adapted for performance researches and type tests of mechanical seal with large diameter under high pressure.

The device for testing mechanical seal performance comprises a main shaft a working chamber with two end covers respectively located at two ends thereof and two groups of mechanical seals to be tested where in each group of mechanical seal comprises a stationary O ring a stationary ring a rotating ring a rotating O ring a support ring a spring a rotating ring seat the rotating ring and the rotating ring seat are axially slidably connected and are circumferentially positioned with each other the spring the support ring and the rotating O ring are located between the rotating ring seat and the rotating ring in sequence the support ring is axially slidably connected with the rotating ring seat the stationary ring is connected with center holes on the end covers via the stationary O ring provided on a periphery of the stationary ring by a sealed manner the stationary ring is axially opposite to the rotating ring 

the shaft sleeve in clearance fit with the main shaft is sleeved on the main shaft the shaft sleeve passes through the end covers at the two ends of the working chamber U shaped openings on a same generatrix are respectively provided at two ends of the shaft sleeve extending outside the end covers drive pins are located at the main shaft corresponding to the U shaped openings two segments of thread with a same screw pitch and an opposite rotation direction are provided at a middle part of the shaft sleeve two nuts respectively match with the two segments of thread two short pins which are parallel to an axis of the shaft sleeve are respectively simultaneously inserted into short pin holes on the two nuts the rotating ring seat of each of the two groups of mechanical seals is located at a back of one of the two nuts the rotating ring seat is axially slid and circumferentially positioned with the shaft sleeve both the stationary ring and the rotating ring surround the shaft sleeve 

a radially installed force sensor adapted for testing a force between a sidewall of one of the U shaped openings and one of the drive pins is located between the sidewall of one of the U shaped openings and one of the drive pins a technological hole for allowing a technological shaft to pass through is provided on at least one of the end covers the technological shaft passing through the technological hole is inserted into the short pin holes the technological hole is sealed by a detachable technological hole plug .

While operating firstly the two nuts are respectively screwed and jointed to two segments of threads on the shaft sleeve the short pins are inserted into the short pin holes on a left nut and a right nut for circumferentially positioning the two nuts and then the rotating ring seats the springs the support rings the rotating O rings and the rotating rings of the two groups of mechanical seals are symmetrically installed to the shaft sleeve the stationary rings with the stationary O rings are respectively installed into the center holes of the two end covers and then an end cover with one stationary ring such as a left end cover at a left side is connected to an end face such as a left end face at the left side of the working chamber the working chamber is moved to pass through the main shaft and then the shaft sleeve with the two nuts and the rotating rings is sleeved on the main shaft the other end cover such as a right end cover at a right side with the other stationary ring is connected with the other end face such as a right end face at the right side of the working chamber the main shaft and the shaft sleeve respectively pass out of the two end covers.

The technological shafts pass through the technological holes on the end covers to be inserted into the short pin holes on the nuts for avoiding the nuts to rotate and then the shaft sleeve is rotated to drive the two nuts which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to move back to back so that a distance between the two nuts is gradually increased the rotating ring seats of the two groups of mechanical seals are driven to respectively press towards the rotating O rings and the rotating rings via the springs and the support rings till the rotating rings tightly press the stationary rings to obtain a certain end face specific pressure of course if the shaft sleeve is reversely rotated to drive the two nuts which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to move face to face so that the distance between the two nuts is gradually decreased the springs are changed from a compressed state to a free state the end face specific pressure is decreased till equals to zero or the rotating rings are detached from the stationary rings because of the technological shafts being inserted into the short pin holes on the nuts the two nuts move relatively to the main shaft without rotation while rotating the shaft sleeve .

Due to the shaft sleeve on the main shaft without axial positioning when an initial position of a center cross section of the shaft sleeve is not coincident with a center cross section of the working chamber namely when a distance between the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve and an end face of a stationary ring on one end cover is not equal to a distance between the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve and an end face of a stationary ring on the other end cover the shaft sleeve is rotated to drive the two nuts which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to move back to back the rotating ring seats of the two groups of mechanical seals are driven to respectively press towards the rotating O rings and the rotating rings via the springs and the support rings one group of mechanical seal which firstly presses the stationary ring pushes the shaft sleeve to move towards the other group of mechanical seal till the rotating ring and the stationary ring of the other group of mechanical seal contact with each other and then the end face specific pressure of the two groups of mechanical seals is increased together. Therefore rotating the shaft sleeve will center it automatically and allow the two groups of mechanical seals to obtain a same initial end face specific pressure. The rotating O ring between the support ring and the rotating ring ensures the sealing between the rotating ring and the shaft sleeve.

And then the drive pins are installed on the main shaft respectively corresponding to the U shaped openings of the shaft sleeve the technological shafts are removed the technological plugs are used to seal the technological holes. A test medium with a certain pressure is injected into the working chamber by an external medium loading and circulatory system.

And then the main shaft is driven to rotate the main shaft drives the shaft sleeve to rotate via the drive pins. Due to axial movement relatively to the shaft sleeve without rotating the rotating ring seats rotate together with the shaft sleeve so as to drive the rotating rings to tightly press the stationary rings for rotating relatively to the stationary rings. Due to a small torque between the shaft sleeve sleeved on the main shaft and the main shaft the end face friction torque is transmitted from the shaft sleeve to the main shaft without loss. The friction torque the end face friction torque of mechanical seal between the rotating ring and the stationary ring is obtained by testing the torque of the shaft sleeve or the main shaft.

To test the end face friction torque of mechanical seal the radially installed force sensor adapted for testing the force between the sidewall of one of the U shaped openings and one of the drive pins is located between the sidewall of one of the U shaped openings and one of the drive pins.

The force which is between the sidewall of one of the U shaped openings and one of the drive pins and tested by the radially installed force sensor is multiplied by an arm of force which is a distance from an action point of the force to the axis of the shaft sleeve to obtain the torque of the shaft sleeve or the main shaft.

A leakage amount of mechanical seal is obtained by weighing the liquid flowing out the center holes of the end covers.

 1 Two groups of mechanical seals to be tested are installed to the shaft sleeve which penetrates through the working chamber in such a manner that the axial force and the spring force which are caused by the pressure medium acting on the two groups of mechanical seals are self balanced so that the axial force at the shaft ends generated by the pressure medium is avoided which is adapted for various working conditions and sizes including performance test of mechanical seal with large diameter under high pressure.

 2 The shaft sleeve is in clearance fit with the main shaft without axial positioning on the main shaft so that the mechanical seal installed on the shaft sleeve is able to be automatically centered in the working chamber. When the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve is not coincident with the center cross section of the working chamber namely when the distance between the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve and the end face of the stationary ring on the left end cover is not equal to the distance between the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve and the end face of the stationary ring on the right end cover the shaft sleeve is rotated to drive the two nuts which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to move back to back so as to drive the rotating ring seats of the two groups of mechanical seals to respectively press towards the rotating O rings and the rotating rings via the springs and the supporting rings. The group of mechanical seal which firstly presses the stationary ring pushes the shaft sleeve to move towards the other group of mechanical seal till the end face specific pressures of the two groups of mechanical seals are the same.

 3 The end face friction torque of the mechanical seal is able to be accurately measured. Two groups of mechanical seals are installed on the shaft sleeve which is in clearance fit with the main shaft the end face wear torque is transmitted via the shaft sleeve to the main shaft without any loss the force tested by the radially installed force sensor is calculated again to obtain the end face friction torque thereby ensuring the measurement accuracy of the end face friction torque of the mechanical seal.

 4 The two groups of mechanical seals to be tested with a certain end face specific pressure form a soft supporting of the main shaft thereby enhancing the running stability of the cantilever main shaft.

 5 The leakage amount of the single group of mechanical seal is represented by an average value of the accumulated leakage amount of the two groups of mechanical seals the end face friction torque of the single group of mechanical seal is represented by the average value of the end face friction torque of the two groups of mechanical seals thus reducing the impact of randomness on the measurement.

 6 Convenient assembly and disassembly. The two groups of mechanical seals are installed to the shaft sleeve and then installed into the working chamber the end face specific pressure thereof is balanced by rotating the shaft sleeve thereby ensuring the position of the shaft sleeve on the main shaft and the mechanical seal in the working chamber when the right end cover is opened and the drive pins on a right end of the main shaft are removed the shaft sleeve and the mechanical seal on the shaft sleeve are able to be removed.

 7 By replacing the shaft sleeves with different structure sizes the shaft sleeve match with the mechanical seal to be tested on the model numbers and sizes so as to test the performance of the mechanical seals with different sizes and model numbers.

At least two axial force sensors adapted for testing the axial force of the stationary rings pass through the end covers and contact with backs of the stationary rings opposite to the rotating rings the axial force sensors are evenly distributed at the periphery of the stationary ring . While no medium exists in the working chamber the axial force sensors located on one end cover for supporting one stationary ring axially bears the spring force for maintaining the attachment between the rotating ring and the stationary ring after injecting the pressure medium into the working chamber the axial force sensors for supporting one stationary ring axially bear a sum of the spring force and the axial force caused by the pressure medium in the single group of mechanical seal. By the axial force sensors the initial spring specific pressure of the mechanical seal is capable of being accurately measured and the change of the end face specific pressure during operation after loading is capable of being monitored.

Two short pin holes are provided on the left nut and are symmetrical to each other with respect to an axis of the shaft sleeve the right nut has a same structure namely two short pin holes are provided on the right nut and are symmetrical to each other with respect to an axis of the shaft sleeve . There are two short pins one short pin simultaneously inserts into one short pin hole in the left nut and one short pin hole in the right nut the other short pin simultaneously inserts into the other short pin hole in the left nut and the other short pin hole in the right nut in such a manner that the left nut and the right nut are circumferentially positioned with the two short pins . Each short pin is in clearance fit with two corresponding short pin holes. Two short pin hole plugs are respectively axially positioned for avoiding the two short pins falling off from the four short pin holes.

The two technological holes are respectively sealed by two detachable technological hole plugs . The two rotating ring seats whose mechanical performance to be tested are respectively circumferentially positioned with the shaft sleeve by two guide flat keys . While rotating the shaft sleeve two technological shafts respectively penetrate through four technological holes on the left end cover and the right end cover and insert into two guide holes as shown in . The shaft sleeve is clockwise rotated to drive the left nut and the right nut which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to move left and right equidistantly so as to drive the rotating ring seats of the two groups of mechanical seals to respectively press towards the rotating O rings and the rotating rings via the springs and the support rings till tightly press the stationary rings for obtaining a certain end face specific pressure.

The drive pins are fixed on the main shaft where two U shaped openings are respectively provided at two ends of the shaft sleeve such that the shaft sleeve is circumferentially positioned. A force between a side wall of each of the two U shaped openings and a corresponding drive pin is tested by a radially installed force sensor. The force is multiplied by an arm of force which is a distance from an action point of the force to the axis of the shaft sleeve to obtain a torque of the shaft sleeve the main shaft .

Both the left end cover and the right end cover have a ring groove which is concentric with a center hole to form a leakage chamber . A deflector hole is provided at a bottom of the ring groove along a tangential direction thereof for collecting and discharging a leakage amount of the mechanical seal. The leakage amount of the mechanical seal is represented by an average value of the accumulated leakage amount of two groups of mechanical seals in the leakage chamber . The force tested by the radially installed force sensor is calculated again to obtain an average value of an end face friction torque of the two groups of mechanical seal. The end face friction torque of a single group of mechanical seal is represented by the average value. Three radially installed force sensors which are uniformly distributed along a circumferential direction of the left end cover and the right end cover with a same model number and have a same height from measuring points thereof to a corresponding end face of the left and right end cover are adapted for measuring an attached end face specific pressure of the rotating ring and the stationary ring .

The shaft sleeve is counterclockwise rotated to drive the left nut and the right nut which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to respectively move right and left equidistantly springs are changed from a compressed state to a free state and the end face specific pressure is decreased till equals to zero or the rotating ring is detached from the stationary ring. While rotating the shaft sleeve the left nut and the right nut move relatively to the main shaft without rotating.

A variable frequency speed controller controls the motor for allowing the main shaft to operate under different rotating speeds. The structure size of the shaft sleeve is changed to allow a performance test of mechanical seals with different sizes and model numbers.

While operating firstly the left nut and the right nut are screwed and jointed to screw threads at a middle of the shaft sleeve the short pins are inserted into the holes of the left nut and the right nut and then the short pin hole plugs are screwed therein for circumferentially positioning the left nut and the right nut . And then the guide flat keys the rotating ring seats the springs the support rings the rotating O rings and the rotating rings are symmetrically installed to the shaft sleeve the stationary rings with the stationary O ring are respectively installed into the left end cover and the right end cover and then the left end cover with the axial force sensor and the stationary ring is connected to a left end face of the working chamber via bolts the working chamber is moved for allowing the left end cover and the working chamber to pass through the main shaft and then the shaft sleeve with the left nut the right nut the guide flat keys and the rotating rings is sleeved on the main shaft and then the right end cover with the axial force sensor and the stationary ring is connected to the right end face of the working chamber by bolts at this time the main shaft and the shaft sleeve pass out of the right end cover .

The technical shafts are inserted into the guide holes on the left nut and the right nut and the technological holes on the left end cover and the right end cover . The shaft sleeve is clockwise rotated to automatically center the shaft sleeve and allows the mechanical seals to obtain an initial end face specific pressure needed. The drive pins are installed on the main shaft corresponding to the U shaped openings of the shaft sleeve and the technological shafts are removed of course the short pin hole plugs are taken out of the short pin holes the technological shafts pass through the technological holes on the left end cover and the right end cover and are inserted into two short pin holes on the left nut and the right nut the shaft sleeve is clockwise rotated to automatically center the shaft sleeve and allows the mechanical seals to obtain the initial end face specific pressure to be needed the drive pins are installed on the main shaft corresponding to the U shaped openings of the shaft sleeve the technological shafts are removed and then the short pin hole plugs are inserted into the short pin holes the technological hole plugs are tightened within the technological holes on the left end cover and the right end cover . A test medium with a certain pressure is injected into the working chamber by an external medium loading and circulatory system.

The torque namely the force tested by the radially installed force sensors is multiplied by the arm of force which is a distance from the action point of the force to the axis of the shaft sleeve indirectly tested by the radial force sensors is equal to the end face friction torque of the mechanical seal rotating ring and the stationary ring which is transferred to the shaft sleeve via the springs and the rotating ring seats the end face friction torque of a single group of mechanical seal is represented by the average value of the end face friction torque of the two groups of mechanical seals indirectly tested by the radially installed force sensors. If a radially installed force sensor is located on only one drive pin then the torque indirectly tested by the radially installed force sensor is divided by two to obtain the end face friction torque of the single group of mechanical seal. If two radially installed force sensors are respectively located on two drive pins then a sum of the torque indirectly tested by the two radially installed force sensors is divided by two to obtain the end face friction torque of the single group of mechanical seal.

 2 The shaft sleeve makes the clearance fit with the main shaft without axial positioning on the main shaft so that the mechanical seal installed on the shaft sleeve is able to be automatically adjusted in the working chamber. When the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve is not coincident with the center cross section of the working chamber namely when the distance between the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve and the end face of the stationary ring on the left end cover is not equal to the distance between the initial position of the center cross section of the shaft sleeve and the end face of the stationary ring on the right end cover the shaft sleeve is rotated to drive the left nut and the right nut which are screwed and jointed with the shaft sleeve to respectively move left and right equidistantly so as to drive the rotating ring seats of two groups of mechanical seal to respectively press towards the rotating O rings and the rotating rings via the springs and the supporting rings. One group of mechanical seal which is firstly pressed to the corresponding stationary ring pushes the shaft sleeve to move towards the other group of mechanical seal till the end face specific pressures of the two groups of mechanical seals are same.

 3 The end face friction wear torque of the mechanical seal is able to be accurately measured. Two groups of mechanical seals are installed on the shaft sleeve which is in clearance fit with the main shaft the end face friction wear torque is transmitted via the shaft sleeve to the drive pins within the U shaped openings at two ends of the shaft sleeve on the main shaft without any loss thereby ensuring the measurement accuracy of the end face friction wear torque of the mechanical seal.

 4 The axial force sensors located on the left and right end covers are able to accurately measure the initial spring specific pressure of mechanical seal and monitor the change of the end face specific pressure during operation.

 5 Two groups of mechanical seals with a same size and a same end face specific pressure are adopted together. The leakage amount of the single group of mechanical seal is represented by an average value of the accumulated leakage amount of two groups of mechanical seals the end face friction torque of the single group of mechanical seal is represented by the average value of an end face friction torque of the two groups of mechanical seals thus reducing the impact of randomness on the measurement.
