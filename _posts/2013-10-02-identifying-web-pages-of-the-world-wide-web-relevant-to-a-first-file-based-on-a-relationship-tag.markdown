This patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 438 225 filed on Apr. 3 2012 which is herein incorporated by reference.

The described embodiments relate generally to search results. More particularly the described embodiments relate to methods and systems for identifying web pages of a world wide web having relevance to a first file.

Search engines use a variety of search techniques to present web pages to users based on one or more search terms that are provided by the users. The relevance of the search results relate closely to the search terms. Selection of a web page from the search results in the search engine provides a list of web pages related to the selected web page. Users who like to read more about the related subject matter use the results suggested by the author or the search engine itself. Many authors suggest related web pages that are very valuable to users also referred to as citations. The suggested list however is older than the selected web page. For web pages published after the publication date of the selected web page users have to rely on the search engine to provide a relevant list. The web pages suggested by search engines are based on the search engine s algorithm. The search engine generally produces a large number of web pages that include some irrelevant results and are difficult to sort for relevant web pages. Many suggested web pages are not relevant to the user. Relevant results are not always provided.

It is desirable to have methods and systems for providing an up to date list of web pages related to the selected web page relevant to the subject matter of the selected web page.

One embodiment includes a method of identifying one or more web pages in the World Wide Web related to a first file. The method includes identifying a plurality of web pages within the world wide web wherein the plurality of web pages each have a relationship with the first file wherein the world wide web provides a platform for sharing web pages and wherein each web page includes a document or information resource that is suitable for the world wide web and is accessible through a web browser. The method further includes generating by a system server a list of inquiries based on the plurality of web pages providing by the system server the list of inquiries to at least one author of the first file wherein the list of inquiries includes a relationship tag between at least one of the plurality of web pages and the first file receiving from the at least one author at least one response to the list of inquiries selecting a subset of the plurality of web pages based on the at least one response and storing information related to the selected subset of the plurality of web pages for access if the first file is selected.

Another embodiment includes providing the list of enquiries to more than one author. In another embodiment a different list of inquiries is provided to a first author and other authors. The identified web pages are ranked based on the responses from all the authors and a subset of web pages is selected.

Other aspects and advantages of the described embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating by way of example the principles of the described embodiments.

The described embodiments are embodied in methods and systems for providing a set of web pages to a user in the World Wide Web where the set of web pages have relevance to the first file from a search or retrieval of a record identifying the first file.

For at least some embodiments the World Wide Web provides a platform for sharing web pages wherein each web page includes a document or information resource that is suitable for the world wide web and is accessible through a web browser. The World Wide Web contains several collections of documents of electronic text containing knowledge created by humans such as research papers blog posts web pages videos or video transcripts. Users can upload web pages and share the web pages immediately without the need to email or transport using portable storage drives. The World Wide Web stores web pages or documents of different file formats not limited to word documents power point presentations portable web page format pdf and spreadsheets. In one embodiment of the World Wide Web a user may contribute to the World Wide Web. In an embodiment any user may edit a file similar to a wiki.

In several embodiments a first file is a file in the World Wide Web a file whose URL is shared by the user on a social network such as Twitter or Facebook a file on the disk drive of the user system or a file on the internet or a file on any other file system identified to generate a list of related web pages. The first file may be a recently added file to the World Wide Web or identified due a large number of web pages added to the World Wide Web in the same subject matter or identified automatically for a periodic update of related web pages or identified by any other method. It is to be understood that for various embodiments the first file includes at least one of a web page a document an article a social profile a message a message thread a conversation a video file an audio file or a picture file. It is also to be understood that this is not an exhaustive list.

The World Wide Web is updated constantly as users add web pages. As the number of web pages grows existence of the file may not be known to many users if relevant hyperlinks from other web pages are not created. Creating hyperlinks is a manual task and often few web pages are linked together in the World Wide Web. Search engines provide access to the web pages that are not linked.

Many authors list references or citations in their web pages. The web pages referenced by authors are generally more relevant than the machine generated references but have a publication date earlier than the current file. Unlike machine generated references using an algorithm running on a computer the judgment of authors in selecting reference web pages is valuable to other readers due to the author s intrinsic understanding and motivation to identify materials related to a file a or web page. In general an author or expert has greater interest and more precise understanding of the subject matter discussed in the author s file or web page compared to other readers. In the described embodiments an author is a sole author co author an expert on the subject matter or a team member or anyone who has write privilege to the first file.

Search engines list related web pages that are published before or after a file has been published. When a file is selected from the search results a set of related web pages is generally presented by the search engine. The set of related web pages are based on some criteria such as the number of hyperlinks a file has common subject matter and the frequency of certain phrases. The number of hyperlinks is one of the criteria for search engines to list a file at the top of the related web pages. If a file has no hyperlinks pointing to the file itself the search engine may not list a file at the top though the file may be relevant. The criteria for suggesting a list of related web pages can be improved by using an expert or author to recommend the web pages through hyperlinks. The process of semi automating the presentation of a list of related web pages is described in the embodiments.

A set of web pages related to the first file is identified in World Wide Web by server . In one embodiment identifying in World Wide Web includes server identifying a set of web pages related to the first file and receiving the list of identified web pages. In another embodiment identifying in World Wide Web includes server receiving the list of identified web pages. The set of identified web pages can be the output of natural language search or a text analysis or from collaborative filtering or any other search technique. In several embodiments the search can be based on a string of words or a picture or an author. The set of web pages is derived based on a relationship with the first file. In several embodiments the relationship can be any one of or some of author of the first file author of the references cited in the first file frequently used noun phrases publication date later than the first file a specific publication date or a publication date after a specific date. Web pages published from an author tend to have common subject matter. Frequently used noun phrases in the first file are also keywords for searching related web pages. However the occurrence of any specific noun phrase in the web may change with technology or over a period of time. Many search engines may not have the intelligence to recognize the changing noun phrases over a period. In some embodiments the full text of the file is used for searching to yield more relevant related web pages. Web pages with publication date later than the first file are valuable as users are generally interested in recent updates.

In an example a search engine operating on server uses ENTREZ API to identify bibliography of post publication updates to papers in PubMed based on noun phrases in full text. PubMed is a free database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. ENTREZ is a powerful search engine that allows users to search health sciences database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. The algorithm used to generate the search terms using ENTREZ API automatically extracts noun phrases from a file using natural language processing tools and ranks them by the number of occurrences in the file compared to the number of occurrences on the web. In another embodiment a search Application Programming Interface API such Yahoo Build Your Own Search Service BOSS may be used.

In an embodiment citation validation is used to generate the list of related web pages . Citation validation is defined as search results from queries where the queries are present in one or more citations provided by the author. Citation validated search terms improve the relevance of the search results compared to search terms that are not present in the citations. The citations can written by the same authors as the file or written by different authors.
