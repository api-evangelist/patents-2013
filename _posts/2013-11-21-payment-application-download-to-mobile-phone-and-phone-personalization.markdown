This application is a continuation of claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 11 741 288 filed Apr. 27 2007 and entitled PAYMENT APPLICATION DOWNLOAD TO MOBILE PHONE AND PHONE PERSONALIZATION. The 288 application is related to U.S. Ser. No. 11 741 268 filed Apr. 27 2007 entitled User Experience on Mobile Phone and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 543 496 on Sep. 24 2013. All of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to mobile payments and more specifically to installing and operating a payment application on a mobile phone.

Mobile or cellular phones can be adapted to be used as payment devices to pay for the purchase of goods and services. As an example mobile phones can incorporate the express pay technology found for instance in some credit or debit cards wherein a radio frequency identification RFID chip containing a small microcontroller and metal antenna is embedded in the plastic of the card and replaces the traditional authenticating function of a magnetic stripe bearing cardholder information.

A mobile phone user who has a transaction account such as an American Express Visa MasterCard or Discover account can adapt the phone for use as a payment device in one of several ways currently in development.

For example the user can visit a secure website in order to request that a payment application and personal account information be transmitted to the user s mobile phone. In this method the user might provide his or her transaction account number the telephone number of the user s mobile phone and verification information such as personal information or a password at a computer connected to the Internet. When the provider of the transaction account receives the user s information over the Internet the provider verifies the information and preferably associates the user s transaction account number with the telephone phone of the user s mobile phone.

Alternatively the mobile phone user can call a customer service representative of the provider of the transaction account in order to request that a payment application and personal account information be transmitted to the user s mobile phone. In this method all of the information necessary to complete the request is provided by the user over the telephone.

A third option is for the mobile phone user to fill out a paper form with all of the information associated with a request that a payment application and personal account information be transmitted to the user s mobile phone. The completed paper form is then mailed or personally delivered by the user to the provider of the transaction account.

In each case after the provider verifies the received information and preferably associates the user s transaction account number with the telephone number of the user s mobile phone the user is able to download a payment application to the mobile phone and to use the mobile phone as a payment device.

Typical downloading methods can be used such as by plugging the mobile phone into a computer in which the necessary software has been stored or which can provide a conduit to an Internet site at which the software is located.

There is room for improvement in the development of methods for converting a mobile phone for use as a payment device. For instance there are possible difficulties in not being unable to locate or access a computer with an online connection the time required to download software first to a computer and then from the computer to a mobile phone the time delay associated with mailing and processing of a paper request form and the inconvenience of having to travel to an office of the provider in order to deliver a paper request form. As well secure personalization of a payment application via an online connection to a host server can be unreliable as a method of downloading necessary data since the connection may drop at any time.

Accordingly there is a need for fast and reliable way to securely personalize a payment application using a mobile phone in a manner that does not require the establishment of an online connection in order to achieve successful downloads

The present invention meets the above identified need by providing for secure personalization of a device over a wireless network.

The invention provides a method of personalizing a device over a wireless network comprising receiving a request to personalize the device with user specific information preparing a unique personalization file providing a description file to the device over the wireless network providing the application to the device over the wireless network and providing the unique personalization file to the device over the wireless network.

The invention also provides a method of configuring a mobile phone to operate as a financial transaction instrument comprising accepting a request to program a user s mobile phone processing the request and loading onto the phone financial transaction account information and a program that operates to transmit the account information from a transmitter of the phone to a merchant s reader.

Additionally the invention further provides a method of configuring a mobile phone to operate as a financial transaction instrument comprising receiving a request from a user to program a mobile phone to operate as a financial transaction instrument sending a message containing a URL pointing to a web hosting environment containing an application and loading onto the phone financial transaction account information and an application for operating the phone as a financial transaction instrument after the user has contacted the web hosting environment using the URL.

According to the invention a mobile phone preferably having the capability of transmitting information to an RFID or other reader is provided with an application that enables the phone to be used as a financial transaction instrument. The enabled phone can be brought within a certain distance from a merchant s RFID reader so as to transmit the user s financial transaction account information to the merchant in order to purchase goods or services.

An advantage of the present invention is that mobile phone owners can quickly and conveniently adapt their mobile phones into payment devices thereby reducing or eliminating the need to carry one or more traditional cards such as credit or debit cards in order to pay for goods and services

Another advantage of the present invention is a reliable download solution for downloading a payment application and personal information onto a mobile phone.

Further features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in view of detailed description of the present invention taken together with the accompanying drawings in which the left most digit of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.

A transaction account as used herein refers to an account associated with an open account or a closed account system as described below. The transaction account may exist in a physical or non physical embodiment. For example a transaction account may be distributed in non physical embodiments such as an account number frequent flyer account telephone calling account or the like. Furthermore a physical embodiment of a transaction account may be distributed as a financial transaction instrument.

A financial transaction instrument may be traditional plastic transaction cards titanium containing or other metal containing transaction cards clear and or translucent transaction cards foldable or otherwise unconventionally sized transaction cards radio frequency enabled transaction cards or other types of transaction cards such as credit charge debit pre paid or stored value cards or any other like financial transaction instrument. A financial transaction instrument may also have electronic functionality provided by a network of electronic circuitry that is printed or otherwise incorporated onto or within the transaction instrument and typically referred to as a smart card or it may be a fob having a transponder and an RFID reader. A financial transaction instrument with this electronic functionality can be brought within a certain distance from a reader for example a merchant s RFID reader so as to transmit financial transaction account information to the reader for example in order to purchase goods or services from the merchant .

 Open cards are financial transaction cards that are generally accepted at different merchants. Examples of open cards include American Express Visa MasterCard and Discover cards which may be used at many different retailers and other businesses. In contrast closed cards are financial transaction cards that may be restricted to use in a particular store a particular chain of stores or a collection of affiliated stores. One example of a closed card is a pre paid gift card that may only be purchased at and only be accepted at a clothing retailer such as The Gap store.

Stored value cards are forms of transaction instruments associated with transaction accounts wherein the stored value cards provide cash equivalent value that may be used within an existing payment transaction infrastructure. Stored value cards are frequently referred to as gift pre paid or cash cards in that money is deposited in the account associated with the card before use of the card is allowed. For example if a customer deposits ten dollars of value into the account associated with the stored value card the card may only be used for payments up to ten dollars. The present invention encompasses configuring a mobile phone or other mobile device to be used as a stored value card.

With regard to use of a transaction account users may communicate with merchants in person e.g. at the box office telephonically or electronically e.g. from a user computer via the Internet . During the interaction the merchant may offer goods and or services to the user. The merchant may also offer the user the option of paying for the goods and or services using any number of available transaction accounts. Furthermore the transaction accounts may be used by the merchant as a form of identification of the user. The merchant may have a computing unit implemented in the form of a computer server although other implementations are possible.

In general transaction accounts may be used for transactions between the user and merchant through any suitable communication device such as the following a telephone network an intranet the global public Internet a point of interaction device e.g. a point of sale POS device personal digital assistant PDA mobile phone kiosk etc. online communications off line communications wireless communications and or the like.

An account account number or account code as used herein may include any device code number letter symbol digital certificate smart chip digital signal analog signal biometric or other identifier indicia suitably configured to allow a consumer to access interact with or communicate with a financial transaction system. The account number may optionally be located on or associated with any financial transaction instrument e.g. a rewards charge credit debit prepaid telephone embossed smart magnetic stripe bar code transponder or radio frequency card .

The account number may be distributed and stored in any form of plastic electronic magnetic radio frequency RF wireless audio and or optical device capable of transmitting or downloading data from itself to a second device. A customer account number may be for example a sixteen digit credit card number. Each credit card issuer has its own numbering system such as the fifteen digit numbering system used by American Express Company of New York N.Y. Each issuer s credit card numbers comply with that company s standardized format such that an issuer using a sixteen digit format will generally use four spaced sets of numbers in the form of 

A merchant account number may be for example any number or alpha numeric characters that identify a particular merchant for purposes of card acceptance account reconciliation reporting and the like.

The terms business or merchant may be used interchangeably with each other and shall mean any person entity distributor system software and or hardware that is a provider broker and or any other entity in the distribution chain of goods or services. For example a merchant may be a grocery store a retail store a travel agency a service provider an online merchant or the like.

Other operating systems or platforms secure elements and programming languages may be employed. The mobile phone is typically also provided with a transmitter or a transceiver with electronic functionality which can be used to transmit information to a reader such as a financial transaction instrument reader belonging to a merchant. If the phone is provided with a transceiver it can receive as well as transmit information. Thus the phone can be converted into a payment device that can take the place of a traditional credit card or the like. In other embodiments the phone may have some other mechanism for providing information to an instrument reader for example physical connection means light and so on .

Also as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present application the present invention is not limited to mobile phones. Other mobile devices such as personal digital assistants can also be securely personalized over a wireless network and used as a payment device.

With reference to the process of adapting a mobile phone or other mobile device for use as a payment device will now be described. In the following description the mobile phone being referred to may be the mobile phone shown in and the events occurring at a provider s side may be implemented using the computer system shown in . The provider of a transaction account owned by a mobile phone user receives a request from the user to personalize the mobile phone with user specific information associated with the transaction account. This request may be made for example by sending a message from the mobile phone by Short Message Service SMS . Other wireless methods such as Multimedia Messaging Service may be employed for sending the request. Typically the request includes the account number associated with the transaction account. The request may include other information such as the name of the account owner a username and a password. The user may also send the request by visiting a website of the provider through a computer terminal or by visiting the website through the mobile phone. The request is received at the provider s side at for example a host server and is authenticated at the provider s side. Alternatively a third party over the air service could perform the authentication on behalf of the provider. Authentication means establishing the identity of the mobile phone user and specifically establishing that the user is the owner of the transaction account. The request is then authorized at the provider s side . Authorization means allowing the owner of the transaction account that is the mobile phone user to interact with the transaction account using the mobile phone.

Following authorization the transaction account is designated at the provider s end as permitting mobile payment that is the provider preferably establishes a record of the authorization of the owner to interact with the transaction account through the mobile phone. In addition a personalized data package which includes user specific information that is unique to the owner of the transaction account is generated at the provider s end. This is information for installation into the mobile phone to enable its use as a financial transaction instrument. An application set is built based on that information. The application set includes a description file described below to be downloaded to a mobile device it also includes the personalized data package generated in step .

It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present application that steps through can be fully automated at the provider s side using hardware and or software such as one or more computer systems or other processing systems running software programs or they can incorporate human input for example a person at the provider s side can check a database to con firm that a transaction account for the user does exist .

Previously there has been a need to plug a mobile phone into a computer in order to download information to enable the phone to function as a mobile payment device. In contrast the present invention provides a method of personalizing a mobile device in which software and personalized data are provided to the device over a wireless network. Preferably SMS messages are employed in carrying out the method of the invention but other forms of wireless communication may also be used. Generally speaking SMS messages may directly contain information for enabling the phone as a payment device or the SMS messages may contain instructions for how to obtain such information.

From the provider s side an SMS message is sent to the mobile phone of the user either completely automatically or with input from a person. Other wireless methods such as Multimedia Messaging Service may be employed in place of SMS. The SMS message preferably informs the user that the necessary application s are ready for download to the phone. The SMS message also preferably includes a Uniform Resource Locator URL address that points to a description file such as a Java application descriptor file .JAD file which is hosted at the provider s side in a web hosting environment and may be specific to the user. When the user visits the URL the description file which is part of the application set built in step may be downloaded . This preferably occurs automatically when the user contacts the web hosting environment. The .JAD file preferably contains another URL leading to a resource file such as a Java archive file .JAR file which is hosted at the provider s side in a web hosting environment and that comprises software that will perform as a payment application further described later once installed on the mobile phone. The .JAD file also preferably contains instructions on how to obtain the personalized data package generated in step for example the .JAD can provide an URL leading to the personalized data package generated in step . Preferably when the .JAD file is read by the mobile phone for the first time the URL to the resource file is submitted thereby causing the downloading of the resource file to the mobile phone where it is to be executed in the main operating environment of the phone. The main operating system of the phone which is J2ME in this embodiment functions to control the keypad of the phone the display screen and so on.

If the user chooses to execute the .JAR file and run the included software in the main operating environment then the personalized data package generated in step is sent to the mobile phone . This can occur for example through accessing a personalized data package URL in the .JAD file. The downloaded personalized data package is initially stored in a main memory of the phone associated with the main operating environment. The personalized data package includes a unique personalization file containing information specific to the owner of the transaction account. Internal logic in the executed .JAR file and the phone s application programming interface J2ME work together to implement the personalized data package onto the phone by pushing the personalized data package into a secure element of the phone. The secure element is generally a module that is resistant to improper physical and electronic tampering and thus is suitable for storing sensitive information. In this embodiment the secure element is a tamper resistant module that conforms to Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 140 2. More specifically in this embodiment the secure element is a secure card that uses the JCOP operating system. With the implementation of the personalized data package the secure element in the phone has been personalized with the financial transaction account information. Preferably the executed .JAR file then deletes the personalized data package from the main memory of the phone as a precaution against unwanted access to the data package should the phone be lost. 

Instead of having the description file contain instructions on how to obtain the personalized data package which includes the unique personalization file containing information specific to the owner of the transaction account the description file can directly contain the information specific to the owner of the transaction account. In this case if the user chooses to execute the .JAR file the information specific to the owner of the transaction account is accessed from the .JAD file and implemented onto the phone into the secure element.

The downloaded software once installed on the mobile phone performs as a payment application. Specifically the software provides the phone with functionality to transmit financial transaction account information using a transmitter allows the user to operate the financial transaction account system on the phone and allows for wireless communication between the phone and the provider. That is the mobile phone having been provided with a payment application is configured to operate as a financial transaction instrument and can be used as a payment device. The mobile phone can now be operated to transmit financial transaction account information of the user such as the information downloaded in step from the mobile phone to a reader such as a merchant s financial transaction instrument reader. Thus the mobile phone user does not need to carry a traditional financial transaction instrument such as a credit card in order to be able to purchase goods and services. One example of a payment application is the ExpressPay Java application from American Express Company.

The above described process from steps to can be repeated for a plurality of financial transaction accounts such that the mobile phone can be used in placed of multiple financial transaction instruments. In this way the mobile phone user can avoid the need to carry numerous traditional cards in order to purchase a variety of goods and services from different types of merchants.

Use of the mobile phone as a payment device is described in further detail in the above identified related application User Experience on Mobile Phone.

According to the present invention there is no need to plug or otherwise physically connect a mobile phone into a computer in order to enable the phone to function as a mobile payment device. The downloading of the description file the downloading of the resource file and the downloading of the personalized data package preferably all occur over a wireless network. Further secure personalization is fast. For example the process from the user s receipt of the SMS message sent in step to complete download of the personalized data package sent in step onto the user s mobile phone may take about a minute. Moreover the URL in the SMS message is easy for a user to use and the user is able to make as little as a single click on the URL in the SMS message in order to enable a mobile phone to function as a mobile payment device. As well secure personalization of a payment application according to the present invention does not rely on an online connection to a host server avoiding problems such as incomplete downloads due to dropped connections.

While an embodiment of the present invention has been described above it should be understood that it has been presented by way of example and not by way of limitation. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s that various changes in form and detail can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The present invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.

Further the purpose of the Abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the general public who may not be familiar with patent or legal terms to quickly determine the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application. The Abstract is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. It is also to be understood that the steps and processes recited in the claims need not be performed in the order presented.
