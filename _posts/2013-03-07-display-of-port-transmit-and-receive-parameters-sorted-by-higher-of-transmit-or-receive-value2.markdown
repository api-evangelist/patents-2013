title: Display of port transmit and receive parameters sorted by higher of transmit or receive value
abstract: The data ports in a network are displayed in a list in descending order based on either the higher transmit or receive data value of the port. Therefore, the port with the highest of either the transmit or receive data value would be displayed on the top of the list. The port with the second highest of the transmit or receive data value would be displayed second on the list. This process would continue for all data ports that are displayed. The other of the transmit or receive data values of the port would be displayed but would not affect the ordering on the display.

The invention relates to network device management and more particularly to displaying a networking device.

Network management software provides network administrators a way of tracking the bandwidth utilization of ports on a network. For smaller networks with a fewer number of ports closely monitoring port utilization in a graphical user interface GUI is a less arduous task. However for large networks there are often so many ports that arrangement of the display of data values for each port based on predetermined parameters is necessitated. Current solutions to this problem offer arranging the ports in several ways. One current solution offers arranging the ports in descending order based on the port with the highest transmit value. Another current solution offers arranging the ports in descending order based on the port with the highest receive value. Yet another current solution offers arranging the ports in descending order based on the port with the highest of sum data transmit and data receive value. While these solutions aid administrators in tracking port traffic they do not always allow for quick viewing of ports close to their physical maximum data transmit or receive values so that the administrator can take action to reroute traffic before congestion occurs. Therefore a method and system to improve the display of heavily used ports is desirable.

The data ports in a network are displayed in a list in descending order based on either the higher transmit or receive data value of the port. Therefore the port with the highest of either the transmit or receive data value would be displayed on the top of the list. The port with the second highest of the transmit or receive data value would be displayed second on the list. This process would continue for all data ports that are displayed. The other of the transmit or receive data values of the port would be displayed but would not affect the ordering on the display.

Referring to an Ethernet network is shown wherein a LAN is interconnected to a remote campus via WAN . The campus core includes a plurality of interconnected core switches . The core switches are connected to a data center not shown . A router no is connected to the core switches and the WAN . The core switches are connected to switches and of an aggregation campus . The aggregation campus switches and are connected to switches of large network and provide data communication services to the large network s telephone computer and wireless access devices. The aggregation network switches and may also be connected to additional campuses not shown in order to provide additional data communication services. The LAN is connected to the WAN via router no. The WAN is comprised of a plurality of interconnected Ethernet switches and other networking devices not shown . WAN is connected to remote campus via a router . Router provides data communication services to computers and telephone devices . It is understood that this is an exemplary network and numerous other network topologies can be monitored according to the present invention.

In an embodiment of the present invention a management station is connected to router no of the campus core . As will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art the management station allows a network administrator to monitor the data traffic port utilization and various other networking characteristics of each switching device in the Ethernet network .

Turning next to a block diagram of an Ethernet switch or router that may be utilized in Ethernet network is shown. The Ethernet switch comprises a switch software environment and switch hardware environment . The software environment includes a diagnostics and statistics module to allow management software access to the various statistical counters in the switch such as receive and transmit rate counters for each port . The switch hardware environment has a processor complex that consists of processors as defined. The processor complex is connected to a switch fabric which provides the basic switching operations for the switch . The switch fabric is connected to a plurality of packet processors . Each packet processor has its own respective policy routing table to provide conventional packet analysis and routing. Each packet processor is connected to its own respective port or ports . When the Ethernet switch is implemented in a network such as network the data value of each port and may be monitored and analyzed using management software on a management station such as management station . Again it is understood that this is an exemplary Ethernet switch architecture and numerous other architectures can be used according to the present invention.

In an embodiment of the present invention a management station is connected to Ethernet LAN which is connected directly to SAN network and indirectly to Ethernet LAN via WAN . Ethernet LANs and are connected to the Ethernet management ports of the switches and to provide a management network for the switches and . As will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art the management station allows a network administrator to monitor the data traffic port utilization and various other networking characteristics using network management software such that any data congestion may be alleviated.

The switch ASIC has four basic modules port groups a frame data storage system a control subsystem and a system interface . The port groups perform the lowest level of packet transmission and reception and include a statistical counter module to allow management software to access the various statistical counters of the switch such as receive and transmit rate counters for each port. Generally frames are received from a media interface and provided to the frame data storage system . Further frames are received from the frame data storage system and provided to the media interface for transmission out a port .

While communication networks using the Ethernet and FC protocols with switches routers and the like have been used as the example in the Figures the present invention can be applied to any type of data communication network.
