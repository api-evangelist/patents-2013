Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and more particularly to configuring multiplayer games in land based and online wagering game systems.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.

While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated. For purposes of the present detailed description the singular includes the plural and vice versa unless specifically disclaimed the words and and or shall be both conjunctive and disjunctive the word all means any and all the word any means any and all and the word including means including without limitation. 

Traditionally wagering game machines were available only at bricks and mortar casinos. However with the advent of Internet technologies some wagering game providers began offering online websites at which players could play wagering games. In both gaming venues i.e. bricks and mortar and online players typically have very little control over gaming options. Some embodiments of the inventive subject matter enable players to configure numerous options in both bricks and mortar wagering game machines and online games. In some embodiments bricks and mortar casino operators give players control over wagering game machine settings such as denominations maximum bets game type e.g. five line electronic slots 12 line electronic slots etc. thematic presentation e.g. sports theme movie theme etc. audio settings video settings etc. Therefore some embodiments enable players to configure and reconfigure wagering game machines to their liking. As a result players need not move about casinos in search of particular machine configurations. For example instead of moving to a different machine a player can significantly increase betting by changing his her machine s denomination configuration. As another example instead of moving to different machine the player can change game types such as changing from video slots to video poker.

Like machine configuration players have had little control over multiplayer games. Typically a player s game becomes part of a multiplayer bonus round after hitting a particular slot reel combination. After hitting the slot reel combination the player s game becomes part of a multiplayer bonus round with other players who hit similar slot reel combinations. Some embodiments give players control over who participates in multiplayer games. Some embodiments allow players to initiate multiplayer games e.g. without first having a particular reel combination and invite particular players to play the multiplayer games. Some embodiments allow players to select multiplayer game participants from their social network contact lists e.g. Facebook friends list casino based social network friends list etc. .

For online gaming some embodiments offer online casinos that enable players to configure various gaming options and multiplayer games as described above. Additionally some embodiments allow online players to configure and operate virtual casinos. The virtual casinos include virtual wagering game machines on which players can play online wagering games. As players build more attractive virtual casinos their virtual casinos may attract more player traffic and they may receive various awards for building popular virtual casinos.

This section describes graphical user interfaces that enable players to configure wagering game machines and online wagering games. Some of the interfaces allow players to configure and initiate multiplayer wagering games.

In the GUI the selectable gaming options are denominations for wagering games. Denominations represent an amount of money for each gaming credit associated with a wagering game. If the denominations are 0.10 when the player bets one gaming credit the player is betting 0.10. The GUI enables the player to select a desired denomination. For example shows the player selecting a 1 denomination icon . As a result of the selection the player will bet at least 1 on each wagering game.

Although shows only denominations the GUI can allow players to configure any suitable gaming options such as maximum bets theme audio settings video settings etc. As another example players may adjust a machine s volatility which adjusts frequency and amount of jackpots. High volatility may be characterized by infrequent jackpots that are relatively large. Low volatility may be characterized by more frequent jackpots that are relatively small.

As shown in the GUI shows two rows of icons the player s favorite game icons and denomination icons . The player can move through the denomination icons by dragging them horizontally across the interface see arrow . For the row of denomination icons the icons can shift left to right or right to left depending player input. As the icons shift some icons move out of the GUI while new game icons enter the GUI. For example if the denomination icons shift left the icon will disappear from the GUI and the icon will move into the position formerly occupied by icon . Additionally the icon will move into the position formerly occupied by the icon and so on until all the icons shift. At some point the denomination icons may wrap around and appear again in the GUI . The same mechanics apply to the favorite game icons .

Although the icons and span the GUI horizontally in they could also appear vertically. If the icons appear vertically the icons could move vertically according to the mechanics described above.

As part of a process for initiating wagering games some embodiments provide a GUI through which players can select wagering games such as games their friends have played their own favorite games multiplayer games to play with their friends. The discussion of describes this in more detail.

The player can initiate single player wagering games by selecting an icon from the favorite game icons friends games icons new games icons and progressive game icons . The player can slide the icons left to right or right to left see arrow as described above. As the player slides the icons new icons may appear with more game choices see discussion above .

The player can initiate multiplayer games by dragging one or more of the friends games icons onto any one of the multiplayer game icons . The discussion of describe selecting multiplayer games in more detail see below .

The GUI also includes a newsfeed window . The newsfeed window presents information about events relevant to the player. For example news items may indicate that the player s friend recently won a jackpot on a particular wagering game. Alternatively the news items may indicate that the player s friends have played certain games signed into the wagering game system online or in a breaks and mortar casino made particular configuration choices etc. The newsfeed window can publish any other events the player may find interesting. In the embodiment shown in new news items appear at the bottom of the newsfeed window and move to the top as additional news items appear see arrow . A news item occupying the top position will disappear from the newsfeed window upon presentation of the next new news item.

This discussion will continue with a description of how the GUI enables players to configure and initiate multiplayer games.

In some embodiments the player is not automatically included in a selected multiplayer game. In such embodiments the player can select himself herself by dragging and dropping a favorite games icon onto a selected multiplayer game icon . In other embodiments dragging and dropping a favorite games icon onto a multiplayer game icon constitutes both selection of the multiplayer game icon and selection of the player himself herself to participate in the multiplayer game. That is some embodiments of the GUI do not require the player initially select a multiplayer game icon before dragging and dropping a favorite games icon onto the multiplayer game icon. shows how the GUI confirms configuration of the multiplayer game.

This discussion will continue with a description of the wagering game system components that provide the functionality described herein.
