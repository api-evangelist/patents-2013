The present invention was made with United States Government support under contract number N00173 05 C 6020 awarded by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to optical connectors in general and in particular to a fiber optic connector having an embedded window for connecting an optical fiber to other optical assemblies.

A fiber optic connector is typically utilized to connect an optical fiber to other optical assemblies. A fiber optic connector commonly includes a ferrule in which an internal optical fiber is housed.

The profile of the end face of an optical fiber can significantly affect its connection characteristics. For example when an angle i.e. an angle to the optical fiber axis of the end face of an optical fiber deviates from a right angle or the end face of an optical fiber is highly roughened air may enter in a space between the end face of the optical fiber to any subsequent optics. As a result Fresnel reflection increases at the end face of the optical fiber and leads to an increase in connection loss of the optical fiber.

One method for preventing the increase in connection loss of an optical fiber due to the roughness of the end face of the optical fiber is by polishing the end face of the optical fiber. However this method is not suitable when the external optical fiber such as holey fiber or soft glasses is very sensitive or when the connection work is conducted at the setting site of the optical fiber because of the necessity of a polishing device and high labor cost.

Another method is to use a refractive index matching agent interposed between the end faces of optical fibers and subsequent optical surfaces. With this method air can be prevented from entering into the space between the end faces of the two optical fibers. As a result Fresnel reflection caused by the air can be lowered and the connection loss of optical fibers can be reduced. However this method has the following problems. Since the refractive index matching agent is generally formed of a silicone or paraffin agent in liquid or grease state it can cause undesirable contamination to holey fibers or high power fibers . Furthermore since the refractive index matching agent generally has a temperature dependency in refractive index transmission loss of optical fibers may vary according to a change in refractive index of the refractive index matching agent. Also current index matching agents are typically restricted to wavelengths below two microns due either to low refraction index most have n

Yet another common method for reducing Fresnel reflection loss is to treat the surface of an optic fiber with an anti reflective coating after its assembly into a ferrule. This coating can be applied via vapor deposition. Alternatively the surface can be mechanically altered to achieve the same effect i.e. moth eye microstructure . Unfortunately some optical fiber materials such as mid infrared sensitive glasses in high power applications may be unsuitable for this method.

Due to the impracticality of implementing traditional methods for reducing Fresnel reflection loss in certain types of optical fibers an improved fiber optic connector would be desirable.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a fiber optic connector includes a top plate having a window of similar refractive index and transmission index as the material of an optic fiber to be contained within the fiber optic connector. The fiber optic connector also includes a ferrule connected to the top plate via multiple spring loaded screws. The ferrule includes an interface and an insert. The insert is capable of firmly gripping an optical fiber. In order to reduce Fresnel reflection losses of the fiber optic connector the window is pre coated with an anti reflective surface on the side opposite an optic fiber to be contained within the fiber optic connector.

All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there is illustrated an isometric view of a fiber optic connector in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown a fiber optic connector includes a ferrule and a housing . In addition fiber optic connector also includes a top plate and multiple O rings . Ferrule is a cylindrical member with a center hole for receiving an optical fiber. Top plate and O rings are preferably secured to a front end of ferrule via multiple screws . Housing is connected to a back end of ferrule .

O rings act as shock absorbers between top plate and ferrule . O rings can be substituted by RTV silicone gaskets or springs. Although top plate is shown to be in a triangular shape having three screw holes at each apex of the triangle it is understood by those skilled in the art that top plate can be of any shape with any number of screw holes.

For the present embodiment top plate is preferably made of steel with a thickness of less than approximately 2 mm. Top plate includes a clear circular window with a diameter of approximately 3 mm. Window can also be in a square shape with a dimension of approximately 3.6 mm 3.6 mm. Window is made of a material that is reflective index matched and transmission matched with an optical fiber contained within ferrule . On the fiber facing side i.e. the side contacting optical fiber window is preferably polished flat and un coated. On the air facing side window is preferably anti reflection coated by any of methods known in the art.

For the present embodiment window is an AsSwindow and optical fiber is an AsSfiber. Alternatively window can be a ZnSe window and optical fiber can be an AsSfiber in order to improve the hardness of the exposed surface along with reducing the reflection losses.

With reference now to there is depicted a cross sectional view of fiber optic connector in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown ferrule includes a steel interface and a Zirconia insert . The length of protrusion of Zirconia insert from steel interface may vary depending on the thickness of O rings . Also shown in is optical fiber contained within Zirconia insert .

Before placing optical fiber within ferrule optical fiber may be prepared as follows. The fiber buffer layer of optical fiber is initially stripped to a length appropriate for cleaving preferably less than 10 cm . Optical fiber is then cleaved and inserted into Zirconia insert . Optical fiber is allowed to protrude approximately 100 m beyond Zirconia insert . An epoxy is applied and is allowed to wick up ferrule and cure slow curing is best . As a result optical fiber is then glued in place within Zirconia insert via the epoxy.

The choice of epoxy can affect the quality of fiber optic connector particularly when the epoxy cannot hold optical fiber adequately. Preferably Epo Tek 353ND manufactured by Epoxy Technology Inc. is utilized for the present embodiment. Epo Tek 353ND is preferred over other epoxies because of its viscous properties during the cure cycle. For the present embodiment steel interface is also bonded to Zirconia insert using Epo Tek 353ND.

In addition window is affixed to top plate either with a bonding agent i.e. silicone RTV or mechanically. After the epoxy for optical fiber has cured top plate is affixed loosely to ferrule along with screws and O rings . By using a microscope with normally incident monochromatic light fringes should be apparent between window and the face of optical fiber . Screws can then be tightened until the fringes are minced to one fringe of green light or less which indicates that sufficient mechanical and optical contact are in place for infra red light transmissions. Screws should not be over tighten in order to avoid crushing optical fiber . Screws can also be tacked in place using the above mentioned epoxy.

As has been described the present invention provides a fiber optic connector having an embedded window for connecting an optical fiber to other optical assemblies.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
