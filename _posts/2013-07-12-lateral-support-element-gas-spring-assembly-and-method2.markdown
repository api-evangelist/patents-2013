This application is the National Stage of International Application No. PCT US2013 050356 filed on Jul. 12 2013 which claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 670 782 filed on Jul. 12 2012 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 672 066 filed on Jul. 16 2012 the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The subject matter of the present disclosure broadly relates to the art of spring devices and more particularly to interfaces between a flexible wall and a lateral support element of a gas spring assembly. Gas spring assemblies including such interfaces as well as suspension systems for vehicles that include one or more of such gas spring assemblies and methods of assembly are also included.

The subject matter of the present disclosure is capable of broad application and use in connection with a variety of applications and or environments. However the subject matter finds particular application and use in conjunction with rail vehicles and will be described herein with particular reference thereto. However it is to be appreciated that the subject matter of the present disclosure is amenable to use in connection with other applications and environments.

A suspension system such as may be used in connection with motorized rail vehicles and or rolling stock rail vehicles for example can include one or more spring elements for accommodating forces and loads associated with the operation and use of the corresponding device e.g. a rail vehicle to which the suspension system is operatively connected. In such applications it is often considered desirable to utilize spring elements that operate at a lower spring rate as a reduced spring rate can favorably influence certain performance characteristics such as vehicle ride quality and comfort for example. That is it is well understood in the art that the use of a spring element having a higher spring rate i.e. a stiffer spring will transmit a greater magnitude of inputs e.g. road inputs to the sprung mass and that in some applications this could undesirably affect the sprung mass such as for example by resulting in a rougher less comfortable ride of a vehicle. Whereas the use of spring elements having lower spring rates i.e. a softer or more compliant spring will transmit a lesser amount of the inputs to the sprung mass.

Generally vehicle performance characteristics such as ride quality and comfort are commonly identified as being related to factors such as spring rate that are acting in an approximately axial direction in relation to the gas spring assemblies. It has been recognized however that relative movement in the lateral direction i.e. a direction transverse to the axes of the gas spring assemblies can also influence vehicle performance characteristics such as ride quality and comfort for example. In some cases such lateral movement can include movement of the opposing end members of a gas spring assembly relative to one another in a direction transverse e.g. perpendicular to the axis of the gas spring assembly that is formed between the opposing end members.

In some cases known gas spring assemblies can include a flexible wall and a lateral support element that engages the flexible wall to influence the lateral stiffness rate of the gas spring assemblies. In some cases known lateral support element designs result in a lower lateral stiffness rate that can permit excessive lateral deflection of the end members relative to one another. While such performance conditions may in some cases result in favorable ride quality and comfort performance characteristics such as vehicle handling and control can be undesirably affected. In other cases known lateral support element designs result in a higher lateral stiffness rate that can provide favorable vehicle handling and control. However such high lateral stiffness rates can also generate undesired performance characteristics such as lower ride quality and or comfort.

Notwithstanding the widespread usage and overall success of the wide variety of gas spring assemblies including a lateral support element that are known in the art it is believed that a need exists to meet these competing goals while still retaining comparable or improved ease of manufacture ease of assembly ease of installation and or reduced cost of manufacture.

One example of a lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure that is dimensioned for use with an associated flexible wall of an associated gas spring assembly can include an element wall with a first surface facing away from an associated flexible wall and a second surface facing toward the associated flexible wall. The lateral support element can be disposed along the associated flexible wall such that an interface is formed between an outer surface of the associated flexible wall and the second surface of the lateral support element. The interface can be operative to generate a lateral spring rate profile in an associated gas spring assembly that varies according to lateral displacement of the associated flexible wall and the lateral support element relative to one another. The interface can include a quantity of friction reducing material operatively disposed between the flexible wall and the lateral support element.

Another example of a lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure that is dimensioned for use with an associated flexible wall of an associated gas spring assembly can include an element wall with a first surface facing away from an associated flexible wall and a second surface facing toward the associated flexible wall. The lateral support element can be disposed along the associated flexible wall such that an interface is formed between an outer surface of the associated flexible wall and the second surface of the lateral support element. The interface can be operative to generate a lateral spring rate profile in an associated gas spring assembly that varies according to lateral displacement of the associated flexible wall and the lateral support element relative to one another. The interface can be at least partially formed by a cross sectional profile of the lateral support element that includes a convex profile segment.

One example of a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure can include a flexible wall having a longitudinal axis and extending peripherally about the longitudinal axis between a first end and a second end spaced longitudinally from the first end. The flexible wall can include an inner surface and an outer surface with the inner surface at least partially defining a spring chamber. A lateral support element can include an element wall with a first surface facing away from the flexible wall and a second surface facing toward the flexible wall. The lateral support element can be disposed along the first end of the flexible wall such that an interface is formed between the outer surface of the flexible wall and the second surface of the lateral support element. The interface can be operative to generate a lateral spring rate profile that varies according to lateral displacement of the flexible wall and the lateral support element relative to one another. The gas spring assembly can be displaced from a neutral position to a laterally offset position with the lateral spring rate decreasing over at least a portion of the displacement from the neutral position to the laterally offset position. In some cases the gas spring assembly can include a quantity of friction reducing material operatively disposed along the interface between the flexible wall and the lateral support element. Additionally or in the alternative the lateral support element of the gas spring assembly can in some cases have a cross sectional profile that includes a convex profile segment.

One example of a method of assembling a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure can include providing a flexible wall having a longitudinal axis and extending peripherally about the longitudinal axis between first and second ends to at least partially form a spring chamber. The method can also include providing a lateral support element and positioning the lateral support element on along or otherwise adjacent the flexible wall. The method can further include forming an interface between the flexible wall and the lateral support element. The method can also include providing a first end member and securing a first end of the flexible wall on or along the first end member. The method can also include providing a second end member and securing the second end member on or along an end of the flexible wall to at least partially form a spring chamber.

Additionally it will be appreciated that the drawings are not to scale and that portions of certain features and or elements may be exaggerated for purposes of clarity and or ease of understanding.

Rail vehicle includes a vehicle body supported on one or more frame and wheel assemblies two of which are shown in .

Bogies are shown as being disposed toward opposing ends and of rail vehicle .

Bogies are shown in as including a frame as well as one or more wheel sets that are typically formed by an axle and a pair of spaced apart wheels . Normally bogies include at least two wheel sets such as is shown in for example that are operatively connected to the frame in manner suitable to permit the wheels to roll along rails RLS of track TRK.

Bogies are also shown as including a secondary suspension system that includes at least one gas spring assembly. In the exemplary arrangement shown in bogies include two gas spring assemblies that are operatively connected between frame and vehicle body to permit relative movement therebetween.

Rail vehicles such as rail vehicle for example typically include a braking system with one or more brakes operatively associated with each wheel set. In the exemplary arrangement in two brakes are shown as being operatively associated with each of wheel sets with one brake disposed adjacent each of wheels . It will be appreciated however that other arrangements could alternately be used.

Additionally rail vehicles such as rail vehicle for example typically include at least one pneumatic system that is operatively associated therewith. In many cases components of the one or more pneumatic systems can be distributed along the length of a train that is formed from a plurality of rail vehicles such as one or more traction drive engines and one or more rolling stock vehicles for example.

Typical pneumatic systems include two or more separately controllable portions such as a pneumatic braking system that is operatively associated with the vehicle brakes e.g. brakes and a pneumatic supply system that is operatively associated with the other pneumatically actuated devices of the rail vehicle such as the secondary suspension system for example. As such rail vehicles typically include a dedicated conduit for each of these two systems. Such conduits normally extend lengthwise along the vehicle body and are often individually referred to as a brake pipe and a supply pipe.

Generally certain components of the braking system such as brakes for example as well as certain components of the pneumatic supply system are supported on or otherwise operatively associated with one of bogies of rail vehicle . For example supply lines can fluidically interconnect bogies with the pneumatic supply system. Supply lines are shown as being fluidically connected with one or more leveling valves that are operatively connected with gas spring assemblies such as by way of gas lines and are selectively operable to transfer pressurized gas into and out of the gas spring assemblies. In some cases a pressurized gas storage device or reservoir can optionally be fluidically connected along gas line between leveling valve and gas spring assembly . Additionally a cross flow line can optionally be connected in fluid communication between two or more of gas lines . In some cases a control valve such as a duplex check valve for example can be fluidically connected along cross flow line such as is shown in for example.

One example of a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure such as may be suitable for use as one or more of gas spring assemblies in for example is shown as gas spring assembly in . The gas spring assembly has a longitudinal axis AX and includes an end member an end member spaced longitudinally from end member and a flexible spring member or sleeve that extends peripherally about the longitudinal axis and is secured between the end members to at least partially define a spring chamber .

Gas spring assembly can be disposed between associated sprung and unsprung masses of an associated vehicle in any suitable manner. For example one end member can be operatively connected to an associated sprung mass with the other end member disposed toward and operatively connected to the associated unsprung mass. In the embodiment shown in for example end member is secured on or along a structural component SC such as an associated vehicle body in for example and can be secured thereon in any suitable manner. As another example end member is secured on or along a structural component SC such as an associated rail bogie in for example and can be secured thereon in any suitable manner.

In the exemplary arrangement in end member is shown as taking the form of a top plate having a plate wall that has opposing surfaces and such that a plate height not identified is at least partially defined therebetween. Plate wall is shown as being generally planar and extending outwardly to an outer periphery . In some cases plate wall can have a generally circular shape such that an outer peripheral surface extending in a heightwise direction can have a generally cylindrical shape. A passage surface at least partially defines a gas transfer passage extending through the end member such that pressurized gas can be transferred into and out of spring chamber such as by way of pneumatic system for example. In some cases the end member can include a projection or boss that extends from along plate wall in a longitudinal direction. In the exemplary arrangement shown in projection extends axially outwardly away from spring chamber .

As mentioned above one or more securement devices not shown can be used to secure or otherwise interconnect the end members of the gas spring assembly with corresponding structural components. In some cases projection can include an outer surface that is dimensioned for receipt within a passage or mounting hole MHL that extends through structural component SC. Additionally one or more sealing elements can optionally be included that are disposed between or otherwise at least partially form a substantially fluid tight connection between the end member and the structural component such as between projection and mounting hole MHL for example. In some cases structural component SC can optionally at least partially define an external reservoir suitable for storing a quantity of pressurized gas.

End member is shown as taking the form of an assembly that includes a support base or pedestal and a base plate that is secured on or along the pedestal in a suitable manner such as by way of a flowed material joint for example. Pedestal extends axially between opposing ends and and includes an outer surface that extends peripherally about axis AX and an end surface that is disposed along end and is dimensioned or otherwise configured for operative engagement with an associated structural component such as structural component SC for example. It will be appreciated that end member can be secured on or along the associated structural component in any suitable manner. As one example pedestal can include a plurality of securement features such as threaded passages that extend inwardly into the pedestal from along end surface for example. In some cases a corresponding number of one or more holes or passages HLS can extend through structural component SC that are dimensioned for receipt of a securement device such as a threaded fastener for example. It will be appreciated however that other configurations and or arrangements could alternately be used.

Base plate can have a plate wall not numbered that has opposing surfaces and such that a plate height not identified is at least partially defined therebetween. Base plate is shown as being generally planar and extending outwardly to an outer periphery . In some cases base plate can have a generally circular shape such that an outer peripheral surface extending in a heightwise direction can have a generally cylindrical shape. Additionally in some cases base plate can optionally include an endless annular recess or groove that extends axially inwardly into the base plate from along surface thereof. It will be appreciated that such a groove if provided can be of any suitable size shape configuration and or arrangement. For example groove is shown as being at least partially defined by a bottom surface an inner side surface and an outer side surface . In a preferred arrangement groove can be dimensioned to at least partially receive a portion of flexible spring member and one or more retaining elements such as may be used to secure the flexible spring member on or along the base plate for example.

Flexible spring member can be of any suitable size shape construction and or configuration. As one example flexible spring member can include a flexible wall that is at least partially formed from one or more layers or plies not identified of elastomeric material e.g. natural rubber synthetic rubber and or thermoplastic elastomer and can optionally include one or more plies or layers of filament reinforcing material not shown .

In the arrangement shown in mounting beads and are shown as being respectively disposed along ends and . In some cases the mounting beads can optionally include a reinforcing element such as an endless annular bead core for example.

As one example gas spring assembly can include one or more bead retaining elements that engage at least a portion of the flexible spring member and maintain the flexible spring member in substantially fluid tight engagement with the corresponding end member e.g. end member . In the arrangement shown in end of flexible wall is disposed in abutting engagement with bottom surface of groove in base plate . A bead retaining element such as in the form of an endless annular ring for example captures at least a portion of mounting bead and is shown as being secured on or along base plate by way of a plurality of securement devices such as for example threaded fastener not numbered and threaded nut not numbered combinations that extend through at least approximately aligned holes or slots not numbered in the base plate and in the bead retaining element.

Typically at least a portion of flexible spring member will extend radially outward beyond outer periphery of base plate . In some cases end member can include an outer support wall that can optionally extend peripherally around or otherwise along base plate such as from along the plate wall of the base plate and in a direction toward end of pedestal . In such cases flexible spring member can extend along an outer surface of outer support wall such that a rolling lobe is formed along the flexible spring member. Outer surface is shown in as having a generally cylindrical shape and rolling lobe can be displaceable along the outer surface as the gas spring assembly is axially displaced between extended and compressed conditions such as may occur during dynamic use in operation. It will be appreciated that other shapes and or configurations of outer support wall and or outer surface can alternately be used such as may be useful to provide desired performance characteristics for example.

As is well known in the art it is generally desirable to avoid or at least minimize contact between end members of a gas spring assembly such as may occur due to variations in load conditions and or upon deflation of the gas spring assembly for example. As such gas spring assembly is shown in as including a jounce bumper that is disposed within spring chamber and supported on end member . As identified in jounce bumper is shown as including a mounting plate that is disposed in abutting engagement with end member a bumper body supported on the mounting plate and a wear plate that is supported on at least partially embedded within bumper body .

It will be appreciated that jounce bumper can be secured on or along an end member in any suitable manner. As identified in for example base plate of end member is shown as including one or more securement features such as may take the form of a plurality of threaded holes for example. In such case a corresponding number of one or more securement devices such as one or more threaded fasteners for example can extend through one of a corresponding number of holes openings or other features of the jounce bumper or a component thereof e.g. mounting plate to secure the jounce bumper on or along the end member.

Gas spring assembly can also optionally include a complimentary component that may be dimensioned to or otherwise suitable for abuttingly engaging the jounce bumper or a component thereof e.g. wear plate . In the arrangement shown in gas spring assembly includes a bearing plate that is disposed in abutting engagement along surface of plate wall and is secured on or along end member . It will be appreciated that the bearing plate can be attached to the end member in any suitable manner. For example plate wall of end member can include one or more securement features such as threaded holes for example that as may be suitable for receiving a complimentary securement device such as a threaded fastener for example to secure the bearing plate on or along the end member.

As discussed above it will be appreciated that the ends of flexible spring member can be secured on along or otherwise interconnected between end members and in any suitable manner. As mentioned above for example gas spring assembly can include one or more bead retaining elements that engage at least a portion of the flexible spring member and maintain the flexible spring member in substantially fluid tight engagement with the corresponding end member e.g. end member . In some cases a bead retaining element such as bead retaining element for example could be used. Alternately one or more bead retaining features can be formed on or along another component of the gas spring assembly. For example in the arrangement shown in gas spring assembly includes a lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure that is configured to engage a portion of flexible spring member during lateral movement of end member relative to end member . Additionally lateral support element can optionally be adapted or otherwise configured to secured or otherwise support an end of a flexible wall such as end for example on or along an end member such as end member for example.

As identified in lateral support element includes an element wall in the form of an endless annular ring that extends radially between an inward or mounting portion and an outward or support portion . As illustrated in the cross sectional profile shown in element wall includes a bead retaining wall portion that extends in a radially inward direction from along mounting portion . In some cases bead retaining wall portion can have a somewhat hook shaped cross sectional profile and can in some cases form an innermost radial extent of the lateral support element. In a preferred arrangement bead retaining wall portion can retain end of flexible wall in abutting engagement with surface of plate wall .

Additionally it will be appreciated that lateral support element can be secured on or along end member in any suitable manner. As one example lateral support element can include a plurality of holes or openings extending therethrough that are disposed in spaced relation to one another about element wall such as in peripherally spaced relation to one another along mounting portion thereof for example. In such case plate wall of end member can include a corresponding plurality of holes or openings HLS that together with holes are dimensioned to receive one of a plurality of securement devices such as threaded fastener and threaded nut assemblies for example. In this manner lateral support element can be secured on end member and flexible spring member can be operatively secured to the end member such that a substantially fluid tight seal can be formed therebetween.

With further reference to element wall of lateral support element is shown as including a mounting surface that is dimensioned or otherwise configured to abuttingly engage an associated component or structural feature such as plate wall of end member for example. Element wall also includes an outer surface along support portion that can have any suitable shape and or configuration such as a frustoconical shape for example. Element wall can include an outer peripheral wall portion that in some cases can at least partially define an outermost peripheral extent of lateral support element . The element wall e.g. element wall of a lateral support element such as lateral support element for example can further include a support surface having a cross sectional profile suitable for operatively engaging and at least partially supporting either directly or indirectly the flexible wall of the gas spring assembly during lateral i.e. transverse movement of the end members relative to one another.

As identified in element wall of lateral support element includes a support surface that is shown as facing in a direction generally opposite mounting surface and or outer surface . In a preferred arrangement element wall is positioned such that at least a portion of support surface can abuttingly engage a portion of flexible spring member during lateral i.e. transverse movement of end member relative to end member . It will be appreciated that lateral support elements having support surfaces with cross sectional profiles of a variety of shapes sizes and configurations have been developed and are commonly used such as may be suitable for contributing to certain lateral performance characteristics of a gas spring assembly for example. As such it will be appreciated that a support surface having a cross sectional profile of any suitable size shape and or configuration could be used.

In the arrangement shown in support surface is shown as including a surface profile portion that extends transverse to axis AX and in approximate alignment with mounting surface such that an annularly extending approximately planar area is formed along a radially inward portion of support surface . Support surface is also shown as including a surface profile portion that extends radially outward from along surface profile portion at an angle not numbered relative to surface profile portion such that a frustoconically shaped area is formed along a radially outward portion of the support surface. In some cases the approximately planar annular area that is at least partially defined by surface profile portion can correspond to a relatively constant lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly such as may occur during relative lateral deflection of the end members in which at least a portion of flexible spring member contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the approximately planar area. And in some cases a forward or positive taper area can be at least partially defined by surface profile portion and can in some cases provide for increased lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly such as may occur during lateral deflection of the end members relative to one another under which at least a portion of flexible spring member contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the forward or positive taper area.

It will be appreciated that end members and are shown in in an approximately coaxial or aligned condition and are shown in as being moved in a lateral direction into an offset or laterally shifted condition such as is represented in by reference arrows MVT. Flexible spring member is shown as having an inside surface that at least partially defines spring chamber and an outside surface . It will be appreciated that under typical conditions of use at least a portion of outside surface of flexible spring member may be disposed on or along at least a portion of support surface of lateral support element . For example under conditions in which end members and are disposed toward a centered coaxial or otherwise at least approximately aligned condition such as is shown in for example an approximately uniform annular area of support surface can abuttingly engage a corresponding area of outside surface of flexible spring member . Such an approximately uniform annular area is shown in in the form of approximately equal cross sectional areas of contact CT on diametrically opposing sides of the support surface.

As end members and are laterally displaced relative to one another toward an offset or laterally shifted condition flexible spring member will separate from support surface along or otherwise around a first circumferential portion of lateral support element such as is shown and represented in by cross sectional area of contact CT. Additionally as end members and are laterally displaced relative to one another toward an offset or laterally shifted condition flexible spring member will come into increased contact with support surface along or otherwise around a second different circumferential portion of lateral support wall such as is shown and identified in by cross sectional area of contact CT which is illustrated as being greater than cross sectional area of contact CT. In many cases the first and second circumferential portions of support surface and or lateral support wall will be disposed generally opposite one another.

With further reference to a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure such as gas spring assembly for example can also include an interface between the outside surface of the flexible wall of the gas spring assembly e.g. outside surface of flexible wall of flexible spring member and a surface of the lateral support element of the gas spring assembly e.g. support surface of lateral support element that has reduced frictional properties and or characteristics i.e. a reduced friction interface in comparison with conventional constructions. In some cases one or more elements components and or materials could be disposed on along or otherwise between the flexible spring member and a surface of the lateral support element. For example gas spring assembly can include an interface that extends annularly about axis AX between support surface of lateral support element and outside surface of flexible wall and that is at least partially formed by a quantity of material that is deposited or otherwise applied along the outer surface of the flexible wall such as is represented in by dashed line . Additionally or in the alternative interface can be at least partially formed by a quantity of material could be deposited or otherwise applied along at least a portion of support surface of lateral support element such as is represented in by solid line .

It will be appreciated that the quantity of material represented by lines and can be in any suitable form and or of any suitable consistency and can include compounds and or compositions of any suitable type and or kind. For example and without being limiting in some cases quantity of material and or could take the form of a liquid semi solid or solid lubricant or other friction reducing compound such as a grease for example. In such case the material s could be in form of a layer that extends approximately uniformly about axis AX such as in a continuous annular manner or in a discontinuous or otherwise segmented configuration. Additionally or in the alternative quantity of material and or could take the form of a surface treatment of at least a portion of the element wall and or the outer surface of the flexible wall. In some cases the surface treatment can include coating of a low friction material that is affixed to at least a portion of the support surface and or the outer surface of the flexible wall. Such a manner of forming a friction reduced interface e.g. interface may in some cases minimize or at least reduce issues that may arise in connection with the migration of and or adhesion of foreign materials to layers of liquid semi solid and in some cases solid lubricants. Examples of friction reducing materials can include polymeric coatings such as PTFE based resins and or nearly frictionless carbon NFC coatings for example. In some cases the quantity of material e.g. quantity of material and or can be formed from any material or combination of materials capable of generating or otherwise forming a comparatively reduced coefficient of friction between the material of the flexible wall e.g. flexible wall and the material of the element wall e.g. element wall relative to an un treated interface therebetween.

An alternate embodiment of an interface in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure is illustrated in in which lateral support element of has been replaced with a lateral support element which has an alternate construction to that of lateral support element . It will be appreciated that though not shown in quantities of material and or can optionally be used together with lateral support element to form an interface having reduced frictional properties and or characteristics i.e. a reduced friction interface in comparison with conventional constructions. As shown in however interface is shown as being formed between lateral support element and flexible wall of gas spring assembly .

As illustrated in the cross sectional profile in lateral support element includes an element wall in the form of an endless annular ring that extends radially between an inward or mounting portion and an outward or support portion . Element wall also includes a bead retaining wall portion that extends in a radially inward direction from along mounting portion . In some cases bead retaining wall portion can have a somewhat hook shaped cross sectional profile and can in some cases form an innermost radial extent of the lateral support element. In a preferred arrangement bead retaining wall portion can retain at least a portion of end of flexible wall e.g. mounting bead in abutting engagement with surface of plate wall .

Additionally it will be appreciated that lateral support element can be secured on or along end member in any suitable manner. As one example lateral support element can include a plurality of holes or openings only one of which is shown in extending therethrough that are disposed in spaced relation to one another about element wall such as in peripherally spaced relation to one another along mounting portion thereof for example. In such case plate wall of end member can include a corresponding plurality of holes or openings HLS that together with holes are dimensioned to receive securement devices such as threaded fastener and threaded nut assemblies for example. In this manner lateral support element can be secured on end member and flexible spring member can be operatively secured to the end member such that a substantially fluid tight seal can be formed therebetween.

With further reference to element wall of lateral support element is shown as including a mounting surface that is dimensioned or otherwise configured to abuttingly engage an associated component or structural feature such as plate wall of end member for example. Element wall also includes an outer surface along support portion that can have any suitable shape and or configuration such as a frustoconical shape for example. Element wall can include an outer peripheral wall portion that in some cases can at least partially define an outermost peripheral extent of lateral support element . The element wall e.g. element wall of a lateral support element such as lateral support element for example can further include a support surface having a cross sectional profile suitable for operatively engaging and at least partially supporting either directly or indirectly the flexible spring member of the gas spring assembly during lateral i.e. transverse movement of the end members relative to one another.

It will be appreciated that a lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure e.g. lateral support element and or can include any suitable combination of one or more components and or elements which can be formed from any suitable material or combination of materials. As one example the element wall of the lateral support element could be primarily formed from a reduced friction material such as a rigid or semi rigid thermoplastic material e.g. polyethylene polypropylene and or polyamide . In some cases the lateral support element can optionally include one or more reinforcing elements or structures such as could be disposed on along or at least partially embedded within the element wall thereof such as may be useful for providing increased axial rigidity and or structural integrity of the lateral support element which may be beneficial for minimizing or at least reducing axial deflection of the element wall during use in operation. One example of a reinforcing element or structure is shown in as being substantially entirely embedded within element wall can be formed as a comparatively thin walled component that is formed from a comparatively rigid material such as a reinforced thermoplastic e.g. glass filled polyamide or a metal material e.g. steel for example.

As another example the element wall of the lateral support element could be primarily formed from a substantially rigid material such as a metal material e.g. steel or aluminum or a reinforced or high strength thermoplastic e.g. glass filled polyamide . Alternately a somewhat less rigid material could be used together with a reinforcing element or structure such as reinforcing structure for example. Additionally a lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure can optionally include one or more friction reducing wall section that are at least partially embedded or otherwise disposed along one or more surfaces of the element wall. As illustrated in element wall of lateral support element can optionally include a reduced friction wall section such as in the form of an annular insert for example that is at least partially embedded within element wall . In the arrangement shown reduced friction wall section includes opposing sides and that extend radially between opposing edges and . It will be appreciated however that other configurations and or arrangements could alternately be used. Reduced friction wall section can be supported or otherwise retained on or along element wall in any suitable manner such as by way of one or more mechanical fasteners e.g. threaded fasteners one or more flowed material joints e.g. adhesive and or welded connections and or by co molding or over molding the element wall and the reduced friction wall section together for example.

Additionally it will be appreciated that reduced friction wall section can be formed from any suitable material or combination of materials having a comparatively reduced coefficient of friction relative to the material of element wall . Examples of such materials can include polymeric materials such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and PTFE based resins for example and nearly frictionless carbon NFC coatings disposed along a substrate or base material e.g. a metal or ceramic material for example. It will be appreciated however that other materials and or combinations of materials can be used without departing from the subject matter of the present disclosure.

As identified in element wall of lateral support element includes a support surface that is shown as facing in a direction generally opposite mounting surface and or outer surface . In a preferred arrangement element wall is positioned such that at least a portion of support surface can abuttingly engage a portion of flexible spring member during lateral i.e. transverse movement of end member relative to end member . It will be appreciated that lateral support elements having support surfaces with cross sectional profiles of a variety of shapes sizes and configurations have been developed and are commonly used such as may be suitable for contributing to certain lateral performance characteristics of a gas spring assembly for example. As such it will be appreciated that a support surface having a cross sectional profile of any suitable size shape and or configuration could be used.

In the arrangement shown in support surface is shown as including a surface profile portion that extends transverse to axis AX and in approximate alignment with mounting surface such that an annularly extending approximately planar area is formed along a radially inward portion of support surface . Support surface is also shown as including a surface profile portion that extends radially outwardly from along surface profile portion at an angle not numbered relative to surface profile portion such that a frustoconically shaped area is formed along a radially outward portion of the support surface. In some cases the approximately planar annular area that is at least partially defined by surface profile portion can correspond to a relatively constant lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly such as may occur during relative lateral deflection of the end members in which at least a portion of flexible wall contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the approximately planar area. And in some cases a forward or positive taper area can be at least partially defined by surface profile portion and can in some cases provide for increased lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly such as may occur during lateral deflection of the end members relative to one another under which at least a portion of flexible wall contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the forward or positive taper area.

It will be recognized from that surface profile portion can in some cases be at least partially from side or surface of reduced friction wall section . Additionally or in the alternative it will be recognized that surface profile portion can in some cases be at least partially formed from side or surface of reduced friction wall section . It will be appreciated however that other configurations and or arrangements could alternately be used.

Generally a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure can include a friction reducing member either as a part of the lateral support element i.e. bead skirt or between the lateral support element and the flexible spring member to provide a surface on which the flexible wall can slide without significant wear. In some cases the angle of the bearing surface of the lateral support element may be reduced relative to the plane of the end member e.g. bead plate to further reduce friction. As a result a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure can allow a certain amount of lateral movement while reducing friction and wear on the flexible spring member which may in some cases minimize or at least reduce the possibility of performance degradation of the flexible wall in addition to reducing the lateral spring rate of the gas spring assembly. As discussed above the friction reducing member can be an integral part of the bottom sleeve facing surface of the lateral support element such that the friction reducing member may be formed with the bead skirt as a single unit. Alternatively as discussed above the friction reducing member may be a component formed separate from the bead skirt and position between the sleeve facing surface of the bead skirt and the flexible spring member. The friction reducing member may be formed from any low friction material such as sintered porous metal inundated with lubricant thermoplastics e.g. UHMW polyethylene PTFE based resins Teflon and nearly frictionless carbon NFC coatings and or films such as may be applied on or along substrates formed from steel aluminum and or titanium alloys glass ceramics and or hard high temperature plastics for example.

Another example of a gas spring assembly in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure such as may be suitable for use as one or more of gas spring assemblies in for example is shown as gas spring assembly in . The gas spring assembly has a longitudinal axis AX and includes an end member an end member spaced longitudinally from end member and a flexible spring member or sleeve that extends peripherally about the longitudinal axis and is secured between the end members to at least partially define a spring chamber .

Gas spring assembly can be disposed between associated sprung and unsprung masses of an associated vehicle in any suitable manner. For example one end member can be operatively connected to an associated sprung mass with the other end member disposed toward and operatively connected to the associated unsprung mass. In the embodiment shown in for example end member is secured on or along structural component SC such as an associated vehicle body in for example and can be secured thereon in any suitable manner. As another example end member is secured on or along structural component SC such as an associated rail bogie in for example and can be secured thereon in any suitable manner.

In the exemplary arrangement in end member is shown as taking the form of a top plate having a plate wall that has opposing surfaces and such that a plate height not identified is at least partially defined therebetween. Plate wall is shown as being generally planar and extending outwardly to an outer periphery . In some cases plate wall can have a generally circular shape such that an outer peripheral surface extending in a heightwise direction can have a generally cylindrical shape. A passage surface at least partially defines a gas transfer passage extending through the end member such that pressurized gas can be transferred into and out of spring chamber such as by way of pneumatic system for example. In some cases the end member can include a projection or boss that extends from along plate wall in a longitudinal direction. In the exemplary arrangement shown in projection extends axially outwardly away from spring chamber .

As mentioned above one or more securement devices not shown can be used to secure or otherwise interconnect the end members of the gas spring assembly with corresponding structural components. In some cases projection can include an outer surface that is dimensioned for receipt within a passage or mounting hole MHL that extends through structural component SC. Additionally one or more sealing elements can optionally be included that are disposed between or otherwise at least partially form a substantially fluid tight connection between the end member and the structural component such as between projection and mounting hole MHL for example. In some cases structural component SC can optionally at least partially define an external reservoir suitable for storing a quantity of pressurized gas.

End member is shown as taking the form of an assembly that includes a support base or pedestal and a base plate that is secured on or along the pedestal in a suitable manner such as by way of a flowed material joint for example. Pedestal extends axially between opposing ends and and includes an outer surface that extends peripherally about axis AX and an end surface that is disposed along end and is dimensioned or otherwise configured for operative engagement with an associated structural component such as structural component SC for example. It will be appreciated that end member can be secured on or along the associated structural component in any suitable manner. As one example pedestal can include a plurality of securement features such as threaded passages that extend inwardly into the pedestal from along end surface for example. In some cases a corresponding number of one or more holes or passages HLS can extend through structural component SC that are dimensioned for receipt of a securement device such as a threaded fastener for example. It will be appreciated however that other configurations and or arrangements could alternately be used.

Base plate can have a plate wall not numbered that has opposing surfaces and such that a plate height not identified is at least partially defined therebetween. Base plate is shown as being generally planar and extending outwardly to an outer periphery . In some cases base plate can have a generally circular shape such that an outer peripheral surface extending in a heightwise direction can have a generally cylindrical shape. Additionally in some cases base plate can optionally include an endless annular recess or groove that extends axially inwardly into the base plate from along surface thereof. It will be appreciated that such a groove if provided can be of any suitable size shape configuration and or arrangement. For example groove is shown as being at least partially defined by a bottom surface an inner side surface and an outer side surface . In a preferred arrangement groove can be dimensioned to at least partially receive a portion of flexible spring member and one or more retaining elements such as may be used to secure the flexible spring member on or along the base plate for example.

Flexible spring member can be of any suitable size shape construction and or configuration. As one example flexible spring member can include a flexible wall that is at least partially formed from one or more layers or plies not identified of elastomeric material e.g. natural rubber synthetic rubber and or thermoplastic elastomer and can optionally include one or more plies or layers of filament reinforcing material not shown . Flexible wall is shown extending in a longitudinal direction between opposing ends and . In some cases flexible wall can optionally include a mounting bead dispose along either one or both of ends and . In the arrangement shown in mounting beads and are shown as being respectively disposed along ends and . In some cases the mounting beads can optionally include a reinforcing element such as an endless annular bead core for example.

It will be appreciated that the ends of flexible spring member can be secured on along or otherwise interconnected between end members and in any suitable manner. As one example gas spring assembly can include one or more bead retaining elements that engage at least a portion of the flexible spring member and maintain the flexible spring member in substantially fluid tight engagement with the corresponding end member e.g. end member . In the arrangement shown in end of flexible wall is disposed in abutting engagement with bottom surface of groove in base plate . A bead retaining element such as in the form of an endless annular ring for example captures at least a portion of mounting bead and is shown as being secured on or along base plate by way of a plurality of securement devices such as for example threaded fastener not numbered and threaded nut not numbered combinations that extend through at least approximately aligned holes or slots not numbered in the base plate and in the bead retaining element.

Typically at least a portion of flexible spring member will extend radially outward beyond outer periphery of base plate . In some cases end member can include an outer support wall that can optionally extend peripherally around or otherwise along base plate such as from along the plate wall of the base plate and in a direction toward end of pedestal . In such cases flexible spring member can extend along an outer surface of outer support wall such that a rolling lobe is formed along the flexible spring member. Outer surface is shown in as having a generally cylindrical shape and rolling lobe can be displaceable along the outer surface as the gas spring assembly is axially displaced between extended and compressed conditions such as may occur during dynamic use in operation. It will be appreciated that other shapes and or configurations of outer support wall and or outer surface can alternately be used such as may be useful to provide desired performance characteristics for example.

As is well known in the art it is generally desirable to avoid or at least minimize contact between end members of a gas spring assembly such as may occur due to variations in load conditions and or upon deflation of the gas spring assembly for example. As such gas spring assembly is shown in as including a jounce bumper that is disposed within spring chamber and supported on end member . As identified in jounce bumper is shown as including a mounting plate that is disposed in abutting engagement with end member a bumper body supported on the mounting plate and a wear plate that is supported on at least partially embedded within bumper body .

It will be appreciated that jounce bumper can be secured on or along an end member in any suitable manner. As identified in for example base plate of end member is shown as including one or more securement features such as may take the form of a plurality of threaded holes for example. In such case a corresponding number of one or more securement devices such as one or more threaded fasteners for example can extend through one of a corresponding number of holes openings or other features of the jounce bumper or a component thereof e.g. mounting plate to secure the jounce bumper on or along the end member.

Gas spring assembly can also optionally include a complimentary component that may be dimensioned to or otherwise suitable for abuttingly engaging the jounce bumper or a component thereof e.g. wear plate . In the arrangement shown in gas spring assembly includes a bearing plate that is disposed in abutting engagement along surface of plate wall and is secured on or along end member . It will be appreciated that the bearing plate can be attached to the end member in any suitable manner. For example plate wall of end member can include one or more securement features such as threaded holes for example that as may be suitable for receiving a complimentary securement device such as a threaded fastener for example to secure the bearing plate on or along the end member.

As discussed above it will be appreciated that the ends of flexible spring member can be secured on along or otherwise interconnected between end members and in any suitable manner. As mentioned above for example gas spring assembly can include one or more bead retaining elements that engage at least a portion of the flexible spring member and maintain the flexible spring member in substantially fluid tight engagement with the corresponding end member e.g. end member . In some cases a bead retaining element such as bead retaining element for example could be used. Alternately one or more bead retaining features can be formed on or along another component of the gas spring assembly. For example in the arrangement shown in gas spring assembly includes a lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure that is configured to engage a portion of flexible spring member during lateral movement of end member relative to end member . Additionally lateral support element can optionally be adapted or otherwise configured to secure or otherwise support an end of a flexible wall such as end for example on or along an end member such as end member for example.

As identified in lateral support element includes an element wall in the form of an endless annular ring that extends radially between an inward or mounting portion and an outward or support portion . As illustrated in the cross sectional profile shown in element wall includes a bead retaining wall portion that extends in a radially inward direction from along mounting portion . Bead retaining wall portion can have a somewhat hook shaped cross sectional profile and can in some cases form an innermost radial extent of the lateral support element. In a preferred arrangement bead retaining wall portion can retain end of flexible wall in abutting engagement with surface of plate wall .

Additionally it will be appreciated that lateral support element can be secured on or along end member in any suitable manner. As one example lateral support element can include a plurality of holes or openings extending therethrough that are disposed in spaced relation to one another about element wall such as in peripherally spaced relation to one another along mounting portion thereof for example. In such case plate wall of end member can include a corresponding plurality of holes or openings HLS that together with holes are dimensioned to receive one of a plurality of securement devices such as threaded fastener and threaded nut assemblies for example. In this manner lateral support element can be secured on end member and flexible spring member can be operatively secured to the end member such that a substantially fluid tight seal can be formed therebetween.

With further reference to element wall of lateral support element is shown as including a mounting surface that is dimensioned or otherwise configured to abuttingly engage an associated component or structural feature such as plate wall of end member for example. Element wall also includes an outer surface along support portion that can have any suitable shape and or configuration such as a frustoconical shape for example. Element wall can include an outer peripheral wall portion that in some cases can at least partially define an outermost peripheral extend to lateral support element . A lateral support element in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure also includes a support surface having a cross sectional profile suitable for improving stability and or control of the gas spring assembly during lateral i.e. transverse movement of the end members relative to one another.

As identified in element wall of lateral support element includes a support surface that is positioned to abuttingly engage a portion of flexible spring member during lateral i.e. transverse movement of end member relative to end member and thereby at least partially form another example of an interface in accordance with the subject matter of the present disclosure. It will be appreciated that end members and are shown in in an approximately coaxial or aligned condition and are shown in as being moved in a lateral direction into an offset or laterally shifted condition such as is represented in by reference arrows MVT. It will be appreciated that in a preferred embodiment flexible spring member is separated or otherwise spaced apart from at least a portion of support surface of lateral support element when end members and are disposed toward a neutral centered coaxial or otherwise at least approximately aligned condition such as is shown and identified in by arrows SP for example. As end members and are laterally displaced relative to one another toward an offset or laterally shifted condition flexible wall will further separate from support surface along or otherwise around a first circumferential portion of lateral support element such as is shown and identified in by arrow SP. Additionally as end members and are laterally displaced relative to one another toward an offset or laterally shifted condition flexible wall will come into increased contact with support surface along or otherwise around a second different circumferential portion of lateral support wall such as is shown and identified in by arrow NSP. In many cases the first and second circumferential portions of support surface and or lateral support wall will be disposed generally opposite one another.

With further reference to support surface includes a cross sectional profile having two or more sections or portions that extend peripherally about element wall of lateral support element . Support surface at least partially defines an annular groove or cavity that extends into element wall such as is illustrated by reference line RLN that extends in a direction generally transverse e.g. perpendicular to axis AX and or in approximate alignment with mounting surface .

In the arrangement shown in the cross sectional profile of support surface can optionally include a first profile section that extends from a first profile point toward a second profile point and forms a reverse or negative taper area that extends annularly around element wall . In a preferred arrangement first profile section can have an approximately linear shape and can extend from point toward point at an angle AG relative to reference line RLN. In such case the reverse or negative taper area formed along element wall can have an approximately frustoconical shape. Generally the reverse or negative taper area that is at least partially defined by first profile section can in some cases provide for reduced lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly such as may occur during lateral deflection of the end members relative to one another under which at least a portion of flexible wall contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the reverse or negative taper area.

The cross sectional profile of support surface can also optionally include a second profile section that extends from approximately second profile point toward a third profile point and forms a sustaining load area that extends annularly around element wall . In a preferred arrangement second profile section can have a radial or otherwise curvilinear shape. In such case the sustaining load area formed along element wall can have a curved annular shape. Generally the sustaining load area that is at least partially defined by second profile section can in some cases provide for a relatively constant lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly as relative lateral deflection of the end members occurs such that at least a portion of flexible wall contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the sustaining load area. It will be appreciated that the lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly during contact along second profile section may vary within a range that is substantially reduced from the variations in lateral stiffness associated with the negative taper area. As one example a variation of less than percent of the total variation of the negative taper area could be provided by the sustaining load area.

The cross sectional profile of support surface can also optionally include a third profile section that extends from approximately third profile point toward a fourth profile point and forms a returning curvature area that extends annularly around element wall . In a preferred arrangement third profile section can have a radial or otherwise curvilinear shape. In such case the returning curvature area formed along element wall can have a curved annular shape. Generally the returning curvature area that is at least partially defined by third profile section can in some cases provide for an increasing lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly as relative lateral deflection of the end members occurs such as when at least a portion of flexible wall contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the returning curvature area.

While both profile sections are described as including a radial or otherwise curvilinear shape it will be appreciated that second profile section and third profile section differ in at least two respects. As one example second profile section is shown as extending between profile points and that are disposed in approximate alignment with one another with respect to reference line RLN. Additionally second profile section has a distal extent that is spaced a first distance from profile points and as is represented in by reference dimension D.

Whereas third profile section is shown as extending between profile points and that are disposed in axially spaced relation to one another as is represented in by reference dimension D.

It has been determined that variations in relative positions along support surface in the axial direction can generally correspond to variations in lateral stiffness. As such the minimal overall variation in axial position along second profile section as represented by dimension D can roughly correspond to a minimal or nearly constant lateral stiffness along the second profile section. Accordingly the greater overall variation in axial position along third profile section as represented by dimension D can roughly correspond to a significant increase in lateral stiffness along the third profile section in the direction from third point toward fourth point .

As a second example second profile section is shown as including a center of curvature CV that is disposed along a side of lateral support element from along which cavity extends into element wall . Whereas third profile section is shown as including a center of curvature CV that is disposed along an opposing side of lateral support element such as may be adjacent mounting surface for example. As such the rate of change of profile sections and differ as the flexible wall is displaced laterally therealong in a direction from first profile point toward fourth profile point . Additionally it will be appreciated that the radial or otherwise curved shape of profile sections and can take the form of suitable geometric configuration whether regular or irregular and can vary along the respective lengths thereof.

In some cases the cross sectional profile of support surface can also optionally include a fourth profile section extends from approximately fourth profile point toward an outermost peripheral point . In some cases a transition section can extend from approximately fourth profile point to a fifth profile point with fourth profile section extending from approximately fifth profile point toward outermost peripheral point . In a preferred arrangement fourth profile section if included can have an approximately linear shape and can extend at an angle AG relative to reference line RLN. In such case a forward or positive taper area can be formed along element wall that can have an approximately frustoconical shape. Generally the forward or positive taper area that is at least partially defined by fourth profile section can in some cases provide for further increased lateral stiffness of the gas spring assembly such as may occur during lateral deflection of the end members relative to one another under which at least a portion of flexible wall contacts or otherwise abuttingly engages a portion of the forward or positive taper area.
