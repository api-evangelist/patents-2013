title: Mechanism to initiate calls between browsers without predefined call signaling protocol
abstract: An apparatus comprising a processor configured to receive an instruction to place a call to a remote user, load a communications application, wherein the communications application comprises an isolated security context, request a list of one or more supported communications protocols from a server, receive the list of one or more supported communications protocols from the server, select a protocol from the list of one or more supported communications protocols, load the selected communications protocol in the isolated security context, and initiate the call through the communications application with the remote server using the selected communications protocol.

Multimedia calls and teleconferences e.g. video calls video chats and Peer to Peer P2P file sharing sessions using web applications e.g. web browsers are increasing in popularity. Web applications may initiate calls to each other based on World Wide Web Consortium W3C Web Real Time Communications WebRTC Application Programming Interfaces APIs using the same Call Signaling Protocol CSP without difficulty. However a plurality of non standardized CSP protocols exist and consequently some web applications may attempt WebRTC using conflicting CSPs e.g. WebRTC Offer Answer Protocol ROAP WebSocket WS Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP Jingle Session Initiation Protocol SIP H.323 Media Gateway Control Protocol MGCP or CSPs specific to the communications web site. Conflicting CSPs typically results in an inability to engage in WebRTC communications.

As a result applications with conflicting CSPs cannot initiate calls unless a previously agreed upon CSP is used for the call which may be problematic in a number of circumstances. A WebRTC communications initiator caller may generally ensure CSP interoperability by using a CSP provided by a WebRTC communications recipient callee to call the callee. However this may lead to phishing attacks in open web since using a callee CSP may place the entire browser under the control of the callee web application and may render it difficult for the caller s web browser to enforce security norms. In a phishing context a callee web application asks a caller to log into an XMPP server using the caller s Jabber Identifier JID and password. In a non trustworthiness context a government agency caller wants to alert a plurality of callees regarding an imminent natural disaster or other emergency. In such cases the callees may be willing to use the CSP of the callers but not vice versa.

Browser negotiation of CSPs using standard names e.g. Uniform Resource Identifiers URIs or interface specifications may not be desired for a variety of reasons. For example standard names may not be desired because they require developing standard protocols and developing standard protocols may take years to develop. Further standard names may require extensive interoperability testing namely N N pairwise coordinated number of tests to verify functionality and may ultimately only ensure interoperability to the extent of the tested cases. Consequently an alternate solution may be preferred.

In one aspect the disclosure includes an apparatus comprising a processor configured to receive an instruction to place a call to a remote user load a communications application wherein the communications application comprises an isolated security context request a list of one or more supported communications protocols from a server receive the list of one or more supported communications protocols from the server select a protocol from the list of one or more supported communications protocols load the selected communications protocol in the isolated security context and initiate the call through the communications application with the remote server using the selected communications protocol.

In another aspect the disclosure includes a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions stored on a non transitory medium that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform the following load a communications application in a web browser send a request for a supported communications protocol list to a site receive the supported communications protocol list from the site wherein the supported communications protocol list contains a communications protocol send a request for a library supporting the communications protocol to the site receive the library supporting the communications protocol from the site send a communications offer encoded according to the communications protocol and receive an answer encoded according to the communications protocol.

In yet another aspect the disclosure includes a method for initiating calls between browsers without predefined CSPs comprising implementing a CSP state machine at a first browser requesting a CSP library for a CSP from a first server receiving and loading the CSP library sending an offer to a second server wherein the offer is encoded according to the CSP receiving an answer from the second server wherein the answer is encoded according to the CSP and transmitting data to a second browser according to the CSP wherein the data comprises voice data video data or both.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below the disclosed systems and or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

The disclosure describes systems and methods to guarantee the WebRTC applications from different sites use an interoperable CSP without the existence of any standard CSP. The disclosure describes such mechanisms and protocols to negotiate CSP JavaScript code and execute it in isolated security contexts such that interoperability is guaranteed with controlled security. Stated another way the disclosure describes an architecture to separate a CSP layer resource or module from the rest of a WebRTC application use the CSP layer resource or module to implement a CSP state machine in JavaScript and sanction data transmissions between web applications. Using the disclosed systems and methods may provide inter alia reduced costs of interoperability tests since only N independent tests are needed for N CSP implementations rather than N N pairwise coordinated tests where N is a whole number increased interoperability since the applications may use identical CSP JavaScript code rather than different implementations of the same CSP increased security through enforced and controlled mechanisms and flexibility since the modular design permits CSP code to be changed without impacting other parts of web applications.
