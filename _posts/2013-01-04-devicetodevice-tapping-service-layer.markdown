The description may use the phrases in an embodiment or in embodiments which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore the terms comprising including having and the like as used with respect to embodiments of the present disclosure are synonymous.

As used herein the term module may refer to be part of or include an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC an electronic circuit a processor shared dedicated or group and or memory shared dedicated or group that execute one or more software or firmware programs a combinational logic circuit and or other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As used herein computer implemented method may refer to any method executed by one or more processors a computer system having one or more processors a mobile device such as a smart phone which may include one or more processors a tablet laptop computer a set top box a gaming console and so forth.

Referring now to a first computing device may have three resources Resource A Resource B and Resource C available for sharing. A computing device may have more or less resources three resources are shown here for illustrative purposes only. A second computing device may include Resource D Resource E and Resource F for sharing. Second computing device may be in communication with first computing device via a local area network . Local area network may take various forms such as a wireless network provided by a wireless access point not shown a wired network or a combination of the two. A third computing device may include Resource G Resource H and Resource I for sharing. Third computing device may be in communication with first and second computing devices and via a wide area network such as the Internet.

Resources A I may be various types of physical and or logical resources found on various computing devices. They may include but are not limited to mice keyboards keypads microphones touch screen displays fingerprint readers scanners retinal readers microphones cameras wired and wireless displays remote controls light emitting diodes LEDs printing devices speakers sensors e.g. to measure temperature gyroscopes global positioning system GPS components compasses storage capacity e.g. hard drives flash memory RAM ROM processing power e.g. processors processor cores chipsets graphics processors wired communication interfaces e.g. Ethernet wireless communication interfaces e.g. antennas for sending receiving WiMAX LTE BlueTooth WiFi etc. simple messaging services SMS interfaces phone dialers backhauling links e.g. a mobile hotspot secure execution environments or any other resource that may be under the control of a computing device. Computing devices and may be configured to implement techniques described herein to share resources such as Resources A I.

Referring to first computing device may include a communication stack that includes an application layer a device to device D2D tapping service DTS layer an in device services layer and a network layer . In device services layer may provide access to resources that are available locally on first computing device . DTS layer may provide transparent access to resources that may not be available locally on first computing device . In various embodiments DTS layer may be at a lowest layer of communication stack above network layer . In various embodiments network layer may include a network interface card driver. Other computing devices such as second computing device and third computing device may include similar communication stacks.

For instance assume an application executing in application layer seeks access to a resource. In various embodiments application may first request access to the resource from in device services layer . In some embodiments application may instead direct the request to DTS layer which may first inquire with in device services layer as to the availability of the requested resource locally. In either case if the resource is available locally in device services layer may provide access to the resource to application or DTS layer . However if the resource is not available locally at first computing device then DTS layer may be configured to locate the requested resource elsewhere on remote computing devices and to provide transparent access to the resource to application . As used herein transparent access may mean that from a perspective of application there may be little or no observable difference between when a resource is accessed locally or from a remote computing device.

Application may request access to resources from DTS layer and or in device services layer in various ways. In various embodiments DTS layer may be exposed directly to application via high level programming scripting or markup languages such as JavaScript hypertext markup language HTML or cascading style sheets CSS . In various embodiments DTS layer may be exposed to application abstractly e.g. with other device interfaces such as a device application programming interface API from the World Wide Web Consortium W3C or one or more Webinos. In various embodiments application may utilize a combination of technologies from both and .

If it is determined e.g. by DTS layer that the resource sought by application is not available on first computing device then in various embodiments DTS layer may be configured to issue a request for the resource e.g. through network layer of communication stack . This request may be issued to remote computing devices such as second computing device or third computing device . In various embodiments DTS layer may thereafter cooperate with a responsive remote computing device to provide application transparent access to the resource.

In various embodiments the request for the resource issued by DTS layer may take the form of a domain name system DNS request. For example DTS layer may generate a DNS Service Discovery DNS SD message that may include for instance a request for DNS SRV TXT and or PRT records as described in Request for Comments 2782 published in February 2000 by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF . As will be described below this DNS request may be further formed by DTS layer based on whether the resource is likely to be available on or would be useful only if available on a computing device within a vicinity of first computing device .

If when it is determined that Resource E is unavailable locally on first computing device then at DTS layer may determine whether the requested resource is likely to be available on and or would be useful only if available on another computing device within a vicinity of the computing device. Based on this determination DTS layer may issue the request for the resource accordingly.

For instance if it is determined e.g. by DTS layer that it is likely a computing device within a vicinity of first computing device such as second computing device has Resource E then at DTS layer may generate the DNS request in a multicast message. For example DTS layer may determine a likelihood that the requested resource is available on another computing device such as second computing device connected to a same local area network e.g. local area network as first computing device .

Additionally or alternatively DTS layer may determine that the resource would be useful only if available on a computing device within a vicinity of first computing device . Examples of such resources may include GPS devices a microphone a speaker or a display on which to render visual output none of which may be useful if obtained from a far away computing device.

Whether it is determined that the resource is likely to be available within a vicinity or whether the resource would be useful only if available within the vicinity at DTS layer may generate the DNS request in a multicast message. In various embodiments the multicast message may be a multicast domain name service mDNS message e.g. using a known Internet Protocol IP address such as 224.0.0.251.

If on the other hand it is determined at e.g. by DTS layer that the requested resource is not likely to be available on another computing device within a vicinity of the computing device and or the resource would be useful even if obtained from a more remote computing device then at DTS layer may be configured to generate the DNS request for the resource in a unicast message.

Whether or not the resource is available within the vicinity at the DNS request may be transmitted through network layer . Multicast messages may be transmitted to computing devices within a vicinity of first computing device such as computing devices of local area network . Unicast messages may be transmitted to a DNS server not shown which may forward requests to remote computing devices indicated in DNS records as having the requested resources. In various embodiments a DNS server may discover and maintain DNS records for resources available on various computing devices e.g. using technology such as DNS Update which is defined in Request for Comments 2136 published in April 1997 by the IETF. In various embodiments updates to DNS resource records may be authenticated using technology such as Transaction Signature or TSIG which is defined in Request for Comments 2845 published in May 2000 by the IETF.

At a remote computing device such as second computing device may determine that the resource requested at is available locally as is the case in . In various embodiments at second computing device may provide a DNS response indicating that it has the requested resource available for sharing. For example the DNS response at may be compliant with DNS SD and may include a service instance name e.g. DNS SRV TXT and or PRT record associated with Resource E. In various embodiments the DNS response may include a universal resource locator or URL associated with the resource.

Once the resource is located computing devices may share resources using a variety of protocols. In various embodiments such as that shown in computing devices may be configured to facilitate access to resources by applications using the hypertext transport protocol HTTP . In various embodiments computing devices may be configured to share resources using a Web Services paradigm in which each computing device may act both as an HTTP client e.g. when requesting a resource and as an HTTP server e.g. when providing access to a resource . In various embodiments computing devices may coordinate in a manner compliant with representational state transfer REST as described by the W3C in order to share resources. Thus in various embodiments computing devices e.g. 12 14 18 may exchange Web Services communications that are RESTful in that they may conform to REST constraints.

In various embodiments before sharing resources at DTS layer may receive from second computing device HTTP security information. HTTP security information may include configuration data that first computing device may use to access Resource E on second computing device . For example HTTP security information may include digital certificates e.g. X.609 or pre shared keys that may be used to establish a secure HTTP session.

DTS layer may then transmit at an HTTP request seeking access to the resource offered by second computing device . The HTTP request at may include a URL associated with the resource on second computing device . For example if application requests Resource E then DTS layer may include in the HTTP request a URL associated with Resource E e.g. http 1.12.23.5 Resource E. In various embodiments the HTTP request may be RESTful. If it turns out the requested resource is not available on the responding computing device e.g. Resource E has suddenly become unavailable then second computing device may send an HTTP response to first computing device that redirects first computing device to another computing device that has the resource available for sharing.

At second computing device may transmit to first computing device an HTTP response. In various embodiments this HTTP response may also be RESTful. In various embodiments the HTTP response may include data in the JavaScript Object Notation JSON or eXtensible Markup Language XML format that originates from and or contains data related to the requested resource. For example if Resource E on second computing device is a GPS then the RESTful HTTP response at may contain geographic coordinates e.g. a latitude and longitude in an XML or JSON message. In various embodiments DTS layer of first computing device may parse the received XML or JSON message and present it to the calling application at e.g. in the form of an API response.

The above described example is not limiting and is for illustrative purposes only. For some types of resources the HTTP request at and response at may supersede and or supplement the use of other protocols traditionally used for those resources. For example printers traditionally use one or more of a number of printing protocols e.g. line printer LPR the Internet Printing Protocol IPP AppSocket PhaserPort JetDirect Page Description Language PDL Port 9100 and so forth. Using techniques described herein and assuming Resource E is a printer an application e.g. executing on first computing device may submit a print job and DTS layer may submit a corresponding print job to second computing device using HTTP at . In such case the HTTP response at may be a confirmation of printing success.

The HTTP request and response may include other types of information and make take various forms. For example HTTP Live Streaming may be utilized if the shared resource is of a type that would require streaming. For example Resource E may be a multimedia file such as an MP3 audio file or digital video. In such case the HTTP request and response at may be one or more HTTP Live Streaming protocol requests and responses in which the requested multimedia file is streamed from second computing device to first computing device . As another example Resource E may be a streaming source e.g. an application that interfaces with an online streaming service to which application requests access. As another example Resource E may be a communication interface on second computing device such as a BlueTooth 802.11 WiFi or other wired or wireless interface through which first computing device may stream data.

Streaming may also be utilized where first computing device does not have hardware capable of rendering a particular type of file. For example first computing device may not have a display or may have a display that is incapable of displaying a particular visual file e.g. 3D . Resource E may be a display that is capable of displaying the visual file. After determining that second computing device has Resource E available for sharing DTS layer on first computing device may use the HTTP Live Streaming protocol to stream the visual file to second computing device where second computing device may render the visual file on its display Resource E . First computing device and second computing device may share other types of output components such as speakers or tactile feedback devices where one or the other does not have an appropriate output component for a particular type of file.

At block it may be determined e.g. by in device services layer and or DTS layer whether the resource requested is available locally e.g. on first computing device . If the answer is yes e.g. as may be indicated by in device services layer then at application may utilize the local resource using traditional means e.g. device API etc. .

However if the resource is not available locally then at it may be determined e.g. by DTS layer whether the resource is likely to be available and or would be useful only if available within a particular vicinity of a computing device executing the requesting application such as first computing device .

If it is determined e.g. by DTS layer that the resource is likely to be available or would be useful only if available on another computing device within a vicinity of the computing device then at block a request for the resource may be issued e.g. by DTS layer to computing devices within vicinity using a multicast e.g. mDNS message. Otherwise at block the request for the resource may be issued e.g. by DTS layer to computing devices outside of the vicinity e.g. to a DNS server in a unicast DNS message.

Either way at block an identifier associated with the resource e.g. URL service instance name may be received e.g. via network layer of first computing device . At block access to the resource by the requesting application e.g. application may be facilitated e.g. by DTS layer . For example as described above DTS layer may use HTTP to access the resource and may parse an HTTP response for presentation to application e.g. in the form of an API response.

At block a request for access to a resource may be received e.g. by second computing device . At block it may be determined e.g. by a DTS layer in second computing device whether the resource is available locally. If not then at block second computing device may not respond. However if the requested resource is available locally on second computing device then at block a DNS response may be issued e.g. by second computing device that may include an identifier e.g. a URL service instance name of the resource on second computing device .

At block HTTP security information e.g. whether the resource can only be accessed using secure means may be transmitted e.g. by second computing device to the requesting computing device. At block an HTTP request for the resource may be received e.g. by second computing device which may be in various formats such as JMOL or XML. At block an HTTP response e.g. in JMOL or XML format containing information pertinent to the requested resource e.g. geographic coordinates from a GPS may be transmitted e.g. by second computing device to the requesting computing device.
