title: Remote jettison disconnect system for a mine roller
abstract: A remote jettison system is provided to disconnect a mine roller from a tactical vehicle. The system enables personnel conducting mine roller operations to disengage the vehicle from the mine roller without leaving the vehicle. The remote jettison system has two assemblies: A mine roller assembly and a tactical vehicle assembly. The mine roller assembly, which is connected to the mine roller, can be remotely disconnected from the tactical vehicle assembly, which is mounted on the vehicle. The system utilizes one mechanized latch to release the mine roller assembly from the tactical vehicle assembly, allowing the force of gravity to cause them to separate.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.

The present invention relates generally to mine rollers and in particular to a system for remotely disconnecting a mine roller from a tactical vehicle.

Pushed mine rollers have historically been attached to the front of tactical vehicles which are driven along a road surface or other areas suspected of containing mines or IEDs in order to prematurely detonate the mines before they can cause serious damage to the tactical vehicles and injure personnel. For example the mine rollers have been mounted on M1 or M60 tanks modified with permanently attached mine roller mounting kits. Wheeled tactical vehicles such as heavily modified Humvees are more commonly used now in part because they are lighter and more energy efficient.

Current mine rollers are typically released from the tactical vehicles by manually pulling two steel pins having cotter pins on either end to keep the pins retained in the pad eyes of the mine roller system. The tongue load of the mine roller system MRS is applied to the pins and a forklift or crane is often required to take off the tongue load as that the pins can be pulled manually thereby disconnecting the MRS. Often it is necessary to disconnect the MRS after a system failure or when the MRS is damaged by a mine or IED blast. This is especially troublesome during combat operations when personnel can be exposed to extreme danger while attempting to disconnect the MRS so they can evacuate the area in the vehicle. Thus a need has been identified for a system that would allow operators to jettison the MRS from the vehicle remotely e.g. from inside the vehicle without exposing the operators to potentially dangerous enemy fire.

The invention is a remote jettison disconnect system RJDS for a mine roller. The typical mine roller has right and left arm pairs extending rearward from the mine roller for attaching to a tactical vehicle. The RJDS comprises two major assemblies A mine roller assembly which is attached to the arms of the mine roller and a tactical vehicle assembly which is attached to the tactical vehicle.

The mine roller assembly has an elongate strength member typically a steel tube with a pair of connection plates mounted thereon and spaced apart at a distance substantially equal to the center to center distance between the right and left arm pairs of the mine roller. The connection plates have through plate apertures and bolts are passed through the apertures and corresponding holes on the mine roller arm pairs to form a pivoting attachment of the mine roller to the connection plates.

The mine roller assembly has a pair of hitching plates mounted on the strength member at opposite ends thereof a pair of J hooking plates also mounted on opposite ends of the strength member and a pair of dual function plates also mounted on the strength member at opposite ends. The hitching plates J hooking plates and dual function plates all have rearward projecting sections with tapered arches that are sized and positioned to accept a pair of shafts installed on the tactical vehicle assembly as discussed below. The arches of all six plats are laterally aligned with each other i.e. the lateral centerlines of their arches are co linear so that they all will securely mount on the parallel co linear pair of shafts on the tactical vehicle assembly when the RJDS is assembled Each dual function plate additionally has a rearward projecting upper section having a latch pin extending laterally therefrom for engagement with either a latch or a stop on corresponding plates on the tactical vehicle assembly.

The tactical vehicle assembly also has an elongate strength member typically a steel tube that is approximately the same length as the mine roller assembly strength member. Mounting plates are mounted on opposite ends of the strength member and have rearward projecting sections with mounting holes for mounting the strength member to corresponding support brackets on the tactical vehicle. A pair of shaft mounting plates are mounted on opposite ends of the strength member and have forward projections with horizontal through plate apertures to accept corresponding parallel shafts.

A tetra function plate is mounted on one end of the tactical vehicle assembly strength member. The tetra function plate has a sloped inward curved inversion on its forward edge that forms a stop for accepting one of the latch pins on the mine roller assembly dual function plates. The tetra function plate also has a horizontal through plate aperture for accepting a corresponding shaft.

A latching assembly is mounted to the tactical vehicle strength member on the end opposite from the end where the tetra function plate is mounted. The latching assembly has a modified shaft plate mounted to the strength member. The modified shaft plate has a horizontal through plate aperture to accept one of the shafts. An actuator mounting panel is mounted on the modified shaft plate and has a latch inversion similarly sized and laterally aligned with the curved inversion of the tetra function plate to accept the other latch pin.

A geared inverted plate is rotatably mounted to the actuator mounting panel adjacent to the latch inversion. The geared inverted plate has a finger like extension which covers closes the entrance to the latch inversion and locks the latch pin in place when the system is assembled when the geared inverted plate is rotated in one direction and opens the entrance to the latch inversion allows insertion of or releases the latch pin when the geared inverted plate is rotated in the other direction.

A wheel gear is also rotatably mounted to the actuator mounting panel so that its gear teeth engage the gear teeth of the geared inverted plate. An electric actuator is coupled to the wheel gear and causes the wheel gear to rotate in response to electrical signals from a remote control box thereby causing the geared inverted plate to rotate and its finger like extension to retain release the latch pin from the latch inversion.

As referred to above the pair of shafts are inserted into apertures in corresponding plates. Specifically the first shaft passes through and is retained in the apertures in the forward projecting sections of the tetra function plate and an adjacent shaft mounting plate the second shaft passes through and is retained in the apertures in the forward projecting sections of the modified shaft plate and the other shaft mounting plate. When installed the shafts are substantially parallel to each other and to the strength members and they are substantially co linear. Each of the shafts has an inboard flange and an outboard flange to retain the shafts in the apertures. Each shaft also preferably has a covering sleeve that reduces friction and wear on the shaft.

Typically the remote control box is located within the tactical vehicle so that personnel can operate it and thus control the electric actuator without exiting the vehicle to release the latch pin thereby allowing the mine roller assembly and an attached mine roller to drop away from the tactical vehicle assembly under the force of gravity. In an exemplary embodiment the remote control box is hard wired to an electrical box which passes the control signals from the remote control box to the actuator. The electrical box also distributes electrical power from the vehicle to the actuator and also to electrical equipment on the mine roller.

When the RJDS is assembled the laterally aligned tapered arches on the hitching plates J hooking plates and dual function plates of the mine roller assembly engage and rest upon the shafts installed on the tactical vehicle assembly. One of the latch pins on a dual function plate on the mine roller assembly enters and abuts the stop formed by the sloped inward curved inversion of the tetra function plate on the tactical vehicle assembly. The other latch pin enters the latch inversion of the actuator mounting panel and is held therein by the finger like extension when the curved geared plate is rotated to the closed position by the actuator.

The invented remote jettison disconnect system RJDS provides in cab release of a mine roller mounted to a tactical vehicle thus eliminating the need for personnel to exit the vehicle and be exposed to hazardous conditions while disconnecting the mine roller. The system as shown in includes two assemblies A tactical vehicle assembly and a mine roller assembly . In the assemblies are connected. The tactical vehicle assembly is shown in greater detail in . The tactical vehicle assembly is mounted to a strength member front bumper using at least two pairs of support brackets . Holes are for head lamps not shown . The illustrated support brackets are mounted on the front and the bottom of the front bumper and are aligned to be mated to a pair of tactical vehicle mounting plates on tactical vehicle assembly . Each tactical vehicle mounting plate has an upper rear mounting hole and lower rear mounting hole for attaching the vehicle mounting plate to bumper as shown in . The tactical vehicle mounting plate has a mounting opening where the perimeter of the mounting opening is welded to the tactical vehicle elongate strength member at a location several inches from each end .

In the exemplary embodiment illustrated and described herein the tactical vehicle elongate strength member is a rectangular steel tube that is about three inches by about five inches having walls with a nominal thickness of about three eighths of an inch.

Adjacent to and outboard of each tactical vehicle mounting plate is a shaft mounting plate . Each shaft mounting plate is mounted on the tactical vehicle elongate strength member projecting forward substantially horizontal to the ground. As shown in each shaft mounting plate has a mounting opening where the perimeter of the mounting opening is welded to the tactical vehicle elongate strength member . The shaft mounting plate has a forward projection with a horizontal through plate aperture for receiving and supporting a segment of a shaft .

Adjacent to and outboard of the left tactical vehicle shaft mounting plate is a tetra function plate . Each tetra function plate has an open base for mounting on the tactical vehicle elongate strength member . Typically the open base is U shaped so that the tetra function plate can drop down on the rectangular tube shaped steel beam . The tetra function plate is secured with a base plate that fastens the tetra function plate to the tactical vehicle elongate strength member . An upper front edge portion of the tetra function plate curves upward. A lower front edge portion curves downward forming a sloped inward curved inversion with an open forward portion. The inversion functions as a stop for the outward depending heavy duty latch pin on a dual function plate on the mine roller assembly . A lower front edge portion of the tetra function plate has a through plate aperture for receiving and supporting a shaft . The middle and upper portions of the tetra function plate are normally used to mount an electrical box mounting plate see .

The electrical box mounting plate supports the electrical box which is in communication with the remote control box and the actuator . The control box is typically located inside the cab of the tactical vehicle not shown for clarity of illustration and controls the actuator via connections with the electrical box to provide in cab release of the mine roller assembly thus eliminating the need for personnel to exit the tactical vehicle. The electrical box effectively functions as a junction bow. It receives power from the tactical vehicle distributes power to the actuator as well as to the electronics on the mine roller itself and distributes signals between the control box and actuator .

As shown in and a latching assembly is mounted on the right side of the tactical vehicle assembly . An actuator for mechanized operation of a latch is mounted on an actuator mounting panel which is mounted to an upper portion of a modified shaft plate with a base plate . The modified shaft plate has an open base for mounting on the tactical vehicle elongate strength member . Typically the open base is U shaped so that the modified shaft plate can drop down on the rectangular tube shaped steel beam . The modified shaft plate is secured with the base plate . In a protective left side panel illustrated in is removed. The actuator can open or close a finger like extension of a geared curved plate rotating on axle . The geared curved plate is rotated by engaged wheel gear to control movement of the finger like extension into or out of the latch inversion on panel and latch inversion on plate . The inversion is substantially parallel to a segment of the shaft .

The shaft is supported by a lower portion of the modified shaft plate having a through plate aperture for receiving and supporting the shaft. An entering upper portion of panel of inversion is curved and sloped upward and lower portion is curved and sloped downward. Similarly an entering upper portion of plate of inversion is curved and sloped upward and lower portion is curved and sloped downward. The combined effect is that when the finger like extension is closed resting on a stop bolt the latch pin of mine roller assembly will be snugly held by the latch . When the finger like extension is retracted the latch pin under the gravitational force of the tongue pressure of the mine roller will rotate and be jettisoned from the latch.

Each shaft as shown in and can be fitted with a sleeve such as a tough low friction plastic or metal where the sleeve reduces wear of the shaft. Each sleeve has an in board flange and an out board flange where the flanges function as lateral stops to limit movement of hitched elements.

In the mine roller assembly is shown disconnected from the tactical vehicle assembly. The mine roller assembly is pivotally fastened to a left pair of arms and a right pair of arms of a mine roller only the arms are shown where both pairs of arms are equally spaced and parallel and both pairs have opposing pairs of connection holes . Each pair of arms is connected to a connection plate on the mine roller assembly using a heavy duty bolt . Each bolt preferably has a handle to help remove the bolt. The junction of the connection plates and the pairs of arms is a pivot point. The mine roller assembly rocks back and drops when it is jettisoned i.e. when the latch pin is released by the finger like extension of the latching assembly . The heavy duty bolts can be utilized as emergency or backup release points for separating the RJDS and the tactical vehicle from the mine roller when the remote jettison system is inoperable or otherwise not used.

As illustrated in the connection plates are mounted near the ends of a mine roller assembly elongate strength member . As shown in each connection plate has a roughly rectangular section R with a mounting opening M and a triangular section T with a through plate aperture H where the through plate aperture H can accommodate a heavy duty bolt . The perimeter of the mounting opening M is welded to the elongate strength member of mine roller assembly .

In the exemplary embodiment the elongate strength member is a rectangular steel tube that is about three inches by about five inches having a nominal wall thickness of about three eights of an inch. The elongate strength member is at least as long as the distance separating the left pair of arms and the right pair of arms .

Each of the connection plates are flanked outboard by hitching plates respectively. Each hitching plate is mounted to the elongate strength member such that a hitching projection section P see of the plate projects substantially opposing the triangular section T of the connection plate . As shown in hitching plate has a rectangular section R with a mounting opening M wherein a perimeter of the mounting opening M is welded to the mine roller assembly s elongate strength member . The hitching projection section P is a thick arched projection with a tapered arch S that can hitch on an outboard segment of a shaft on the tactical vehicle assembly .

Each of the connection plates are also preferably flanked in board by J hooking plates respectively. Each J Hooking plate is welded to the elongate strength member shown in ghost with dashed lines in such that a hitching projection section P of the plate projects substantially opposing the triangular section T of the connection plate . As shown in J hooking plate has a J section J with a length that follows the contour of the elongate strength member wherein a portion of the length of the J section J is welded to the elongate strength member . The hitching projection section P is a thick arched projection with a tapered arch S that can hitch on an inboard segment of a shaft on the tactical vehicle assembly . In the exemplary embodiment the arc A is about 153 degrees 180 117 90 153 with a range of plus ten to minus ten degrees and then the arc opens into a linear slope. The J hooking plate keeps lateral movement of the mine roller assembly to a minimum as each connection plate is sandwiched between a J hooking plate and a hitching plate .

In addition to the hitching plates and the J hooking plates proximate to the right end of the mine roller elongate strength member and the hitching plate and the J hooking plates proximate to the left end of the mine roller elongate strength member there is a pair of dual function plates located inboard of J hooking plates respectively. As identified in each dual function plate has a latch projection U with an opening L for outward depending heavy duty latch pin see and a hitching projection P that has a thick recessed tapered arch S that can hitch on another inboard segment of a shaft on the tactical vehicle assembly . The left and right dual function plates are substantially mirror images the only difference being that on one side for example the right side the right heavy duty latch pin see will be engaged by the mechanized latch see on the tactical vehicle assembly while on the left side the left heavy duty latch pin will come into contact with a stop sloped portion of tetra function plate see on the left side of the tactical vehicle assembly . The mechanized latch can be opened remotely for instance from the cab of the tactical vehicle. Each dual function plate has a rectangular section R with a mounting opening M where a perimeter of the mounting opening is welded to the mine roller elongate strength member . The heavy duty latch pins are substantially parallel to the mine roller elongate strength member .

In the hitched position the latch is closed and the elongate strength members on both assemblies are about at the same height and the heavy duty latch pins are substantially parallel and directly above the corresponding shaft on the tactical vehicle assembly . When latched the mine roller assembly has a fixed position and unlike a ball hitch where there can be wide horizontal rotational movement and some vertical rotational movement all movement is locked out. The only movement that is allowed is at the pivot point between the mine roller assembly and the left pair of arms and the right pair of arms where both pairs of arms are equally spaced and parallel and both pairs have opposing pairs of connection holes that function substantially as horizontal bearings. Each pair of arms is connected to a corresponding connection plate on the mine roller assembly using a heavy duty axle bolt that can be secured for example with an axial pin having a handle that permits vertical rotational movement of the mine roller.

When assembled and in operation the tactical vehicle assembly is typically mounted to the front of a tactical vehicle by mounting plates so that the strength member and shafts are substantially parallel to the ground surface. The mine roller assembly is attached to the tactical vehicle assembly by placing the tapered arches S S and S of the hitching plates J hooking plates and dual function plates respectively over corresponding exposed portions of the shafts .

When the mine roller assembly is rotated and positioned so that the plates are substantially parallel to the ground and the tapered arches S S and S are facing downward the shafts support the weight of the mine roller assembly. Also when the mine roller assembly is in this position latch pin is disposed within and abuts against the stop of inversion of the tetra function plate and the other latch pin is disposed within latch inversion of the latching assembly .

When an operator activates the actuator via remote control to rotate geared curved plate so that the finger like extension moves into the closed position as illustrated in the latch pin is retained in that position thereby retaining the mine roller assembly in this position. The mine roller assembly can be attached to the mine roller arm pairs with bolts either before or after it is attached to the tactical vehicle assembly .

When it becomes necessary to release the mine roller and the attached mine roller assembly from the tactical vehicle the operator simply uses the remote control to activate the actuator to rotate the geared curved plate so that the finger like extension moves into the open position i.e. so that it does not block the entrance of latch inversion . When this occurs latch pin is released allowing the mine roller assembly to rotate and pivot about the bolts and the shafts so that the plates and can rotate downward under the influence of the tongue weight of the mine roller into a substantially vertical position and the tapered arches S S and S can fall away from the shafts thereby releasing the mine roller assembly from the tactical vehicle assembly. Thus unencumbered by the mine roller the tactical vehicle can evacuate the area for example in an emergency situation.

It is to be understood that the foregoing description and specific embodiments are merely illustrative of the best mode of the invention and the principles thereof and that various modifications and additions may be made to the invention by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. For example the elongate strength members can be other than rectangular tubes and can be made of a material other than steel. Additional plates can be added to the strength members to provide additional supporting structure or one or more of the disclosed plates such as the J hooking plate may be omitted to save weight as long as there is sufficient supporting structure to support the weight of the mine roller and maintain the mine roller assembly s position and attachment to the tactical vehicle assembly.
