This Application is a United States National Stage Application filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT Patent Application Serial No. PCT CN2013 075011 filed on Apr. 28 2013 the contents of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a system and method of providing an interactive interface to a user who wishes to interact with a live program broadcast from a mobile device and more particularly to a system and method in which the user can interact with particular television shows to for example vote for the show s contests request information about the show and its contestants or buy products associated with the show.

The ubiquitous presence of cell phones in our society is universal. It is estimated that there are as many as 6 billion cell phone subscribers on the planet with a population of 7 billion people. Approximately 1 billion of those cell phones are smartphones and that number is projected to double by 2015. The technological advances found in smartphones continue to become standard features e.g. cameras Bluetooth GPS touch screens and WiFi are now commonplace in smartphones. While the functionality of smartphones increases the costs of purchasing such a mobile device continue to decrease. Similarly other mobile devices including tablets and laptops have shown ever increasing functionality at lower cost.

Concurrently live program broadcasts via radio digital radio satellite radio webcasts television and HDTV are improving in quality and format across platforms. The networks and components for delivering the live program broadcast continue to improve in quality and functionality as well. However a user s relationship to the live program broadcast remains static. That is the user watches or listens to the live program broadcast but does little more. There is little or no interaction between the live program broadcast and the user except for some live program broadcasts that ask users to call a phone number email text or Tweet in their vote for a particular television show s contestant. Additionally the user may visit the television show s website to cast their vote.

The interaction between the user and the live program broadcast if any is cumbersome at best. Today s user must divert his attention from the live program broadcast to dial a phone number that is provided open an email or SMS application access their Twitter account to Tweet or type in the provided URL to interact with the live program broadcast. The cumbersome steps required to interact are a deterrent to a user s participation with the live program broadcast.

With the current cumbersome steps available to users there is a need for a system that provides a true interactive experience for a user. Thus a system is needed that will enable a user to quickly and easily interact with a live program broadcast in order to access specific content associated with that live program broadcast at that particular point in the broadcast.

In accordance with some implementations of the present application a method of providing an interactive content to a prospective user at a mobile device the mobile device including a non transitory computer readable medium including a computer executable program code and a processor for executing the computer executable program code the method including the steps of initiating capture of an audio stream capturing the audio stream via a microphone in the mobile device converting the captured audio stream into an audio fingerprint sending information related to the audio fingerprint to a server and receiving an interactive content from the server wherein the interactive content is associated with a live program broadcast near the mobile device and displaying the interactive content on the mobile device.

In accordance with some implementations of the present application a mobile device comprises a processor audio circuitry for detecting audio signals and converting the audio signals into audio streams a sensor for detecting movements of the mobile device and memory for storing programs.

Transmission of information related to the audio fingerprints created by a conversion of the audio stream at the mobile device to the remote server allows for possible matching of the captured audio stream with the live program broadcast . In some implementations the audio stream may be transmitted to the server before conversion into the audio fingerprint is undertaken.

The remote server includes the server frontend the server backend and the database . The server backend may handle multiple live program broadcasts streaming content so the server backend can build a candidate audio fingerprint dataset of the live program broadcasts and store associated interactive interfaces programs and information. In response to a query from the mobile device the query including an audio fingerprint the server backend compares the audio fingerprint with the candidate audio fingerprints in the database . If a match between the captured audio stream and any of the live program broadcasts is identified the associated interactive interface program and information is pushed by the server frontend to the mobile device for the user to enjoy. It is envisioned that there may be multiple servers required to receive and convert the numerous live program broadcasts into audio fingerprints.

Audio circuitry speaker and microphone provide an audio interface between a user and electronic device streaming audio . Audio circuitry receives electrical signals converted by microphone from the sound waves emanating from the electronic device. Audio circuitry also may receive audio data from the communication buses and convert the audio data to an electrical signal and transmit the electrical signal to speaker . The speaker may convert the electrical signal to human audible sound waves.

Note that although named messaging client module the module is by no means limited to providing messaging services. For example the messaging client module may include an identifier of the user of the mobile device a mobile device identifier for binding the mobile device to the user s account at the remote server an audio signal processing sub module for initiating and capturing an audio stream broadcast near the mobile device converting the audio stream into one or more audio fingerprints and generating a time stamp or hash code for each audio fingerprint an audio fingerprint query processing sub module for submitting a query including an audio fingerprint and associated information to the remote server and processing the response to the query the response including an interactive content related to the audio signal captured by the mobile device and one or more data entries each entry including an audio fingerprint from a captured audio stream a hash code derived from the audio fingerprint and a time stamp indicating when the audio stream was captured by the mobile device.

It should be noted that the modules and datasets in the remote server describe above in connection with may be implemented on a single computer server or distributed among multiple computer servers that are connected by a computer network. Although a specific hardware configuration may affect the performance of the remote server the implementation of the present application is not dependent on a particular hardware configuration.

In some implementations the server frontend module which is responsible for receiving a request for interactive content from the mobile device and transmitting back interactive content or an error message developed by the backend subsystem in response to the request. The server backend module which is responsible for converting live program broadcasts into audio fingerprints timestamping and segmenting the audio fingerprints of the live program broadcasts and comparing the numerous segmented audio fingerprints with the fingerprint of the captured audio stream from the mobile device . See . But one skilled in the art would understand that this illustrative division of the remote server is not necessary for implementing the present application.

At step the user starts an application e.g. the messaging client module on the mobile device. For example the user may press the application s icon on the smartphone s touch screen to open the application before or after a live program broadcast begins. In some implementations the application is automatically started by another application running on the mobile device. For example the messaging client module may provide an application programming interface API to another third party application. While the third party application runs on the mobile device it may detect audio signals in the surrounding environment and then activate the messaging client module which then prompts the user to capture the audio signals in order to participate in an interactive program associated with the live program broadcast. In some implementations the live program broadcast near the mobile device may be one of a radio broadcast a television broadcast or a web broadcast which generates an audio signal that can be captured by the mobile device s microphone.

At step while listening to the live program broadcast and at some particular point in time the user may decide to check whether the live program broadcast has any interactive content and then interact with the live program broadcast through the interactive content. The interaction may include for example an opportunity to receive more information regarding the subject matter of the live program broadcast a chance to vote for the favorite contestant on the live program broadcast or share the live program broadcast with a friend using e.g. the messaging service or even an online shopping opportunity to buy related merchandise. The user may shake his mobile device in order to start an audio stream capture of the live program broadcast. In some implementations the user is prompted by an audio cue or a visual cue from the mobile device indicating that there might be an interactive section of the live program broadcast currently available. After shaking the mobile device a ten to fifteen second snippet of the audio stream of the live program broadcast may be captured by the mobile device. Note that there are many other ways of activating the mobile device to capture the audio stream by triggering one of the sensors in a predefined manner e.g. tapping the mobile device pressing a predefined button of the mobile device etc.

At step the mobile device converts the captured audio stream into an audio fingerprint. There are many benefits for converting the audio stream into the audio fingerprint. First the size of the audio fingerprint is usually smaller than that of the audio stream which means that less data is required to be transmitted to the remote server. This feature is more important if the mobile device currently has only a cellular wireless connection with the remote server. Second by converting audio streams into audio fingerprints there are many known and robust algorithms for determining the similarity between two audio streams by comparing their respective audio fingerprints. For example the teaching of two well known approaches for generating the audio fingerprints from audio signals can be found in 1 J. Haitsma and T. Kalker. . In Proc. of International Conference on Music Information Retrieval ISMIR Paris France 2002 and 2 A. Wang. . In Proc. of International Conference on Music Information Retrieval ISMIR Baltimore Md. USA October 2003 both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In some implementations at step the mobile device generates a timestamp for the audio fingerprint and a fixed length hash code for the audio fingerprint. For example the timestamp may be chosen to be the mid point of the audio stream. As described below the timestamp is a parameter used for determining the linear correlation of two audio fingerprints which then indicates the similarity between the two audio signals behind the audio fingerprints. The hash code is used for reducing the number of candidate audio fingerprints required to be linearly correlated with the audio fingerprint provided by the mobile device so as to make the entire matching process more efficient and reduce the user s waiting time for the matching result.

At step the mobile device sends a query to the remote server. The query typically includes the audio fingerprint and information related to the audio fingerprint e.g. the timestamp and hash code . In some implementations the audio fingerprint is further compressed before being sent to the remote server to further reduce its size. is an exemplary screenshot illustrating that the mobile device has submitted a query to the remote server and is waiting for the server to return the interactive content associated with the live program broadcast captured by the mobile device.

Subsequently at step the mobile device receives an interactive content from the remote server. This interactive content is deemed to be associated with the live program broadcast near the mobile device. Note that the interactive content may be pre stored at the remote server. In some implementations the remote server may dynamically fetch at least part of the interactive content from other sources e.g. by submitting a query including search terms related to the live program broadcast to a generic search engine www.soso.com or a particular website e.g. Wikipedia and supplement the interactive content with additional search results. At step the mobile device displays in the interactive content. In some implementations the mobile device may display a graphical user interface that includes a plurality of icons associated with the interactive content. Upon detecting a user selection of one of the icons the mobile device performs a predefined operation associated with the user selected icon e.g. voting downloading data sharing the live program broadcast with another person and online shopping. In response to the interactive content the mobile device may also invoke a social network application to render the interactive content and allow the user to share it with his friends. For example the user may send a message including a link to the interactive content hosted by the remote server to a predefined account e.g. a public account shared by many users at a social networking website so that users who have signed up to follow that public account will receive a message including the link. By clicking on the link the other users can download the interactive content onto their mobile devices and participate in the same interactive program. In some implementations another user may be able to configure his registration with the public account so that the interactive content is automatically pushed onto his mobile device without requiring a user click on the link. is another exemplary screenshot illustrating that the mobile device has rendered the interactive content on its display. The user has two options of interacting with the talent program called The Voice by i tapping the play icon to watch the show from the mobile device or ii tapping the vote icon to cast his vote for the participants of the talent show.

At step the server compares the audio fingerprint with a plurality of candidate audio fingerprints each candidate audio fingerprint corresponding to a respective live program broadcast that has an associated interactive content accessible to the server. As noted above the remote server independently receives audio streams from numerous live programs from third party providers. For each live program the server streams an audio signal segment which may last between one and two minutes and then generates a set of candidate audio fingerprints for the audio signal segment each candidate audio fingerprint corresponding to a respective portion of the audio signal segment. Sometimes there is a partial overlap between two candidate audio fingerprints that correspond to two consecutive portions of the audio signal segment. Because this is a live program the server abandons a set of candidate audio fingerprints associated with an old audio signal segment if it determines that it is less likely for any user to submit a query including an audio fingerprint corresponding to the audio signal segment. In other words the server only maintains a set of candidate audio fingerprints corresponding to the current audio signal segment.

In some implementations the comparison of two audio fingerprints has multiple sub steps. At step the server first identifies among the plurality of candidate audio fingerprints one or more candidate audio fingerprints whose association scores with the hash code exceed a predefined threshold level. By doing so many audio fingerprints whose hash codes are very different from the one provided by the mobile device will be skipped because they are deemed to be associated with live program broadcasts not captured by the mobile device. At step the server generates a linear correlation measurement between the audio fingerprint and each identified candidate audio fingerprint before. Note that this measurement is based at least in part on the audio fingerprint s timestamp. This linear correlation is similar to a cross correlation operation of two signals. The more similar the two signals are the higher the linear correlation measurement. At step the server selects as the one matching the audio fingerprint a candidate audio fingerprint that has a linear correlation measurement greater than that of any other identified candidate audio fingerprint.

Finally at step the server returns an interactive content to the mobile device the interactive content being associated with a live program broadcast that has at least one candidate audio fingerprint matching the audio fingerprint.
