This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 663 391 filed Jun. 22 2012 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. DE AR0000059 awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in this invention.

Sustainably produced biofuels are an alternative to fossil fuels and may help to alleviate the depletion of easily accessible fossil fuel stocks such as cellulosic biomass while avoiding fossil fuel associated pollution and greenhouse gas emission thus satisfying a rising demand for affordable energy in a sustainable way. The development of methods and oil producing organisms suitable for the efficient conversion of carbon sources to lipids is prerequisite for widespread implementation of microbial biofuel production.

Microbial oil production by heterotrophic organisms is a most promising path for the cost effective production of biofuels from renewable resources provided high conversion yields can be achieved. The key to cost effective microbial oil production from renewable feedstocks is a high carbohydrate to oil conversion yield. Additionally the use of available and abundant cellulosic biomass feedstocks for biofuel production is currently limited by the high cost and energy associated with processing such sources. Metabolic engineering has emerged as the enabling technology applied to this end and numerous examples exist of successful pathway engineering that markedly improved the performance of microbial biocatalysts in the synthesis of chemical pharmaceutical and fuel products.

Prior efforts at engineering microbes for oil production have focused on amplifying presumed rate controlling steps in the fatty acid synthesis pathway using traditional carbon sources such as glucose. Significant drawbacks of such approaches include the high cost of a glucose based feedstock and that increasing carbon flux into fatty acid synthesis pathways increases the level of saturated fatty acids in the cell which activate a potent negative feedback loop of fatty acid biosynthesis.

Some aspects of this disclosure provide a strategy for microbe engineering that combines the utilization of nontraditional carbon sources such as those obtained from cellulosic materials including xylose with amplification of upstream metabolite forming pathways also referred to herein as push and downstream product sequestering pathways also referred to herein as pull metabolic pathways. Some aspects of this invention provide that a balanced combination of push and pull modifications in a microbe results in large carbon flux amplifications into lipid synthesis pathways without significant departures of the concentrations of intermediate metabolites from their homeostatic physiological levels thus avoiding feedback inhibition of lipid synthesis.

Liquid biofuels are a promising alternative to fossil fuels that can help ease concerns about climate change and smoothen supply uncertainties 1 . Biodiesel jet oil and other oil derived fuels in particular are necessary for aviation and heavy vehicle transport. They are presently produced exclusively from vegetable oils which is a costly and unsustainable path 2 . An attractive possibility is the non photosynthetic conversion of renewable carbohydrate feedstocks to oil 3 . For biodiesel a transition from vegetable oil to microbial oil production for the oil feedstock presents numerous additional advantages adaptability to diverse feedstocks flexibility in land requirements efficient process cycle turnover and ease of scale up 4 . In the search for improved feedstocks the push towards cellulosic biofuels is a clear choice. Cellulosic biomass mitigates the need to compete with food crop production an estimated 1.3 billion dry tons per year of biomass is potentially available in the US alone Perlack 2005 . Additionally cellulosic materials can be more efficiently grown and more stably produced compared to sugar crops. However cellulosic materials are not naturally consumable by most biofuel producing organisms and thus cellulose requires pretreatment and hydrolysis to break the material down into monomeric sugar. The resulting hydrolysate can then be used as a sugar rich feedstock. Since hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass results in 20 30 carbohydrates in the form of xylose utilization of pentose sugars is one of the first steps toward efficiently using cellulosic materials.

Another factor in a cost effective microbial technology for the conversion of carbohydrates to oils is a high carbohydrate to oil conversion yield. Metabolic engineering has emerged as the enabling technology applied to this end and numerous examples exist of successful pathway engineering that markedly improved the performance of microbial biocatalysts in the synthesis of chemical pharmaceutical and fuel products. Prior efforts at engineering microbes with high lipid synthesis have focused on amplifying presumed rate controlling steps in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. These efforts however have produced mixed results presumably because modulating fatty acid flux gave rise to the levels of saturated fatty acids which are potent allosteric inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes providing a negative feedback loop for the fatty acid biosynthesis. Certain aspects of this disclosure describe an approach that combines the introduction of xylose metabolic genes to utilize xylose as a carbon source with the amplification of upstream metabolite forming pathways in the lipid synthesis pathway with a similar increase in the flux of downstream metabolite consuming pathways. Combining the utilization of xylose as a carbon source with a push and pull strategy can achieve large flux amplifications without significant departures of the concentrations of intermediate metabolites from their homeostatic physiological levels while growing the cells on a renewable cellulosic carbohydrate feedstock.

The oleaginous yeast is an attractive candidate for microbial oil production which has also demonstrated usefulness in a wide range of other industrial applications citric acid production protein production e.g. proteases and lipases and bioremediation. With a fully sequenced genome and a growing body of genetic engineering tools engineering of can be achieved with relative ease. also has been found to be robust in culture able to grow on a variety of substrates and has been used for lipid production on agro industrial residues industrial glycerol and industrial fats. It has excellent lipid accumulation capacity commonly accumulating up to 36 of its dry cell weight DCW in lipids.

The metabolic pathways for de novo lipid synthesis in are beginning to be fully mapped out. Glucose entering glycolysis enters the mitochondria as pyruvate for use in the TCA cycle however excess acetyl coA is transported from the mitochondria to the cytosol via the citrate shuttle. Cytosolic acetyl CoA is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase ACC as the first step of fatty acid synthesis. After fatty acid synthesis triacylglycerol TAG synthesis follows the Kennedy pathway which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum ER and lipid bodies. Acyl CoA is the precursor used for acylation to the glycerol 3 phosphate backbone to form lysophosphatidic acid LPA which is further acylated to form phosphatidic acid PA . PA is then dephosphorylated to form diacylglycerol DAG and then a final acylation occurs by diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGA to produce TAG.

Transport of acetyl CoA from the mitochondria to the cytosol is carried out by the ATP citrate lyase ACL mediated cleavage of citrate via the citrate shuttle yielding Acetyl CoA and Oxaloacetate OAA . Acetyl CoA carboxylase ACC then catalyzes the first committed step towards lipid biosynthesis converting cytosolic acetyl CoA into malonyl CoA which is the primary precursor for fatty acid elongation. Completed fatty acyl CoA chains are then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum ER or lipid body membranes for the final assembly of triacylglycerol TAG via the Kennedy pathway. Over 80 of the storage lipids produced in are in the form of TAG. Cytosolic OAA is converted to malate by malic dehydrogenase and transported back into the mitochondria to complete the citrate shuttle cycle. Reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH is provided either by the pentose phosphate pathway PPP or by malic enzyme in the transhydrogenase cycle. In high PPP flux and ineffectual malic enzyme overexpression suggest that the former is the primary source for NADPH.

Instead of utilizing glucose as a carbon source the metabolic conversion of xylose to lipids is a favorable alternative for reasons described herein. Xylose enters the cell and can be catabolized through a redox pathway whereby xylose reductase XD or XYL1 converts xylose to xylitol using NADPH as a reducing equivalent. Xylitol is then converted to xylulose through the action of xylitol dehydrogenase XDH or XYL2 using NAD as an electron acceptor. Xylulokinase XK or XYL3 then phosphorylates xylulose to form xylulose 5 P. Alternatively the xylose isomerase XYLA enzyme bypasses the requirement of reducing equivalents producing xylulose directly from xylose which is then converted to xylulose 5 P by XYL3. Xylulose 5 P can then enter central metabolism through the non oxidative pathway of the PPP where it ultimately produces glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate G3P and fructose 6 phosphate F6P . These two products can then enter the rest of central metabolism going through glycolysis to enter the TCA cycle. Production of lipids occurs normally through the transport of mitochondrial citrate into the cytosol where it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into oxaloacetate and cytosolic acetyl coA. The acetyl coA can then enter the fatty acid synthesis pathway through the enzymatic activity of acetyl coA carboxylase. Acyl CoA generated from the fatty acid synthase complex are transferred to a glycerol 3 phosphate backbone and ultimately sequestered within lipid bodies as triacylglycerol TAG .

Intracellular lipid accumulation can occur via two methods de novo lipid synthesis or ex novo incorporation of exogenous fatty acids and lipids. Lipid accumulation most commonly occurs when nutrient supply is exhausted in the presence of excess carbon. In culture this state typically coincides with the onset of the stationary phase. In practice the most commonly used limiting nutrient is nitrogen as it is easily controllable in media compositions. Despite these inducible conditions lipid synthesis pathways are highly regulated in order for the organism to balance cell growth with energy storage. For example ACC alone is regulated at multiple levels and by multiple factors.

This tight regulation was circumvented in certain cases. By eliminating peroxisomal oxidation pathways and engineering glycerol metabolism was able to achieve 40 70 lipids through ex novo lipid accumulation. Coexpression of 6 and 12 desaturase genes allowed for significant production of linolenic acid GLA 20 . However engineering lipid biosynthesis pathways in is still relatively unexplored and strategies are still being developed for effective engineering of the lipid production pathways to maximize output.

Some aspects of this disclosure provide engineered microbes for the production of biofuel or biofuel precursor. The term biofuel refers to a fuel that is derived from a biological source such as a living cell microbe fungus or plant. The term includes for example fuel directly obtained from a biological source for example by conventional extraction distillation or refining methods and fuel produced by processing a biofuel precursor obtained from a biological source for example by chemical modification such as transesterification procedures. Examples of biofuels that are directly obtainable are alcohols such as ethanol propanol and butanol fat and oil. Examples of biofuels that are obtained by processing of a biofuel precursor e.g. a lipid are biodiesel e.g. produced by transesterification of a lipid and green diesel modified oil fuels e.g. produced by hydrogenation of an oil . Biodiesel also referred to as fatty acid methyl or ethyl ester is one of the economically most important biofuels today and can be produced on an industrial scale by transesterification of lipids in which sodium hydroxide and methanol or ethanol reacts with a lipid for example a triacylglycerol to produce biodiesel and glycerol.

Feedstocks for industrial scale production of biodiesel include animal fats vegetable oils palm oil hemp soy rapeseed flax sunflower and oleaginous algae. In other approaches biomass is converted by a microbe into a biofuel precursor for example a lipid that is subsequently extracted and further processed to yield a biofuel. The term biomass refers to material produced by growth and or propagation of a living cell or organism for example a microbe. Biomass may contain cells microbes and or intracellular contents for example cellular fatty acids and TAGS as well as extracellular material. Extracellular material includes but is not limited to compounds secreted by a cell for example secreted fatty acids or TAGs. Important types of biomass for biofuel production are algal biomass and plant derived biomass for example corn stover and wood fiber. In some embodiments biomass for biofuel or biofuel precursor production may comprise plant derived sugars for example sugarcane or corn derived sugars.

Some aspects of this disclosure relate to the engineering and development of a microbial source of lipids useful for example for economically viable industrial scale biodiesel production. The term lipid refers to fatty acids and their derivatives. Accordingly examples of lipids include fatty acids FA both saturated and unsaturated glycerides or glycerolipids also referred to as acylglycerols such as monoglycerides monoacylgycerols diglycerides diacylglycerols triglycerides triacylglycerols TAGs or neutral fats phosphoglycerides glycerophospholipids nonglycerides sphingolipids sterol lipids including cholesterol and steroid hormones prenol lipids including terpenoids fatty alcohols waxes and polyketides and complex lipid derivatives sugar linked lipids or glycolipids and protein linked lipids . Lipids are an essential part of the plasma membrane of living cells and microbes. Some cells and microbes also produce lipids to store energy for example in the form of triacylglycerols in lipid bodies lipid droplets or vacuoles.

Some aspects of this invention relate to engineered microbes for biofuel or biofuel precursor production. In some embodiments the microbes provided herein are engineered to use 5C sugars as a carbon source for example xylose. In some embodiments the microbes provided herein also are engineered to optimize their lipid metabolism for lipid production. The term lipid metabolism refers to the molecular processes that involve the creation or degradation of lipids. Fatty acid synthesis fatty acid oxidation fatty acid desaturation TAG synthesis TAG storage and TAG degradation are examples of processes that are part of the lipid metabolism of a cell. Accordingly the term fatty acid metabolism refers to all cellular or organismic processes that involve the synthesis creation transformation or degradation of fatty acids. Fatty acid synthesis fatty acid oxidation TAG synthesis and TAG degradation are examples of processes are part of the fatty acid metabolism of a cell.

The term triacylglycerol TAG sometimes also referred to as triglyceride refers to a molecule comprising a single molecule of glycerol covalently bound to three fatty acid molecules aliphatic monocarboxylic acids via ester bonds one on each of the glycerol molecule s three hydroxyl OH groups. Triacylglycerols are highly concentrated stores of metabolic energy because of their reduced anhydrous nature and are a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production.

Many cells and organisms store metabolic energy in the form of fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives such as TAGs. Fatty acids and their derivatives such as TAGs provide an ideal form to store metabolic energy. The energy contained in the C C bonds can be efficiently released by oxidation a reaction formally equivalent to the reverse of fatty acid biosynthesis but mediated and regulated by different enzymes constituting a different molecular pathway. Microbes can derive fatty acids from external supply endogenous turnover and de novo synthesis. Some aspects of this invention relate to the identification of a microbe for biofuel or biofuel precursor production based on the microbe s ability to synthesize and store fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives such as TAGs efficiently from an externally supplied carbon source.

Natural fatty acid molecules commonly have an unbranched aliphatic chain or tail of 4 to 28 carbon atoms. Fatty acids are referred to as saturated if all carbon atoms of the aliphatic chain are connected via a C C single bond or as unsaturated if two or more carbon atoms are connected via a C C double bond. Unsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the regulation of membrane fluidity cellular activity metabolism and nuclear events governing gene transcription.

The spectrum of fatty acids in yeast consists mostly of C16 and C18 fatty acids for example palmitic acid C16 palmitoleic acid C16 stearic acid C18 and oleic acid C18 . Palmitic acid is an unbranched saturated fatty acid with an aliphatic chain of 16 carbon atoms carbon atoms unsaturated bonds 16.0 . Stearic acid is an unbranched saturated fatty acid with an aliphatic chain of 18 carbon atoms 18.0 . Palmitoleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid with an aliphatic chain of 16 carbon atoms 16.1 . Oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid with an aliphatic chain of 18 carbon atoms 18.1 . Minor fatty acid species in yeast include C14 and C26 fatty acids which play essential functions in protein modification or as components of sphingolipids and GPI anchors respectively.

De novo synthesis of fatty acids utilizes substantial amounts of metabolites acetyl CoA ATP and NADPH and thus competes with other cellular processes that are dependent on these compounds. NADPH is required for two reduction steps in the fatty acid elongation cycle linking fatty acid synthesis to the metabolic state of the cell and results in fatty acid synthesis being restricted to conditions of high energy load of the cells indicated by increased ATP AMP ratio elevated reduction equivalents and elevated acetyl CoA pool. Almost all subcellular organelles are involved in fatty acid metabolism indicating that maintenance of fatty acid homeostasis requires regulation at multiple levels. Lipid synthesis steps that generate metabolites acetyl CoA ATP or NADPH for lipid biosynthesis are sometimes referred to herein as push steps of lipid synthesis. The amplification of a process that increases the production of a metabolites acetyl CoA ATP or NADPH for lipid synthesis in a cell for example by overexpressing a gene product mediating such a metabolite producing process is sometimes referred to herein as a push modification. 

Most organisms including yeast are able to synthesize fatty acids de novo from a variety of carbon sources. In an initial step acetyl CoA is carboxylated by the addition of COto malonyl CoA by the enzyme acetyl CoA carboxylase ACC encoded by ACC1 and HFA1 in yeast . Biotin is an essential cofactor in this reaction and is covalently attached to the ACC apoprotein by the enzyme biotin apoprotein ligase encoded by BPL1 ACC2 in yeast . ACC is a trifunctional enzyme harboring a biotin carboxyl carrier protein BCCP domain a biotin carboxylase BC domain and a carboxyl transferase CT domain. In most bacteria these domains are expressed as individual polypeptides and assembled into a heteromeric complex. In contrast eukaryotic ACC including mitochondrial ACC variants Hfa1 in yeast harbor these functions on a single polypeptide. Malonyl CoA produced by ACC serves as a two carbon donor in a cyclic series of reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthase FAS and elongases.

The immediate product of de novo fatty acid synthesis are saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are known to be the precursors of unsaturated fatty acids in eukaryotes including yeast. Unsaturated fatty acids are generally produced by desaturation of C C single bonds in saturated fatty acids by specialized enzymes called desaturases. The control mechanisms that govern the conversion of saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids are not well understood. In eukaryotes unsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the regulation of membrane fluidity cellular activity metabolism and nuclear events that govern gene transcription. Typically about 80 of yeast fatty acids are monounsaturated meaning that they contain one unsaturated bond in their aliphatic chain.

Fatty acids are potent inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis and the feedback inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by fatty acids is a major obstacle in engineering microbes for oil production. Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the recognition that while push modifications of lipid synthesis are typically unable to override fatty acid mediated feedback inhibition of lipid synthesis a combination of a push modification e.g. ACC1 overexpression with a pull modification e.g. DGA1 overexpression can efficiently bypass the feedback inhibition thus fully realizing the increased carbon flux to the lipid synthesis pathway for example in TGAs stored in a lipid body or vacuole of the cell

Engineering the Capacity for 5C Sugar Utilization and Increased Lipid Synthesis in Oleaginous Microbes

Some aspects of this disclosure provide strategies for engineering microbes for oil production. In some embodiments such strategies employ genetic engineering of oleaginous microbes for example to utilize five carbon 5C sugars such as xylose as a carbon source for lipid synthesis.

Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the surprising discovery described herein that oleaginous microbes such as which are unable to metabolize xylose for lipid synthesis can be engineered to be able to utilize five carbon 5C sugars as feedstocks or in feedstocks. Some aspects of this disclosure relate to the engineering of oleaginous microbes to utilize 5C sugars such as xylose through the introduction of exogenous xylose metabolism genes or the amplification or modification of endogenous xylose metabolism genes. Some aspects of this disclosure relate to the discovery that an oleaginous microbe such as has within its genome a copy of an XYL3 gene that produces a functional gene product. Some aspects of this disclosure are related to the heterologous overexpression of xylose metabolism genes such as XYL1 and XYL2 or XYLA in an oleaginous microbe such as which enables the microbe to utilize xylose as a sole carbon source in the production TAGs.

Some aspects of this disclosure provide strategies for additional engineering of 5C utilizing microbes for oil production. In some embodiments such strategies employ genetic engineering of oleaginous microbes for example to simultaneously amplify a push and a pull step of lipid synthesis. Significant increases of lipid production in oleaginous yeast host cells can be achieved using these strategies.

According to some aspects of this invention modifying the lipid metabolism in a microbe in accordance with methods provided herein for example by simultaneously overexpressing a gene product mediating a metabolite generating push step and a gene product mediating a product sequestering pull step of lipid synthesis allows for the generation of a microbe optimized for use in biofuel or biofuel precursor production processes. Some aspects of this invention provide strategies and methods for engineering the fatty acid metabolism in a microbe by simultaneously amplifying a push step and a pull step of lipid biosynthesis resulting in increased synthesis rate and accumulation of fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives in the microbe.

Some aspects of this invention provide methods that include genetic modifications resulting in the modulation of the expression and or activity of gene products regulating the lipid metabolism of microbes for biofuel or biofuel precursor production. Such genetic modifications according to some aspects of this invention are targeted to increase carbohydrate to fatty acid and or TAG conversion in order to optimize the modified microbe for large scale production of lipids from a carbon source for example a carbohydrate source such as a 5C sugar e.g. xylose. Some modifications provided according to some aspects of this invention for example overexpression knockout knock down activation and or inhibition of specific gene products may be effected alone or in combination and or in combination with other modifications known to those of skill in the art. The term modification refers to both genetic manipulation for example overexpression knockout knock down activation and or inhibition of specific gene products and non genetic manipulation for example manipulation of the growth media substrate substrate pretreatment pH temperature conversion process etc.

A modification of gene expression also referred to herein as a modulation of gene expression can be a disruption or inhibition of the natural regulation of expression an overexpression an inhibition of expression or a complete abolishment of expression of a given gene. The insertion of a heterologous promoter upstream of a native gene sequence for example the native DGA1 or ACC1 gene sequence or the deletion of regulatory sequences within a promoter for example regulatory sequences that mediate the feedback inhibition of the DGA1 or ACC1 gene by saturated fatty acids are examples of a disruption or inhibition of the natural regulation of expression. Strategies for the modulation of gene expression may include genetic alterations for example by recombinant technologies such as gene targeting or viral transductions or non genetic alterations for example environmental alterations known to result in the up or down regulation of gene expression or transient delivery of modulators for example drugs or small RNA molecules to the target cells. Methods for genetic and non genetic alterations of microbes are well known to those of skill in the art and are described for example in J. Sambrook and D. Russell Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 3rd edition Jan. 15 2001 David C. Amberg Daniel J. Burke and Jeffrey N. Strathern Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press April 2005 John N. Abelson Melvin I.

Aristidou and Jens Nielsen Academic Press 1 edition Oct. 16 1998 and Christina Smolke CRC Press 1 edition Jul. 28 2009 all of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The term overexpression as used herein refers to an increased level of expression of a given gene product in a given cell cell type or cell state as compared to a reference cell for example a wild type cell of the same cell type or a cell of the same cell type but lacking a specific modification for example a genetic modification. Forced continuous expression of the DGA1 and or ACC1 gene in cells exhibiting concentrations of saturated fatty acids that would inhibit DGA1 or ACC1 gene expression in wild type cells is an example of gene overexpression.

Some aspects of this invention provide a method for the manipulation of the activity of a xylose reductase XD or XYL1 gene product in a microbe including for biofuel or biofuel precursor production. The XYL1 gene encodes a reductase that reduces xylose to xylitol the initial step of metabolizing xylose as required for entry into the PPP pathway. XYL1 uses NADPH as a reducing equivalent generating xylitol and NADP . Xylitol is then acted upon by XYL2 as described herein. In some embodiments the manipulation is an overexpression.

The term nucleic acid refers to a molecule comprising multiple linked nucleotides. Nucleic acid and nucleic acid molecule are used interchangeably and refer to oligoribonucleotides as well as oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The terms also include polynucleosides i.e. a polynucleotide minus a phosphate and any other organic base containing nucleic acid. The organic bases include adenine uracil guanine thymine cytosine and inosine. The nucleic acids may be single or double stranded. The nucleic acid may be naturally or non naturally occurring. Nucleic acids can be obtained from natural sources or can be synthesized using a nucleic acid synthesizer i.e. synthetic . Isolation of nucleic acids are routinely performed in the art and suitable methods can be found in standard molecular biology textbooks. See for example Maniatis Handbook of Molecular Biology. The nucleic acid may be DNA or RNA such as genomic DNA mitochondrial DNA mRNA cDNA rRNA miRNA PNA or LNA or a combination thereof as described herein. Non naturally occurring nucleic acids such as bacterial artificial chromosomes BACs and yeast artificial chromosomes YACs can also be used in accordance with some aspects of this invention.

Some aspects of this invention relate to the use of nucleic acid derivatives. The use of certain nucleic acid derivatives may increase the stability of the nucleic acids of the invention by preventing their digestion particularly when they are exposed to biological samples that may contain nucleases. As used herein a nucleic acid derivative is a non naturally occurring nucleic acid or a unit thereof. Nucleic acid derivatives may contain non naturally occurring elements such as non naturally occurring nucleotides and non naturally occurring backbone linkages. Nucleic acid derivatives according to some aspects of this invention may contain backbone modifications such as but not limited to phosphorothioate linkages phosphodiester modified nucleic acids combinations of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate nucleic acid methylphosphonate alkylphosphonates phosphate esters alkylphosphonothioates phosphoramidates carbamates carbonates phosphate triesters acetamidates carboxymethyl esters methylphosphorothioate phosphorodithioate p ethoxy and combinations thereof. The backbone composition of the nucleic acids may be homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Nucleic acid derivatives according to some aspects of this invention may contain substitutions or modifications in the sugars and or bases. For example some nucleic acid derivatives may include nucleic acids having backbone sugars which are covalently attached to low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at the 3 position and other than a phosphate group at the 5 position e.g. an 2 O alkylated ribose group . Nucleic acid derivatives may include non ribose sugars such as arabinose. Nucleic acid derivatives may contain substituted purines and pyrimidines such as C 5 propyne modified bases 5 methylcytosine 2 aminopurine 2 amino 6 chloropurine 2 6 diaminopurine hypoxanthine 2 thiouracil and pseudoisocytosine.

In some embodiments a nucleic acid may comprise a peptide nucleic acid PNA a locked nucleic acid LNA DNA RNA or a co nucleic acids of the above such as DNA LNA co nucleic acid.

As used herein the term isolated nucleic acid molecule refers to a nucleic acid that is not in its natural environment for example a nucleic acid that has been i extracted and or purified from a cell or microbe for example a bacteria or yeast by methods known in the art for example by alkaline lysis of the host cell and subsequent purification of the nucleic acid for example by a silica adsorption procedure ii amplified in vitro for example by polymerase chain reaction PCR iii recombinantly produced by cloning for example a nucleic acid cloned into an expression vector iv fragmented and size separated for example by enzymatic digest in vitro or by shearing and subsequent gel separation or v synthesized by for example chemical synthesis. In some embodiments the term isolated nucleic acid molecule refers to vi an nucleic acid that is chemically markedly different from any naturally occurring nucleic acid. In some embodiments an isolated nucleic acid can readily be manipulated by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. Accordingly a nucleic acid cloned into a vector or a nucleic acid delivered to a host cell and integrated into the host genome is considered isolated but a nucleic acid in its native state in its natural host for example in the genome of the host is not. An isolated nucleic acid may be substantially purified but need not be. For example a nucleic acid that is isolated within a cloning or expression vector is not pure in that it may comprise only a small percentage of the material in the cell in which it resides. Such a nucleic acid is isolated however as the term is used herein.

Some aspects of this invention relate to nucleic acids encoding a gene product conferring a required or desirable phenotype to a microbe for biofuel or biofuel precursor production which are linked to a promoter or other transcription activating element. In some embodiments the nucleic acid encoding the gene product and linked to a promoter is comprised in an expression vector or expression construct. As used herein the terms expression vector or expression construct refer to a nucleic acid construct generated recombinantly or synthetically with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host microbe for example an oleaginous yeast. In some embodiments the expression vector may be part of a plasmid virus or nucleic acid fragment. In some embodiments the expression vector includes the coding nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a promoter. A promoter is a nucleic acid element that facilitates transcription of a nucleic acid to be transcribed. A promoter is typically located on the same strand and upstream or 5 of the nucleic acid sequence the transcription of which it controls. In some embodiments the expression vector includes the coding nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a heterologous promoter. A heterologous promoter is a promoter not naturally operably linked to a given nucleic acid sequence. For example the DGA1 gene in is naturally operably linked to the DGA1 gene promoter. Any promoter other than the wildtype DGA1 gene promoter operably linked to the DGA1 gene or parts thereof for example in an expression construct would therefore be a heterologous promoter in this context. For example a TEF1 promoter linked to a nucleic acid encoding a DGA1 gene product is a heterologous promoter in the DGA1 context.

In some embodiments the expression vector includes a coding nucleic acid for example a nucleic acid encoding a XYL1 and XYL2 and optionally XYL3 gene product or a XYLA gene product and optionally a DGA1 ACC1 and or SCD gene product operably linked to a constitutive promoter. The term constitutive promoter refers to a promoter that allows for continual transcription of its associated gene. In some embodiments the expression vector includes a coding nucleic acid for example a nucleic acid encoding a XYL1 and XYL2 and optionally XYL3 gene product or a XYLA gene product and optionally a DGA1 ACC1 and or SCD gene product operably linked to an inducible promoter. The term inducible promoter interchangeably used herein with the term conditional promoter refers to a promoter that allows for transcription of its associated gene only in the presence or absence of biotic or abiotic factors. Drug inducible promoters for example tetracycline doxycycline inducible promoters tamoxifen inducible promoters as well as promoters that depend on a recombination event in order to be active for example the cre mediated recombination of loxP sites are examples of inducible promoters that are well known in the art.

Some aspects of this disclosure relate to the surprising discovery that overexpression of a given gene product from a heterologous promoter in oleaginous microbes can be significantly enhanced by including an intron in the respective expression construct. Some aspects of this disclosure provide an intron enhanced constitutive promoter for gene overexpression in oleaginous microbes and expression constructs and vectors comprising this intron enhanced promoter. In some embodiments an intron enhanced TEF promoter is provided that comprises a TEF promoter sequence a transcription start site an intronic sequence downstream of the transcription start site and a coding nucleic acid sequence for example a nucleic acid sequence encoding a XYL1 and XYL2 and optionally XYL3 gene product or a XYLA gene product and optionally a DGA1 ACC1 and or SCD gene product. In some embodiments the intron is positioned downstream of the translation start site yet within the open reading frame of the gene sequence e.g. after the start codon but before the termination site of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the gene product. In some embodiments the intron is positioned immediately downstream of the translation start site e.g. an ATG start codon yet upstream of the remainder of the coding sequence. For illustration purposes a non limiting exemplary structure of an intron enhanced expression construct is provided as follows 

5 TEF promoter transcription start site intron XYL1 coding sequence 3 . Another non limiting exemplary structure of an intron enhanced expression construct is provided as follows 

5 TEF promoter transcription start site start codon intron XYL1 coding sequence stop codon 3 . Expression constructs for XYL2 XYL3 XYLA DGA1 ACC1 and SCD gene products would have the XYL1 coding sequence substituted by an XYL2 XYL3 XYLA DGA1 ACC or SCD coding sequence respectively.

Suitable TEF promoter sequences as well as suitable intron sequences will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Some intron less TEF promoter sequences are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 265 185. Some exemplary representative sequences are provided below. However it will be understood that the invention is not limited in this respect.

Methods to deliver expression vectors or expression constructs into microbes for example into yeast cells are well known to those of skill in the art. Nucleic acids including expression vectors can be delivered to prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes by various methods well known to those of skill in the relevant biological arts. Methods for the delivery of nucleic acids to a microbe in accordance to some aspects of this invention include but are not limited to different chemical electrochemical and biological approaches for example heat shock transformation electroporation transfection for example liposome mediated transfection DEAE Dextran mediated transfection or calcium phosphate transfection. In some embodiments a nucleic acid construct for example an expression construct comprising a combination of XYL1 XYL2 XYL3 XYLA DGA1 ACC1 and or SCD encoding nucleic acid sequences is introduced into the host microbe using a vehicle or vector for transferring genetic material. Vectors for transferring genetic material to microbes are well known to those of skill in the art and include for example plasmids artificial chromosomes and viral vectors. Methods for the construction of nucleic acid constructs including expression constructs comprising constitutive or inducible heterologous promoters knockout and knockdown constructs as well as methods and vectors for the delivery of a nucleic acid or nucleic acid construct to a microbe are well known to those of skill in the art and are described for example in J. Sambrook and D. Russell Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 3rd edition Jan. 15 2001 David C. Amberg Daniel J. Burke and Jeffrey N. Strathern Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press April 2005 John N. Abelson Melvin I. Simon Christine Guthrie and Gerald R. Fink 194 Methods in Enzymology Series 194 Academic Press Mar. 11 2004 Christine Guthrie and Gerald R.

In some embodiments the native promoter of a gene encoding a gene product conferring a required or desirable phenotype to a microbe for example the native XYL1 XYL2 XYL3 XYLA DGA1 ACC1 or SCD promoter is modified in the microbe to alter the regulation of its transcriptional activity. In some embodiment the modified promoter exhibits an increased transcriptional activity as compared to its unmodified counterpart. The term modified promoter as used herein refers to a promoter the nucleotide sequence of which has been artificially altered. Nucleotide deletion s insertion s or mutation s alone or in combination are examples of such artificial alterations. Artificial promoter alterations can be effected in a targeted fashion for example by homologous recombination approaches such as gene targeting knockout knock in site directed mutagenesis or artificial zinc finger nuclease mediated strategies. Alternatively such alterations may be effected by a random or quasi random event such as irradiation or non targeted nucleotide integration and subsequent selection. Promoter modifications in general are fashioned in order to modulate the transcriptional activation properties of the respective promoter. For example the disruption or deletion of a regulatory element mediating the repression of a XYL1 XYL2 XYL3 XYLA DGA1 ACC1 or SCD promoter in response to elevated intracellular fatty acid levels would lead to continued transcriptional activation of the respective gene even under conditions of elevated intracellular fatty acid levels. Similarly the insertion of a constitutively active transcriptional activator element into a conditional promoter region may effect overexpression of the respective gene under normally inhibitive conditions. Methods for the targeted disruption of a native promoter for example a native XYL1 XYL2 XYL3 XYLA DGA1 ACC1 or SCD promoter in a microbe for example for targeted disruption resulting in an increased transcription rate are well known to those of skill in the art.

The type of carbon source to be employed for conversion to a biofuel or biofuel precursor according to aspects of this invention depends on the specific microbe employed. Some microbes provided by aspects of this invention may be able to efficiently convert a specific carbohydrate source while a different carbohydrate source may not be processed by the same microbe at high efficiency or at all.

The function and advantage of these and other embodiments of the present invention will be more fully understood from the examples below. The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention. Accordingly it will be understood that the example section is not meant to limit the scope of the invention.

In the search for improved feedstocks the push towards cellulosic biofuels is a clear choice. Cellulosic biomass mitigates the need to compete with food crop production an estimated 1.3 billion dry tons per year of biomass is potentially available in the US alone Perlack 2005 . Additionally cellulosic materials can be more efficiently grown and more stably produced compared to sugar crops. However cellulosic materials are not naturally consumable by most biofuel producing organisms and thus cellulose requires pretreatment and hydrolysis to break the material down into monomeric sugar. The resulting hydrolysate can then be used as a sugar rich feedstock.

Since hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass results in 20 30 carbohydrates in the form of xylose utilization of pentose sugars is one of the first steps toward efficiently using cellulosic materials. the most productive of ethanologenic organisms cannot ferment xylose it lacks the ability to convert xylose into xylulose which can then enter the pentose phosphate pathway PPP . Transferring the xylose reductase XR or XYL1 and xylitol dehydrogenase XDH or XYL2 enzymes from formerly has been shown to enable growth of the yeast on xylose for production of ethanol Jeffries 2006 . The addition of xylulokinase XK or XYL3 can also be used to further improve utilization although already carries an endogenous version of this gene. A secondary pathway using xylose isomerase XYLA can be used to convert xylose into xylulose. Compared to the XR XDH redox pathway which uses NADPH and NAD cofactors for shuttling of reducing equivalents the isomerase pathway requires no cofactors. Nonetheless the redox pathway is much more prevalent in nature and likewise in literature Jeffries 2006 Matsushika et al. 2009 .

Instead of ethanol production it may also be advantageous to produce yeast oil for biodiesel from cellulosic feedstocks. As a robust lipid producing organism appears to be an attractive platform for the production of cellulosic biodiesel. By leveraging the knowledge and resources developed for xylose metabolic engineering in xylose utilization in enables robust production of yeast oils from cellulosic materials. Because theoretical yields of lipid production from xylose are very similar to that of glucose 0.34 g g compared to 0.32 g g the consumption of xylose represents an attractive and worthwhile opportunity in a developing cellulosic biodiesel microbial bioprocess Ratledge 1988 . Furthermore has a very high relative PPP flux Blank et al. 2005 a phenotype advantageous for growth on xylose since all flux must pass through the PPP. Upregulation of the PPP pathway is a commonly engineered aspect in xylose utilizing strains Walfridsson et al. 1995 .

For the metabolic conversion of xylose to lipids xylose enters the cell and can be catabolized either through the redox XR XDH pathway or the isomerase XYLA pathway producing xylulose. It can then enter central metabolism through the non oxidative pathway of the PPP where it ultimately produces glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate G3P and fructose 6 phosphate F6P . These two products can then enter the rest of central metabolism going through glycolysis to enter the TCA cycle. Production of lipids occurs normally through the transport of mitochondrial citrate into the cytosol where it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into oxaloacetate and cytosolic acetyl coA. The acetyl coA can then enter the fatty acid synthesis pathway through the enzymatic activity of acetyl coA carboxylase. Acyl coA generated from the fatty acid synthase complex are transferred to a glycerol 3 phosphate backbone and ultimately sequestered within lipid bodies as triacylglycerol TAG .

Here we describe the analysis of for its natural xylose utilization and the metabolic engineering of the organism enabling utilization of xylose for the production of lipids. By incorporation of XR XDH genes we are able to enable growth on xylose as sole carbon source and open up opportunities for the production of lipids from cofermentations. Next we study the performance of our engineered strain through the use of cofermentations to analyze for catabolite repression and response and evaluate the performance of the strain in a scaled up 2 L bioreactor glycerol xylose cofermentation with respect to lipid production. Finally we perform transcription analysis to observe the respiratory responses of the organism during cofermentation.

Constructed plasmids were linearized with SacII and chromosomally integrated into Po1g according to the one step lithium acetate transformation method described by Chen et al. Chen et al. 1997 . MTYL transformants were named after the numbering of their corresponding integrated plasmids. Transformants were plated on selective media and verified by PCR of prepared genomic DNA. Verified transformants were then stored as frozen glycerol stocks at 80 C. and on selective YNB plates at 4 C.

Media and growth conditions for have been previously described by Sambrook et al. Sambrook and Russell 2001 and those for have been described by Barth and Gaillardin Barth and Gaillardin 1997 . Rich medium YPD was prepared with 20 g L Bacto peptone Difco Laboratories Detroit Mich. 10 g L yeast extract Difco 20 g L glucose Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. . YNB medium was made with 1.7 g L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids Difco 0.69 g L CSM Leu MP Biomedicals Solon Ohio and 20 g L glucose. Selective YNB plates contained 1.7 g L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids 0.69 g L CSM Leu 20 g L glucose and 15 g L Bacto agar Difco .

Shake flask experiments were carried out using the following medium 1.7 g L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids 1.5 g L yeast extract and 50 g L glucose. From frozen stocks precultures were inoculated into YNB medium 5 mL in Falcon tube 200 rpm 28 C. 24 hr . Overnight cultures grown in YPD were centrifuged washed and reinoculated into 50 mL of media in 250 mL Erlenmeyer shake flask 200 rpm 28 C. . OD biomass and sugar content were taken periodically and analyzed.

For adaptation of strains on xylose verified transformants were inoculated into shake flasks containing minimal media and 20 g L xylose. The cultures were incubated at 30 C. for at least 10 days waiting for growth to occur before reinoculation into fresh media. This process was repeated until the final OD of the culture reached at least 20 indicating adaptation to xylose. The culture was then stored as frozen stock in 15 glycerol at 80 C. for subsequent use.

Bioreactor scale fermentation was carried out in a 2 liter baffled stirred tank bioreactor. The medium used contained 1.7 g L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate 2 g L ammonium sulfate 1 g L yeast extract and 90 g L glucose. From a selective plate an initial preculture was inoculated into YPD medium 40 mL in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask 200 rpm 28 C. 24 hr . Exponentially growing cells from the overnight preculture were transferred into the bioreactor to an optical density A600 of 0.1 in the 2 L reactor 2.5 vvm aeration pH 6.8 28 C. 250 rpm agitation . Time point samples were stored at 20 C. for subsequent lipid analysis. Sugar organic acid content was determined by HPLC. Biomass was determined by determined gravimetrically from samples washed and dried at 60 C. for two nights. Lipid content was analyzed by direct transesterification.

Standard molecular genetic techniques were used throughout this study Sambrook and Russell 2001 . Restriction enzymes and Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase used in cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs Ipswich Mass. . Genomic DNA from yeast transformants was prepared using Yeastar Genomic DNA kit Zymo Research Irvine Calif. . All constructed plasmids were verified by sequencing. PCR products and DNA fragments were purified with PCR Purification Kit or QIAEX II kit Qiagen Valencia Calif. . Plasmids used are described in Table 1. Primers used are described in Table 2.

Plasmid pMT041 was constructed by amplifying the xylose reductase gene XYL1 Accession Number XM001385144 from genomic DNA ATCC 58376 using the primers MT243 and MT244 and inserting it between the Pm1I and BamHI sites of pINA1269. Plasmid pMT044 was constructed by amplifying the xylitol dehydrogenase gene XYL2 Accession Number XM001386945 using the primers MT233 and MT234 and inserting it between the Pm1I and BamHI sites of pINA1269. XYL1 and XYL2 are both genes originally from the xylose utilizing yeast 

Plasmid pMT059 was constructed by amplifying the XYL1 gene from pMT041 using the primers MT281 and MT282. The amplicon was then inserted into the TEFin expression plasmid pMT015 between the sites SnaBI and KpnI.

For the expression of multiple genes on a single plasmid the promoter gene terminator cassette can be amplified from a parent vector using primers MT220 and MT265. The cassette can then be inserted into the receiving vector between the restriction sites NruI and AseI resulting in a tandem gene construct. The AseI restriction site was selected to facilitate selection as it resides within the ampicillin resistance marker of the plasmid. Because NruI is a blunt end restriction site insertion of the amplicon does not increase the total number of NruI sites that helps facilitate progressive insertions. Plasmid pMT081 was constructed by amplifying the XYL2 cassette from pMT044 and inserting it into the plasmid pMT059 containing XYL1. Plasmid pMT085 was constructed by amplifying the DGA cassette from pMT053 and inserting it into the plasmid pMT081 which contains XYL12.

Shake flask cultures grown for 42 hrs were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000 g. Each pellet was resuspended in 1.0 ml of Trizol reagent Invitrogen and 100 L of acid washed glass beads were added Sigma Aldrich . Tubes were vortexed for 15 min at 4 C. for cell lysis to occur. The tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 g at 4 C. and the supernatant was collected in a fresh 2 mL tube. 200 L chloroform was then added and tubes were shaken by hand for 10 seconds. The tubes were again centrifuged for 10 min at 12 000 g at 4 C. 400 L of the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and an equal volume of phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol pH 4.7 Ambion Austin Tex. was added.

Fluorescence results were analyzed using Real time PCR Miner and relative quantification and statistical analysis was determined with REST 2009 Qiagen using actin as the reference gene and MTYL038 as the reference strain Zhao and Fernald 2005 . Samples were analyzed in quadruplicate.

For routine lipid quantification to determine relative lipid accumulation a method for direct transesterification of cell biomass was used adapted from the two step base then acid catalyzed direct transesterification method developed by Griffiths et al. Griffiths et al. 2010 . A normalized quantity of cell culture was centrifuged and the media supernatant was removed. Samples were then stored in 20 C. freezer or directly transesterified. The cell was then resuspended with the addition of 100 L of hexane containing 10 mg mL methyl tridecanoate internal standard. 500 L 0.5 N sodium methoxide prepared by the addition of sodium hydroxide to methanol was then added to the sample. The sample was then vortexed for 1 hour at room temperature. Next 40 L of sulfuric acid was carefully added to the sample followed by the addition of 500 L of neat hexane. The sample was again vortexed at room temperature for another 30 minutes. 300 L of the upper hexane layer was then transferred into a glass vial and run using the GC FID under standard operating conditions. Total lipid content was calculated as the sum of total fatty acid content for the five primary FAMEs identified.

Within the literature there are conflicting reports about the ability for to naturally consume xylose. In most reports growth on xylose has not been observed Pan et al. 2009 Ruiz Herrera and Sentandreu 2002 . However there are reports of positively growing on xylose strain Po1g was found to consume xylose in a cane hydrolysate fermentation Tsigie et al. 2011 and two strains of were grown on xylose to measure xylulose 5 phosphate phosphoketolase activity Evans and Ratledge 1984 . Beyond these incidences there is otherwise very little reported evidence of using for growth on xylose despite the volume of research of using the organism grow on other alternative and residual substrate sources Papanikolaou et al. 2002 Papanikolaou et al. 2003 Scioli and Vollaro 1997 . Table 3 lists putative XR XDH XK genes within the genome of from a BLAST comparison to known functional pathway genes. While the amino acid identity is only 40 52 the expect value indicates significant likelihood of similarity and often manages only 40 60 amino acid identity with orthologous genes from due to distal phylogeny. Nonetheless the low homology calls into question the potential functional characteristics of these genes which further adds to the controversy.

To test the ability for to utilize its endogenous putative XYL123 pathway in laboratory conditions control strain MTYL038 was grown in minimal media on three different substrates xylose xylitol arabitol. As seen in these three substrates can be used to diagnose the functionality of the three XYL123 genes. For example growth on xylitol will demonstrate that XYL2 and XYL3 are functional while growth on arabitol demonstrates that XYL3 is functional. depicts the growth curves of MTYL038 on the various substrates with a shake flask with no carbon substrate as the control. While it was found that the strain did not grow on xylose it was found to grow weakly on xylitol and quite robustly on arabitol. This suggests that while XYL1 and most likely XYL2 are not naturally expressed or functional in in the presence of their respective substrates XYL3 is expressed and the organism can grow utilizing this pathway as its primary catabolic pathway. Expression of XYL12 enables growth on xylose

With the knowledge that the endogenous xylulokinase is functional in the remaining elements of the xylose utilization pathway were integrated to enable growth on xylose. The XYL1 and XYL2 genes from cloned into expression cassettes. XYL1 was cloned under the control of the stronger TEFin promoter while the XYL2 gene was cloned under the control of hp4d. The XYL2 expression cassette was inserted into the XYL1 plasmid creating plasmid pMT081 expressing both XYL1 and XYL2. Transformation of this plasmid into background strain Po1g yielded the strain MTYL081.

Numerous experiments working with and the xylose utilization pathway have discovered that it is often necessary to include periods of adaptation where serial dilution in xylose media is performed for development of stable xylose utilization Jeffries 2006 Kuyper et al. 2004 Tom s Pej et al. 2010 . This was similarly found to be the case in the verified transformant MTYL081 initially did not grow on xylose. It was grown in minimal xylose media in a shake flask for 10 days before reinoculating in fresh media. This serial dilution was repeated until there was an observed increase in maximum OD to above 15. shows the growth curve on the third serial dilution compared to the original unadapted strain and a control strain that underwent serial dilution in xylose media. Lack of growth from the latter two strains shows that adaptation is necessary for xylose utilization and adaptation does not occur in strains lacking the heterologous XYL12 genes. Adapted growth was found to be steady and roughly exponential with the maximum OD of 38 being reached after 130 hours. The doubling time is roughly 25 hrs which is significantly lower than rates typically observed on glucose but comparable to that on arabitol see .

To explore the underlying adaptations that improved the xylose utilizing phenotype RT PCR was performed comparing the expression of heterologously expressed XYL12 and endogenous XYL123 genes in the adapted and unadapted strains. shows the relative change in transcription level of the genes after adaptation. The heterologously expressed XYL1 was overexpressed 300 fold compared to the unadapted strain while XYL2 was upregulated 17 fold. Within the adapted strain XYL1 was expressed 6 fold greater than XYL2 which is in agreement with the expression expected from the promoters used. Endogenous XYL123 was not significantly upregulated both in adapted MTYL081 and the control strain that underwent serial dilution indicating that the observed adaptation to xylose was not an activation of the putative native xylose pathway. The strong upregulation of XYL1 and XYL2 has been similarly observed in metabolic engineering of as the utilization pathway being both heterologously expressed and potentially the rate limiting step requires strong overexpression for sufficient growth Karhumaa et al. 2005 Karhumaa et al. 2007 . This seems to likewise be the case in as the two XYL12 steps achieve very strong overexpression and yet still only achieve a relatively low growth rate. However it may also be that with the adapted XYL12 expression new rate limiting steps appear to hinder specific growth on xylose such as PPP activity or pentose transport Karhumaa et al. 2005 .

The normal combined activity of XYL1 and XYL2 consumes one NADPH and generates one NADH. Without suitable means to regenerate NADPH from NADH this can lead to cofactor imbalances and has been seen as a significant challenge in metabolic engineering of Matsushika et al. 2009 . However with a potential cofactor imbalance one would expect early cessation of growth and large accumulation of xylitol due to complete depletion on NADPH. In our shake flask cultures we observed only 

While metabolic engineering allowed growth on xylose in growth was dramatically slower than on glucose. Possible factors contributing to the limited growth and productivity are the lack of dedicated pentose transporters low PPP flux and inability for the cell to identify xylose as a fermentable sugar Jeffries 2006 Jin et al. 2004 Matsushika et al. 2009 . To improve productivities with the limited specific growth on xylose experiments were performed using two substrate cofermentations. Cellulosic materials typically consist of a blend of both hexose and pentose sugars and rarely consist of pure pentose Lee et al. 2007 . Furthermore substrates like glycerol are a byproduct of biodiesel production and may be recycled back into the process. First it was necessary to characterize and determine which cofermentation combinations are ideal for lipid production. Xylose was combined with a helper substrate glucose glycerol or arabitol and grown in shake flasks to determine growth characteristics and observe catabolite repression effects in the cofermentation system. Catabolite repression is the preferential uptake of one substrate through the repression of the utilization pathway of secondary substrates and can be seen in a wide range of cofermentations in Morgunov and Kamzolova 2011 . The strain MTYL085 was used which contains the XYL12 pathway as well as DGA overexpression. DGA overexpression is capable of improving lipid accumulation and was found to be a strong contributor to engineered lipid overproduction Kamisaka et al. 2007 . By combining both the xylose utilization pathway and elements for lipid overproduction we may be able to direct flux from xylose towards lipids for a cellulosic biodiesel platform.

The cofermentation of xylose and arabitol exhibits a much different response . Since arabitol shares the same catabolic route for all but the initial pathway it is likely the arabitol response will be most similar to the xylose growth phenotype. Furthermore xylose depletion begins well before arabitol is consumed exhibiting simultaneous utilization of both substrates. The smooth growth profile in this case is in contrast to the two phase growth seen in glucose or glycerol a product of diauxic growth. Nonetheless the overall growth rate and productivity is significantly lower than glucose or glycerol. Additionally arabitol is not a common substrate in cellulosic material and would thus be a prohibitive cost to supplement as a feedstock.

Because glycerol showed the greatest promise for increased productivity a scale up cofermentation was performed using glycerol and xylose as substrates. A 2 L bioreactor was initially charged with 20 g L glycerol and 80 g L xylose. The C N ratio of the reactor was adjusted to be 100 which results nitrogen limited conditions favorable for lipid accumulation. The results of the fermentation are found in . Over the course of 230 hrs all the carbon substrate was consumed with glycerol being depleted within the first 24 hrs. Diauxic shift can clearly be observed as no xylose is consumed until after all the glycerol has been depleted. The 20 g L of glycerol was able to generate 13 g L of biomass. Lipid accumulation steadily occurred between 70 and 230 hours with a majority of the biomass generated on xylose being accounted as lipids. The culture finally achieved a biomass concentration of 18 g L with 7.64 g L lipids or 42 of total biomass. The overall productivity was 0.033 g lipids L hr. Strain MTYL085 was able to convert xylose into lipids at quantities similar to other fermentations Beopoulos et al. 2009 Papanikolaou and Aggelis 2002 . The yield of lipid production however was very low. Of the 80 g L of xylose consumed only 6.08 g L of lipids was generated for a yield of 0.074 g lipids g xylose. This is only 21.7 of the theoretical yield. This low yield may be due to overrespiration of the carbon substrate as high aeration on a foreign substrate may lead to strong flux through the TCA cycle. Furthermore 9.13 g L citrate was also generated which actually accounts for a significant yield from the 100 g L of carbon substrate initially charged. It is possible that the C N ratio was too high as extreme C N ratios in fermentations can tend to produce citrate instead of lipids likely due to limited ability to generate sufficient ATP for fatty acid synthesis Beopoulos et al. 2009 . Despite these low yields the vast majority 80 of the lipids were produced after glycerol depletion and during the xylose only phase indicating successful conversion of xylose to lipids using a first step in developing a cellulosic biodiesel platform.

To further investigate the response of during cofermentations with xylose and the overrespiration observed on glycerol xylose transcriptional analysis was performed on genes within the TCA cycle. Xylose consumption in elicits a non fermentative response and general upregulation of the TCA cycle Jin et al. 2004 Salusjarvi et al. 2006 . This results in lower efficiencies in xylose utilization for ethanol production as downregulation of the TCA cycle is necessary to divert carbon flux towards ethanol fermentation whether via anaerobic environmental conditions or activity of the Crabtree effect. In our cofermentation system the response of when transitioning from the helper substrate to xylose was examined. An initial RNA extraction was performed during the cofermentation while still growing on glucose glycerol or arabitol and a second RNA extraction was performed after the helper substrate was depleted and the strain was exhibiting growth on xylose as sole carbon substrate. RT PCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 2. From this we can identify if a similar respiratory response is observed on xylose. depicts the fold change in transcripts for pyruvate dehydrogenase PDB1 Accession Number XM504448 Aconitase ACO1 Accession Number XM502616 isocitrate lyase ICL1 Accession Number XM501923 and isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1 Accession Number XM503571 . These genes represent key enzymatic steps for the utilization of TCA cycle intermediates PDB1 entrance into the TCA cycle ACO1 diverting citrate to the TCA cycle instead of the cytosol ICL1 diverting isocitrate through the glyoxylate shunt IDH1 committed step into oxidative respiration.

In all three cases PDB1 is significantly upregulated suggesting that there is a stronger driving force towards the TCA cycle in xylose than any other substrate. Aconitase overexpression was not observed in the glucose to xylose transition but was dramatically increased 50 fold in the glycerol to xylose transition. This was mostly due to very low transcription levels observed of ACO1 on glycerol rather than extraordinarily high expression of ACO1 on xylose. ACO1 was upregulated in the transition from arabitol to xylose as well. For ICL1 significant increase in expression was observed during the glycerol to xylose transition and the arabitol to xylose transition but not on glucose. In most organisms ICL1 is normally not expressed due to strong catabolite repression however seems to exhibit constitutive expression of the pathway Flores and Gancedo 2005 . Indeed the magnitude of changes in expression of ICL1 suggests significant expression prior to the transition. Finally IDH1 expression is not significantly changed in glucose and arabitol but is actually downregulated on glycerol indicating that respiration is much more strongly upregulated on glycerol than xylose.

The upregulation of PDB1 and ACO1 in the glycerol fermentation demonstrate an elevated respiratory response when transitioning from glycerol to xylose utilization. While IDH1 is downregulated the upstream regulation may be enough to result in the overrespiration observed in the bioreactor. It is unclear why ACO1 is downregulated so dramatically when growing on glycerol but any previous regulation on this enzyme must surely be alleviated. On the other hand glucose xylose cofermentation resulted in few significant changes in transcription. This may indicate that glucose xylose cofermentation may yield better results at larger scales despite the stronger preference for glycerol by

Pentose utilization represents a pressing need in the development of sustainable biofuel production as the push and advantages for cellulosic feedstocks begin to outweigh the technical challenges. The oleaginous yeast is an example of a robust platform for the production of yeast oil that can be converted into biodiesel. Through metabolic engineering the robust lipid production capabilities established in can be expanded to include xylose utilization enabling further opportunities for microbial cellulosic biodiesel production. By testing native growth on a variety of substrates we showed that the endogenous XYL3 is functional in minimal media while the putative XYL12 genes are not. Through heterologous expression of XYL1 and XYL2 genes from we enabled xylose utilization in after an adaptation period. Through cofermentation we are able to eliminate lag phases and increase growth and productivity on xylose ultimately achieving 42 lipid accumulation in a strain that is metabolically engineered in both xylose utilization and lipid accumulation pathways. By observing that the TCA cycle response we also observed variation between cofermentation substrates suggesting a transcriptional regulatory basis for overrespiration. By leveraging the knowledge base developed from the study of xylose utilization in these results establish a framework for studying and engineering the oleaginous yeast for xylose utilization and the production of cellulosic biodiesel.
