This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the implementations. The scope of the described implementations should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims.

In various example embodiments one or more nonlinear normalization analyses may be applied to data such as for example seismic data data derived from seismic data other data etc. As an example a method may include performing one or more nonlinear normalization analyses to detect features such as for example fractures other latent structures etc. As an example seismic cube nonlinear normalization analyses may be implemented in a framework as a module set of modules etc. for example to detect faults fractures and latent reflections. As an example one or more nonlinear normalization analyses may be performed to assist with detection of one or more features of interest in oil and gas exploration and production E P . For example results from an analysis may assist with well placement geologic modeling sill analyses detection of fractured zones or fracture corridors and in E P for unconventional resources and carbonate fields e.g. consider shale fields .

Fracture corridors or subtle faults may give rise to seismic signals that may be exhibited in acquired seismic data as small amplitude self incoherent features for example in cross sections and as lineaments on slices or seismic surfaces. Detection of such features may include processing seismic signals seismic data or both to generate one or more edge detection attributes for example where an attribute may be considered a measurable property of seismic data e.g. consider amplitude dip frequency phase polarity etc. . For example an attribute may be a value or a set of values derived from seismic signals seismic data etc. and defined with respect to a coordinate system e.g. one dimensional two dimensional three dimensional four dimensional or of an even higher dimension . As an example a dimension may be a spatial dimension a time dimension a frequency dimension etc. As an example consider providing seismic data as a cube where each voxel volume element in the cube has a value. In such an example an edge detection algorithm may process the values in a cube to generate new values where the new values are referred to collectively as an edge detection attribute e.g. an attribute cube .

As an example a seismic cube e.g. a seismic volume or seismic data for a volume may be processed to generate an attribute cube e.g. an attribute volume or attribute values for a volume . As another example a seismic surface may be processed to generate an attribute surface. As yet another example a seismic line may be processed to generate an attribute line. As an example a seismic point may be processed to generate an attribute point.

Attributes may be derived measured etc. for example at one instant in time for multiple instances in time over a time window etc. and for example may be measured on a single trace on a set of traces on a surface interpreted from seismic data etc. Attribute analysis may include assessment of various parameters for example as to a reservoir consider a hydrocarbon indicator derived from an amplitude variation with offset AVO analysis.

As an example structures in a subterranean environment may be understood better through acquisition of seismic data and processing of acquired seismic data. Acquired seismic data may exhibit a dynamic range of values that may be for example about 40 dB between weakest and strongest reflectors. Such a range of values in a data set e.g. a seismic image etc. can pose issues for edge detection which may be applied for example to uncover highlight etc. structures such as faults fractures etc. Various edge detection algorithms include determining gradients e.g. spatial derivatives of values in a data set . Where dynamic range is large gradient values too are likely to exhibit a large dynamic range. As an example normalization may be applied in conjunction with edge detection for example in an effort to ensure that edges in weak reflectors may be as visible as edges in strong reflectors. As an example a nonlinear normalization technique may be applied that includes for example an adjustable parameter. In various trials such a nonlinear normalization technique demonstrated stability when applied to seismic data e.g. raw or processed seismic data . Output values from application of such a nonlinear normalization technique demonstrated how a selected value of the adjustable parameter can help uncover and highlight structures in a subterranean environment for example for a particular purpose. For example a workflow may aim to determine whether certain structures exist in a subterranean environment and whether those structures exist in some relationship with respect to other structures. In such an example the workflow may implement a selected value of the adjustable parameter or optionally multiple selected values of the adjustable parameter.

As an example a workflow may include a nonlinear normalization analysis where based on workflow type e.g. purpose etc. a predetermined parameter value may be specified for the nonlinear normalization analysis. As an example a workflow may include nonlinear normalization analyses where based on workflow type e.g. purpose etc. one or more predetermined parameter values may be specified for the nonlinear normalization analyses.

As an example a nonlinear normalization technique can be applied to output a more balanced edge attribute for example where edges for both strong and weak reflectors are detected simultaneously. Such an approach may for example diminish a number of procedures in a workflow compared to a workflow where weak and strong reflectors may be processed separately e.g. where processing and visualization occur with normalization turned on and again with normalization turned off .

As an example application of nonlinear normalization analysis or analyses to data may help to uncover highlight etc. small seismic data features e.g. small in time space or both time and space that may be associated with faults fractures etc. e.g. small seismic data features associated with seismic energy interacting with faults fractures etc. .

As an example a method may include accessing or providing wellbore information for example to assist with selection of one or more adjustable parameter values for a nonlinear normalization technique e.g. for use in fracture detection etc. . As an example fault and fracture auto tracking technology such as ant tracking may be applied to one or more processed data sets for example to improve or enhance information e.g. consider ant tracking to generate a fracture image . As an example detecting may include classifying for example where classification information e.g. model information results from previously analyzed data etc. may assist in detecting one or more features that may belong to a class of features e.g. a type of feature .

Below an example of a system is described followed by various technologies including examples of techniques which may for example include applying a nonlinear normalization analysis or analyses to data.

In the example of the management components include a seismic data component an additional information component e.g. well logging data a processing component a simulation component an attribute component an analysis visualization component and a workflow component . In operation seismic data and other information provided per the components and may be input to the simulation component .

In an example embodiment the simulation component may rely on entities . Entities may include earth entities or geological objects such as wells surfaces reservoirs etc. In the system the entities can include virtual representations of actual physical entities that are reconstructed for purposes of simulation. The entities may include entities based on data acquired via sensing observation etc. e.g. the seismic data and other information . An entity may be characterized by one or more properties e.g. a geometrical pillar grid entity of an earth model may be characterized by a porosity property . Such properties may represent one or more measurements e.g. acquired data calculations etc.

In an example embodiment the simulation component may rely on a software framework such as an object based framework. In such a framework entities may include entities based on pre defined classes to facilitate modeling and simulation. A commercially available example of an object based framework is the MICROSOFT .NET framework Redmond Wash. which provides a set of extensible object classes. In the .NET framework an object class encapsulates a module of reusable code and associated data structures. Object classes can be used to instantiate object instances for use in by a program script etc. For example borehole classes may define objects for representing boreholes based on well data.

In the example of the simulation component may process information to conform to one or more attributes specified by the attribute component which may include a library of attributes. Such processing may occur prior to input to the simulation component e.g. consider the processing component . As an example the simulation component may perform operations on input information based on one or more attributes specified by the attribute component . In an example embodiment the simulation component may construct one or more models of the geologic environment which may be relied on to simulate behavior of the geologic environment e.g. responsive to one or more acts whether natural or artificial . In the example of the analysis visualization component may allow for interaction with a model or model based results. As an example output from the simulation component may be input to one or more other workflows as indicated by a workflow component .

As an example the simulation component may include one or more features of a simulator such as the ECLIPSE reservoir simulator Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. the INTERSECT reservoir simulator Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. etc. As an example a reservoir or reservoirs may be simulated with respect to one or more enhanced recovery techniques e.g. consider a thermal process such as SAGD etc. .

In an example embodiment the management components may include features of a commercially available simulation framework such as the PETREL seismic to simulation software framework Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. . The PETREL framework provides components that allow for optimization of exploration and development operations. The PETREL framework includes seismic to simulation software components that can output information for use in increasing reservoir performance for example by improving asset team productivity. Through use of such a framework various professionals e.g. geophysicists geologists and reservoir engineers can develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes. Such a framework may be considered an application and may be considered a data driven application e.g. where data is input for purposes of simulating a geologic environment .

In an example embodiment various aspects of the management components may include add ons or plug ins that operate according to specifications of a framework environment. For example a commercially available framework environment marketed as the OCEAN framework environment Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. allows for integration of add ons or plug ins into a PETREL framework workflow. The OCEAN framework environment leverages .NET tools Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. and offers stable user friendly interfaces for efficient development. In an example embodiment various components may be implemented as add ons or plug ins that conform to and operate according to specifications of a framework environment e.g. according to application programming interface API specifications etc. .

The model simulation layer may provide domain objects act as a data source provide for rendering and provide for various user interfaces Rendering may provide a graphical environment in which applications can display their data while the user interfaces may provide a common look and feel for application user interface components.

In the example of the domain objects can include entity objects property objects and optionally other objects. Entity objects may be used to geometrically represent wells surfaces reservoirs etc. while property objects may be used to provide property values as well as data versions and display parameters. For example an entity object may represent a well where a property object provides log information as well as version information and display information e.g. to display the well as part of a model .

In the example of data may be stored in one or more data sources or data stores generally physical data storage devices which may be at the same or different physical sites and accessible via one or more networks. The model simulation layer may be configured to model projects. As such a particular project may be stored where stored project information may include inputs models results and cases. Thus upon completion of a modeling session a user may store a project. At a later time the project can be accessed and restored using the model simulation layer which can recreate instances of the relevant domain objects.

In the example of the geologic environment may include layers e.g. stratification that include a reservoir and that may be intersected by a fault . As an example the geologic environment may be outfitted with any of a variety of sensors detectors actuators etc. For example equipment may include communication circuitry to receive and to transmit information with respect to one or more networks . Such information may include information associated with downhole equipment which may be equipment to acquire information to assist with resource recovery etc. Other equipment may be located remote from a well site and include sensing detecting emitting or other circuitry. Such equipment may include storage and communication circuitry to store and to communicate data instructions etc. As an example one or more satellites may be provided for purposes of communications data acquisition etc. For example shows a satellite in communication with the network that may be configured for communications noting that the satellite may additionally or alternatively include circuitry for imagery e.g. spatial spectral temporal radiometric etc. .

As mentioned the system may be used to perform one or more workflows. A workflow may be a process that includes a number of worksteps. A workstep may operate on data for example to create new data to update existing data etc. As an example a may operate on one or more inputs and create one or more results for example based on one or more algorithms. As an example a system may include a workflow editor for creation editing executing etc. of a workflow. In such an example the workflow editor may provide for selection of one or more pre defined worksteps one or more customized worksteps etc. As an example a workflow may be a workflow implementable in the PETREL software for example that operates on seismic data seismic attribute s etc. As an example a workflow may be a process implementable in the OCEAN framework. As an example a workflow may include one or more worksteps that access a module such as a plug in e.g. external executable code etc. .

As shown the formation includes a horizontal surface and various subsurface layers. As an example a borehole may be vertical. As another example a borehole may be deviated. In the example of the borehole may be considered a vertical borehole for example where the z axis extends downwardly normal to the horizontal surface of the formation .

As to the convention for dip as shown the three dimensional orientation of a plane can be defined by its dip and strike. Dip is the angle of slope of a plane from a horizontal plane e.g. an imaginary plane measured in a vertical plane in a specific direction. Dip may be defined by magnitude e.g. also known as angle or amount and azimuth e.g. also known as direction . As shown in the convention of various angles indicate angle of slope downwards for example from an imaginary horizontal plane e.g. flat upper surface whereas azimuth refers to the direction towards which a dipping plane slopes e.g. which may be given with respect to degrees compass directions etc. . Another feature shown in the convention of is strike which is the orientation of the line created by the intersection of a dipping plane and a horizontal plane e.g. consider the flat upper surface as being an imaginary horizontal plane .

Some additional terms related to dip and strike may apply to an analysis for example depending on circumstances orientation of collected data etc. One term is true dip see e.g. Dipin the convention of . True dip is the dip of a plane measured directly perpendicular to strike see e.g. line directed northwardly and labeled strike and angle and also the maximum possible value of dip magnitude Another term is apparent dip see e.g. Dipin the convention of . Apparent dip may be the dip of a plane as measured in any other direction except in the direction of true dip see e.g. as Dipfor angle however it is possible that the apparent dip is equal to the true dip see e.g. as Dip Dipfor angle with respect to the strike . In other words where the term apparent dip is used e.g. in a method analysis algorithm etc. for a particular dipping plane a value for apparent dip may be equivalent to the true dip of that particular dipping plane.

As shown in the convention of the dip of a plane as seen in a cross section perpendicular to the strike is true dip see e.g. the surface with 0 as Dip Dipfor angle with respect to the strike . As indicated dip observed in a cross section in any other direction is apparent dip see e.g. surfaces labeled Dip . Further as shown in the convention of apparent dip may be approximately 0 degrees e.g. parallel to a horizontal surface where an edge of a cutting plane runs along a strike direction .

In terms of observing dip in wellbores true dip is observed in wells drilled vertically. In wells drilled in any other orientation or deviation the dips observed are apparent dips e.g. which are referred to by some as relative dips . In order to determine true dip values for planes observed in such boreholes as an example a vector computation e.g. based on the borehole deviation may be applied to one or more apparent dip values.

As mentioned another term that finds use in sedimentological interpretations from borehole images is relative dip e.g. Dip . A value of true dip measured from borehole images in rocks deposited in very calm environments may be subtracted e.g. using vector subtraction from dips in a sand body. In such an example the resulting dips are called relative dips and may find use in interpreting sand body orientation.

A convention such as the convention may be used with respect to an analysis an interpretation an attribute etc. see e.g. various blocks of the system of . As an example various types of features may be described in part by dip e.g. sedimentary bedding faults and fractures cuestas igneous dikes and sills metamorphic foliation etc. .

Seismic interpretation may aim to identify and classify one or more subsurface boundaries based at least in part on one or more dip parameters e.g. angle or magnitude azimuth etc. . As an example various types of features e.g. sedimentary bedding faults and fractures cuestas igneous dikes and sills metamorphic foliation etc. may be described at least in part by angle at least in part by azimuth etc.

As shown in the diagram of a geobody may be present in a geologic environment. For example the geobody may be a salt dome. A salt dome may be a mushroom shaped or plug shaped diapir made of salt and may have an overlying cap rock e.g. or caprock . Salt domes can form as a consequence of the relative buoyancy of salt when buried beneath other types of sediment. For example hydrocarbons may be found at or near a salt dome due to formation of traps due to salt movement in association with evaporite mineral sealing. Buoyancy differentials can cause salt to begin to flow vertically e.g. as a salt pillow which may cause faulting. In the diagram the geobody is met by layers which may each be defined by a dip angle .

As an example seismic data may be acquired for a region in the form of traces. In the example of the diagram shows acquisition equipment emitting energy from a source e.g. a transmitter and receiving reflected energy via one or more sensors e.g. receivers strung along an inline direction. As the region includes layers and the geobody energy emitted by a transmitter of the acquisition equipment can reflect off the layers and the geobody . Evidence of such reflections may be found in the acquired traces. As to the portion of a trace energy received may be discretized by an analog to digital converter that operates at a sampling rate. For example the acquisition equipment may convert energy signals sensed by sensor Q to digital samples at a rate of one sample per approximately 4 ms. Given a speed of sound in a medium or media a sample rate may be converted to an approximate distance. For example the speed of sound in rock may be of the order of around 5 km per second. Thus a sample time spacing of approximately 4 ms would correspond to a sample depth spacing of about 10 meters e.g. assuming a path length from source to boundary and boundary to sensor . As an example a trace may be about 4 seconds in duration thus for a sampling rate of one sample at about 4 ms intervals such a trace would include about 1000 samples where latter acquired samples correspond to deeper reflection boundaries. If the 4 second trace duration of the foregoing example is divided by two e.g. to account for reflection for a vertically aligned source and sensor the deepest boundary depth may be estimated to be about 10 km e.g. assuming a speed of sound of about 5 km per second .

In the example of the system includes one or more information storage devices one or more computers one or more networks and one or more modules . As to the one or more computers each computer may include one or more processors e.g. or processing cores and memory for storing instructions e.g. modules for example executable by at least one of the one or more processors. As an example a computer may include one or more network interfaces e.g. wired or wireless one or more graphics cards a display interface e.g. wired or wireless etc.

In the example of the one or more memory storage devices may store seismic data for a geologic environment that spans kilometers in length and width and for example around 10 km in depth. Seismic data may be acquired with reference to a surface grid e.g. defined with respect to inline and crossline directions . For example given grid blocks of about 40 meters by about 40 meters a 40 km by 40 km field may include about one million traces. Such traces may be considered 3D seismic data where time approximates depth. As an example a computer may include a network interface for accessing seismic data stored in one or more of the storage devices via a network. In turn the computer may process the accessed seismic data via instructions which may be in the form of one or more modules.

As an example one or more attribute modules may be provided for processing seismic data. As an example attributes may include geometrical attributes e.g. dip angle azimuth continuity seismic trace etc. . Such attributes may be part of a structural attributes library see e.g. the attribute component of . Structural attributes may assist with edge detection local orientation and dip of seismic reflectors continuity of seismic events e.g. parallel to estimated bedding orientation etc. As an example an edge may be defined as a discontinuity in horizontal amplitude continuity within seismic data and correspond to a fault a fracture etc. Geometrical attributes may be spatial attributes and rely on multiple traces.

As mentioned as an example seismic data for a region may include one million traces where each trace includes one thousand samples for a total of one billion samples. Resources involved in processing such seismic data in a timely manner may be relatively considerable by today s standards. As an example a dip scan approach may be applied to seismic data which involves processing seismic data with respect to discrete planes e.g. a volume bounded by discrete planes . Depending on the size of the seismic data such an approach may involve considerable resources for timely processing. Such an approach may look at local coherence between traces and their amplitudes and therefore may be classified in the category of apparent dip. 

As an example imagery such as surface imagery e.g. satellite geological geophysical etc. may be processed using a nonlinear normalization technique. As an example a method may analyze imagery using a nonlinear normalization technique to illustrate latent structure optionally in conjunction with non latent structure. As an example a framework may access surface imagery and may access sub surface seismic data and generate a three dimensional representation e.g. for visualization of surface structure and sub surface structure which may be joined via an interpolation process or other process. For example a latent structure may be captured by seismology and by satellite imagery and a model constructed based at least in part on a nonlinear normalization analysis of seismic data and surface imagery.

As an example ant tracking may be performed as part of a workflow which may include for example performing nonlinear normalization analysis on data and then generating ant track data from which for example features may be extracted e.g. patches . In turn such features may be subject to one or more of validation editing or other process. Ant tracking may generate an ant tracking attribute an ant tracking surface an ant tracking volume e.g. or cube etc.

Ant tracking may include using an algorithm that by analogy involves ants finding the shortest path between their nest and their food source e.g. by communicating using pheromones to attract other ants . In such an example the shortest path becomes marked with more pheromones than longer paths such that subsequent ants are more likely to choose the shortest path and so on.

Where features may be latent e.g. latent structure for example due to noise acquisition footprint etc. performing nonlinear normalization analysis prior to ant tracking may enhance the ability to track the latent features particularly where the features have some amount of continuity e.g. contiguous within a surface a volume etc. . For example fractures generated by a fracturing process e.g. consider hydraulic fracturing can tend to be relatively small e.g. compared to faults and contiguous.

As to the linear equation for example if a range of values of a data set is from 50 to 180 and a desired range is 0 to 255 a linear normalization technique can include subtracting 50 from each of the values making the range from 0 to 130 followed by multiplication by 255 130 to make the range from 0 to 255.

As to the equation of the sigmoid technique it can focus on a particular range of values and progressively attenuate values outside that range. In the equation I is the input value Iis the output value Iis the difference between the new minimum also I nmin and maximum values defines the width of the input value range and defines the value around which the range is centered.

As an example the Sobel filter may include two 3 3 kernels which are convolved with an original image to estimate horizontal and vertical derivatives which may be output as derivative images Gx and Gy. As an example a gradient value e.g. gradient magnitude or gradient image may be generated based on Gx and Gy for example as indicated by the equation .

In the gradient kernel is shown as being a 1 0 1 kernel for an x direction and the gradient kernel is shown as being a 1 0 1 kernel for a y direction. Examples of data values e.g. intensity values are shown for example with reference to the data where values range from 0 to 255.

In the nonlinear normalization equations and include a term in the denominator e.g. a nonlinear normalization term that includes a parameter k. In particular the nonlinear normalization terms in two dimensions may be represented by the following equation I x y .

In the nonlinear normalization equations and may be referred to as mixed gradient and intensity equations. For example each of the equations includes at least one gradient value and at least one intensity value. While intensity is mentioned it may be raw data processed data etc. For example the nomenclature I may refer to an attribute value whereas the nomenclature G refers to a gradient based on a plurality of attribute values.

As to the parameter k where k is equal to 1 the nonlinear normalization equation can normalize gradient values linearly with respect to I e.g. I I whereas as k increases for example to 10 the nonlinear normalization diminishes e.g. reaching a limit of no normalization because as the value of k increases the term 1 k approaches zero for example I x y raised to a power of about 0 would be approximately unity . As an example where k 2 the nonlinear normalization may be referred to as square normalization and where k 3 the nonlinear normalization may be referred to as cubic normalization. As an example as k approaches zero the output may be compressed e.g. to values less than the un normalized gradient magnitude G . As an example k may be a number which may be an integer or a real number. As an example k may be a number different than unity. As an example k may be a number less than one. As an example k may be a number greater than one. As an example k may be a number less than one or k may be a number greater than one.

As shown in the method includes a provision block for providing data values for a region a determination block for determining a gradient magnitude value based on at least a portion of the data values a normalization block for normalizing the gradient magnitude value using a nonlinear normalization equation that includes a gradient magnitude variable divided by a normalization variable raised to a power that depends on an adjustable parameter and an output block for outputting the normalized gradient magnitude value. In such an example the data values for a region may be or include seismic data values for a subsurface region. In such an example the subsurface region may include a reflector. For example the seismic data values may be values based at least in part on energy reflected from a reflector e.g. a subsurface structure etc. .

As an example the method may include providing data values for a region where the data values are or include imagery data values. As an example imagery data values may be X ray NMR microwave etc. or other imagery data values. As an example data values may be acquired via satellite equipment. As an example satellite equipment may be configured to acquire data in one or more a visible a panchromatic a mid infrared a thermal infrared or other region of an electromagnetic spectrum e.g. consider LANDSAT data and or other types of satellite data . As an example data values may include information as to climate e.g. temperature wind water currents clouds rain snow ice etc. . As an example data values may be acquired using one or more remote sensing technologies e.g. radar etc. . As an example data values may be or include data values acquired via a sensor array or sensor arrays e.g. as in a camera X ray detector etc. . As an example a method may include detecting one or more edges in imagery data.

As an example input values may be gradient values and a nonlinear normalization equation may include a non gradient value as a variable such that gradient values are normalized by non gradient values e.g. intensity values .

As an example a gradient value or gradient values may be determined using a kernel or kernels that center on a spatial location for example where a value for that spatial location is used for normalizing a gradient value or for normalizing gradient values. For example the equations and of can nonlinearly normalize a gradient value based on a non gradient value e.g. an intensity value for a spatial location .

As an example a subsurface region e.g. a subterranean environment may include reflectors. As an example such reflectors may include different classes of reflectors. For example depending on reflection properties a reflector may be classified as to how much energy it reflects for example along a spectrum from weak to strong.

As an example a reflector may be an interface between layers of contrasting acoustic optical or electromagnetic properties. In such an example waves of electromagnetism heat light and sound may be reflected at such an interface. As an example as to seismic data a reflector might represent a change in lithology a fault an unconformity etc. As an example a reflector may be expressed as a reflection e.g. or reflections in seismic data.

As an example an adjustable parameter may be selected based on at least in part on a class or classes of reflectors. As an example reflectors may include a strong class of reflectors and a weak class of reflectors.

As an example a method may be performed at least in part using a computing device a system that includes one or more processors etc.

As an example low amplitude reflectors may have low amplitude gradients e.g. a relatively large change in a small value range remains a small value . Referring to the processed data values where lateral changes in the strong reflector near center e.g. location indicated by the cross hairs stand out however a fault to the far left e.g. surrounded by weak reflectors is less visible. As an example to make edge detection insensitive to reflector amplitude a method can include normalizing the spatial derivatives by the magnitude of the seismic amplitudes.

Referring to the processed data values the lateral derivative values in the inline direction are normalized by the magnitude i.e. absolute value of the lateral derivative with the factor I 1 1 I where I is the amplitude of the seismic data value at the location for which the derivative is determined e.g. a centered spatial location . As seen in the fault to the left in the image is highlighted while lateral changes for the strong reflector are more muted.

As an example a method may include highlighting lateral changes for both the strong and the weak reflectors simultaneously in the seismic data values . Referring to the processed data values normalization may use as an example the term I Sqrt I which provides for highlighting changes in both the strong and the weak reflectors.

As an example a method can include normalizing a gradient value e.g. gradient magnitude etc. using a term I 1 k . For example a method can include normalizing the lateral derivative of seismic data values with the term I 1 k where k is a number e.g. integer fraction rational complex etc. and where I is a positive value for example representative of a value range of numbers used to calculate a derivative or derivatives e.g. center value mean value max value etc. .

Referring to the processed seismic data values strong reflectors can more strongly indicate the presence of a fault than the weak reflectors. As an example a method may include correcting for under estimation of edges for weak reflectors. In such a method normalization may be applied. For example a normalization factor may aim to represent the strength of the reflectors for example using amplitude magnitude for center pixel used in the gradient calculation amplitude magnitude for strongest pixel used in the gradient calculation mean amplitude magnitude for considered pixel values RMS or mean amplitude magnitude in a spatial window in the proximity of the center pixel. Of these examples amplitude magnitude finds use for example in determination of coherency variance and amplitude contrast seismic attributes. However when such an approach is applied for very weak reflectors it can be unstable because of risk of division by zero.

As an example a method may include normalizing based at leas in part on an amplitude magnitude for a strongest pixel used in a gradient determination. For example referring to the maximum amplitude magnitude for the gradient determinations and is 255 e.g. greatest intensity of the three in an x direction kernel or a y direction kernel .

Referring to and processed seismic data values these result from normalization using the strongest seismic data value within a gradient determination kernel e.g. or kernels . As shown edges for weak reflectors are now more visible and overall the result appears intuitively better than for the processed seismic data values of .

As an example consider that a normalization proportional to the amplitude energy level of the reflectors at hand may tend to under estimate the presence of discontinuities for strong reflectors. Such a tendency finds support in practical and empirical aspects as to the nature of seismic reflections. Accordingly as an example depending on what may be desired from an investigation e.g. a workflow a smaller norm may be appropriate for strong reflectors than for weak reflectors.

As an example consider seismic waves propagating through the underground to be measured by pressure sensors or accelerometers. Both of these types of sensors measure the energy level of the propagating acoustic and elastic wave propagation not the magnitude amplitude of the waves. Amplitude may be considered to be proportional to the square root of energy and energy of seismic signals can tend to be proportional to the square of amplitude. Given such considerations a norm proportional to the square root of recorded energy level may be appropriate for example depending on desired outcome e.g. of a workflow etc. . Thus as an example a strong reflector may have a comparatively smaller norm than a weak reflector where the square root of the norm is used to scale gradient values.

As an example for a two dimensional scenario the following equation may be provided Result Sqrt norm 1 

in the foregoing example equation dIx may represent the spatial derivative of an image e.g. for the point x y in the x direction and dIy may represent the spatial derivative of the image e.g. for the point x y in the y direction. As an example the norm value may be a representative value of the strength of the data the pixel the voxel the sample etc. and k may be a predefined value or for example a user defined value e.g. optionally a constant . As an example a method may include a default setting for the parameter k for example k is set to be equal to 2 e.g. to take the square root of the norm as the actual norm used .

In the processed data values correspond to k 2 and a comparison can be made to the processed data values where no modified norm is used. From such a comparison strong reflectors can have a much more pronounced edge indication while the more noisy parts of the weak reflectors have been somewhat muted which may be deemed a desirable result.

As an example a seismic edge detection process may include computing spatial derivatives along an estimated local 3D layering e.g. dip correction and also adding an element of vertical smoothing for example to help ensure continuity in the vertical depth domain dimension. Where these two techniques are applied e.g. dip correction and vertical smoothing one arrives at the processed seismic data of . The processed seismic data of corresponds to the processed seismic data of with dip corrected spatial derivatives and vertical smoothing e.g. with a radius of two samples in the vertical dimension .

In the processed seismic data corresponds to a comparable horizontal section time slice result using the variance seismic attribute parameters 3 3 7 in the PETREL framework.

The processed seismic data corresponds to normalized edge result using k 1. As seen in many small discontinuities exist throughout the processed seismic data noting that for k 1 results are sensitive to low amplitude noise.

The processed seismic data correspond to a normalized edge result using k 1.5 and the processed seismic data corresponds to a normalized edge result using k 2 i.e. squared normalization .

The processed seismic data correspond to a normalized edge result using k 99 e.g. normalization approximately unity which means that practically no amplitude correction is applied. As such strong reflectors can dominate the result noting that some faults are well mapped for this k value.

The processed seismic data correspond to a comparable vertical section inline result using the variance seismic attribute parameters 3 3 7 in the PETREL framework.

As an example the method may include a process block for processing such as ant tracking. For example where particular structural features are highlighted in output results using one or more of the parameter k values ant tracking may be applied to those results. Such an approach may facilitate determination of locations of structures that may be indicated by weak reflectors strong reflectors or weak and strong reflectors in seismic data values e.g. from a seismic study of a subterranean environment .

As an example a method may include detecting faults that stem from old earthquakes oil accumulations artificial fracturing e.g. hydraulic fracturing etc. As an example a method may include detecting features and mapping such feature prior to drilling for example to avoid drilling through active faults. For example a method such as the method may be implemented to uncover and or highlight active faults.

As an example a method may include tracking changes in a subterranean environment with respect to time. For example changes may be due to artificial fractures sedimentation as to depletion of a reservoir etc. Such a method may include assessing different generations of seismic data one data another data set etc. and examining processed data for differences e.g. as an indication of a response to pressure production injection etc. .
