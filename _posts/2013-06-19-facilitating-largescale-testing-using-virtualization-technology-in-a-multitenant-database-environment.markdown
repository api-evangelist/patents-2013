The subject matter discussed in the background section should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of its mention in the background section. Similarly a problem mentioned in the background section or associated with the subject matter of the background section should not be assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. The subject matter in the background section merely represents different approaches which in and of themselves may also be inventions.

In conventional database systems users access their data resources in one logical database. A user of such a conventional system typically retrieves data from and stores data on the system using the user s own systems. A user system might remotely access one of a plurality of server systems that might in turn access the database system. Data retrieval from the system might include the issuance of a query from the user system to the database system. The database system might process the request for information received in the query and send information relevant to the request to the user system.

Unfortunately defects in software that is run in a database environment may affect all users running the same version of the software. Conventional testing of software in a database environment can be inefficient especially when the testing requires a substantial amount of resources.

Embodiments provide mechanisms and methods for testing in a database system. In one embodiment a method includes receiving an indication of one or more changes to a software application wherein each change corresponds to a different version of the software application. The method further includes generating one or more virtual machines for a version of the software application in response to the indication wherein the one or more virtual machines test the version of the software application.

While one or more implementations and techniques are described one or more embodiments may be implemented in a system having an application server providing a front end for an on demand database service capable of supporting multiple tenants. The embodiments described herein are not limited to multi tenant databases or deployment on application servers. Embodiments may be practiced using other database architectures i.e. ORACLE DB2 by IBM and the like without departing from the scope of the embodiments claimed.

Any of the above embodiments may be used alone or together with one another in any combination. Embodiments described herein may also include embodiments that are only partially mentioned or alluded to or are not mentioned or alluded to at all in this brief summary or in the abstract. Although various embodiments may have been motivated by various deficiencies with the prior art which may be discussed or alluded to in one or more places in the specification the embodiments do not necessarily address any of these deficiencies. In other words different embodiments may address different deficiencies that may be discussed in the specification. Some embodiments may only partially address some deficiencies or just one deficiency that may be discussed in the specification and some embodiments may not address any of these deficiencies.

Systems and methods are provided for facilitating large scale testing using virtualization technology in a multi tenant database environment.

As used herein the term multi tenant database system refers to those systems in which various elements of hardware and software of the database system may be shared by one or more customers. For example a given application server may simultaneously process requests for a great number of customers and a given database table may store rows for a potentially much greater number of customers.

Next mechanisms and methods for facilitating large scale testing using virtualization technology in a multi tenant database environment twill be described with reference to example embodiments.

Embodiments described herein enable facilitate and manage the testing of a software application in a database environment such as an on demand database services system. Such testing may include for example the testing of changes to software used in a database system. Such changes are tracked using change lists. As described in more detail below virtual machines are dynamically generated to provide pristine testing environments for each version of a given software application. Upon completion of the testing the virtual machines are torn down to free up resources for new tests.

In one embodiment server stores test environment templates for test environments in test environment template storage where each test environment template may include one or more virtual machines that perform a set of functional tests. A virtual machine as used herein may among other things run test cases within the database environment as a process separate from other executing applications and instructions. In one implementation a virtual machine is created when the testing process begins. The virtual machine may also provide the specifications used to test a particular version of software used in a database environment. In one embodiment each test version of software may for example include changes to the software application.

In one embodiment server copies a test environment template from test environment template storage to cluster datastore . Each test environment template may be a virtual machine VM disk where the VM disk performs a given set of tests. As described in more detail below multiple clones of the VM disk may be stored in datastore . These clones may be referred to as VM disk clones.

In one embodiment server may represent blade servers connected via double data rate DDR Infiniband to virtualized input output IO directors which are further connected via a fiber channel and gigabit Ethernet to the rest of the network and storage arrays. In one embodiment eight systems may be grouped into a distributed resource scheduler DRS cluster datastore. In one embodiment each cluster datastore may be treated as a single computing resource and each cluster datastore has its own datastore e.g. one terabyte etc. . In one embodiment test environment templates may be accessed and sourced from a network storage cluster. In one embodiment a custom built Java servlet e.g. AutobuildRunner may run on any suitable clustered operating system e.g. Linux which provides the automated interface to the test harness. In one embodiment communications with server may be conducted using any suitable tool e.g. a Java toolkit .

In one embodiment a developer checks in a change to the core code line of a software application. This check in process may be referred to as a code revision check in. In one embodiment as long as the change does not consist solely of comments the change will be tested. In one embodiment a change is not eligible for use e.g. for performance etc. until it has passed functional testing. In one embodiment each new change corresponds to a new version of the software application. In one embodiment the terms code software code software and software application are used interchangeably. Also the terms revision and version are used interchangeably. Also the terms change and change list are used interchangeably.

In one embodiment the testing of the software application is not performed on a local server of a developer which could take days to perform but is instead performed by system which provides a pristine test environment configured specifically for that version of the software application. As indicated above with respect to one or more test environment templates are stored in test environment template storage or any other suitable storage location.

In block system generates one or more virtual machines to test each version of the software application. In one embodiment the virtual machines are the VM disk clones . The terms virtual machine and virtual machine disk clone are used interchangeably. In one embodiment system generates VM disk clones in response to the indication of one or more changes to the software application.

In one embodiment to generate the virtual machines system retrieves a copy of a test environment template from test environment template storage and stores the copy in VM disk of cluster database . In one embodiment one copy of the test environment template is copied to cluster database . In one embodiment if another base test environment is needed a different test environment template may be copied to another cluster database in order to provide another set of test environments. In one embodiment after copying the test environment template to VM disk system generates one or more VM disk clones for each version of the software application.

In one embodiment system checks if the date stamp on each test environment template has changed within a predetermined time period e.g. in the last 24 hours etc. . If the date stamp has changed system copies the test environment template to cluster datastore to update VM disk with the new base image for the virtual machines. This ensures that all virtual machines e.g. VM disk clones have the latest database schema changes for testing the software application and that all virtual machines are built from an identical base.

In one embodiment there may be millions of different functional tests to be performed e.g. over 7 million different functional tests on every version of the software application. Failures are then reported back to the developer. Accordingly the amount of time required to test a given version may vary depending on the actual number of tests and the number of resources made available to perform the functional tests. In one embodiment all code changes e.g. every iteration of code may be required to go through the functional testing process as part of defect analysis. The functional tests ensure that each version of the software application works properly before being released.

In one embodiment the number of VM disk clones generated for each version of the software application will depend on the specific implementation. The VM disk clones may be generated by any suitable clone generation tool e.g. open source tool . For a given run of a set of functional tests e.g. 7 million functional tests it may take one VM disk clone a certain number of days to complete the run e.g. 1 day 1.5 days 2 days etc. . Having more VM disk clones available e.g. 5 10 15 or more VM disk clones will reduce the total amount of time required to run through the set of functional tests e.g. 1 hour 1.5 hours 2 hours etc. . Accordingly if more time to test the software code is acceptable system may generate a fewer number e.g. one or two etc. of VM disk clones . If a shorter time period for testing is desired system may generate a larger number e.g. 70 or more etc. .

In one embodiment system notes newly arrived change lists and thereafter schedules the change list into a queue and processes the queue to determine if there is capacity on cluster datastore to build virtual machines e.g. VM disk clones to run the tests. In one embodiment optimal capacity as determined via testing will depend on the implementation. For example in one embodiment there may be 50 virtual machines in an 8 node cluster. In one embodiment if there is available capacity the program flow for testing continues. If there is not enough capacity the queue for initiating the functional tests sleeps for a predetermined time period e.g. for 5 minutes and repeats until there is capacity.

In one embodiment system may issue application programming interface API requests using an open source tool e.g. VI Java Toolkit to create new virtual machines for the functional tests. In one embodiment in the creation of virtual machines each new virtual machine may be created with a backing store type of VM disk clone using VM disk . Because VM disk is used as a base and is not copied the time required for the creation is less than 10 seconds. In one embodiment as part of an API call a customized specification may be created so that each virtual machine will receive a unique fixed IP address on boot. Also a power on command using the API may be issued to all new virtual machines.

In one embodiment each VM disk clone is initially empty and redirects certain commands e.g. certain types of commands to VM disk in response to the commands. For example in one embodiment VM disk clones may direct read commands to VM disk . Accordingly all VM disk clones redirect read commands to the same VM disk .

In one embodiment all writes are sent to and are processed by the different VM disk clones . As a result changes to the software code affect only one VM disk clone . Furthermore any change to specific code of the software application is stored at the particular VM disk clone . Accordingly each VM disk clone provides a different test environment and tests a particular version of the software application. For ease of illustration shows four VM disk clones . There may be hundreds of VM disk clones for testing hundreds of corresponding versions of the software application each version having a different change. Furthermore additional VM disk clones may be quickly and dynamically generated as needed to accommodate new versions of the software application. As such every version of the software application gets its own separate pristine test environment for applying the same set of functional tests e.g. 7 million functional test etc. .

In one embodiment system may sleep for a predetermined time period e.g. 60 seconds while it waits for all of the virtual machines to be customized and booted. In one embodiment system then attempts to apply a secure shell SSH connection to all virtual machines. If the SSH connection succeeds system moves to the next step. If the SSH connection fails system sleeps for a predetermined time period e.g. for 60 seconds and then repeats the SSH connection attempt.

In block system causes the one or more virtual machines to perform functional testing on each version of the software application. In one embodiment once all virtual machines e.g. VM disk clones are ready system issues commands to those virtual machines giving them the change list to download from the source management system and the subset of tests that they are required to run.

As each virtual machine runs its set of functional tests it reports successes and failures back to system e.g. using simple object access protocol SOAP calls . As each virtual machine completes its final test it performs a final SOAP call and indicates the results to system . Upon receipt of a completion notice from a virtual machine system collects basic performance statistics for capacity planning purposes unregisters the virtual machine and deletes its private VM disk.

In one embodiment the process of generating new virtual machines and testing new versions of a software application may occur hundreds of times every day e.g. 500 times a day etc. performing numerous tests e.g. over 5 billion etc. per day across many clusters e.g. 20 etc. .

In block system tears down the one or more virtual machines after they complete the functional testing. In one embodiment the tearing down the virtual machines frees up resources to generate new virtual machines to test new versions of the software application.

Embodiments describe herein provide numerous benefits. For example embodiments provide pristine test environments for applying the same functional tests to each version of a software application. Embodiments quickly generate and deploy test environments for the different versions of the software application e.g. on demand and in seconds . Embodiments also enable test environment management efforts to be focused on test environment templates instead of individual virtual machine disks as well as dynamically reallocating capacity across different test environments used by different branches. Furthermore leveraging the VM disk clones saves a significant amount of time in generating virtual machines as well as shared storage disk space due to the homogeneity in the entire server farm.

Environment is an environment in which an on demand database service exists. User system may be any machine or system that is used by a user to access a database user system. For example any of user systems can be a handheld computing device a mobile phone a laptop computer a work station and or a network of computing devices. As illustrated in and in more detail in user systems might interact via a network with an on demand database service which is system . System may also be referred to as a cloud service provider. System provides its resources to customers e.g. end users as a service.

An on demand database service such as system is a database system that is made available to outside users who do not need to necessarily be concerned with building and or maintaining the database system but instead may be available for more general use when the users need the database system e.g. on the demand of the users . Some on demand database services may store information from one or more tenants stored into tables of a common database image to form a multi tenant database system MTS . Accordingly on demand database service and system will be used interchangeably herein. A database image may include one or more database objects. A relational database management system RDMS or the equivalent may execute storage and retrieval of information against the database object s . Application platform may be a framework that allows the applications of system to run such as the hardware and or software e.g. the operating system. In an embodiment system may include an application platform that enables creating managing and executing one or more applications developed for an on demand database service for users accessing the on demand database service via user systems or for third party application developers accessing the on demand database service via user systems .

The users of user systems may differ in their respective capacities and the capacity of a particular user system might be entirely determined by permissions permission levels for the current user. For example where a salesperson is using a particular user system to interact with system that user system has the capacities allotted to that salesperson. However while an administrator is using that user system to interact with system that user system has the capacities allotted to that administrator. In systems with a hierarchical role model users at one permission level may have access to applications data and database information accessible by a lower permission level user but may not have access to certain applications database information and data accessible by a user at a higher permission level. Thus different users will have different capabilities with regard to accessing and modifying application and database information depending on a user s security or permission level.

Network is any network or combination of networks of devices that communicate with one another. For example network can be any one or any combination of a local area network LAN wide area network WAN telephone network wireless network point to point network star network token ring network hub network or other appropriate configuration. As the most common type of computer network in current use is a transfer control protocol and Internet protocol TCP IP network such as the global internetwork of networks often referred to as the Internet with a capital I. That network will be used in many of the examples herein. However it should be understood that the networks used with the embodiment described herein use are not so limited although TCP IP is a frequently implemented protocol.

User systems might communicate with system using TCP IP and at a higher network level use other common Internet protocols to communicate such as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP file transfer protocol FTP Andrew file system AFS wireless application protocol WAP etc. In an example where HTTP is used user system might include an HTTP client commonly referred to as a browser for sending and receiving HTTP messages to and from an HTTP server at system . Such an HTTP server might be implemented as the sole network interface between system and network but other techniques might be used as well or instead. In some implementations the interface between system and network includes load sharing functionality such as round robin HTTP request distributors to balance loads and distribute incoming HTTP requests evenly over a plurality of servers. At least as for the users that are accessing that server each of the plurality of servers has access to the MTS data however other alternative configurations may be used instead.

In one embodiment system shown in implements a web based customer relationship management CRM system. For example in one embodiment system includes application servers configured to implement and execute CRM software applications as well as to provide related data code forms webpages and other information to and from user systems . The application servers are also configured to store to and retrieve from a database system related data objects and Webpage content. With a multi tenant system data for multiple tenants may be stored in the same physical database object. Tenant data may be arranged such that data of one tenant is kept logically separate from that of other tenants so that one tenant does not have access to another tenant s data unless such data is expressly shared. In certain embodiments system implements applications other than or in addition to a CRM application. For example system may provide tenant access to multiple hosted standard and custom applications including a CRM application. User or third party application developer software applications which may or may not include CRM may be supported by the application platform which manages the creation and storage of the applications into one or more database objects and executing of the applications in a virtual machine in the process space of the system . The terms software application and application are used interchangeably.

One arrangement for elements of system is shown in including a network interface application platform tenant data storage for tenant data system data storage for system data accessible to system and possibly multiple tenants program code for implementing various functions of system and a process space for executing MTS system processes and tenant specific processes such as running applications as part of an application hosting service. Additional processes that may execute on system include database indexing processes.

Several elements in the system shown in include conventional well known elements that are explained only briefly here. For example each user system could include a desktop personal computer workstation laptop PDA cell phone or any wireless access protocol WAP enabled device or any other computing device capable of interfacing directly or indirectly to the Internet or other network connection. User system typically runs an HTTP client e.g. a browsing program such as Microsoft s Internet Explorer browser Netscape s Navigator browser Opera s browser or a WAP enabled browser in the case of a cell phone PDA or other wireless device or the like allowing a user e.g. subscriber of the multi tenant database system of user system to access process and view information pages and applications available to it from system over network . Each user system also typically includes one or more user interface devices such as a keyboard a mouse trackball touch pad touch screen pen or the like for interacting with a graphical user interface GUI provided by the browser on a display e.g. a monitor screen liquid crystal display LCD monitor etc. in conjunction with pages forms applications and other information provided by system or other systems or servers. For example the user interface device can be used to access data and applications hosted by system and to perform searches on stored data and otherwise allow a user to interact with various GUI pages that may be presented to a user. As discussed above embodiments are suitable for use with the Internet which refers to a specific global internetwork of networks. However it should be understood that other networks can be used instead of the Internet such as an intranet an extranet a virtual private network VPN a non TCP IP based network any LAN or WAN or the like.

According to one embodiment each user system and all of its components are operator configurable using applications such as a browser including computer code run using a central processing unit such as an Intel Pentium processor or the like. Similarly system and additional instances of an MTS where more than one is present and all of their components might be operator configurable using application s including computer code to run using a central processing unit such as processor system which may include an Intel Pentium processor or the like and or multiple processor units. A computer program product embodiment includes a machine readable storage medium media having instructions stored thereon in which can be used to program a computer to perform any of the processes of the embodiments described herein. Computer code for operating and configuring system to intercommunicate and to process webpages applications and other data and media content as described herein are preferably downloaded and stored on a hard disk but the entire program code or portions thereof may also be stored in any other volatile or non volatile memory medium or device as is well known such as a read only memory ROM or random access memory RAM or provided on any media capable of storing program code such as any type of rotating media including floppy disks optical discs digital versatile disk DVD compact disk CD microdrive and magneto optical disks and magnetic or optical cards nanosystems including molecular memory integrated circuits ICs or any type of media or device suitable for storing instructions and or data. Additionally the entire program code or portions thereof may be transmitted and downloaded from a software source over a transmission medium e.g. over the Internet or from another server as is well known or transmitted over any other conventional network connection as is well known e.g. extranet virtual private network VPN LAN etc. using any communication medium and protocols e.g. TCP IP HTTP HTTPS Ethernet etc. as are well known. It will also be appreciated that computer code for implementing embodiments can be implemented in any programming language that can be executed on a client system and or server or server system such as for example C C HTML any other markup language Java JavaScript ActiveX any other scripting language such as VBScript and many other programming languages as are well known may be used. Java is a trademark of Sun Microsystems Inc. .

According to one embodiment each system is configured to provide webpages forms applications data and media content to user client systems to support the access by user systems as tenants of system . As such system provides security mechanisms to keep each tenant s data separate unless the data is shared. If more than one MTS is used they may be located in close proximity to one another e.g. in a server farm located in a single building or campus or they may be distributed at locations remote from one another e.g. one or more servers located in city A and one or more servers located in city B . As used herein each MTS could include one or more logically and or physically connected servers distributed locally or across one or more geographic locations. Additionally the term server is meant to include a computer system including processing hardware and process space s and an associated storage system and database application e.g. object oriented database management system OODBMS or rational database management system RDBMS as is well known in the art. It should also be understood that server system and server are often used interchangeably herein. Similarly the database object described herein can be implemented as single databases a distributed database a collection of distributed databases a database with redundant online or offline backups or other redundancies etc. and might include a distributed database or storage network and associated processing intelligence.

User system network system tenant data storage and system data storage were discussed above in . Regarding user system processor system A may be any combination of one or more processors. Memory system B may be any combination of one or more memory devices short term and or long term memory. Input system C may be any combination of input devices such as one or more keyboards mice trackballs scanners cameras and or interfaces to networks. Output system D may be any combination of output devices such as one or more monitors printers and or interfaces to networks. As shown in system may include a network interface of implemented as a set of HTTP application servers an application platform tenant data storage and system data storage . Also shown is system process space including individual tenant process spaces and a tenant management process space . Each application server may be configured to tenant data storage and the tenant data therein and system data storage and the system data therein to serve requests of user systems . The tenant data might be divided into individual tenant storage areas which can be either a physical arrangement and or a logical arrangement of data. Within each tenant storage area user storage and application metadata might be similarly allocated for each user. For example a copy of a user s most recently used MRU items might be stored to user storage . Similarly a copy of MRU items for an entire organization that is a tenant might be stored to tenant storage area . A UI provides a user interface and an API provides an application programmer interface to system resident processes and to users and or developers at user systems . The tenant data and the system data may be stored in various databases such as one or more Oracle databases.

Application platform includes an application setup mechanism that supports application developers creation and management of applications which may be saved as metadata into tenant data storage by save routines for execution by subscribers as one or more tenant process spaces managed by tenant management process for example. Invocations to such applications may be coded using PL SOQL that provides a programming language style interface extension to API . Invocations to applications may be detected by one or more system processes which manage retrieving application metadata for the subscriber making the invocation and executing the metadata as an application in a virtual machine.

Each application server may be communicably coupled to database systems e.g. having access to system data and tenant data via a different network connection. For example one application server might be coupled via the network e.g. the Internet another application server might be coupled via a direct network link and another application server might be coupled by yet a different network connection. Transfer control protocol and Internet protocol TCP IP are typical protocols for communicating between application servers and the database system. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other transport protocols may be used to optimize the system depending on the network connection used.

In certain embodiments each application server is configured to handle requests for any user associated with any organization that is a tenant. Because it is desirable to be able to add and remove application servers from the server pool at any time for any reason there is preferably no server affinity for a user and or organization to a specific application server . In one embodiment therefore an interface system implementing a load balancing function e.g. an F5 Big IP load balancer is communicably coupled between the application servers and the user systems to distribute requests to the application servers . In one embodiment the load balancer uses a least connections algorithm to route user requests to the application servers . Other examples of load balancing algorithms such as round robin and observed response time also can be used. For example in certain embodiments three consecutive requests from the same user could hit three different application servers and three requests from different users could hit the same application server . In this manner system is multi tenant wherein system handles the storage of and access to different objects data and applications across disparate users and organizations.

As an example of storage one tenant might be a company that employs a sales force where each salesperson uses system to manage his or her sales process. Thus a user might maintain contact data leads data customer follow up data performance data goals and progress data etc. all applicable to that user s personal sales process e.g. in tenant data storage . In an example of an MTS arrangement since all of the data and the applications to access view modify report transmit calculate etc. can be maintained and accessed by a user system having nothing more than network access the user can manage his or her sales efforts and cycles from any of many different user systems. For example if a salesperson is visiting a customer and the customer has Internet access in their lobby the salesperson can obtain critical updates as to that customer while waiting for the customer to arrive in the lobby.

While each user s data might be separate from other users data regardless of the employers of each user some data might be organization wide data shared or accessible by a plurality of users or all of the users for a given organization that is a tenant. Thus there might be some data structures managed by system that are allocated at the tenant level while other data structures might be managed at the user level. Because an MTS might support multiple tenants including possible competitors the MTS should have security protocols that keep data applications and application use separate. Also because many tenants may opt for access to an MTS rather than maintain their own system redundancy up time and backup are additional functions that may be implemented in the MTS. In addition to user specific data and tenant specific data system might also maintain system level data usable by multiple tenants or other data. Such system level data might include industry reports news postings and the like that are sharable among tenants.

In certain embodiments user systems which may be client systems communicate with application servers to request and update system level and tenant level data from system that may require sending one or more queries to tenant data storage and or system data storage . System e.g. an application server in system automatically generates one or more structured query language SQL statements e.g. one or more SQL queries that are designed to access the desired information. System data storage may generate query plans to access the requested data from the database.

Each database can generally be viewed as a collection of objects such as a set of logical tables containing data fitted into predefined categories. A table is one representation of a data object and may be used herein to simplify the conceptual description of objects and custom objects according to the embodiments described herein. It should be understood that table and object may be used interchangeably herein. Each table generally contains one or more data categories logically arranged as columns or fields in a viewable schema. Each row or record of a table contains an instance of data for each category defined by the fields. For example a CRM database may include a table that describes a customer with fields for basic contact information such as name address phone number fax number etc. Another table might describe a purchase order including fields for information such as customer product sale price date etc. In some multi tenant database systems standard entity tables might be provided for use by all tenants. For CRM database applications such standard entities might include tables for Account Contact Lead and Opportunity data each containing pre defined fields. It should be understood that the word entity may also be used interchangeably herein with object and table .

In some multi tenant database systems tenants may be allowed to create and store custom objects or they may be allowed to customize standard entities or objects for example by creating custom fields for standard objects including custom index fields. In certain embodiments for example all custom entity data rows are stored in a single multi tenant physical table which may contain multiple logical tables per organization. It is transparent to customers that their multiple tables are in fact stored in one large table or that their data may be stored in the same table as the data of other customers.

Any suitable programming language can be used to implement the routines of particular embodiments including C C Java assembly language etc. Different programming techniques can be employed such as procedural or object oriented. The routines can execute on a single processing device or multiple processors.

A processor includes any suitable hardware and or software system mechanism or component that processes data signals or other information. A processor can include a system with a general purpose central processing unit multiple processing units dedicated circuitry for achieving functionality or other systems. Processing need not be limited to a geographic location or have temporal limitations. For example a processor can perform its functions in real time offline in a batch mode etc. Portions of processing can be performed at different times and at different locations by different or the same processing systems. A computer may be any processor in communication with a memory. The memory may be any suitable processor readable storage medium such as random access memory RAM read only memory ROM magnetic or optical disk or other tangible media suitable for storing instructions for execution by the processor.
