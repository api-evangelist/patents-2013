This invention was made with Government support under grant number DE AR0000158 awarded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy ARPA E . The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to magnets and more particularly to nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase and methods of making the same.

Magnetic nanoparticles have drawn attention as essential materials for achieving a variety of next generation nanotechnology devices such as high density magnetic recording media nanoscale electronics radio frequency electromagnetic wave shields nanocomposite permanent magnets or transformer core. In the biomedical field the magnetic nanoparticle has potential applications as novel catalysts biomolecule labeling agents or used as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging MRI . The magnetic nanoparticle further used for hyperthermia immunological test systems drug targeting or gene delivery. A nanocomposite permanent magnet comprising a hard magnetic phase nanoparticles and soft magnetic phase nanoparticles may have immense significance to enhance intrinsic coercivity of the permanent magnets which may demonstrate enhanced performance at high temperatures. Magnetically soft materials with low anisotropy are advantageous in the development of read heads and in magnetic shielding applications. A steady supply of magnetic nanoparticles comprising soft magnetic phases with desirable size and magnetic properties is necessary for various applications.

Methods have been developed with primary focus to prepare nanoparticles of desired size by controlling the particle growth however the exact details of the magnetic properties of the resulting particles are unknown. Soft magnetic nanoparticles with a high magnetic saturation are primary requirement for making a nanocomposite magnet. Thus the ability to obtain soft magnetic nanoparticles with magnetic properties approaching maximum magnetic saturation in the bulk is a desirable quality. Unlike previously reported processes on the synthesis of soft magnetic nanoparticles using iron II compounds and with zero valent iron precursors a process for producing small nanoparticles such as 5 nm to 20 nm with magnetic saturation values approaching maximum is a long felt need.

A secondary requirement for a nanocomposite magnet is to minimize the non magnetic material in the protective shell of the soft magnetic nanoparticle to allow optimal coupling between the soft magnetic phase and hard magnetic phase. Methods that have been established using long chain surfactants for stabilization of small particles exhibit lower magnetic saturation emu g due to ligand effects. Various attempts of heat treatment have resulted in uncontrolled growth of the nanoparticles.

Therefore the development of a method for synthesizing uniform nanoparticles comprising soft magnetic phases comprised of a metal or an alloy having desired particle diameter particle size distribution improved crystallinity phase structure or phase purity is desired. Moreover an economically feasible method for making magnetic nanoparticles with improved magnetic properties compared to commercially available or conventionally made magnetic nanoparticles may provide a solution for the current requirement.

One or more embodiments of a method are provided wherein the method comprises degassing a first mixture at a temperature in a range from about 80 C. to 130 C. The first mixture comprises a solvent a compound comprising iron cobalt or combinations thereof dissolved in the solvent and an organic component comprising a fatty acid or an amine. The degassing is followed by adding a capping ligand to the first mixture under inert atmosphere to form a second mixture adding a reducing agent to the second mixture at a temperature in a processing temperature range from about 250 C. to about 350 C. to form a third mixture and incubating the third mixture at a temperature within the processing temperature range to form nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase.

In another embodiment a method comprises degassing a first mixture at a temperature of about 100 C. wherein the mixture comprises diphenyl ether as a solvent an iron bromide dissolved in diphenyl ether and an organic component comprising a fatty acid or an amine having 10 to 20 carbon atoms adding trioctylphosphine under inert atmosphere of argon to form a second mixture adding lithium triethylborohydride to the second mixture at a temperature in a processing temperature range from about 250 C. to about 350 C. forming a third mixture incubating the third mixture at a temperature within the processing temperature range for at least about 3 hours to form nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase with dimension of less than 50 nm purifying the nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase by precipitation using a non aqueous polar protic solvent and heating the nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase at about 500 C. under inert atmosphere.

Typically magnetic nanoparticles used for various applications are commercially available however magnetic properties of the nanoparticles may be improved while synthesizing by a method of the present invention. The desired magnetic property may include better crystallinity phase structure or phase purity which typically enhance the magnetic performance. The present invention provides a methodology to generate nanoparticles comprising soft magnetic phase with minimal coatings and maximized crystallinity using a reduction at elevated temperatures. The method is an inexpensive and efficient process for preparing high quality magnetic nanoparticles with monodisperse magnetic elemental and alloy nanoparticles.

Embodiments of a method are provided herein the method comprises degassing a first mixture at a temperature in a range from about 80 C. to 130 C. wherein the first mixture comprising a solvent a compound comprising iron cobalt or combinations thereof dissolved in the solvent and an organic component comprising a fatty acid or an amine and adding a capping ligand to the first mixture under inert atmosphere to form a second mixture adding a reducing agent to the second mixture at a temperature in a processing temperature range from about 250 C. to about 350 C. to form a third mixture and incubating the third mixture at a temperature within the processing temperature range to form nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase. The soft magnetic phase may have relatively high magnetization. The terms nanoparticles comprising soft magnetic phase and soft magnetic phase nanoparticles are interchangeably used herein after.

In one or more embodiments the method further comprises purifying the soft magnetic phase nanoparticles by precipitation using a solvent. In some embodiments the precipitation is effected by using an anti solvent. The term anti solvent used herein refers to a solvent in which the product is insoluble and addition of the anti solvent drastically reduces the solubility of the desired product. In some embodiments the solvent is a non aqueous polar protic solvent for example methanol or ethanol. In an exemplary embodiment the synthesized nanoparticles are transferred to a glovebox with an inert atmosphere for further downstream procedures. The nanoparticles inside the glovebox are precipitated by adding a polar protic solvent such as ethanol 5 1 into the reaction mixture. The precipitated nanoparticles are separated using a permanent magnet. The nanoparticles are re suspended in hexanes and further precipitated using ethanol. In some embodiments the process is repeated for one or more time. The nanoparticles are dried under vacuum using a vacuum pump connected to the glovebox. The dry powder of nanoparticle is used for all further steps.

In some embodiments the method further comprises heating the dry powdered form of the soft magnetic phase nanoparticles at about 500 C. under inert atmosphere to form a soft magnetic phase nanoparticles with saturation magnetization of at least about 200 emu g. The heat treatment of the soft magnetic phase nanoparticles results in magnetic nanoparticles with improved phase structure possessing superior saturation magnetization value without increasing the size.

As noted the method comprises degassing a first mixture comprising a solvent a compound comprising iron cobalt or combinations thereof dissolved in the solvent and an organic component comprising a fatty acid or an amine. In one or more embodiments the first mixture is degassed at a temperature in a range of 80 C. to 130 C. In some other embodiments the degassing of the first mixture is effected at a temperature in a range from about 100 C. to 130 C. In one embodiment the degassing of the first mixture is effected at a temperature of about 100 C. A temperature greater than 130 C. may cause removal of the solvents and surfactants from the mixture and hinders the synthetic process. A temperature below 80 C. may not be sufficient for complete degassing of the mixture. In some embodiments the degassing of the mixture is optimized at about 100 C. in some other embodiments the first mixture is degassed at about 130 C. The step of degassing may be performed in a vacuum environment an environment with reduced pressure or in the presence of an inert gas. Degassing may aid in removal of at least a portion of a surfactant and or undesirable gases such as oxygen.

In one or more embodiments the compound comprises halides of iron cobalt or combinations thereof. In some embodiments the halides comprise iron bromide cobalt bromide or combinations thereof. In one embodiment the halides comprise iron II bromide cobalt II bromide Nickel II bromide Platinum II bromide or combinations thereof. In one or more embodiments the soft magnetic phase nanoparticles further comprise iron nickel iron platinum cobalt platinum or combinations thereof. In one or more embodiments the invention produces intermetallics e.g. CoPt FePt binary alloys e.g. Co Ni CoFe and Fe Ni and ternary alloys e.g. Co Fe Ni .

As noted the compounds such as halides are dissolved in a solvent. In some embodiments the solvent has a boiling point more than 250 C. In one or more embodiments the solvent comprises diphenyl ether di decyl ether di octyl ether di dodecylether octadecene or combinations thereof. The phenylether or n octylether may be used as the solvent due to their low cost and high boiling point. In one example an amount of the solvent may be in a range from about 55 by weight to about 300 by weight of the weight of the precursor material. The remaining solvent after formation of the product may be removed by precipitation purification technique. Solvent free dried magnetic nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase is desirable for downstream applications.

Typically the method employed a surfactant comprises an organic stabilizer which is a long chain organic component. The surfactant may be added to the mixture of the precursor material and solvent. In one embodiment it may be desirable to use surfactants that do not contain oxygen. For example during processing of the precursor material the oxygen containing surfactants may result in undesirable oxidation of the resultant nanoparticles. Non limiting examples of the surfactant may include fatty acids or fatty amines having medium to long carbon chains. In one or more embodiments of the method the organic components used for synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles comprise a fatty acid or an amine comprising 8 to 26 carbon atoms. In some embodiments the organic components used for synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles comprise a fatty acid or an amine comprising 10 to 20 carbon atoms. In one or more embodiments the functional groups such as acid or amine of the organic component may provide a chemical attachment to the nanoparticle surface. In one example the surfactant may include a long hydrocarbon chain for acid or amine. In another example the amine may have two hydrocarbon chains such as in dioctylamine or didodecylamine. In one embodiment an amount of surfactant used may be in a range from about 5 by weight to about 50 by weight of the total weight of the precursor material.

The organic component may comprise carboxylic acid primary amine secondary amine or tertiary amine. The organic component may comprise long chain fatty acids wherein the examples of fatty acids may include myristic acid dodecanoic acid oleic acid erucic acid caprylic acid linoleic acid other long chain fattyacids or combinations thereof. In other embodiments amine may comprise oleyl amine decylamine tetradecylamine stearyl amine tallow amine or other long chain amine surfactants. In one example a combination of phosphines and organic components may provide controlled particle growth and stabilization. For example to achieve optimum growth of the magnetic nanoparticles oleic acid is employed in combination with phosphine. In one embodiment the organic component comprises oleic acid which may act as a stabilizer. In some embodiments the oleic acid is used to protect iron nanoparticles. The oleic acid has an 18 carbon chain which is about 20 angstroms long with one double bond. A significant steric barrier is provided by the relatively long chain of oleic acid which counteracts with the strong magnetic interaction between the particles. In some embodiments other long chain carboxylic acids like erucic acid or linoleic acid may be added to oleic acid.

In one or more embodiments the method employs capping ligands wherein the capping ligand is added to the first mixture . The capping ligands typically attach to the surface of the nanoparticles either by chemical or physical attachment. The function of the capping ligands is to control the size of the nanoparticles during nanoparticle synthesis and induce stability to suspend nanoparticles in a suitable solvent. In some embodiments the capping ligand used for the present method comprises trialkylphosphine triarylphosphine or combinations thereof. In some embodiments the iron or cobalt particles are stabilized by a combination of oleic acid and trialkylphosphine. A plurality of different phosphines may be used as capping ligands such as symmetric tertiary phosphines e.g. tributyl trioctyl triphenyl etc. asymmetric phosphines e.g. dimethyl octyl phosphine or combinations thereof. In one embodiment trialkylphosphine is selected as one capping ligand because it is a well known ligand to stabilize zero valent metal due to a donating and back bonding characteristics. In one embodiment the capping ligand is trioctylphosphine or TOP. The addition of capping ligand to the first mixture forms a second mixture.

As noted the reducing agent is added to the second mixture to form a third mixture. In one or more embodiments the reducing agent comprises a hydride source. In some embodiments the reducing agent comprises metal hydride. In some embodiments the metal hydride comprises lithium hydride sodium hydride rubidium hydride cesium hydride lithium aluminum hydride sodium aluminum hydride or combinations thereof. In one embodiment the reducing agent is lithium triethylborohydride which is commercially known as superhydride.

The third mixture is incubated at a processing temperature range to form desired nanoparticles. The reaction may be executed at a temperature as referred to herein as a processing temperature . The processing temperature range may be selected depending on the requirement of the process efficiency or required property of the nanoparticles such as Mas sown in Table 1. The processing temperature range of the reaction mixture may attain after adding the capping ligand to the first mixture and may be maintained till end of the reaction that is the formation of the nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase . In some embodiments the capping ligand is added to the mixture under inert atmosphere to form a second mixture followed by heating the second mixture to a temperature in a processing temperature range from about 250 C. to about 350 C. The particle growth is hampered at a lower or a higher temperature beyond the range of 250 C. to about 350 C. In some embodiments the temperature of the reaction for generating soft phase magnetic nanoparticles is optimized to be in a range of 270 C. to 300 C. In one exemplary embodiment the reaction temperature is optimized to be about 290 C. The optimization of the processing temperature is demonstrated in Table 1 with further details. In some embodiments the processing temperature may be same or different than the degassing temperature. In one embodiment the processing temperature of the reaction is different than the degassing temperature.

As noted the third mixture is incubated to form nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase. In one or more embodiments the third mixture is incubated at a temperature within the processing temperature range for at least about 2 to 10 hours to form nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase. In some embodiments the mixture is incubated at a temperature within the processing temperature range for at least about 3 hours to form desired nanoparticles comprising a soft magnetic phase. Heat treatment for a long time increases the crystallinity thereby improving the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles. However heating for a prolonged period may lead to oversized particle growth and agglomerations. For the synthesis of Fe Co or FeCo nanoparticles 3 hours incubation may be an ideal condition balancing both the processes.

The entire synthesis process is subjected under inert atmosphere except degassing. As used herein inert atmosphere refers to a condition where the reaction is covered in a blanket of inert gases such as nitrogen or argon. The inert atmosphere prevents the interference of atmospheric oxygen humidity or both with the reaction. Exposure to oxygen or humidity results in oxidation of the nanoparticles which may lead to impure phases in the product resulting in poor magnetic behavior. In one or more embodiments the method synthesizes magnetic nanoparticles under an inert atmosphere. In some embodiments the inert atmosphere comprises a noble gas such as nitrogen argon or combinations thereof. In one or more embodiments the magnetic nanoparticles synthesize under nitrogen atmosphere.

Non limiting examples of the shape of the soft magnetic phase nanoparticles may include spherical aspherical elongated cube hexagonal or combinations thereof.

The saturation magnetization value of soft magnetic phase nanoparticles may vary depending on various factors such as heat treatment during synthesis or use of different chemical reagents. In one embodiment an XRD analysis of the nanoparticles comprising iron indicates pure body centered cubic bcc iron structure as shown in with Mvalue of 210 emu g. The term body centered cubic bcc refers to the specific internal crystal structure of the particles which may determine the anisotropy of the magnetic properties.
